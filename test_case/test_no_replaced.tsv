This study aims to synthesize available data on EBIs for SCD and assess IROs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs reporting on EBIs for SCD management implemented in LMICs. We identified articles from PubMed/Medline, Global Health, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science medical subject heading (MeSH and Emtree) and keywords, published from inception through February 23, 2020, and conducted an updated search through December 24, 2020. We provide intervention characteristics for each study, EBI impact on SCD, and evidence of reporting on IROs. MAIN RESULTS: 29 RCTs were analyzed. EBIs identified included disease modifying agents, supportive care agents/analgesics, anti-malarials, systemic treatments, patient/ provider education, and nutritional supplements. Studies using disease modifying agents, nutritional supplements, and anti-malarials reported improvements in pain crisis, hospitalization, children's growth and reduction in severity and prevalence of malaria. Two studies reported on the sustainability of supplementary arginine, citrulline, and daily chloroquine and hydroxyurea for SCD patients. Only 13 studies (44.8%) provided descriptions that captured at least three of the eight IROs. There was limited reporting of acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, cost and sustainability. CONCLUSION: EBIs are effective for SCD management in LMICs; however, measurement of IROs is scarce. Future research should focus on penetration of EBIs to inform evidence-based practice and sustainability in the context of LMICs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review is registered in PROSPERO #CRD42020167289.
35140852		Association and Risk Factors of Osteonecrosis of Femoral Head in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the level of evidence about the associated factors and the risk factors of osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH) in sickle cell individuals. METHODS: The review was based on the search and selection of studies available in the electronic databases PubMed, SCIELO, LILACS, BVS. As descriptors, the terms of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) corresponding to "Osteonecrosis", "Necrosis avascular" and "Aseptic necrosis" and "Femoral head" and "sickle cell disease" and "risk factor" and "predictor". RESULTS: Among clinical and laboratorial factors the most promising risk factors were the severity of sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome. As a result, from studies of a moderate level of quality, blood pressure, body weight, previous trauma, haemoglobin to haematocrit ratio (Hb/HCT), and number of hospitalizations can be highlighted. Others, such as genetic markers and male gender, have also been positively associated in lower quality studies. CONCLUSION: For a better clarification of what the risk factors are for the ONFH, it is necessary to study with populations of different origins, different ages, different profiles of Hb, which present greater methodological rigor and perform a multivariate analysis to control confounding factors. Further study is also needed to understand the genetic determinants of ONFH.

This indicates that circulating erythrocytes are vulnerable to the oxidative injury occurring under the imbalance of redox homeostasis. In this review article, two topics are presented concerning the human erythrocytes exposed to the oxidative inflammation including septic and sterile conditions. First, we demonstrate rheological derangement of erythrocytes subjected to acute oxidative injury caused by exogenous generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Erythrocyte filterability as whole-cell deformability has been estimated by the gravity-based nickel mesh filtration technique in our laboratory and was dramatically impaired in a time-dependent manner after starting exposure to the ROS generators, that is associated with concurrent progression of membrane protein degradation, phospholipid peroxidation, erythrocyte swelling, methemoglobin formation, and oxidative hemolysis. Second, we introduce an impairment of erythrocyte filterability confirmed quantitatively in diabetes mellitus and hypertension of animal models and patients under treatment. Among the cell geometry, internal viscosity, and membrane property as the three major determinants of erythrocyte deformability, erythrocyte membrane alteration is supposed to be the primary cause of this impairment in these lifestyle-related diseases associated with persistent oxidative inflammation. Excessive ROS trigger the inflammatory responses and reduce the erythrocyte membrane fluidity. Oxidative inflammation increasing erythrocyte membrane rigidity underlies the impaired systemic microcirculation, which is observed in diabetic and/or hypertensive patients. On the other hand, elevated internal viscosity caused by sickle hemoglobin polymerization is a primary cause of impaired erythrocyte filterability in sickle cell disease (SCD). However, oxidative inflammation is also involved in the pathophysiology of SCD. The physiologic level of ROS acts as signaling molecules for adaptation to oxidative environment, but the pathological level of ROS induces suicidal erythrocyte death (eryptosis). These findings provide further insight into the ROS-related pathophysiology of many clinical conditions.
7771550	associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@CHEMICAL_Polymers	Contributions of sickle hemoglobin polymer and sickle cell membranes to impaired filterability.Sickle cell anemia is a disease of abnormal rheology caused by acute and reversible, as well as chronic and irreversible, changes in the properties and deformability of sickle erythrocytes. Deformability is determined by several factors, including intracellular sickle hemoglobin polymerization, the abnormal membrane properties of sickle cells, and the abnormal rheological properties of the soluble concentrated hemoglobin solution within dense sickle red blood cells. In this study, we used a 5-microns pore nickel mesh filter to evaluate quantitatively the effects of these factors on the filterability of erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin. We used sickle trait and sickle/beta(+)-thalassemia cells, because they have minimal membrane abnormalities or density heterogeneity, to investigate the effects of polymer formation on rheological properties. We found that filterability of these cells is sensitive to small amounts of intracellular polymer and that impaired filtration is linearly related to oxygen-dependent polymer formation, up to a polymer fraction of 0.3. By increasing the proportion of dense cells in populations of normal cells or cells from individuals with sickle syndromes and equilibrating these cells with gas ligands, we estimate that polymerization, even at 95% saturation, contributes twice as much to impaired filterability of sickle erythrocytes as the abnormal membranes in homozygous sickle cell disease. At lower saturation values, the effects of polymer are even greater. The viscosity of the concentrated hemoglobin in dense cells had the smallest effect, over physiologically relevant saturation values. These results emphasize the importance of sickle hemoglobin polymerization in the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease and should help define its pathophysiology and responses to therapy in quantitative terms.
34966850		Bochdalek Hernia and Partial Diaphragmatic Agenesis: Pedicled Intercostal Muscle Flap and Mesh Repair in a Young Adult with Sickle Cell Disease.Congenital Bochdalek hernia (BH) in an adult is rare and has an unusual presentation. They are confined to the pediatric age group with an incidence of 1:3,000 live births. It rarely persists asymptomatic until adulthood. Surgical repair by thoracic, abdominal, or thoraco-abdominal approach is the treatment of choice with diaphragmatic reconstruction in associated diaphragmatic agenesis. With only 10 cases of BH with partial diaphragmatic agenesis reported to date, we discuss the rarity, unusual presentation, and management of BH in a young adult with sickle cell disease that has not been reported in the literature.
