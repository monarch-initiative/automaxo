input_text: 'Association and Risk Factors of diseaseD000070603 in MONDO:0011382: A
  Systematic Review.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the level of evidence
  about the associated factors and the risk factors of diseaseD000070603 (diseaseD000070603)
  in MONDO:0011382 individuals. METHODS: The review was based on the search and selection
  of studies available in the electronic databases PubMed, SCIELO, LILACS, BVS. As
  descriptors, the terms of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Health Sciences Descriptors
  (DeCS) corresponding to "MONDO:0005380", "MONDO:0005380" and "MONDO:0005380" and
  "diseaseD000070603" and "MONDO:0011382" and "risk factor" and "predictor". RESULTS:
  Among clinical and laboratorial factors the most promising risk factors were the
  severity of MONDO:0011382 and MONDO:0020683 MONDO:0005632. As a result, from studies
  of a moderate level of quality, blood pressure, body weight, previous MONDO:0021178,
  haemoglobin to haematocrit ratio (Hb/HCT), and number of hospitalizations can be
  highlighted. Others, such as genetic markers and male gender, have also been positively
  associated in lower quality studies. CONCLUSION: For a better clarification of what
  the risk factors are for the diseaseD000070603, it is necessary to study with populations
  of different origins, different ages, different profiles of Hb, which present greater
  methodological rigor and perform a multivariate analysis to control confounding
  factors. Further study is also needed to understand the genetic determinants of
  diseaseD000070603.'
