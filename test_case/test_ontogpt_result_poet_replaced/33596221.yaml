input_text: "Evidence-based interventions implemented in low-and middle-income countries
  for MONDO:0011382 management: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.BACKGROUND:
  Despite ~90% of MONDO:0011382 (MONDO:0011382) occurring in low-and middle-income
  countries (LMICs), the vast majority of people are not receiving evidence-based
  interventions (EBIs) to reduce MONDO:0011382-related adverse outcomes and mortality,
  and data on implementation research outcomes (IROs) and MONDO:0011382 is limited.
  This study aims to synthesize available data on EBIs for MONDO:0011382 and assess
  IROs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs reporting on EBIs for MONDO:0011382
  management implemented in LMICs. We identified articles from PubMed/Medline, Global
  Health, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science medical subject heading (MeSH and
  Emtree) and keywords, published from inception through February 23, 2020, and conducted
  an updated search through December 24, 2020. We provide intervention characteristics
  for each study, EBI impact on MONDO:0011382, and evidence of reporting on IROs.
  MAIN RESULTS: 29 RCTs were analyzed. EBIs identified included disease modifying
  agents, supportive care agents/analgesics, anti-malarials, systemic treatments,
  9606/ provider education, and nutritional supplements. Studies using disease modifying
  agents, nutritional supplements, and anti-malarials reported improvements in HP:0012531
  crisis, hospitalization, children's growth and reduction in severity and prevalence
  of MONDO:0005136. Two studies reported on the sustainability of supplementary chemicalD001120,
  chemicalD002956, and daily chemicalD002738 and chemicalD006918 for MONDO:0011382
  9606. Only 13 studies (44.8%) provided descriptions that captured at least three
  of the eight IROs. There was limited reporting of acceptability, feasibility, fidelity,
  cost and sustainability. CONCLUSION: EBIs are effective for MONDO:0011382 management
  in LMICs; however, measurement of IROs is scarce. Future research should focus on
  penetration of EBIs to inform evidence-based practice and sustainability in the
  context of LMICs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review is registered in PROSPERO
  #CRD42020167289."
