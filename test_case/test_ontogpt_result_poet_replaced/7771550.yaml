input_text: Contributions of sickle hemoglobin chemicalD011108 and MONDO:0011382 cell
  membranes to impaired filterability.MONDO:0011382 is a disease of abnormal rheology
  caused by acute and reversible, as well as chronic and irreversible, changes in
  the properties and deformability of MONDO:0011382 erythrocytes. Deformability is
  determined by several factors, including intracellular sickle hemoglobin polymerization,
  the abnormal membrane properties of MONDO:0011382 cells, and the abnormal rheological
  properties of the soluble concentrated hemoglobin solution within dense MONDO:0011382
  red blood cells. In this study, we used a 5-microns pore chemicalD009532 mesh filter
  to evaluate quantitatively the effects of these factors on the filterability of
  erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin. We used MONDO:0011382 trait and MONDO:0011382/MONDO:0019402
  cells, because they have minimal MONDO:0005376 or density heterogeneity, to investigate
  the effects of chemicalD011108 formation on rheological properties. We found that
  filterability of these cells is sensitive to small amounts of intracellular chemicalD011108
  and that impaired filtration is linearly related to chemicalD010100-dependent chemicalD011108
  formation, up to a chemicalD011108 fraction of 0.3. By increasing the proportion
  of dense cells in populations of normal cells or cells from individuals with MONDO:0011382
  and equilibrating these cells with gas ligands, we estimate that polymerization,
  even at 95% saturation, contributes twice as much to impaired filterability of MONDO:0011382
  erythrocytes as the abnormal membranes in homozygous MONDO:0011382. At lower saturation
  values, the effects of chemicalD011108 are even greater. The viscosity of the concentrated
  hemoglobin in dense cells had the smallest effect, over physiologically relevant
  saturation values. These results emphasize the importance of sickle hemoglobin polymerization
  in the pathogenesis of MONDO:0011382 and should help define its pathophysiology
  and responses to therapy in quantitative terms.
