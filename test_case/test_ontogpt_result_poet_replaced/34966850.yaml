  and Mesh Repair in a Young Adult with MONDO:0011382.Congenital HP:0000776 (HP:0000776)
  in an adult is rare and has an unusual presentation. They are confined to the pediatric
  age group with an incidence of 1:3,000 live births. It rarely persists asymptomatic
  until adulthood. Surgical repair by thoracic, abdominal, or thoraco-abdominal approach
  is the treatment of choice with diaphragmatic reconstruction in associated diseaseC537768.
  With only 10 cases of HP:0000776 with partial diseaseC537768 reported to date, we
  discuss the rarity, unusual presentation, and management of HP:0000776 in a young
  adult with MONDO:0011382 that has not been reported in the literature.'
