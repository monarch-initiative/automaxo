input_text: MONDO:0016677 in 9606 Erythrocytes Subjected to Oxidative diseaseD007249.Erythrocytes
  are chemicalD010100 carriers and exposed to redox cycle in oxygenation and deoxygenation
  of hemoglobin. This indicates that circulating erythrocytes are vulnerable to the
  oxidative injury occurring under the imbalance of redox homeostasis. In this review
  article, two topics are presented concerning the 9606 erythrocytes exposed to the
  oxidative diseaseD007249 including septic and sterile conditions. First, we demonstrate
  rheological derangement of erythrocytes subjected to acute oxidative injury caused
  by exogenous generators of chemicalD017382 (chemicalD017382). Erythrocyte filterability
  as whole-cell deformability has been estimated by the gravity-based chemicalD009532
  mesh filtration technique in our laboratory and was dramatically impaired in a time-dependent
  manner after starting exposure to the chemicalD017382 generators, that is associated
  with concurrent progression of membrane protein degradation, chemicalD010743 peroxidation,
  erythrocyte swelling, ncbi3048 formation, and oxidative diseaseD006461. Second,
  we introduce an impairment of erythrocyte filterability confirmed quantitatively
  in MONDO:0005015 and MONDO:0005044 of animal models and 9606 under treatment. Among
  the cell geometry, internal viscosity, and membrane property as the three major
  determinants of erythrocyte deformability, erythrocyte membrane alteration is supposed
  to be the primary cause of this impairment in these lifestyle-related diseases associated
  with persistent oxidative diseaseD007249. Excessive chemicalD017382 trigger the
  diseaseD007249 responses and reduce the erythrocyte membrane fluidity. Oxidative
  diseaseD007249 increasing erythrocyte membrane rigidity underlies the impaired systemic
  microcirculation, which is observed in MONDO:0005015/or MONDO:0005044 9606. On the
  other hand, elevated internal viscosity caused by sickle hemoglobin polymerization
  is a primary cause of impaired erythrocyte filterability in MONDO:0011382 (MONDO:0011382).
  However, oxidative diseaseD007249 is also involved in the pathophysiology of MONDO:0011382.
  The physiologic level of chemicalD017382 acts as signaling molecules for adaptation
  to oxidative environment, but the pathological level of chemicalD017382 induces
  suicidal erythrocyte death (eryptosis). These findings provide further insight into
  the chemicalD017382-related pathophysiology of many clinical conditions.
