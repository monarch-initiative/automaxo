This study aims to synthesize available data on EBIs for diseaseD000755 and assess IROs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs reporting on EBIs for diseaseD000755 management implemented in LMICs. We identified articles from PubMed/Medline, Global Health, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science medical subject heading (MeSH and Emtree) and keywords, published from inception through February 23, 2020, and conducted an updated search through December 24, 2020. We provide intervention characteristics for each study, EBI impact on diseaseD000755, and evidence of reporting on IROs. MAIN RESULTS: 29 RCTs were analyzed. EBIs identified included disease modifying agents, supportive care agents/analgesics, anti-malarials, systemic treatments, 9606/ provider education, and nutritional supplements. Studies using disease modifying agents, nutritional supplements, and anti-malarials reported improvements in diseaseD010146 crisis, hospitalization, children's growth and reduction in severity and prevalence of diseaseD008288. Two studies reported on the sustainability of supplementary chemicalD001120, chemicalD002956, and daily chemicalD002738 and chemicalD006918 for diseaseD000755 9606. Only 13 studies (44.8%) provided descriptions that captured at least three of the eight IROs. There was limited reporting of acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, cost and sustainability. CONCLUSION: EBIs are effective for diseaseD000755 management in LMICs; however, measurement of IROs is scarce. Future research should focus on penetration of EBIs to inform evidence-based practice and sustainability in the context of LMICs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review is registered in PROSPERO #CRD42020167289.
35140852		Association and Risk Factors of diseaseD000070603 in diseaseD000755: A Systematic Review.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the level of evidence about the associated factors and the risk factors of diseaseD000070603 (diseaseD000070603) in diseaseD000755 individuals. METHODS: The review was based on the search and selection of studies available in the electronic databases PubMed, SCIELO, LILACS, BVS. As descriptors, the terms of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) corresponding to "diseaseD010020", "diseaseD010020" and "diseaseD010020" and "diseaseD000070603" and "diseaseD000755" and "risk factor" and "predictor". RESULTS: Among clinical and laboratorial factors the most promising risk factors were the severity of diseaseD000755 and diseaseD000208 diseaseD056586. As a result, from studies of a moderate level of quality, blood pressure, body weight, previous diseaseD014947, haemoglobin to haematocrit ratio (Hb/HCT), and number of hospitalizations can be highlighted. Others, such as genetic markers and male gender, have also been positively associated in lower quality studies. CONCLUSION: For a better clarification of what the risk factors are for the diseaseD000070603, it is necessary to study with populations of different origins, different ages, different profiles of Hb, which present greater methodological rigor and perform a multivariate analysis to control confounding factors. Further study is also needed to understand the genetic determinants of diseaseD000070603.

This indicates that circulating erythrocytes are vulnerable to the oxidative injury occurring under the imbalance of redox homeostasis. In this review article, two topics are presented concerning the 9606 erythrocytes exposed to the oxidative diseaseD007249 including septic and sterile conditions. First, we demonstrate rheological derangement of erythrocytes subjected to acute oxidative injury caused by exogenous generators of chemicalD017382 (chemicalD017382). Erythrocyte filterability as whole-cell deformability has been estimated by the gravity-based chemicalD009532 mesh filtration technique in our laboratory and was dramatically impaired in a time-dependent manner after starting exposure to the chemicalD017382 generators, that is associated with concurrent progression of membrane protein degradation, chemicalD010743 peroxidation, erythrocyte swelling, ncbi3048 formation, and oxidative diseaseD006461. Second, we introduce an impairment of erythrocyte filterability confirmed quantitatively in diseaseD003920 and diseaseD006973 of animal models and 9606 under treatment. Among the cell geometry, internal viscosity, and membrane property as the three major determinants of erythrocyte deformability, erythrocyte membrane alteration is supposed to be the primary cause of this impairment in these lifestyle-related diseases associated with persistent oxidative diseaseD007249. Excessive chemicalD017382 trigger the diseaseD007249 responses and reduce the erythrocyte membrane fluidity. Oxidative diseaseD007249 increasing erythrocyte membrane rigidity underlies the impaired systemic microcirculation, which is observed in diseaseD003920/or diseaseD006973 9606. On the other hand, elevated internal viscosity caused by sickle hemoglobin polymerization is a primary cause of impaired erythrocyte filterability in diseaseD000755 (diseaseD000755). However, oxidative diseaseD007249 is also involved in the pathophysiology of diseaseD000755. The physiologic level of chemicalD017382 acts as signaling molecules for adaptation to oxidative environment, but the pathological level of chemicalD017382 induces suicidal erythrocyte death (eryptosis). These findings provide further insight into the chemicalD017382-related pathophysiology of many clinical conditions.
7771550	Association|chemicalD010100|chemicalD011108	Contributions of sickle hemoglobin chemicalD011108 and diseaseD000755 cell membranes to impaired filterability.diseaseD000755 is a disease of abnormal rheology caused by acute and reversible, as well as chronic and irreversible, changes in the properties and deformability of diseaseD000755 erythrocytes. Deformability is determined by several factors, including intracellular sickle hemoglobin polymerization, the abnormal membrane properties of diseaseD000755 cells, and the abnormal rheological properties of the soluble concentrated hemoglobin solution within dense diseaseD000755 red blood cells. In this study, we used a 5-microns pore chemicalD009532 mesh filter to evaluate quantitatively the effects of these factors on the filterability of erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin. We used diseaseD000755 trait and diseaseD000755/diseaseD017086 cells, because they have minimal diseaseD015433 or density heterogeneity, to investigate the effects of chemicalD011108 formation on rheological properties. We found that filterability of these cells is sensitive to small amounts of intracellular chemicalD011108 and that impaired filtration is linearly related to chemicalD010100-dependent chemicalD011108 formation, up to a chemicalD011108 fraction of 0.3. By increasing the proportion of dense cells in populations of normal cells or cells from individuals with diseaseD000755 and equilibrating these cells with gas ligands, we estimate that polymerization, even at 95% saturation, contributes twice as much to impaired filterability of diseaseD000755 erythrocytes as the abnormal membranes in homozygous diseaseD000755. At lower saturation values, the effects of chemicalD011108 are even greater. The viscosity of the concentrated hemoglobin in dense cells had the smallest effect, over physiologically relevant saturation values. These results emphasize the importance of sickle hemoglobin polymerization in the pathogenesis of diseaseD000755 and should help define its pathophysiology and responses to therapy in quantitative terms.
34966850		diseaseD065630 and Partial diseaseC537768: Pedicled Intercostal Muscle Flap and Mesh Repair in a Young Adult with diseaseD000755.Congenital diseaseD065630 (diseaseD065630) in an adult is rare and has an unusual presentation. They are confined to the pediatric age group with an incidence of 1:3,000 live births. It rarely persists asymptomatic until adulthood. Surgical repair by thoracic, abdominal, or thoraco-abdominal approach is the treatment of choice with diaphragmatic reconstruction in associated diseaseC537768. With only 10 cases of diseaseD065630 with partial diseaseC537768 reported to date, we discuss the rarity, unusual presentation, and management of diseaseD065630 in a young adult with diseaseD000755 that has not been reported in the literature.
