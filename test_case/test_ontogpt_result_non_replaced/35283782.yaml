input_text: Rheological Abnormalities in Human Erythrocytes Subjected to Oxidative
  Inflammation.Erythrocytes are oxygen carriers and exposed to redox cycle in oxygenation
  and deoxygenation of hemoglobin. This indicates that circulating erythrocytes are
  vulnerable to the oxidative injury occurring under the imbalance of redox homeostasis.
  In this review article, two topics are presented concerning the human erythrocytes
  exposed to the oxidative inflammation including septic and sterile conditions. First,
  we demonstrate rheological derangement of erythrocytes subjected to acute oxidative
  injury caused by exogenous generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Erythrocyte
  filterability as whole-cell deformability has been estimated by the gravity-based
  nickel mesh filtration technique in our laboratory and was dramatically impaired
  in a time-dependent manner after starting exposure to the ROS generators, that is
  associated with concurrent progression of membrane protein degradation, phospholipid
  peroxidation, erythrocyte swelling, methemoglobin formation, and oxidative hemolysis.
  Second, we introduce an impairment of erythrocyte filterability confirmed quantitatively
  in diabetes mellitus and hypertension of animal models and patients under treatment.
  Among the cell geometry, internal viscosity, and membrane property as the three
  major determinants of erythrocyte deformability, erythrocyte membrane alteration
  is supposed to be the primary cause of this impairment in these lifestyle-related
  diseases associated with persistent oxidative inflammation. Excessive ROS trigger
  the inflammatory responses and reduce the erythrocyte membrane fluidity. Oxidative
  inflammation increasing erythrocyte membrane rigidity underlies the impaired systemic
  microcirculation, which is observed in diabetic and/or hypertensive patients. On
  the other hand, elevated internal viscosity caused by sickle hemoglobin polymerization
  is a primary cause of impaired erythrocyte filterability in sickle cell disease
  (SCD). However, oxidative inflammation is also involved in the pathophysiology of
  SCD. The physiologic level of ROS acts as signaling molecules for adaptation to
  oxidative environment, but the pathological level of ROS induces suicidal erythrocyte
  death (eryptosis). These findings provide further insight into the ROS-related pathophysiology
  of many clinical conditions.
