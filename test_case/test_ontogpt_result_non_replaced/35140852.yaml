input_text: 'Association and Risk Factors of Osteonecrosis of Femoral Head in Sickle
  Cell Disease: A Systematic Review.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the level
  of evidence about the associated factors and the risk factors of osteonecrosis of
  femoral head (ONFH) in sickle cell individuals. METHODS: The review was based on
  the search and selection of studies available in the electronic databases PubMed,
  SCIELO, LILACS, BVS. As descriptors, the terms of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
  and Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) corresponding to "Osteonecrosis", "Necrosis
  avascular" and "Aseptic necrosis" and "Femoral head" and "sickle cell disease" and
  "risk factor" and "predictor". RESULTS: Among clinical and laboratorial factors
  the most promising risk factors were the severity of sickle cell disease and acute
  chest syndrome. As a result, from studies of a moderate level of quality, blood
  pressure, body weight, previous trauma, haemoglobin to haematocrit ratio (Hb/HCT),
  and number of hospitalizations can be highlighted. Others, such as genetic markers
  and male gender, have also been positively associated in lower quality studies.
  CONCLUSION: For a better clarification of what the risk factors are for the ONFH,
  it is necessary to study with populations of different origins, different ages,
  different profiles of Hb, which present greater methodological rigor and perform
  a multivariate analysis to control confounding factors. Further study is also needed
  to understand the genetic determinants of ONFH.'
