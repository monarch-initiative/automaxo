input_text: 'Bochdalek Hernia and Partial Diaphragmatic Agenesis: Pedicled Intercostal
  Muscle Flap and Mesh Repair in a Young Adult with Sickle Cell Disease.Congenital
  Bochdalek hernia (BH) in an adult is rare and has an unusual presentation. They
  are confined to the pediatric age group with an incidence of 1:3,000 live births.
  It rarely persists asymptomatic until adulthood. Surgical repair by thoracic, abdominal,
  or thoraco-abdominal approach is the treatment of choice with diaphragmatic reconstruction
  in associated diaphragmatic agenesis. With only 10 cases of BH with partial diaphragmatic
  agenesis reported to date, we discuss the rarity, unusual presentation, and management
  of BH in a young adult with sickle cell disease that has not been reported in the
  literature.'
