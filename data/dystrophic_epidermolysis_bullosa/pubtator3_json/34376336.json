Research has focused on characterizing the unique properties of MSCs, which broadly revolve around their regenerative and more recently discovered immunomodulatory capacities. Because of ease of harvesting and expansion, differentiation potential and low immunogenicity, MSCs have been leading candidates for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications for wound healing, yet results from clinical studies have been variable, and promising pre-clinical work has been difficult to reproduce. Therefore, the specific mechanisms of how MSCs influence the local microenvironment in distinct wound etiologies warrant further research. Of specific interest in MSC-mediated healing is harnessing the secretome, which is composed of components known to positively influence wound healing. Molecules released by the MSC secretome can promote re-epithelialization and angiogenesis while inhibiting fibrosis and microbial invasion. This review focuses on the therapeutic interest in MSCs with regard to wound healing applications, including burns and diabetic ulcers, with specific attention to the genetic skin disease recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. This review also compares various delivery methods to support skin regeneration in the hopes of combating the poor engraftment of MSCs after delivery, which is one of the major pitfalls in clinical studies utilizing MSCs.",
