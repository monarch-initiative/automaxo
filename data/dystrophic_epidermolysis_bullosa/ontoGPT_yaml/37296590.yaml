input_text: Kinetics of Wound Development and Healing Suggests a Skin-Stabilizing
  Effect of Allogeneic ABCB5+ Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Treatment in Recessive Dystrophic
  Epidermolysis Bullosa. Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis (RDEB) is a rare, inherited,
  and currently incurable skin blistering disorder characterized by cyclically recurring
  wounds coexisting with chronic non-healing wounds. In a recent clinical trial, three
  intravenous infusions of skin-derived ABCB5+ mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to
  14 patients with RDEB improved the healing of wounds that were present at baseline.
  Since in RDEB even minor mechanical forces perpetually provoke the development of
  new or recurrent wounds, a post-hoc analysis of patient photographs was performed
  to specifically assess the effects of ABCB5+ MSCs on new or recurrent wounds by
  evaluating 174 wounds that occurred after baseline. During 12 weeks of systemic
  treatment with ABCB5+ MSCs, the number of newly occurring wounds declined. When
  compared to the previously reported healing responses of the wounds present at baseline,
  the newly occurring wounds healed faster, and a greater portion of healed wounds
  remained stably closed. These data suggest a previously undescribed skin-stabilizing
  effect of treatment with ABCB5+ MSCs and support repeated dosing of ABCB5+ MSCs
  in RDEB to continuously slow the wound development and accelerate the healing of
  new or recurrent wounds before they become infected or progress to a chronic, difficult-to-heal
  stage.
