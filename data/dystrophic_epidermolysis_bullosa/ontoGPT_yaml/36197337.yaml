input_text: "Validation and Repeatability of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Eye Disease
  Index in Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. PURPOSE: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
  (DEB) is a devastating condition that causes painful corneal abrasions and vision
  loss. Epidermolysis Bullosa Eye Disease Index (EB-EDI) for the first time captures
  and quantifies EB-specific assessment of ocular symptoms and activities of daily
  living scales. This survey will become critical in developing new interventions
  on patients' quality of life. METHODS: Three-part set of the EB-EDI baseline, EB-EDI
  interval, and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) survey was distributed to 92 patients
  with DEB who previously reported eye symptoms on previous surveys. It was then posted
  online through several EB patient organizations. We compared the EB-EDI with the
  gold standard OSDI and examined the repeatability of the EB-EDI over a 7- to 15-day
  interval. RESULTS: Of the 45 individuals who initially responded, 30 of 45 (67%)
  completed the surveys sent 7 to 15 days later. The age of participants ranged from
  6 to 51 years (mean 21 +- 15 years), and 60% (18 of 30) of participants were younger
  than 18 years. The overall Cronbach alpha values for the subscales of EB-EDI baseline
  and interval tools presented a good internal consistency (>=0.7). From 2 visits,
  the domain scores of EB-EDI baseline (0.94) and interval tools (0.83) were shown
  to have excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8).
  By comparison, OSDI had the intraclass correlation coefficient score of 0.72 +-
  0.11. The convergent validation analysis showed that correlations between the domain
  scores of EB-EDI baseline and interval tools and the subscales of the OSDI reached
  the hypothesized strength. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a 30-person repeated-measures study,
  we found that the EB-EDI has excellent reliability and validity specifically in
  patients with DEB."
