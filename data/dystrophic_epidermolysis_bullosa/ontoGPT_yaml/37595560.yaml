input_text: Herpes simplex virus gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
  (DEB). The FDA has recently approved Krystal biotech's beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC,
  Vyjuvek) to treat the wounds of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) patients.
  This represents a giant step, not only toward the treatment of this devastating
  disease, but also for the whole field of non-replicative (nr) recombinant HSV-1
  vectors for gene therapy. To view this Bench to Bedside, open or download the PDF.
