input_text: Variable Outcome of Immunotherapy in Advanced Multiple Cutaneous Squamous
  Cell Carcinomas in Two Patients with Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa.
  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a major complication of recessive dystrophic
  epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) that has high morbidity and mortality rates and unmet
  therapeutic needs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular pattern of
  cSCC and the clinical course of immunotherapy in 2 RDEB patients with multiple advanced
  cSCC. Clinical course and disease staging were evaluated retrospectively. The tumour
  tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical staining. DNA from the blood and cSCC
  samples was subjected to massive parallel sequencing, and somatic mutations were
  determined. Patient 1 survived for over 2 years as disease control was achieved
  with cemiplimab and intralesional interleukin-2. The target advanced cSCC demonstrated
  a high rate of somatic mutations and strong expression of the immune markers, indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase, programmed cell death protein ligand 1, and lymphocyte-activation
  gene 3. The patient ultimately succumbed to complications of oesophageal carcinoma.
  Patient 2 had an undifferentiated cSCC on the foot, which displayed a low mutational
  burden and did not express immune markers. The tumour progressed quickly even with
  cemiplimab therapy. These 2 cases underscore the challenges of cSCC treatment for
  RDEB. Multiple tumours with different molecular and immune profiles occur concomitantly
  or sequentially, and surgical excision is not always possible because of the anatomical
  and tissue constraints imposed by the disease itself. In conclusion, programmed
  cell death protein 1 inhibitors are approved and effective in treating metastatic
  and locally advanced cSCC. Our experience and the literature suggest that cemiplimab
  is an option in patients with RDEB if surgery is not. Somatic mutations and the
  immune microenvironment should be characterized to predict therapeutic response,
  particularly in aggressive undifferentiated tumours.
