input_text: Haplotype-based non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of recessive dystrophic
  epidermolysis bullosa via targeted capture sequencing of maternal plasma. Recessive
  dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare and severe hereditary skin disease,
  caused by mutations in the COL7A1. However, whether non-invasive prenatal testing
  (NIPT) can be used for this monogenic genodermatosis remains unknown. Accordingly,
  we conducted a study in which one couple at high risk of having a fetus with RDEB
  were recruited and tested by haplotyping-based NIPT. Next-generation sequencing-based
  multi-gene panel testing was carried out in this couple and their first child as
  proband who was affected with RDEB. We deduced parental haplotypes via single nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP)-based haplotype linkage analysis. Then the maternal plasma cell-free
  DNA was also sequenced to determine the fetal haplotypes using a parental haplotype-assisted
  hidden Markov model (HMM) analysis. Results show that the fetus was only a heterozygous
  mutation carrier in COL7A1 and the identical results were obtained after birth.
  These results demonstrate that haplotyping-based NIPT is a feasible method for NIPT
  of RDEB.
