input_text: 'Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange for Difficult
  Airway Management in Adults With Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa: A Case
  Series. Airway management of adult patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis
  bullosa presents significant challenges associated with tissue fragility and distortion
  of airway anatomy. This retrospective case series describes 11 adult patients with
  recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and difficult airways undergoing 24 general
  anesthetics in which transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange
  was used for preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation. Despite an average time to intubation
  of over 6 minutes, transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange
  provided oxygenation before endotracheal intubation without the need for bag-mask
  ventilation or supraglottic airway ventilation, facilitating smooth and atraumatic
  flexible scope intubation. There were no major adverse events.'
