input_text: 'Beremagene Geperpavec: First Approval. Beremagene geperpavec-svdt (VYJUVEK
  ) is a topically applied, redosable, live, replication defective herpes simplex
  virus-1 (HSV-1) vector -based gene therapy that is being developed by Krystal Biotech
  to deliver functional human collagen type VII alpha 1 chain (COL7A1) genes in patients
  with both, dominant and recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Beremagene geperpavec
  can transduce both keratinocytes and fibroblasts and restore functional COL7 protein.
  In May 2023, beremagene geperpavec received its first approval in the US for the
  treatment of wounds in patients >= 6 months of age with dystrophic epidermolysis
  bullosa with mutation(s) in the COL7A1 gene. A Marketing Authorization Application
  for beremagene geperpavec in Europe is planned for the second half of 2023. This
  article summarizes the milestones in the development of beremagene geperpavec leading
  to this first approval for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.'
