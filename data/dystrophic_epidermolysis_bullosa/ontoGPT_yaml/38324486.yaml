input_text: Ocular Gene Therapy in a Patient with Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa.
  Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic disease caused by damaging variants
  in COL7A1, which encodes type VII collagen. Blistering and scarring of the ocular
  surface develop, potentially leading to blindness. Beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC)
  is a replication-deficient herpes simplex virus type 1-based gene therapy engineered
  to deliver functional human type VII collagen. Here, we report the case of a patient
  with cicatrizing conjunctivitis in both eyes caused by dystrophic epidermolysis
  bullosa who received ophthalmic administration of B-VEC, which was associated with
  improved visual acuity after surgery.
