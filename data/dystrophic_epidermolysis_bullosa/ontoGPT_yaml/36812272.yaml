input_text: Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Inversa - Case Report and Review of the
  Literature. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa inversa is a very rare subtype of inherited
  dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with a unique clinical manifestation. Generalized
  blistering in the neonatal period and in early infancy improves with age, with lesions
  becoming restricted to intertriginous areas, axial parts of the trunk, and mucous
  membranes. In contrast to other variants of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, the
  inverse type has a more favorable prognosis. We present a case of a 45-year-old
  female patient with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa inversa, diagnosed in adulthood
  based on typical clinical presentation, transmission electron microscopic findings,
  and genetic analysis. Additionally, genetic analysis revealed that the patient also
  suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy.
  To our knowledge, the coexistence of these two genetic diseases has not been reported
  so far. We describe clinical and genetic findings in the patient and review previous
  reports on dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa inversa. A possible temperature-related
  pathophysiology for the peculiar clinical manifestation is discussed.
