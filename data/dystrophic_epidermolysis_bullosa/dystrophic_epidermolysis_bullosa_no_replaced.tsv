34293384	Highly branched poly(beta-amino ester)s for gene delivery in hereditary skin diseases. Non-viral gene therapy for hereditary skin diseases is an attractive prospect. However, research efforts dedicated to this area are rare. Taking advantage of the branched structural possibilities of polymeric vectors, we have developed a gene delivery platform for the treatment of an incurable monogenic skin disease - recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) - based on highly branched poly(beta-amino ester)s (HPAEs). The screening of HPAEs and optimization of therapeutic gene constructs, together with evaluation of the combined system for gene transfection, were comprehensively reviewed. The successful restoration of type VII collagen (C7) expression both in vitro and in vivo highlights HPAEs as a promising generation of polymeric vectors for RDEB gene therapy into the clinic. Considering that the treatment of patients with genetic cutaneous disorders, such as other subtypes of epidermolysis bullosa, pachyonychia congenita, ichthyosis and Netherton syndrome, remains challenging, the success of HPAEs in RDEB treatment indicates that the development of viable polymeric gene delivery vectors could potentially expedite the translation of gene therapy for these diseases from bench to bedside.
37432558	Beremagene Geperpavec: First Approval. Beremagene geperpavec-svdt (VYJUVEK ) is a topically applied, redosable, live, replication defective herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) vector -based gene therapy that is being developed by Krystal Biotech to deliver functional human collagen type VII alpha 1 chain (COL7A1) genes in patients with both, dominant and recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Beremagene geperpavec can transduce both keratinocytes and fibroblasts and restore functional COL7 protein. In May 2023, beremagene geperpavec received its first approval in the US for the treatment of wounds in patients >= 6 months of age with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with mutation(s) in the COL7A1 gene. A Marketing Authorization Application for beremagene geperpavec in Europe is planned for the second half of 2023. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of beremagene geperpavec leading to this first approval for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
36516090	Trial of Beremagene Geperpavec (B-VEC) for Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. BACKGROUND: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic blistering skin disease caused by mutations in COL7A1, which encodes type VII collagen (C7). Beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC) is a topical investigational herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-based gene therapy designed to restore C7 protein by delivering COL7A1. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, intrapatient randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients 6 months of age or older with genetically confirmed dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. For each patient, a primary wound pair was selected, with the wounds matched according to size, region, and appearance. The wounds within each pair were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly application of either B-VEC or placebo for 26 weeks. The primary end point was complete wound healing of treated as compared with untreated wounds at 6 months. Secondary end points included complete wound healing at 3 months and the change from baseline to weeks 22, 24, and 26 in pain severity during changes in wound dressing, assessed with the use of a visual analogue scale (scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater pain). RESULTS: Primary wound pairs were exposed to B-VEC and placebo in 31 patients. At 6 months, complete wound healing occurred in 67% of the wounds exposed to B-VEC as compared with 22% of those exposed to placebo (difference, 46 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 24 to 68; P = 0.002). Complete wound healing at 3 months occurred in 71% of the wounds exposed to B-VEC as compared with 20% of those exposed to placebo (difference, 51 percentage points; 95% CI, 29 to 73; P<0.001). The mean change from baseline to week 22 in pain severity during wound-dressing changes was -0.88 with B-VEC and -0.71 with placebo (adjusted least-squares mean difference, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.10 to -0.13); similar mean changes were observed at weeks 24 and 26. Adverse events with B-VEC and placebo included pruritus and chills. CONCLUSIONS: Complete wound healing at 3 and 6 months in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa was more likely with topical administration of B-VEC than with placebo. Pruritus and mild systemic side effects were observed in patients treated with B-VEC. Longer and larger trials are warranted to determine the durability and side effects of B-VEC for this disease.

34884578	Development of Minicircle Vectors Encoding COL7A1 Gene with Human Promoters for Non-Viral Gene Therapy for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare autosomal inherited skin disorder caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene that encodes type VII collagen (C7). The development of an efficient gene replacement strategy for RDEB is mainly hindered by the lack of vectors able to encapsulate and transfect the large cDNA size of this gene. To address this problem, our group has opted to use polymeric-based non-viral delivery systems and minicircle DNA. With this approach, safety is improved by avoiding the usage of viruses, the absence of bacterial backbone, and the replacement of the control viral cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter of the gene with human promoters. All the promoters showed impressive C7 expression in RDEB skin cells, with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1alpha) promoter producing higher C7 expression levels than CMV following minicircle induction, and COL7A1 tissue-specific promoter (C7P) generating C7 levels similar to normal human epidermal keratinocytes. The improved system developed here has a high potential for use as a non-viral topical treatment to restore C7 in RDEB patients efficiently and safely, and to be adapted to other genetic conditions.

Airway management of adult patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa presents significant challenges associated with tissue fragility and distortion of airway anatomy. This retrospective case series describes 11 adult patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and difficult airways undergoing 24 general anesthetics in which transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange was used for preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation. Despite an average time to intubation of over 6 minutes, transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange provided oxygenation before endotracheal intubation without the need for bag-mask ventilation or supraglottic airway ventilation, facilitating smooth and atraumatic flexible scope intubation. There were no major adverse events.

34376336	Mesenchymal stromal cells in wound healing applications: role of the secretome, targeted delivery and impact on recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa treatment. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multi-potent stromal-derived cells capable of self-renewal that possess several advantageous properties for wound healing, making them of interest to the field of dermatology. Research has focused on characterizing the unique properties of MSCs, which broadly revolve around their regenerative and more recently discovered immunomodulatory capacities. Because of ease of harvesting and expansion, differentiation potential and low immunogenicity, MSCs have been leading candidates for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications for wound healing, yet results from clinical studies have been variable, and promising pre-clinical work has been difficult to reproduce. Therefore, the specific mechanisms of how MSCs influence the local microenvironment in distinct wound etiologies warrant further research. Of specific interest in MSC-mediated healing is harnessing the secretome, which is composed of components known to positively influence wound healing. Molecules released by the MSC secretome can promote re-epithelialization and angiogenesis while inhibiting fibrosis and microbial invasion. This review focuses on the therapeutic interest in MSCs with regard to wound healing applications, including burns and diabetic ulcers, with specific attention to the genetic skin disease recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. This review also compares various delivery methods to support skin regeneration in the hopes of combating the poor engraftment of MSCs after delivery, which is one of the major pitfalls in clinical studies utilizing MSCs.
36197337	Validation and Repeatability of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Eye Disease Index in Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. PURPOSE: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a devastating condition that causes painful corneal abrasions and vision loss. Epidermolysis Bullosa Eye Disease Index (EB-EDI) for the first time captures and quantifies EB-specific assessment of ocular symptoms and activities of daily living scales. This survey will become critical in developing new interventions on patients' quality of life. METHODS: Three-part set of the EB-EDI baseline, EB-EDI interval, and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) survey was distributed to 92 patients with DEB who previously reported eye symptoms on previous surveys. It was then posted online through several EB patient organizations. We compared the EB-EDI with the gold standard OSDI and examined the repeatability of the EB-EDI over a 7- to 15-day interval. RESULTS: Of the 45 individuals who initially responded, 30 of 45 (67%) completed the surveys sent 7 to 15 days later. The age of participants ranged from 6 to 51 years (mean 21 +- 15 years), and 60% (18 of 30) of participants were younger than 18 years. The overall Cronbach alpha values for the subscales of EB-EDI baseline and interval tools presented a good internal consistency (>=0.7). From 2 visits, the domain scores of EB-EDI baseline (0.94) and interval tools (0.83) were shown to have excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8). By comparison, OSDI had the intraclass correlation coefficient score of 0.72 +- 0.11. The convergent validation analysis showed that correlations between the domain scores of EB-EDI baseline and interval tools and the subscales of the OSDI reached the hypothesized strength. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a 30-person repeated-measures study, we found that the EB-EDI has excellent reliability and validity specifically in patients with DEB.
35620886	T-cell activation and bacterial infection in skin wounds of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa patients. Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) patients develop poorly healing skin wounds that are frequently colonized with microbiota. Because T cells play an important role in clearing such pathogens, we aimed to define the status of adaptive T cell-mediated immunity in RDEB wounds. Using a non-invasive approach for sampling of wound-associated constituents, we evaluated microbial contaminants in cellular fraction and exudates obtained from RDED wounds. Infectivity and intracellular trafficking of inactivated Staphylococcus aureus was accessed in RDEB keratinocytes. S. aureus and microbial antigen-specific activation of RDEB wound-derived T cells were investigated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based immune-phenotyping and T-cell functional assays. We found that RDEB wounds and epithelial cells are most frequently infected with Staphylococcus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. and that S. aureus essentially infects more RDEB keratinocytes and RDEB-derived squamous cell carcinoma cells than keratinocytes from healthy donors. The RDEB wound-associated T cells contain populations of CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral memory T cells that respond to soluble microbial antigens by proliferating and secreting interferon gamma (IFNgamma). Moreover, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize S. aureus-infected RDEB keratinocytes and respond by producing interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IFNgamma and degranulating and cytotoxically killing infected cells. Prolonged exposure of RDEB-derived T cells to microbial antigens in vitro does not trigger PD-1-mediated T-cell exhaustion but induces differentiation of the CD4high population into CD4high CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. Our data demonstrated that adaptive T cell-mediated immunity could clear infected cells from wound sites, but these effects might be inhibited by PD-1/Treg-mediated immuno-suppression in RDEB.
34905622	Epidemiological, clinical, pathological and genetic characteristics of epidermolysis bullosa in New Zealand. OBJECTIVE: To establish the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and genetic characteristics of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in New Zealand (NZ). METHODS: Participants were recruited through the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association of New Zealand (DEBRA NZ). Dedicated EB nurse medical records, Genetic Health Service NZ (GHSNZ) records and, where available, public hospital records were manually reviewed for relevant clinical data. RESULTS: Ninety-two participants took part in the study (56% participation rate). Forty-nine (53%) participants had EB simplex (EBS), 40 (43%) had dystrophic EB (DEB), and 3 (3%) had junctional EB (JEB). Point prevalence for EB of all types was 19.5 per million, and 10.4, 8.6 and 0.9 per million for EBS, DEB and JEB, respectively. Thirty-four participants had intermediate or severe EB. There were 29 paediatric cases and almost even numbers of males and females. Compared to NZ European and Maori, prevalence rates were lower for Pacific and Asian people and higher in the Middle Eastern/Latin American/African population. Eight out of 14 skin biopsy results were informative, and 14 of 15 genetic test results were informative. CONCLUSION: New Zealand has similar prevalence rates of EB compared with other national cohorts. This is likely to be an underestimate due to methodological limitations. Recent advancements in genomic testing have resulted in an improved diagnostic rate in our population. Further research into ethnic differences in prevalence, and exploring the characteristics of lethal forms of EB, is warranted. A dynamic registry may be helpful for the EB community in NZ.
36455867	Opening Pandora's box: abnormal genetic carrier screening and need for lifetime follow-up. OBJECTIVE: Expanded carrier screening (ECS) is rising in popularity because of its application in a diverse population, its decreasing cost, and efficiency.1 However, it has traditionally been used to assess fetal risk. The next generation sequencing ECS panel offered at our academic medical center consists of 283 genes associated with hereditary disorders. Of those, 20 (7.1%) are autosomal recessive conditions, notable for variable expression of the clinical phenotype in heterozygous carriers, which may increase maternal risk for malignancy, bleeding, cardiovascular, or rheumatologic disease. Another 21 (7.4%) are X-linked conditions. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of variants that have a potential for maternal phenotypic expression and whether identification of specific variants prompted patients to pursue further care in our health system, namely comprehensive genetic counseling and further healthcare consults when recommended. STUDY DESIGN: An institutional review board-approved descriptive retrospective cohort study was performed in a New York City academic medical center at which reproductive aged women were offered universal ECS from 2018 to 2021 by their provider, inclusive of obstetrician-gynecologists, maternal-fetal medicine physicians, and genetic counselors. Pretest counseling was performed by the ordering provider. Patients found to carry mutations with the potential for maternal phenotypic expression were contacted by genetic counselors regarding their clinical risks. In addition, patients who were carriers for factor XI deficiency, Bernard Soulier syndrome, ataxia telangectesia, fumarase deficiency, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and familial hypercholesterolemia were advised to seek specialized healthcare pertaining to their clinical risk. The genetic counseling summary was placed in the electronic medical records (EMRs) so that the primary provider could view the findings. Through our EMRs, we evaluated the rates of healthcare uptake among these patients for at least 1 year after delivery. RESULTS: In total, 168 of 1184 (14.2%) patients were identified as carriers of mutations with a potential for maternal phenotypic expression. Of these, 156 (93%) were pregnant and 12 (7%) were preconception. Of those patients, 143 (85%) were carriers of autosomal recessive traits (Figure 1), whereas 22 of 168 (13%) patients were carriers of X-linked conditions (Figure 2) and 3 of 168 (2%) patients carried both autosomal recessive traits and X-linked conditions. Of these carriers, 132 of 168 (78.6%) patients underwent genetic counseling. The most common heterozygous mutations were sickle cell trait (25.6%), thalassemia (alpha and/or beta) trait (14.2%), factor XI deficiency (4.7%), dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (4.2%), and Alport syndrome (4.1%). Two patients were diagnosed as homozygous carriers of nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia. During the study period, 23 of 168 (13.6%) patients were heterozygous for specific pathogenic variants (inclusive of factor XI, Bernard Soulier syndrome, ataxia telangectesia, fumarase deficiency, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and familial hypercholesterolemia) and were advised to seek specialized healthcare pertaining to these findings. Of these, 20 (87.0%) received genetic counseling with standardized recommendations, however, only 4 of 23 (17%) patients pursued the recommended referrals during our study period. CONCLUSION: This study described the follow-up rates among patients identified as carriers of conditions with the potential for maternal phenotypic expression using ECS. We observed that 14.2% of patients who underwent ECS were identified as carriers of genetic mutations with the potential for maternal phenotypic expression, and of the 23 who were recommended specific care because a pathogenic variant was identified, only 17.4% of patients followed the recommendations. We believe that as ECS implementation becomes widespread, more maternal carriers with clinical risk to themselves will be identified. Therefore, as we open this Pandora's box, the burden of counseling and follow-up must be addressed.
35347281	In vivo topical gene therapy for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: a phase 1 and 2 trial. Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a lifelong genodermatosis associated with blistering, wounding, and scarring caused by mutations in COL7A1, the gene encoding the anchoring fibril component, collagen VII (C7). Here, we evaluated beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC), an engineered, non-replicating COL7A1 containing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vector, to treat RDEB skin. B-VEC restored C7 expression in RDEB keratinocytes, fibroblasts, RDEB mice and human RDEB xenografts. Subsequently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trial (NCT03536143) evaluated matched wounds from nine RDEB patients receiving topical B-VEC or placebo repeatedly over 12 weeks. No grade 2 or above B-VEC-related adverse events or vector shedding or tissue-bound skin immunoreactants were noted. HSV-1 and C7 antibodies sometimes presented at baseline or increased after B-VEC treatment without an apparent impact on safety or efficacy. Primary and secondary objectives of C7 expression, anchoring fibril assembly, wound surface area reduction, duration of wound closure, and time to wound closure following B-VEC treatment were met. A patient-reported pain-severity secondary outcome was not assessed given the small proportion of wounds treated. A global assessment secondary endpoint was not pursued due to redundancy with regard to other endpoints. These studies show that B-VEC is an easily administered, safely tolerated, topical molecular corrective therapy promoting wound healing in patients with RDEB.
34341262	Genetic and acquired blistering disorders of pediatric age group: An experience from Eastern India. INTRODUCTION: Blistering or vesiculobullous disorders in pediatric population are either immunobullous or mechanobullous. Spectrum was analyzed using demographic details, clinical features, histopathology, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and Immunofluorescence mapping (IFM). METHODOLOGY: This was a single institution based observational study in children below 18 years. The demographic details were collected using proforma containing particulars of the patient, history, complaints, and other parameters. Punch biopsy of the skin lesion was done. Biopsy samples were examined under light microscope followed by DIF using fluorescent conjugated polyclonal antibody against immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, IgA, and complement C3. The salt-split technique was also used in particular cases. IFM was done using anticytokeratin (CK) 5 & 14, antilaminin 332, anticollagen VII, and anticollagen IV antibodies. RESULTS: Out of total 50 cases, linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) was the commonest. The average concordance between clinical and final diagnosis (histopathological examination + DIF) was 87.5% and discordance was 12.5%. The agreement between histopathological examination and DIF was found to be substantially significant (kappa = 0.6892). IFM depicted epidermolysis bullosa simplex with reduced CK 14 expression, dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with reduced Collagen VII expression and junctional epidermolysis bullosa with absent laminin 5 expression. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of bullous lesions in childhood was properly delineated and subcategorization of EB was done. Histopathological examination showed the hallmarks that were conclusive in most of the cases except in LABD and EB. DIF and IFM proved indispensable in those cases. Thus, DIF is not a substitute for histopathology but complementary to it.
34253486	Hand surgery in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: Our experience with dermal substitutes. BACKGROUND: Deformities of the hands occur in most patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. All structures of the hand may be involved. To restore hand function, it is necessary to identify the proper method of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 18 patients for a total of 30 surgically treated hands. The data were collected between 1998 and 2016 at Hopital Necker Enfants Malades (Paris, France) and Institut de la Main (Paris, France). The postoperative follow-up period ranged between 22 months and 168 months, with an average duration of 76 months. The procedure performed on all of these patients involved a first web release for the thumb and pseudosyndactyly release for the remaining digits. A full thickness skin graft was used at the level of the first commissure and palm of the hand, while acellular dermal substitutes (Integra  or Matriderm ) were used to cover the remaining commissures, digits, and the remainder of the hand, followed by a split thickness skin graft. Postoperative rehabilitation ensued. RESULTS: Long-term results are encouraging, demonstrating maintenance of function greater than 3 years in 57% of cases, and greater than 5 years in 33% of cases. CONCLUSION: We believe that good surgical technique followed by good rehabilitation, combined with an interdisciplinary overall management of these patients, allowed us to succeed in maintaining a very satisfactory, esthetic, and functional result exceeding 5 years for one-third of patients. The resultant psychological benefit is very important.
34862606	The potential of gene therapy for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited skin fragility disorders, with mutations in genes encoding the basement membrane zone (BMZ) proteins that normally ensure dermal-epidermal integrity. Of the four main EB types, recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB), especially the severe variant, represents one of the most debilitating clinical entities, with recurrent mucocutaneous blistering and ulceration leading to chronic wounds, infections, inflammation, scarring and ultimately cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which leads to premature death. Improved understanding of the molecular genetics of EB over the past three decades and advances in biotechnology have led to rapid progress in developing gene and cell-based regenerative therapies for EB. In particular, RDEB is at the vanguard of advances in human clinical trials of advanced therapeutics. Furthermore, the past decade has witnessed the emergence of a real collective, global effort involving academia and industry, supported by international EB patient organizations such as the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association (DEBRA), among others, to develop clinically relevant and marketable targeted therapeutics for EB. Thus, there is an increasing need for the practising dermatologist to become familiar with the concept of gene therapy, fundamental differences between various approaches, and their human applications. This review explains the principles of different approaches of gene therapy, summarizes its journey, and discusses its current and future impact in RDEB.
38324486	Ocular Gene Therapy in a Patient with Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a rare genetic disease caused by damaging variants in COL7A1, which encodes type VII collagen. Blistering and scarring of the ocular surface develop, potentially leading to blindness. Beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC) is a replication-deficient herpes simplex virus type 1-based gene therapy engineered to deliver functional human type VII collagen. Here, we report the case of a patient with cicatrizing conjunctivitis in both eyes caused by dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa who received ophthalmic administration of B-VEC, which was associated with improved visual acuity after surgery.
37296590	Kinetics of Wound Development and Healing Suggests a Skin-Stabilizing Effect of Allogeneic ABCB5+ Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Treatment in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis (RDEB) is a rare, inherited, and currently incurable skin blistering disorder characterized by cyclically recurring wounds coexisting with chronic non-healing wounds. In a recent clinical trial, three intravenous infusions of skin-derived ABCB5+ mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to 14 patients with RDEB improved the healing of wounds that were present at baseline. Since in RDEB even minor mechanical forces perpetually provoke the development of new or recurrent wounds, a post-hoc analysis of patient photographs was performed to specifically assess the effects of ABCB5+ MSCs on new or recurrent wounds by evaluating 174 wounds that occurred after baseline. During 12 weeks of systemic treatment with ABCB5+ MSCs, the number of newly occurring wounds declined. When compared to the previously reported healing responses of the wounds present at baseline, the newly occurring wounds healed faster, and a greater portion of healed wounds remained stably closed. These data suggest a previously undescribed skin-stabilizing effect of treatment with ABCB5+ MSCs and support repeated dosing of ABCB5+ MSCs in RDEB to continuously slow the wound development and accelerate the healing of new or recurrent wounds before they become infected or progress to a chronic, difficult-to-heal stage.

35304249	Interrogation of RDEB Epidermal Allografts after BMT Reveals Coexpression of Collagen VII and Keratin 15 with Proinflammatory Immune Cells and Fibroblasts. Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a devastating genodermatosis characterized by dysfunctional collagen VII protein resulting in epithelial blistering of the skin, mucosa, and gastrointestinal tract. There is no cure for RDEB, but improvement of clinical phenotype has been achieved with bone marrow transplantation and subsequent epidermal allografting from the bone marrow transplant donor. Epidermal allografting of these patients has decreased wound surface area for up to 3 years after treatment. This study aimed to determine the phenotype of the epidermal allograft cells responsible for durable persistence of wound healing and skin integrity. We found that epidermal allografts provide basal keratinocytes coexpressing collagen VII and basal stem cell marker keratin 15. Characterization of RDEB full-thickness skin biopsies with single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered proinflammatory immune and fibroblast phenotypes potentially driven by the local environment of RDEB skin. This is further highlighted by the presence of a myofibroblast population, which has not been described in healthy control human skin. Finally, we found inflammatory fibroblasts expressing profibrotic gene POSTN, which may have implications in the development of squamous cell carcinoma, a common, lethal complication of RDEB that lacks curative treatment. In conclusion, this study provides insights into and targets for future RDEB studies and treatments.
36880304	Haplotype-based non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa via targeted capture sequencing of maternal plasma. Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare and severe hereditary skin disease, caused by mutations in the COL7A1. However, whether non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can be used for this monogenic genodermatosis remains unknown. Accordingly, we conducted a study in which one couple at high risk of having a fetus with RDEB were recruited and tested by haplotyping-based NIPT. Next-generation sequencing-based multi-gene panel testing was carried out in this couple and their first child as proband who was affected with RDEB. We deduced parental haplotypes via single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based haplotype linkage analysis. Then the maternal plasma cell-free DNA was also sequenced to determine the fetal haplotypes using a parental haplotype-assisted hidden Markov model (HMM) analysis. Results show that the fetus was only a heterozygous mutation carrier in COL7A1 and the identical results were obtained after birth. These results demonstrate that haplotyping-based NIPT is a feasible method for NIPT of RDEB.
37338146	Variable Outcome of Immunotherapy in Advanced Multiple Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Two Patients with Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a major complication of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) that has high morbidity and mortality rates and unmet therapeutic needs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular pattern of cSCC and the clinical course of immunotherapy in 2 RDEB patients with multiple advanced cSCC. Clinical course and disease staging were evaluated retrospectively. The tumour tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical staining. DNA from the blood and cSCC samples was subjected to massive parallel sequencing, and somatic mutations were determined. Patient 1 survived for over 2 years as disease control was achieved with cemiplimab and intralesional interleukin-2. The target advanced cSCC demonstrated a high rate of somatic mutations and strong expression of the immune markers, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, programmed cell death protein ligand 1, and lymphocyte-activation gene 3. The patient ultimately succumbed to complications of oesophageal carcinoma. Patient 2 had an undifferentiated cSCC on the foot, which displayed a low mutational burden and did not express immune markers. The tumour progressed quickly even with cemiplimab therapy. These 2 cases underscore the challenges of cSCC treatment for RDEB. Multiple tumours with different molecular and immune profiles occur concomitantly or sequentially, and surgical excision is not always possible because of the anatomical and tissue constraints imposed by the disease itself. In conclusion, programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitors are approved and effective in treating metastatic and locally advanced cSCC. Our experience and the literature suggest that cemiplimab is an option in patients with RDEB if surgery is not. Somatic mutations and the immune microenvironment should be characterized to predict therapeutic response, particularly in aggressive undifferentiated tumours.
34494659	The clinical efficacy and safety of anti-IgE therapy in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) remains challenging. Elevated IgE levels have previously been reported in several RDEB patients. In this prospective, single-centre, open intervention study, elevated IgE levels were seen in 11 out of 12 patients with intense pruritus, and the patients with elevated IgE levels received anti-IgE therapy every 4 weeks for at least three cycles. Compared with the baseline, 10 patients with RDEB had good clinical outcomes with enhanced wound healing, a reduction in Birmingham (epidermolysis bullosa) EB severity score by 15%, a reduction in affected body surface area by 23.3%, amelioration of skin inflammation, and an increase in type VII collagen deposition by 13.1-fold. All the patients had a good tolerance to anti-IgE therapy. Furthermore, patients with higher IgE levels tended to have higher disease severity and more favorable clinical outcomes. Our report also suggested the potential role of IgE in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions associated with RDEB. (ChiCTR1900021437).
33916959	hTERT-Driven Immortalization of RDEB Fibroblast and Keratinocyte Cell Lines Followed by Cre-Mediated Transgene Elimination. The recessive form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a crippling disease caused by impairments in the junctions of the dermis and the basement membrane of the epidermis. Using ectopic expression of hTERT/hTERT + BMI-1 in primary cells, we developed expansible cultures of RDEB fibroblasts and keratinocytes. We showed that they display the properties of their founders, including morphology, contraction ability and expression of the respective specific markers including reduced secretion of type VII collagen (C7). The immortalized keratinocytes retained normal stratification in 3D skin equivalents. The comparison of secreted protein patterns from immortalized RDEB and healthy keratinocytes revealed the differences in the contents of the extracellular matrix that were earlier observed specifically for RDEB. We demonstrated the possibility to reverse the genotype of immortalized cells to the state closer to the progenitors by the Cre-dependent hTERT switch off. Increased beta-galactosidase activity and reduced proliferation of fibroblasts were shown after splitting out of transgenes. We anticipate our cell lines to be tractable models for studying RDEB from the level of single-cell changes to the evaluation of 3D skin equivalents. Our approach permits the creation of standardized and expandable models of RDEB that can be compared with the models based on primary cell cultures.
35008999	Evaluating a Targeted Cancer Therapy Approach Mediated by RNA trans-Splicing In Vitro and in a Xenograft Model for Epidermolysis Bullosa-Associated Skin Cancer. Conventional anti-cancer therapies based on chemo- and/or radiotherapy represent highly effective means to kill cancer cells but lack tumor specificity and, therefore, result in a wide range of iatrogenic effects. A promising approach to overcome this obstacle is spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMaRT), which can be leveraged to target tumor cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. Notably, a previously established RNA trans-splicing molecule (RTM44) showed efficacy and specificity in exchanging the coding sequence of a cancer target gene (Ct-SLCO1B3) with the suicide gene HSV1-thymidine kinase in a colorectal cancer model, thereby rendering tumor cells sensitive to the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV). In the present work, we expand the application of this approach, using the same RTM44 in aggressive skin cancer arising in the rare genetic skin disease recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). Stable expression of RTM44, but not a splicing-deficient control (NC), in RDEB-SCC cells resulted in expression of the expected fusion product at the mRNA and protein level. Importantly, systemic GCV treatment of mice bearing RTM44-expressing cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume and weight compared with controls. Thus, our results demonstrate the applicability of RTM44-mediated targeting of the cancer gene Ct-SLCO1B3 in a different malignancy.
36812272	Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Inversa - Case Report and Review of the Literature. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa inversa is a very rare subtype of inherited dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with a unique clinical manifestation. Generalized blistering in the neonatal period and in early infancy improves with age, with lesions becoming restricted to intertriginous areas, axial parts of the trunk, and mucous membranes. In contrast to other variants of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, the inverse type has a more favorable prognosis. We present a case of a 45-year-old female patient with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa inversa, diagnosed in adulthood based on typical clinical presentation, transmission electron microscopic findings, and genetic analysis. Additionally, genetic analysis revealed that the patient also suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. To our knowledge, the coexistence of these two genetic diseases has not been reported so far. We describe clinical and genetic findings in the patient and review previous reports on dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa inversa. A possible temperature-related pathophysiology for the peculiar clinical manifestation is discussed.

36068590	Understanding the socioeconomic costs of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa in Europe: a costing and health-related quality of life study. BACKGROUND: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a family of rare genetic dermatological conditions. Recent evidence indicated that in addition to its detrimental implications on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL), there are substantial socioeconomic cost implications, especially regarding direct non-medical costs. This study aims to understand the burden of dystrophic EB (DEB) in Europe, using a primary EB patient-level dataset. METHODS: A bottom-up, cross-sectional, study design was adopted for non-institutionalised patients diagnosed with EB who received outpatient care across EU5 countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. A prevalence-based approach was used to estimate resource utilisation from a societal perspective, including direct (medical and non-medical) and indirect costs for patients and caregivers. Patient and caregiver outcomes were obtained using the EQ-5D questionnaire. RESULTS: A sample of 91 DEB patients was analysed. Overall, average EU5 annual cost per patient was estimated at $53,359, ranging from $18,783 (France) to $79,405 (Germany). Average EU5 annual direct medical costs were estimated at $8357 (15.7% of total), ranging from $5658 (France) to $12,576 (Germany); average direct non-medical costs were estimated at $41,353 (77.5% of total), ranging from $11,961 (France) to $57,000 (Germany); and average indirect costs were estimated at $3649 (6.8% of total), ranging from $1025 (Italy) to $9930 (United Kingdom). Costs varied across patients with different disability but also between children and adults. The mean EQ-5D index score for adult DEB patients ranged between 0.304 (United Kingdom) and 0.541 (Germany), with an EU5 average of 0.456, whereas the mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale score ranged between 47.5 (Germany) and 70.0 (France), with an EU5 average of 61.9. Limitations included potential patient selection bias, recall bias, and exclusion of bandaging and related costs. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a substantial socioeconomic burden for DEB in Europe, attributable mostly to high direct non-medical costs, with the majority of patients requiring support from caregivers at home. Compared to the average economic burden of the overall EB patient population, costs for DEB patients are higher across all components of direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect costs.
