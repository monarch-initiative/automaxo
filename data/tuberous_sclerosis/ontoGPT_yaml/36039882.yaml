input_text: 'Vagus nerve stimulation outcome prediction: from simple parameters to
  advanced models. Since its approval as an adjunct treatment for refractory partial
  epilepsy, the positive effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on seizure frequency
  and severity have been supported by many studies. Seizure reduction of more than
  50 % can be expected in at least 50 % of patients. However, a complete post-VNS
  seizure freedom is rarely achieved and 25 % of patients do not benefit from VNS.
  Our study provides an overview of the potential predictors of VNS response, from
  the most simple and basic data to sophisticated EEG processing studies and functional
  imaging studying brain connectivity. The data support better outcomes in younger
  patients with early VNS implantation, in patients with posttraumatic epilepsy or
  tuberous sclerosis, and in patients without bilateral interictal epileptiform discharges.
  The variability of heart activity has also been studied with some promising results.
  Because the generally accepted hypothesis of the VNS mechanism is the modulation
  of synaptic activity in multiple cortical and subcortical regions of the brain,
  the studies of brain response to external stimulation and/or of brain connectivity
  were used for models predicting the effect of VNS in individual patients. Although
  the predictive value of these models is high, the required special equipment and
  sophisticated mathematical tools limit their routine use (Ref. 58). Keywords: epilepsy,
  vagus nerve stimulation, response predictor, EEG.'
