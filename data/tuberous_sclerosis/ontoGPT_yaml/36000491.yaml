input_text: Progress of clinical research studies on tuberous sclerosis complex-related
  epilepsy in China. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous
  syndrome, with 75.6%-83.5% and 54.1% patients presenting with epilepsy and drug-resistant
  epilepsy (DRE), respectively. Clinical studies on TSC, particularly surgical interventions,
  have achieved rapid and substantial progress. The TSC-Task Force Committee of the
  China Association Against Epilepsy (CAAE-TFTSC) was founded in 2012, and annual
  academic conferences on the surgical treatment of TSC-related epilepsy have been
  held since 2013. 'China experts' consensus on surgical treatment of TSC-related
  epilepsy' was published in 2019. This review focuses on surgical treatment, including
  resective surgery, neuromodulations, corpus callosotomy and mini-invasive ablations,
  as well as studies on phenotype, genotype and anti-seizure therapies of mammalian
  target of rapamycin inhibitor, vigabatrin and ketogenic diet in patients with TSC-related
  DRE in China.
