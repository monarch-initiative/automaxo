input_text: 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: An updated in the treatment of epilepsy for
  early careers. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder
  that is characterized by multisystem involvement and significant neurological manifestations.
  TSC1 and TSC2 pathogenic variants lead to hyperactivation of the mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which disrupts cellular growth and differentiation.
  Epilepsy, affecting 85-90% of individuals with TSC, often presents within the first
  year of life and is commonly resistant to conventional therapies. This paper provides
  a comprehensive overview of the diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and current
  treatment strategies for TSC-associated epilepsy, including pharmacological approaches
  such as vigabatrin, cannabidiol, and mTOR inhibitors, as well as non-pharmacological
  interventions such as ketogenic diet and epilepsy surgery. Preventive strategies,
  highlighted by robust trials, delay seizure onset and reduce its severity but have
  a limited impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Challenges include the heterogeneity
  of cortical tubers, suboptimal seizure control with existing therapies, and underutilization
  of neuropsychiatric care for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Advances
  in biomarkers, precision medicine, and surgical techniques have paved the way for
  personalized treatment approaches. Future research providing earlier detection strategies
  and integrating therapies targeting both the neurological and behavioral dimensions
  of TSC is ongoing. By addressing these needs, clinicians and researchers can enhance
  the quality of life and developmental outcomes of individuals with TSC.'
