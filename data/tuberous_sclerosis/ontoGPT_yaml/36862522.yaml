input_text: 'Cannabidiol Add-On in Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-Related Drug-Resistant
  Epilepsy. Background: Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein deficiencies
  (GPI-ADs) are commonly associated with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Cannabidiol
  (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures in Dravet/Lennox-Gastaut
  Syndromes and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. We report on the efficacy and safety of
  CBD for the treatment of DRE in patients with genetically proven GPI-AD. Patients
  and Methods: Patients received add-on treatment with purified GW-pharma CBD (Epidyolex
  ). Efficacy endpoints were the percentage of patients with >=50% (responders) or
  >25<50% (partial responders) reduction in monthly seizures from baseline and at
  12 (M12) months of follow-up. Safety was evaluated through adverse events (AEs)
  monitoring. Results: Six patients (5 males) were enrolled. The median age at seizures
  onset was 5 months and the syndromic diagnosis was early infantile developmental
  and epileptic encephalopathy in 4 patients and focal non-lesional epilepsy or GEFS+
  in one patient each. Five out of six (83%) patients were responders at M12, while
  one was a partial responder. No severe AEs were reported. Mean prescribed CBD dose
  was 17.85 mg/kg/day and median treatment duration is currently 27 months. Conclusions:
  In summary, off-label treatment with CBD was effective and safe in patients with
  DRE due to GPI-ADs.'
