input_text: 'Prenatal ultrasound and magnetic resonance evaluation and fetal outcome
  in high-risk fetal tumors: A retrospective single-center cohort study over 20 years.
  INTRODUCTION: Fetal tumors are rare and usually followed by poor outcome. We describe
  our single-center experience with fetal tumors evaluated by ultrasound and magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI). Our aims were to evaluate mortality and morbidity including
  long-term outcome and to determine which ultrasound and MRI characteristics were
  helpful for pre- and perinatal management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a
  retrospective analysis on prenatally diagnosed tumors between 1998 and 2018. Poor
  outcome included fetal or neonatal death and survival with serious illness. MRI
  addressed tumor morphology (sacrococcygeal teratomas), compromise of surrounding
  structures (head and neck tumors) and early depiction of brain alterations specific
  to tuberous sclerosis (rhabdomyomas). RESULTS: Of 68 pregnancies, 15 (22%) were
  terminated and eight children (8/53, 15%) died pre- or postnatally. Of the 45 survivors
  (45/68, 66%), 24 (24/45, 53%) were healthy, eight (8/45, 18%) had a minor illness
  and 13 (13/45, 29%) a serious illness. Diffusion- and T1-weighted MRI reliably predicted
  tumor morphology in teratomas. To detect head and neck tumors critical to airway
  obstruction, MRI was superior to ultrasound in delivery planning. Rhabdomyomas were
  frequently associated with tuberous sclerosis, regardless of their number or size
  in ultrasound; MRI could depict specific brain alterations from the early third
  trimester onwards. For several rare tumors, MRI provided critical differential diagnoses
  that could not be clearly displayed in ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of survivors
  with serious long-term illness among fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of a tumor
  was high. MRI is specifically helpful for risk stratification in fetal teratomas
  and delivery planning in head and neck tumors.'
