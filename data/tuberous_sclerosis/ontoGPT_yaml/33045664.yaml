input_text: 'A prospective multicenter study of laser ablation for drug resistant
  epilepsy - One year outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To report one-year seizure outcomes, procedural
  data, and quality of life scores following laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT)
  of epileptogenic foci. METHODS: Data from an ongoing prospective, multi-center registry
  were assessed. Procedural information, Engel seizure outcomes, and quality of life
  (QoL) scores were analyzed. A responder analysis was performed to better understand
  potential clinical characteristics that could influence seizure outcome. RESULTS:
  Sixty patients have been enrolled into LAANTERN (Laser Ablation of Abnormal Neurological
  Tissue Using Robotic NeuroBlate System) specifically for epilepsy treatment, of
  which 42 reached one year follow up. Engel I outcome was achieved in 64.3 % at one
  year follow up. Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) comprised 56.7
  % of this cohort of multiple epilepsy types. Other significant etiologies included
  focal cortical dysplasia, hypothalamic hamartoma, cavernoma, heterotopias, and tuberous
  sclerosis. Median length of stay was 32.7 h. At discharge, head pain score averaged
  1.4 +- 2.1 on a scale from 1 to 10. Five adverse events were reported, one categorized
  as serious. Seizure worry and social functioning scores improved significantly in
  quality of life measures. SIGNIFICANCE: Surgical treatment with LITT for epileptic
  foci is a safe and effective treatment option for people with drug resistant epilepsy.
  Our multicenter prospective seizure outcomes continue to expand published LITT experience
  in MTLE as well as non-MTLE epilepsies. The minimally invasive nature allows for
  short hospitalizations with minimal reported pain and discomfort.'
