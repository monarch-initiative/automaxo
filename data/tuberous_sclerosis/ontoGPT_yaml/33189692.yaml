input_text: 'Distinct patterns of repetition suppression in Fragile X syndrome, down
  syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex and mutations in SYNGAP1. Sensory processing
  is the gateway to information processing and more complex processes such as learning.
  Alterations in sensory processing is a common phenotype of many genetic syndromes
  associated with intellectual disability (ID). It is currently unknown whether sensory
  processing alterations converge or diverge on brain responses between syndromes.
  Here, we compare for the first time four genetic conditions with ID using the same
  basic sensory learning paradigm. One hundred and five participants, aged between
  3 and 30 years old, composing four clinical ID groups and one control group, were
  recruited: Fragile X syndrome (FXS; n = 14), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; n
  = 9), Down syndrome (DS; n = 19), SYNGAP1 mutations (n = 8) and Neurotypical controls
  (NT; n = 55)). All groups included female and male participants. Brain responses
  were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) during an audio-visual task that
  involved three repetitions of the pronunciation of the phoneme /a/. Event Related
  Potentials (ERP) were used to: 1) compare peak-to-peak amplitudes between groups,
  2) evaluate the presence of repetition suppression within each group and 3) compare
  the relative repetition suppression between groups. Our results revealed larger
  overall amplitudes in FXS. A repetition suppression (RS) pattern was found in the
  NT group, FXS and DS, suggesting spared repetition suppression in a multimodal task
  in these two ID syndromes. Interestingly, FXS presented a stronger RS on one peak-to-peak
  value in comparison with the NT. The results of our study reveal the distinctiveness
  of ERP and RS brain responses in ID syndromes. Further studies should be conducted
  to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in these patterns of responses.'
