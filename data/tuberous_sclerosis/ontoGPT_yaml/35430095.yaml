input_text: "Kidney Transplantation in a Patient With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex:
  A Case Report. BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal
  dominant genetic disease caused by mutations of either of 2 genes, TSC1 and TSC2.
  Renal manifestations include angiomyolipomas (AMLs), multiple cysts, and renal cell
  carcinoma. AMLs increase bleeding tendency and the risk of renal insufficiency which
  end-stage develops in 1% of affected patients. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman
  suffering from TSC since early childhood has developed multiple complications associated
  with this disease. The patient was diagnosed with brain tumor-giant cell astrocytoma-which
  was removed in 1992. In 2006, right nephrectomy was performed due to the unsuccessful
  right renal artery embolization after the massive hemorrhage into the AML. Moreover,
  the right idiopathic pneumothorax occurred twice. Therefore, the video-assisted
  thoracoscopic surgery and pleurodesis were conducted (2006, 2013). The patient is
  intellectually disabled and unable to make decisions on her own. Her legal guardians
  (parents) make all decisions associated with her treatment. Diagnostic and therapeutic
  procedures demanding cooperation were conducted under anesthesia. Because of end-stage
  renal failure, the patient required the renal replacement therapy (RRT). Preemptive
  kidney transplantation (KTx) was the best solution for this patient. Procedures
  such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were infeasible to perform due to the
  intellectual disability that inhibits essential cooperation. During KTx qualification
  tests, the expanding AML with risk of hemorrhage was noticed. The patient was qualified
  for simultaneous left nephrectomy and KTx from the living donor (her father). The
  surgery was performed on the 2nd of June 2020. The patient is looked after by her
  parents, stays in good general condition. The patient's creatinine level is maintained
  at 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: Patients with significant intellectual disability
  that prevents maintaining conscious cooperation who require RRT must have individually
  adjusted therapy. In the case of the presented patient, it was decided to perform
  the preemptive kidney transplantation from her determined father."
