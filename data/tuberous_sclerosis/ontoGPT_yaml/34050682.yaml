input_text: "The long-term efficacy of cannabidiol in the treatment of refractory
  epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to reduce seizures among patients
  with refractory epilepsies of various etiologies in recent clinical trials and an
  expanded access program (EAP). Most studies report efficacy over short time periods
  (<1 year), with little published on longer term efficacy. Here, we investigate the
  efficacy of CBD for a treatment period of up to 60 months (median = 45.5 months).
  METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patient-reported seizure logs and
  medical records for 54 subjects with refractory epilepsy who enrolled in the Massachusetts
  General Hospital's open-label EAP for CBD as a new treatment for epilepsy. We analyzed
  the effect of CBD on seizure frequencies and concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED)
  use at 1 year after starting treatment and the most recent study visit. RESULTS:
  Our results indicate that CBD maintains its efficacy for controlling seizures from
  Year 1 to the most recent study visit. The percentage of seizure responders remained
  similar at these time points (41.7%-42.6%), and the seizure response rate was also
  maintained (p = .12). Efficacy was also seen over a broad dose range, and up to
  50 mg/kg/day. CBD was particularly effective for controlling seizures in the setting
  of tuberous sclerosis complex and for reducing epileptic spasms and absence seizures.
  Although CBD use did not lead to an overall decrease in concomitant AEDs, most subjects
  reduced the dose of at least one concomitant AED compared to baseline. CBD was generally
  well tolerated, with drowsiness and diarrhea as the primary adverse reactions. SIGNIFICANCE:
  This study demonstrates CBD does not lose its efficacy in controlling seizures over
  a treatment period of up to 60 months. Taken alongside other results on the efficacy
  and tolerability of CBD in the treatment of refractory epilepsies, our results provide
  evidence that CBD is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated AED for long-term use."
