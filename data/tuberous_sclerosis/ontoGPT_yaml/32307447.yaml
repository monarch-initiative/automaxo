input_text: Tumour kinome re-wiring governs resistance to palbociclib in oestrogen
  receptor positive breast cancers, highlighting new therapeutic modalities. Combination
  of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy improves clinical outcome in advanced
  oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, however relapse is inevitable. Here,
  we show in model systems that other than loss of RB1 few gene-copy number (CN) alterations
  are associated with irreversible-resistance to endocrine therapy and subsequent
  secondary resistance to palbociclib. Resistance to palbociclib occurred as a result
  of tumour cell re-wiring leading to increased expression of EGFR, MAPK, CDK4, CDK2,
  CDK7, CCNE1 and CCNE2. Resistance altered the ER genome wide-binding pattern, leading
  to decreased expression of 'classical' oestrogen-regulated genes and was accompanied
  by reduced sensitivity to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. Persistent CDK4 blockade decreased
  phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) enhancing EGFR signalling,
  leading to the re-wiring of ER. Kinome-knockdown confirmed dependency on ERBB-signalling
  and G2/M-checkpoint proteins such as WEE1, together with the cell cycle master regulator,
  CDK7. Noteworthy, sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition was associated with loss of ER
  and RB1 CN. Overall, we show that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors is dependent on
  kinase re-wiring and the redeployment of signalling cascades previously associated
  with endocrine resistance and highlights new therapeutic networks that can be exploited
  upon relapse after CDK4/6 inhibition.
