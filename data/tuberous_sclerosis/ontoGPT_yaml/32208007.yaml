input_text: 'Eight-Year Experience With 3-T Intraoperative MRI Integration in Focal
  Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery: Impact on Extent of Resection, Residual Volumes, and
  Seizure Outcomes. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence
  of 3-T intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) on the extent of resection of pediatric focal
  epileptogenic lesions, residual lesion volumes, and postoperative seizure outcomes.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS. All surgical procedures for focal epilepsy from 2003 to 2017
  were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who
  underwent ioMRI and those who did not. Each group was subdivided into two subcategories
  according to preoperative MRI visualization of the lesion: those with well-defined
  and those with poorly defined lesions. The volumes of preoperative lesions and postoperative
  residual lesions were delineated. Outcome data and patient characteristics were
  reviewed. The results were compared between the two groups and the two subcategories.
  RESULTS. Eighty patients were included: 45 in the ioMRI group (24 with well-defined
  lesions, 21 with poorly defined lesions) and 35 in the non-ioMRI group (18 with
  well-defined lesions, 17 with poorly defined lesions). The well-defined lesions
  included tumors and vascular lesions. The poorly defined lesions included malformations
  of cortical development, hippocampal sclerosis, and tuberous sclerosis. The mean
  follow-up duration was 5.1 +- 3.3 years. The rate of gross total resection was not
  significantly different between the ioMRI and non-ioMRI groups (p = 0.46). However,
  ioMRI findings facilitated further resection during surgery, increasing gross total
  resection by an additional 11.1%. The ioMRI group had a significant reduction in
  percentage of residual volume (p < 0.001). Outcome data suggested that ioMRI is
  protective against poor Engel score (p = 0.048). Although ioMRI prolonged the mean
  operative time by 1.2 hours (p = 0.002), the additional time was not associated
  with additional complications. CONCLUSION. Integration of ioMRI into focal epilepsy
  surgery was associated with smaller residual lesions and was protective against
  poor Engel score. It prolonged the operative time but without increasing the number
  of complications.'
