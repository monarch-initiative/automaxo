input_text: "Optimization and high-density array of stereoelectroencephalography-guided
  radiofrequency thermocoagulation for the treatment of pediatric tuberous sclerosis
  complex with epilepsy. BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal
  dominant neurocutaneous syndrome involved in many organ systems. At the same time,
  epilepsy is the most common manifestation and more than 50% of TSC patients present
  with intractable epilepsy. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of optimized
  and high-density stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation
  (RF-TC) in treating TSC-related epilepsy. METHODS: Nine TSC children with refractory
  epilepsy were treated with first-stage SEEG-Guided RF-TC, and four underwent second-stage-optimized
  high-density array of SEEG-Guided RF-TC. Patients' clinical data and postoperative
  outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The patients' median age at surgery
  was 4 years and 2 month (range from 3 years and 5 month to 16 years and 7 month).
  The mean age at surgery was 6.7 years old. Eight in 9 (88.9%) patients achieved
  complete remission after the final operation at half-year follow-up. Of seven patients
  with final postoperative time beyond 1 year, 6 (85.7%) reached completely seizure-free.
  No severe or long-term neurologic impairment existed in all nine patients. CONCLUSION:
  Optimized high-density array of SEEG-guided RF-TC is a safe and highly effective
  approach and can be an alternative application applied for TSC patients with refractory
  epilepsy."
