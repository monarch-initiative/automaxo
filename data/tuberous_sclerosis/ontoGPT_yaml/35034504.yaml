input_text: 'Low-frequency electroacupuncture improves disordered hepatic energy metabolism
  in insulin-resistant Zucker diabetic fatty rats via the AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K signaling
  pathway. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disordered hepatic energy metabolism is found in obese
  rats with insulin resistance (IR). There are insufficient experimental studies of
  electroacupuncture (EA) for IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this
  study was to probe the effect of EA on disordered hepatic energy metabolism and
  the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70-kDa (p70S6K) signaling
  pathway. METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were randomly divided into three
  groups: EA group receiving EA treatment; Pi group receiving pioglitazone gavage;
  and ZF group remaining untreated (n = 8 per group). Inbred non-insulin-resistant
  Zucker lean rats formed an (untreated) healthy control group (ZL, n = 8). Fasting
  plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP)
  and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were measured.
  Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate the liver morphologically.
  The mitochondrial structure of hepatocytes was observed by transmission electron
  microscopy (TEM). Western blotting was adopted to determine protein expression of
  insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK, tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2)
  and p70S6K, and their phosphorylation. RT-PCR was used to quantify IRS-1, mTOR,
  mTORC1, AMPK and p70S6K mRNA levels. RESULTS: Compared with the ZF group, FPG, FINS,
  C-peptide, CRP and HOMA-IR levels were significantly reduced in the EA group (p
  < 0.05, p < 0.01). Evaluation of histopathology showed improvement in liver appearances
  following EA. Phosphorylation levels of AMPK, mTOR and TSC2 decreased, and IRS-1
  and p70S6K increased, in hepatocytes of the ZF group, while these negative effects
  appeared to be alleviated by EA. CONCLUSIONS: EA can effectively ameliorate IR and
  regulate energy metabolism in the ZDF rat model. AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K and related
  molecules may represent a potential mechanism of action underlying these effects.'
