input_text: 'Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and COVID-19:
  The experience of a TSC clinic in Italy. Individuals with comorbidities are at higher
  risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and worse outcome, but little information
  has been available about patients with genetic diseases and COVID-19. This study
  aims at evaluating the presence and outcome of COVID-19 in a cohort of Italian patients
  with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and/or lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and
  at reviewing the possible effects of mTOR inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
  included 102 unselected individuals with a diagnosis of TSC and/or LAM assessed
  between January 1, 2020 and April 24, 2020 (29% children, 71% adults). Twenty-six
  patients were on mTOR inhibitors. Demographic data, TSC manifestations, presence,
  and outcomes in individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were
  evaluated. Health status and outcomes of all patients on mTOR inhibitors were assessed.
  One patient with severe TSC had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
  infection, was admitted to ICU, and died. Nine additional patients either met the
  definition of suspect case or presented with at least two of the most common symptoms
  of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All recovered fully. None of the patients treated with
  mTOR inhibitors for their underlying comorbidities was diagnosed with COVID-19,
  and those who showed suspicious respiratory symptoms recovered fully. This cohort
  study provides preliminary information on COVID-19 in people with TSC in Italy and
  suggests feasibility to systematically evaluate the role of mTOR inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2
  infection.'
