input_text: 'MTORC1-Regulated Metabolism Controlled by TSC2 Limits Cardiac Reperfusion
  Injury. RATIONALE: The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1) controls
  metabolism and protein homeostasis and is activated following ischemia reperfusion
  (IR) injury and by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, studies vary as to whether
  this activation is beneficial or detrimental, and its influence on metabolism after
  IR is little reported. A limitation of prior investigations is their use of broad
  gain/loss of mTORC1 function, mostly applied before ischemic stress. This can be
  circumvented by regulating one serine (S1365) on TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex)
  to achieve bidirectional mTORC1 modulation but only with TCS2-regulated costimulation.
  OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation protects
  the myocardium against IR and is required for IPC by amplifying mTORC1 activity
  to favor glycolytic metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with either S1365A (TSC2SA;
  phospho-null) or S1365E (TSC2SE; phosphomimetic) knockin mutations were studied
  ex vivo and in vivo. In response to IR, hearts from TSC2SA mice had amplified mTORC1
  activation and improved heart function compared with wild-type and TSC2SE hearts.
  The magnitude of protection matched IPC. IPC requited less S1365 phosphorylation,
  as TSC2SE hearts gained no benefit and failed to activate mTORC1 with IPC. IR metabolism
  was altered in TSC2SA, with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and
  glycolytic capacity (stressed/maximal extracellular acidification) after myocyte
  hypoxia-reperfusion. In whole heart, lactate increased and long-chain acylcarnitine
  levels declined during ischemia. The relative IR protection in TSC2SA was lost by
  lowering glucose in the perfusate by 36%. Adding fatty acid (palmitate) compensated
  for reduced glucose in wild type and TSC2SE but not TSC2SA which had the worst post-IR
  function under these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: TSC2-S1365 phosphorylation status
  regulates myocardial substrate utilization, and its decline activates mTORC1 biasing
  metabolism away from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis to confer protection against
  IR. This pathway is also engaged and reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation required
  for effective IPC. Graphic Abstract: A graphic abstract is available for this article.'
