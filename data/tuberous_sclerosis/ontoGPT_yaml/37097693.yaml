input_text: 'A Phase I/II Investigation of Safety and Efficacy of Nivolumab and nab-Sirolimus
  in Patients With a Variety of Tumors With Genetic Mutations in the mTOR Pathway.
  BACKGROUND/AIM: Advanced sarcoma has a poor prognosis. Dysregulation of the mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) occurs in various types of cancer. We aimed to determine
  the safety and efficacy of mTOR inhibitor nab-sirolimus when combined with the immune
  checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously treated patients
  >=18 years with confirmed diagnosis of advanced sarcoma or tumor with mutations
  in the mTOR pathway were treated with 3 mg/kg nivolumab intravenously every 3 weeks;
  escalating doses of nab-sirolimus at 56, 75 or 100 mg/m2 were administered intravenously
  on days 8 and 15 beginning in cycle 2. The primary aim was to determine the maximum-tolerated
  dose; we also determined disease control, objective response, progression-free survival,
  overall survival, and correlation between response using Immune-related Response
  Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (irRECIST) versus RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: The
  maximum-tolerated dose was 100 mg/m2 There were two patients with partial response,
  12 with stable disease and 11 with progressive disease. Median progression-free
  and overall survival were 12 and 47 weeks, respectively. The best responders (partial
  responses) were patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with loss of
  phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), tuberous sclerosis
  complex 2 (TSC2) mutation and estrogen receptor-positive leiomyosarcoma. Treatment-related
  adverse events of grade 3 or more included thrombocytopenia, oral mucositis, rash,
  hyperlipidemia and increased serum alanine aminotransferase. CONCLUSION: The data
  indicate that (i) treatment with nivolumab plus nab-sirolimus is safe with no unexpected
  adverse events; (ii) treatment outcome parameters were not improved by combining
  nivolumab with nab-sirolimus; and (iii) best responders were patients with undifferentiated
  pleomorphic sarcoma with PTEN loss and TSC2 mutation and estrogen receptor-positive
  leiomyosarcoma. Future direction in sarcoma research with nab-sirolimus will be
  biomarker-based (TSC1/2/mTOR, tumor mutational burden/mismatch repair deficiency
  etc.).'
