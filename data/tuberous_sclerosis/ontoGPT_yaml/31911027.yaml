input_text: 'Compliance With Standard Therapies and Remission Rates After Implementation
  of an Infantile Spasms Management Guideline. BACKGROUND: We implemented an infantile
  spasms management guideline recommending standard therapies and, early start of
  next treatment. After six years, we determined (1) our compliance with standard
  therapies, (2) time to next treatment, and (3) rate of initial and three-month electroclinical
  remission with first, second, and third treatments. METHODS: This is a retrospective
  record review of newly diagnosed spasms from September 2012 to September 2018, with
  the onset age of two months to two years. RESULTS: Standard therapies (hormone or
  vigabatrin) were the first treatments in 114 of 115 consecutive patients. The second
  and third treatments were started within 14 days of failed treatment in only 21%
  and 24%, respectively. Remission with the first and second treatments was similar
  (41% and 40%). Remission was lower for the third treatment (15%), although higher
  if standard therapy was used (36%). Initial and three-month remission by the first
  treatment was significantly higher for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 66% and
  79%, respectively) and prednisolone (53% and 83%, respectively) than for vigabatrin
  (19% and 40%, respectively). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics
  or rates of remission between ACTH and prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Although we achieved
  excellent compliance with standard therapies as initial treatment, a next treatment
  often started after two weeks. Given the superiority of hormone therapies over vigabatrin
  and standard therapies over nonstandard therapies, as well as the potentially negative
  impact of delays in effective treatment, future interventions need to focus on increasing
  the use of hormone over vigabatrin (for patients without tuberous sclerosis complex),
  use of standard therapies as second and third treatments, and reducing delays to
  next treatment.'
