input_text: "Cluster of differentiation 8 and programmed cell death ligand 1 expression
  in triple-negative breast cancer combined with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
  disease and tuberous sclerosis complex: a case report. BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant
  polycystic kidney disease is defined as an inherited disorder characterized by renal
  cyst formation due to mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene, whereas tuberous sclerosis
  complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome caused by mutation or deletion
  of the TSC2 gene. A TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, which is caused by a chromosomal
  mutation that disrupts both the TSC2 and PKD1 genes, has been identified in patients
  with tuberous sclerosis complex and severe early-onset autosomal dominant polycystic
  kidney disease. The tumor tissue of patients with breast cancer with contiguous
  gene syndrome has a high mutation burden and produces several neoantigens. A diffuse
  positive immunohistochemistry staining for cluster of differentiation 8+ in the
  T cells of breast cancer tissue is consistent with neoantigen production due to
  high mutation burden. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Japanese woman who had been
  undergoing dialysis for 23 years because of end-stage renal failure secondary to
  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was diagnosed as having triple-negative
  breast cancer and underwent mastectomy in 2015. She had a history of epilepsy and
  skin hamartoma. Her grandmother, mother, two aunts, four cousins, and one brother
  were also on dialysis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Her brother
  had epilepsy and a brain nodule. Another brother had a syndrome of kidney failure,
  intellectual disability, and diabetes mellitus, which seemed to be caused by mutation
  in the CREBBP gene. Immunohistochemistry of our patient's breast tissue showed cluster
  of differentiation 8 and programmed cell death ligand 1 positivity. CONCLUSIONS:
  Programmed cell death ligand 1 checkpoint therapy may be effective for recurrence
  of triple-negative breast cancer in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic
  kidney disease and tuberous sclerosis complex."
