  4-(Difluoromethyl)-5-(4-((3R,5S)-3,5-dimethylmorpholino)-6-((R)-3-methylmorpholino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)pyridin-2-amine
  (PQR626), a Potent, Orally Available, and Brain-Penetrant mTOR Inhibitor for the
  Treatment of Neurological Disorders. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  pathway is hyperactivated in cancer and neurological disorders. Rapalogs and mTOR
  kinase inhibitors (TORKi) have recently been applied to alleviate epileptic seizures
  in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Herein, we describe a pharmacophore exploration
  to identify a highly potent, selective, brain penetrant TORKi. An extensive investigation
  of the morpholine ring engaging the mTOR solvent exposed region led to the discovery
  of PQR626 (8). 8 displayed excellent brain penetration and was well-tolerated in
  mice. In mice with a conditionally inactivated Tsc1 gene in glia, 8 significantly
  reduced the loss of Tsc1-induced mortality at 50 mg/kg p.o. twice a day. 8 overcomes
  the metabolic liabilities of PQR620 (52), the first-in-class brain penetrant TORKi
  showing efficacy in a TSC mouse model. The improved stability in human hepatocytes,
  excellent brain penetration, and efficacy in Tsc1GFAPCKO mice qualify 8 as a potential
  therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neurological disorders.
