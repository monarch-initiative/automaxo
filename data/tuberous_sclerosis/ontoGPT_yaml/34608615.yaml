input_text: Precision Therapy for Epilepsy Related to Brain Malformations. Malformations
  of cortical development (MCDs) represent a range of neurodevelopmental disorders
  that are collectively common causes of developmental delay and epilepsy, especially
  refractory childhood epilepsy. Initial treatment with antiseizure medications is
  empiric, and consideration of surgery is the standard of care for eligible patients
  with medically refractory epilepsy. In the past decade, advances in next generation
  sequencing technologies have accelerated progress in understanding the genetic etiologies
  of MCDs, and precision therapies for focal MCDs are emerging. Notably, mutations
  that lead to abnormal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway,
  which provides critical control of cell growth and proliferation, have emerged as
  a common cause of malformations. These include tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC),
  hemimegalencephaly (HME), and some types of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). TSC
  currently represents the best example for the pathway from gene discovery to relatively
  safe and efficacious targeted therapy for epilepsy related to MCDs. Based on extensive
  pre-clinical and clinical data, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is currently approved
  for the treatment of focal refractory seizures in patients with TSC. Although clinical
  studies are just emerging for FCD and HME, we believe the next decade will bring
  significant advancements in precision therapies for epilepsy related to these and
  other MCDs.
