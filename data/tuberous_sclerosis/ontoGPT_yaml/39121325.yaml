input_text: 'Pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus and impact of concomitant antiseizure
  medications in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: A retrospective study of
  therapeutic drug monitoring data in Denmark and Norway. The mTOR-inhibitor everolimus
  is a precision drug with antiepileptogenic properties approved for treatment of
  epilepsy in persons with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in combination with other
  antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, the pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus
  is scarcely described, and the available information on pharmacokinetic interactions
  is scarce. The purpose of this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic variability
  of everolimus in patients with TSC, and the impact of age, sex and comedication.
  In this retrospective observational study we used anonymized data from medical records
  of patients with TSC using everolimus in Norway and Denmark, 2012 to 2020. Long-term
  therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) identified inter-patient and intra-patient variability.
  The study included 59 patients, (36 females (61%)), median age 22 (range 3-59 years).
  Polytherapy was used in 50 patients (85%). The most frequently used ASMs were lamotrigine
  (n = 21), valproate (n = 17), and levetiracetam (n = 13). Blood concentrations of
  everolimus were measured in all patients. Pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus
  between patients was extensive, as demonstrated by a 24-fold variability from minimum-maximum
  concentration/dose (C/D)-ratios. The coefficient of variation (CV) for intra-patient
  (n = 59) and inter-patient variability (n = 47, >=3 measurements) was 40% and 43%,
  respectively. The C/D-ratio of everolimus was 50% lower in 13 patients (22%) using
  enzyme-inducing ASMs compared to the 30 patients who did not (0.7 vs 1.4 ng/mL mg,
  P < .05). Age and sex were not significantly associated with changes in C/D-ratios
  of everolimus. Long-term TDM identified extensive variability in concentrations
  over time for everolimus both within and between patients, where comedication with
  enzyme-inducing ASMs was an important contributing factor. The findings suggest
  a need for TDM in patients with TSC treated with everolimus.'
