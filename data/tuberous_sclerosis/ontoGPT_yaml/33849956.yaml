input_text: "Association of maternal body mass index with intellectual disability
  risk. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to investigate the association between maternal
  body mass index (BMI) in early pregnancy and children's intellectual disability
  (ID) risk in the absence of chromosomal disorders, neurofibromatosis and tuberous
  sclerosis, taking adverse birth outcomes, maternal hypertension/diabetes and maternal
  socioeconomic status into consideration. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of
  singletons without common genetic defects born in Sweden during 1992-2006, and followed
  them from birth until 31 December 2014 (n=1 186 836). Cox proportional hazards models
  were used to analyse the association between maternal BMI in early pregnancy and
  the risk of offspring's ID. RESULTS: The risk of ID was higher in children born
  to mothers who were underweight (HR=1.21, 95% CI=1.07 to 1.36), overweight (HR=1.28,
  95% CI=1.21 to 1.34) or had obesity class I (HR=1.63, 95% CI=1.53 to 1.74), obesity
  class II (HR=2.08, 95% CI=1.88 to 2.30) and obesity class III (HR=2.31, 95% CI=1.46
  to 3.65) than in children born to normal weight mothers. Results remained consistent
  after excluding children with adverse birth outcome or born to mothers with gestational
  hypertension/diabetes. Analysis stratified by maternal education and annual household
  income showed that the association between maternal underweight and children's ID
  risk was attenuated among children of mothers with tertiary education or with high
  income. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that maternal underweight or overweight/obesity
  in early pregnancy was associated with the development of ID in their offspring.
  This association was independent of the effect of adverse birth outcomes and maternal
  hypertension/diabetes. High socioeconomic status may attenuate the risk of ID among
  children of underweight mothers. This study highlights the importance of improving
  health education before conception to reduce children's ID risk."
