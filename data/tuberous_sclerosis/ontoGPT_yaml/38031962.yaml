  with tuberous sclerosis complex: A 1206 visits retrospective cohort study. AIMS:
  To evaluate the benefits of telemedicine in children with tuberous sclerosis complex
  during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted,
  comparing telemedicine and in-person visits within the timeframe spanning from June
  1, 2021, to June 1, 2022. Disparities in demographics, emergency visits, hospitalizations,
  adverse effects (AEs) associated with sirolimus, and the incidence of drug-refractory
  epilepsy (DRE) between telehealth and in-person care were assessed. Additionally,
  distinctions between audio and video telehealth, as well as varying frequencies
  of telehealth encounters, were investigated and reported as odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS:
  A total of 378 patients with 1206 visits were included, of which 137 were telemedicine
  patients and 241 were in-person patients. The median age was 5.0 years (IQR 2.8-10.0
  years). There were 197 males (52.12%), 691 in-person visits (57.30%), and 515 telemedicine
  visits (42.70%). Children under 12 years old, those farther away from the center,
  mothers with more than 12 years of education, and children treated with sirolimus
  were more likely to visit via telemedicine. Telehealth was associated with significantly
  fewer emergency visits, hospitalizations, AEs of sirolimus, and DRE. With 10 or
  more visits, the incidence of emergency visits, hospitalization, and DRE was significantly
  reduced. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine visits are almost as close in number as in-person
  visits. Younger patients, patients in remote areas, and mothers with higher education
  levels are more willing to complete telemedicine visits. Telemedicine visits were
  associated with a significantly lower number of emergency visits, hospitalizations,
  and AEs of sirolimus. Patients with more than 10 visits per year seemed to have
  better clinical outcomes.'
