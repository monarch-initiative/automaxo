input_text: 'Radiotherapy for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma: time to challenge
  a historical ban? A case report and review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Subependymal
  giant cell astrocytoma is a benign brain tumor that occurs in patients with tuberous
  sclerosis complex. Surgical removal is the traditional treatment, and expert opinion
  is strongly against the use of radiotherapy. Recently, success has been reported
  with the mTor inhibitor everolimus in reducing tumor volume, but regrowth has been
  observed after dose reduction or cessation. CASE REPORT: We present the case of
  a 40-year-old Asian female patient treated successfully for growing bilateral subependymal
  giant cell astrocytoma with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy before everolimus
  became available. After a follow-up of 8 years, everolimus was administered for
  renal angiomyolipoma and the patient was followed up until 13 years after radiotherapy.
  Successive magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an 80% volume reduction after
  radiotherapy that increased to 90% with everolimus. A review of the literature was
  done leveraging Medline via PubMed, and we assembled a database of 1298 article
  references and 780 full-text articles in search of evidence for contraindicating
  radiotherapy in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Varying results of single-fraction
  radiosurgery were described in a total of 13 cases. Only in two published cases
  was the radiation dose of fractionated radiotherapy mentioned. One single publication
  mentions an induced secondary brain tumor 8 years after whole-brain radiotherapy.
  CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of contraindication and exclusion of fractionated
  radiotherapy in treating subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Our experience demonstrates
  that subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, as other benign intracranial tumors, responds
  slowly but progressively to radiotherapy and suggests that fractionated stereotactic
  radiotherapy holds promise to consolidate responses obtained with mTor inhibitors
  avoiding regrowth after cessation.'
