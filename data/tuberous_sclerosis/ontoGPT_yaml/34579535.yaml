input_text: Precision Medicine Approaches for Infantile-Onset Developmental and Epileptic
  Encephalopathies. Epilepsy is an etiologically heterogeneous condition; however,
  genetic factors are thought to play a role in most patients. For those with infantile-onset
  developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a genetic diagnosis is now obtained
  in more than 50% of patients. There is considerable motivation to utilize these
  molecular diagnostic data to help guide treatment, as children with DEEs often have
  drug-resistant seizures as well as developmental impairment related to cerebral
  epileptiform activity. Precision medicine approaches have the potential to dramatically
  improve the quality of life for these children and their families. At present, treatment
  can be targeted for patients with diagnoses in many genetic causes of infantile-onset
  DEE, including genes encoding sodium or potassium channel subunits, tuberous sclerosis,
  and congenital metabolic diseases. Precision medicine may refer to more intelligent
  choices of conventional antiseizure medications, repurposed agents previously used
  for other indications, novel compounds, enzyme replacement, or gene therapy approaches.
