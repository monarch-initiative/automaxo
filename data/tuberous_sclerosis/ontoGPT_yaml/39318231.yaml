input_text: 'Severe hypertension in tuberous sclerosis complex caused by renal artery
  stenosis: A case report. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant
  neurocutaneous disease. Arterial hypertension is one of its uncommon complications,
  which is supposed to be caused by renal cysts or angiomyolipomas. Few studies have
  been reported in the literature on renal artery stenosis (RAS) as the cause of hypertension
  in TSC. Hence, we reported a boy who presented with uncontrolled hypertension under
  five anti-hypertension drugs and was diagnosed with TSC complicated with left RAS.
  His high blood pressure was relieved by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty
  (PTRA). In one and a half years follow-up, his blood pressure was normal whilst
  he took four anti-hypertensive drugs. In conclusion, children with TCS complicated
  with hypertension should be carefully screened for RAS, which might be relieved
  by percutaneous balloon dilatation.'
