input_text: 'Epilepsy Surgery in Young Children With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: A
  Novel Hybrid Multimodal Surgical Approach. BACKGROUND: Surgery has become integral
  in treating children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related drug-resistant
  epilepsy (DRE). OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes of a multimodal diagnostic and therapeutic
  approach comprising invasive intracranial monitoring and surgical treatment and
  compare the complementary techniques of open resection and magnetic resonance-guided
  laser interstitial thermal therapy. METHODS: Clinical and radiographic data were
  prospectively collected for pediatric patients undergoing surgical evaluation for
  TSC-related DRE at our tertiary academic hospital. Seizure freedom, developmental
  improvement, and Engel class were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20 females)
  underwent treatment in January 2016 to April 2019. Thirty-five underwent phase II
  invasive monitoring with intracranial electrodes: 24 stereoencephalography, 9 craniotomy
  for grid/electrode placement, and 2 grids + stereoencephalography. With the multimodal
  approach, 33/38 patients (87%) achieved >50% seizure freedom of the targeted seizure
  type after initial treatment; 6/9 requiring secondary treatment and 2/2 requiring
  a third treatment achieved >50% freedom. The median Engel class was II at last follow-up
  (1.65 years), and 55% of patients were Engel class I/II. The mean age was lower
  for children undergoing open resection (2.4 vs 4.9 years, P = .04). Rates of >50%
  reduction in seizures (86% open resection vs 88% laser interstitial thermal therapy)
  and developmental improvement (86% open resection vs 83% magnetic resonance-guided
  laser interstitial thermal therapy) were similar. CONCLUSION: This hybrid approach
  of using both open surgical and minimally invasive techniques is safe and effective
  in treating DRE secondary to TSC. Clinical trials focused on treatment method with
  longer follow-up are needed to determine the optimal candidates for each approach
  and compare the treatment modalities more effectively.'
