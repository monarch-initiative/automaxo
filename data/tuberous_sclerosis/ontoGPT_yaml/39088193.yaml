input_text: 'Long-term efficacy and safety of cannabidiol in patients with tuberous
  sclerosis complex: 3-year results from the cannabidiol expanded access program.
  OBJECTIVE: The cannabidiol (CBD) Expanded Access Program provided compassionate
  access to CBD for patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy, including tuberous
  sclerosis complex (TSC), at 35 US epilepsy centers. Here, we present the long-term
  efficacy and safety outcomes for add-on CBD treatment in patients with TSC. METHODS:
  Patients received plant-derived, highly purified CBD (Epidiolex  100 mg/mL, oral
  solution), increasing from 2 to 10 mg/kg/d to tolerance or maximum of 25-50 mg/kg/d.
  Efficacy endpoints were percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive,
  focal, and total seizure frequency and >= 50%, >=75%, and 100% responder rates across
  12-week visit windows through 144 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) are reported through
  233 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with confirmed TSC were included. Mean
  age was 12.4 years (range, 1.8-31.2), and patients were receiving a median of 3
  (range, 1-7) antiseizure medications (ASMs) at baseline. Median CBD dose was 25-28
  mg/kg/d for 36 weeks and then 20-50 mg/kg/d through 228 weeks. Dose reduction from
  baseline occurred for most ASMs, except topiramate. Median reduction in the frequency
  of convulsive, focal, and total seizures was 44%-81%, 51%-87%, and 44%-87%, respectively,
  through 144 weeks. Responder rates (>=50%, >=75%, and 100% reduction) were 43%-71%,
  14%-58%, and 0%-25% for convulsive seizures; 52%-75%, 35%-60%, and 7%-32% for focal
  seizures; and 46%-79%, 26%-65%, and 0%-13% for total seizures. A total of 94% of
  patients experienced >=1 AE; 47% had serious AEs, considered treatment unrelated
  by the investigator. Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 71% of patients.
  The most frequently reported TRAEs were somnolence, diarrhea, and ataxia. Two patients
  experienced AEs leading to discontinuation. There were no deaths. SIGNIFICANCE:
  Long-term add-on CBD use was associated with reduced seizure frequency through 144
  weeks. The safety profile was consistent with previous reports. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY:
  In this study, we evaluated efficacy and safety of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment in
  patients with tuberous sclerosis complex receiving CBD in addition to other antiseizure
  treatments in an Expanded Access Program. After starting CBD, 46%-79% of patients
  had at least 50% reduction and 26%-65% had at least 75% reduction in the number
  of seizures per month; up to 13% had no seizures through 144 weeks. Safety results
  were similar to prior studies; sleepiness and diarrhea were common treatment-related
  side effects. These results show that long-term CBD treatment was associated with
  fewer seizures and mild/moderate side effects.'
