input_text: 'Melatonin regulates the ovarian function and enhances follicle growth
  in aging laying hens via activating the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. The
  signal pathway of target of rapamycin (TOR) plays an important role in regulating
  cell growth and proliferation, follicular development, and ovulation. Melatonin
  (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (MT) is involved in the regulation of many physiological
  functions in animals. Recent studies have shown that MT affects the number and the
  degree of maturation of follicles in the ovary, but there are few studies concerning
  its mechanism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism
  of TOR signal pathway in the regulation of ovarian function by MT in aging laying
  hens. In the present study, a total of 60 hens (70-week-old) were randomly divided
  into 2 groups: control group and melatonin group (M). Melatonin was administered
  intraperitoneally at a dose of 20 mg/kg/D for 28 D in the M group. The results showed
  that MT significantly increased the levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide
  dismutase and total antioxidant capacity (P < 0.01) as well as levels of immunoglobulin
  (IgA, IgG, and IgM) (P < 0.05) and the reproductive hormones estradiol and luteinizing
  hormone (P < 0.01) in the plasma and also increased the numbers of middle white
  follicles and small white follicles (P < 0.05) and decreased the level of reactive
  oxygen species in plasma (P < 0.01) in laying hens. There were higher expression
  levels in MT receptor A (P < 0.05), melatonin receptor B (P < 0.01), and tuberous
  sclerosis complex 2 (P < 0.01). Activation of TOR, 4E binding protein-l (4E-BP1),
  and ribosomal protein 6 kinase (P < 0.01) was found in the M. The levels of mTOR
  and p-mTOR protein were increased in the M (P < 0.05). The mTORC1-dependent 4E-BP1
  and p-4E-BP1 were increased in the M (P < 0.05). This study indicated that MT may
  enhance follicle growth by increasing levels of antioxidant enzymes and reproductive
  hormones and by activating the mTOR and downstream components in aging laying hens.'
