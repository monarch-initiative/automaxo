input_text: 'Living Donor Preemptive Kidney Transplantation in Tuberous Sclerosis
  Complex Patient and the Role of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Inhibitor: A Case
  Report. BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the preferred treatment for end-stage
  kidney disease (ESKD), while preemptive (PE) living donor (LD) KT is associated
  with better survival, quality of life, and lower costs. Tuberous sclerosis complex
  (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder. Renal involvement (multiple bilateral angiomyolipoma
  [AMLs], cysts, renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) is related to significant morbidity,
  including ESKD and KT. Nephrectomy in TSC patients before KT is controversial. Affected
  kidneys carry a risk of hemorrhage or malignancy, while AMLs may be fat-poor and
  are often hardly distinguishable from RCC in magnetic resonance (MR)/computed tomography.
  On the other hand nephrectomy impedes PE KT. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors
  (mTORi) have proved efficacy in many TSC complications, including AMLs, fat-poor
  AMLs, TSC-related RCC, and immunosuppressive (IS) treatment. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old
  female TSC patient was referred for evaluation to the TSC reference center. Her
  family history was negative for TSC. A clinical evaluation revealed multisystem
  TSC manifestation (skin, brain, lungs, kidneys). MR disclosed indeterminate fat-poor
  renal lesions, possibly AMLs, but RCC could not be excluded. A comparison with previous
  MR did not show any significant progression. Due to ESKD, the patient was qualified
  for PE LD (mother) KT. mTORi, sirolimus, was used in IS. Creatinine at discharge
  was 2.1 mg/dL. Sixteen months later, MR showed significant reduction in tumor size.
  Two years after KT, graft function remained stable (creatinine 1.98 mg/dL). No complications
  related to renal lesions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: mTORi are the therapy of choice
  in TSC patients after KT, achieving IS effect and improvement in TSC manifestations
  while avoiding nephrectomy and management of patients with indeterminate renal lesions,
  especially in the case of PE KT.'
