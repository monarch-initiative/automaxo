input_text: 'Vagus nerve stimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy induced by tuberous
  sclerosis complex. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the dynamic and long-term
  efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy
  (DRE) induced by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In addition, the impact of VNS
  on cognition and emotion after a one-year follow-up was evaluated. METHODS: A total
  of 17 patients diagnosed with DRE induced by TSC were retrospectively recruited
  between 2008 and 2019. Dynamic changes in seizure frequency were observed in the
  responders (>=50% reduction of seizure frequency at last follow-up) and non-responders.
  Clinical characteristics and seizure outcomes were comprehensively analyzed to determine
  factors associated with seizure outcomes. The Wechsler intelligence scale was applied
  in a subgroup of six pediatric patients, whereas the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)
  and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were assessed in a subgroup of nine patients
  to determine the impact of VNS therapy on cognitive performance and emotional state.
  RESULTS: The follow-up duration for the 17 patients who underwent VNS treatment
  ranged from 0.5 to 10 years (mean +- SD: 4.1 +- 3.2 years). Monthly seizures decreased
  significantly from three months to four years post-treatment (p < 0.05). At the
  last follow-up, 70.6% of the patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in seizure
  frequency, and three patients were completely seizure free. Comparatively, non-responder
  patients experienced deterioration of seizure frequency after the first year. Notably,
  after one-year follow-up the mean standard score of full-scale intelligence quotient
  increased from 67.33 to 69.5 (p = 0.078) while the mean, standard score of SDS decreased
  from 49.22 to 45.67 (p = 0.003) compared to preoperative neuropsychological evaluation
  results. CONCLUSION: VNS is a safe and effective treatment for patients with DRE
  caused by TSC. Although early outcomes were encouraging, a follow-up of at least
  one-year was required to predict long-term outcomes in patients receiving VNS treatment.
  Moreover, VNS may improve depressive mood in patients with DRE caused by TSC. Further
  investigations are needed to validate the present results.'
