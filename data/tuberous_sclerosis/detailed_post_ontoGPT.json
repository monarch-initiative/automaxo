TSC1 and TSC2 pathogenic variants lead to hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which disrupts cellular growth and differentiation. Epilepsy, affecting 85-90% of individuals with TSC, often presents within the first year of life and is commonly resistant to conventional therapies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and current treatment strategies for TSC-associated epilepsy, including pharmacological approaches such as vigabatrin, cannabidiol, and mTOR inhibitors, as well as non-pharmacological interventions such as ketogenic diet and epilepsy surgery. Preventive strategies, highlighted by robust trials, delay seizure onset and reduce its severity but have a limited impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Challenges include the heterogeneity of cortical tubers, suboptimal seizure control with existing therapies, and underutilization of neuropsychiatric care for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Advances in biomarkers, precision medicine, and surgical techniques have paved the way for personalized treatment approaches. Future research providing earlier detection strategies and integrating therapies targeting both the neurological and behavioral dimensions of TSC is ongoing. By addressing these needs, clinicians and researchers can enhance the quality of life and developmental outcomes of individuals with TSC.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by mutations of either of 2 genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Renal manifestations include angiomyolipomas (AMLs), multiple cysts, and renal cell carcinoma. AMLs increase bleeding tendency and the risk of renal insufficiency which end-stage develops in 1% of affected patients. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman suffering from TSC since early childhood has developed multiple complications associated with this disease. The patient was diagnosed with brain tumor-giant cell astrocytoma-which was removed in 1992. In 2006, right nephrectomy was performed due to the unsuccessful right renal artery embolization after the massive hemorrhage into the AML. Moreover, the right idiopathic pneumothorax occurred twice. Therefore, the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pleurodesis were conducted (2006, 2013). The patient is intellectually disabled and unable to make decisions on her own. Her legal guardians (parents) make all decisions associated with her treatment. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures demanding cooperation were conducted under anesthesia. Because of end-stage renal failure, the patient required the renal replacement therapy (RRT). Preemptive kidney transplantation (KTx) was the best solution for this patient. Procedures such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were infeasible to perform due to the intellectual disability that inhibits essential cooperation. During KTx qualification tests, the expanding AML with risk of hemorrhage was noticed. The patient was qualified for simultaneous left nephrectomy and KTx from the living donor (her father). The surgery was performed on the 2nd of June 2020. The patient is looked after by her parents, stays in good general condition. The patient's creatinine level is maintained at 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: Patients with significant intellectual disability that prevents maintaining conscious cooperation who require RRT must have individually adjusted therapy. In the case of the presented patient, it was decided to perform the preemptive kidney transplantation from her determined father.",

These renal tumors are benign by nature but locally invasive and carry a risk for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). The frequency of subsequent renal transplantation in this population is largely uncharacterized, although single-center data suggests that 5%-15% of adult TSC patients are kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data. We included candidates waitlisted between 1987 and 2020 for a first kidney transplant with TSC-associated kidney failure. We utilized descriptive statistics to characterize the frequency of first-time kidney transplant waitlisting and transplantation among persons with TSC and the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model to evaluate characteristics associated with progression from waitlist. RESULTS: We identified 200 TSC-associated kidney failure patients within the waitlist cohort. Of these, 12 were pediatric patients. Two-thirds (N = 134) of waitlisted persons were female. One hundred forty patients received a transplant with a median waitlist time of 2 years. Younger age at waitlisting was associated with a greater probability of progressing to transplant (HR 0.98 [95% CI: 0.96-0.99]). 91.8% of kidney transplant recipients survived 1-year post-transplant with a functioning allograft. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with TSC who are waitlisted for a kidney transplant progress onto transplantation with excellent 1-year post transplant patient and allograft survival.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) often present with refractory epilepsy and may be undergoing treatment with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to control seizures. Surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary to monitor for the renal angiomyolipomas associated with TSC; however, MRI of the abdomen is not approved for patients withVNS therapy. We have many TSC patients with refractory epilelpsy who benefitted from VNS therapy, so we developed an MRI protocol that allows MRI of the abdomen to be performed in these patients to permit safe imaging of their kidneys. Here we report our results using this protocol. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review for all TSC patients seen from 01/01/1997 to 10/01/2022 at a single center to determine VNS implantation status. Patients with VNS implants and abdomen imaging performed according to the protocol for kidney surveillance were included. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with 48 total MRIs of the abdomen were found: 34 (71 %) scans were conducted under sedation and 14 (29 %) without sedation. None of the patients reported any adverse effects (pain or discomfort). No instances of VNS dysfunction were noted when re-interrogating the device immediately after completion of the imaging studies or at later neurology follow-up appointments. All MRI scans were of good quality for interpretation. CONCLUSION: Abdominal MRIs performed in typical VNS exclusion zones were not associated with adverse events or VNS dysfunction. We believe this protocol is safe and permits the best method for monitoring renal disease in TSC patients with VNS.",

METHODS: We evaluated patients with ES from the CDKL5 Centers of Excellence and the National Infantile Spasms Consortium (NISC), with onset from 2 months to 2 years, treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), oral corticosteroids, vigabatrin, and/or the ketogenic diet. We excluded children with tuberous sclerosis complex, trisomy 21, or unknown etiology with normal development because of known differential treatment responses. We compared the two cohorts for time to treatment and ES remission at 14 days and 3 months. RESULTS: We evaluated 59 individuals with CDD (79% female, median ES onset 6 months) and 232 individuals from the NISC database (46% female, median onset 7 months). In the CDD cohort, seizures prior to ES were common (88%), and hypsarrhythmia and its variants were present at ES onset in 34%. Initial treatment with ACTH, oral corticosteroids, or vigabatrin started within 1 month of ES onset in 27 of 59 (46%) of the CDD cohort and 182 of 232 (78%) of the NISC cohort (p < .0001). Fourteen-day clinical remission of ES was lower for the CDD group (26%, 7/27) than for the NISC cohort (58%, 106/182, p = .0002). Sustained ES remission at 3 months occurred in 1 of 27 (4%) of CDD patients vs 96 of 182 (53%) of the NISC cohort (p < .0001). Comparable results were observed with longer lead time (>=1 month) or prior treatment. Ketogenic diet, used within 3 months of ES onset, resulted in ES remission at 1 month, sustained at 3 months, in at least 2 of 13 (15%) individuals with CDD. SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to the broad group of infants with ES, children with ES in the setting of CDD often experience longer lead time to treatment and respond poorly to standard treatments. Development of alternative treatments for ES in CDD is needed.",

                    "abstract": "Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign tumor of the kidney. It consists of blood vessels, smooth muscle and fat components in varying proportions. AML is divided into the sporadic type and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated type. TSC-associated AML develops at a younger age and tends to exhibit a much faster growth rate over time than sporadic AML. AMLs are classified as classic AML, fat-poor AML and epithelioid AML. Epithelioid AML, though rare, shows aggressive behavior leading to distant metastasis and mortality. TSC-associated AML is more likely to have an epithelioid component than sporadic AML. Active surveillance is the suggested management for small AML. Clinical intervention is mainly indicated when there is a substantial risk of rupture. Minimally invasive therapies, including partial nephrectomy, transcatheter arterial embolization, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor treatment are employed for patients who require treatment. An updated algorithm for the management of AML is herein described. According to this algorithm, treatment intervention is recommended for TSC-associated AML >3 cm, even in asymptomatic cases. In cases with asymptomatic sporadic AML >4 cm in size or with an intra-tumoral aneurysm of >5 mm, treatment, including transcatheter arterial embolization or partial nephrectomy, is advised. The major complication of AML is intra-tumoral or retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to rupture that may be serious and life threatening. Thus, correct diagnosis, proper observation, and appropriate treatment are very important in the management of renal AML.",

Here, we present the long-term efficacy and safety outcomes for add-on CBD treatment in patients with TSC. METHODS: Patients received plant-derived, highly purified CBD (Epidiolex  100 mg/mL, oral solution), increasing from 2 to 10 mg/kg/d to tolerance or maximum of 25-50 mg/kg/d. Efficacy endpoints were percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive, focal, and total seizure frequency and >= 50%, >=75%, and 100% responder rates across 12-week visit windows through 144 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) are reported through 233 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with confirmed TSC were included. Mean age was 12.4 years (range, 1.8-31.2), and patients were receiving a median of 3 (range, 1-7) antiseizure medications (ASMs) at baseline. Median CBD dose was 25-28 mg/kg/d for 36 weeks and then 20-50 mg/kg/d through 228 weeks. Dose reduction from baseline occurred for most ASMs, except topiramate.

A total of 94% of patients experienced >=1 AE; 47% had serious AEs, considered treatment unrelated by the investigator. Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 71% of patients. The most frequently reported TRAEs were somnolence, diarrhea, and ataxia. Two patients experienced AEs leading to discontinuation. There were no deaths.

Safety results were similar to prior studies; sleepiness and diarrhea were common treatment-related side effects. These results show that long-term CBD treatment was associated with fewer seizures and mild/moderate side effects.",

Cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures in Dravet/Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. We report on the efficacy and safety of CBD for the treatment of DRE in patients with genetically proven GPI-AD. Patients and Methods: Patients received add-on treatment with purified GW-pharma CBD (Epidyolex ). Efficacy endpoints were the percentage of patients with >=50% (responders) or >25<50% (partial responders) reduction in monthly seizures from baseline and at 12 (M12) months of follow-up. Safety was evaluated through adverse events (AEs) monitoring. Results: Six patients (5 males) were enrolled. The median age at seizures onset was 5 months and the syndromic diagnosis was early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathy in 4 patients and focal non-lesional epilepsy or GEFS+ in one patient each. Five out of six (83%) patients were responders at M12, while one was a partial responder. No severe AEs were reported. Mean prescribed CBD dose was 17.85 mg/kg/day and median treatment duration is currently 27 months. Conclusions: In summary, off-label treatment with CBD was effective and safe in patients with DRE due to GPI-ADs.",

Everolimus showed higher efficacy than placebo for seizures in the primary analysis of the EXIST-3 study. Here, we present the long-term outcomes of everolimus at the end of the postextension phase (PEP; data cutoff date: October 25, 2017). METHODS: After completion of the extension phase, patients were invited to continue everolimus in the PEP with everolimus (targeted trough concentration = 5-15 ng/ml, investigator-judged). Efficacy assessments included changes in seizure status during the PEP collected at 12-week intervals as parent/caregiver-reported data through a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 361 patients, 343 entered the extension phase and 249 entered the PEP. After 12 weeks in the PEP, 18.9% (46/244) of patients were seizure-free since the last visit of the extension phase and 64.8% (158/244) had a stable/improved seizure status. At 24 weeks, the corresponding percentages were 18.2% (42/231) and 64.5% (149/231). Among 244 patients, the response rate was 32.8% (80/244) during the 12-week maintenance period of the core phase and 63.9% (156/244) at the end of the extension phase. Of the 149 responders at the end of the extension phase, 70.5% were seizure-free or had stable/improved seizure status. Long-term efficacy data showed persistent responses were observed in 183 of 361 patients (50.7%); 63.9% of these patients had a response that lasted at least 48 weeks. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse events (>=2% incidence) reported throughout the study were pneumonia, status epilepticus, seizure, stomatitis, neutropenia, and gastroenteritis. Four patients died during the study.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are rare and debilitating forms of epilepsy, characterised by recurrent, severe, drug-resistant seizures and neurodevelopmental impairments. A non-euphoric, plant-derived, highly purified formulation of cannabidiol (CBD; Epidyolex , 100 mg/mL oral solution) is approved in the European Union and United Kingdom for use in patients aged >=2 years for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with LGS or DS in conjunction with clobazam (CLB), and for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex in patients aged >=2 years. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies who were treated with adjunctive CBD at six epilepsy centres in Germany. We analysed patient and treatment characteristics, seizure outcomes, treatment retention rates (i.e. the proportion of patients remaining on CBD treatment at time of assessment and retention as estimated by Kaplan-Meier [KM] analyses), physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), and adverse events (AEs) for up to 12 months. Here, we report data from this chart review for those patients with LGS or DS receiving adjunctive treatment with concomitant CBD and CLB. RESULTS: We identified 126 patients (102 LGS; 24 DS) receiving CBD and CLB, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 23.2 (15.8) years and a mean (SD) age of epilepsy onset of 3 (3.7) years. Patients had received a median (range) number of prior antiseizure medications (ASMs) of 6 (1-24) and concomitant ASMs of 3 (1-7). The median target CBD dose was 11.1 mg/kg/day in the total population (17.8, 15.8, and 9.7 mg/kg/day in the <6 years, 6-17 years, and >=18 years subgroups, respectively). The median time to the target dose was 21-22 days across age groups. The median concomitant CLB dose was 0.14 mg/kg/day (0.38, 0.22, and 0.10 mg/kg/day in the respective age groups). A >=50% reduction in total seizures was observed in 47.5% of patients at 3 months (35.7-52.6% across age groups) and 45.5% of patients at 12 months (44.4-46.2% across age groups). For generalised tonic-clonic seizures, a >=50% reduction was observed in 63.0% of patients at 3 months (60.7-66.7% across age groups) and 56.9% of patients at 12 months (50.0-75.0% across age groups). Median seizure days per month significantly decreased from 30 (range: 0.5-30) at baseline to 15 (range: 0-30) at the last follow-up (p <0.001). Overall, 89.7%, 80.7%, and 69.8% patients remained on CBD at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. KM estimated treatment retention was similar across paediatric and adult groups, according to earlier or later initiation (e.g. <=4 vs >=15 prior and concomitant ASMs) and according to the syndrome (LGS and DS). Physicians rated 66% of patients demonstrated a CGI-C improvement and 67% demonstrated a CGI-C behaviour improvement. The most common AEs (>=5%) were sedation (n = 30, 23.8%), diarrhoea (n = 13, 10.3%) and psycho-behavioural AEs (n = 9, 7.1%). CONCLUSION: In this chart review of patients with severe treatment refractory LGS or DS receiving adjunctive CBD and CLB concomitantly, a reduction in seizure frequency and sustained treatment retention was observed for up to 12 months across age groups in real-world clinical practice. CBD discontinuations exclusively due to AEs were infrequent and the AE profile was generally aligned to that previously observed.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1) controls metabolism and protein homeostasis and is activated following ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury and by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, studies vary as to whether this activation is beneficial or detrimental, and its influence on metabolism after IR is little reported. A limitation of prior investigations is their use of broad gain/loss of mTORC1 function, mostly applied before ischemic stress. This can be circumvented by regulating one serine (S1365) on TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex) to achieve bidirectional mTORC1 modulation but only with TCS2-regulated costimulation. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation protects the myocardium against IR and is required for IPC by amplifying mTORC1 activity to favor glycolytic metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with either S1365A (TSC2SA; phospho-null) or S1365E (TSC2SE; phosphomimetic) knockin mutations were studied ex vivo and in vivo. In response to IR, hearts from TSC2SA mice had amplified mTORC1 activation and improved heart function compared with wild-type and TSC2SE hearts. The magnitude of protection matched IPC. IPC requited less S1365 phosphorylation, as TSC2SE hearts gained no benefit and failed to activate mTORC1 with IPC. IR metabolism was altered in TSC2SA, with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and glycolytic capacity (stressed/maximal extracellular acidification) after myocyte hypoxia-reperfusion. In whole heart, lactate increased and long-chain acylcarnitine levels declined during ischemia. The relative IR protection in TSC2SA was lost by lowering glucose in the perfusate by 36%. Adding fatty acid (palmitate) compensated for reduced glucose in wild type and TSC2SE but not TSC2SA which had the worst post-IR function under these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: TSC2-S1365 phosphorylation status regulates myocardial substrate utilization, and its decline activates mTORC1 biasing metabolism away from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis to confer protection against IR. This pathway is also engaged and reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation required for effective IPC. Graphic Abstract: A graphic abstract is available for this article.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of TOR signal pathway in the regulation of ovarian function by MT in aging laying hens. In the present study, a total of 60 hens (70-week-old) were randomly divided into 2 groups: control group and melatonin group (M). Melatonin was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 20 mg/kg/D for 28 D in the M group.

There were higher expression levels in MT receptor A (P < 0.05), melatonin receptor B (P < 0.01), and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (P < 0.01). Activation of TOR, 4E binding protein-l (4E-BP1), and ribosomal protein 6 kinase (P < 0.01) was found in the M. The levels of mTOR and p-mTOR protein were increased in the M (P < 0.05). The mTORC1-dependent 4E-BP1 and p-4E-BP1 were increased in the M (P < 0.05).

For those with infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a genetic diagnosis is now obtained in more than 50% of patients. There is considerable motivation to utilize these molecular diagnostic data to help guide treatment, as children with DEEs often have drug-resistant seizures as well as developmental impairment related to cerebral epileptiform activity. Precision medicine approaches have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for these children and their families. At present, treatment can be targeted for patients with diagnoses in many genetic causes of infantile-onset DEE, including genes encoding sodium or potassium channel subunits, tuberous sclerosis, and congenital metabolic diseases. Precision medicine may refer to more intelligent choices of conventional antiseizure medications, repurposed agents previously used for other indications, novel compounds, enzyme replacement, or gene therapy approaches.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the treatment response of infantile-onset epileptic spasms (ES) in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) vs other etiologies. METHODS: We evaluated patients with ES from the CDKL5 Centers of Excellence and the National Infantile Spasms Consortium (NISC), with onset from 2 months to 2 years, treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), oral corticosteroids, vigabatrin, and/or the ketogenic diet. We excluded children with tuberous sclerosis complex, trisomy 21, or unknown etiology with normal development because of known differential treatment responses. We compared the two cohorts for time to treatment and ES remission at 14 days and 3 months. RESULTS: We evaluated 59 individuals with CDD (79% female, median ES onset 6 months) and 232 individuals from the NISC database (46% female, median onset 7 months). In the CDD cohort, seizures prior to ES were common (88%), and hypsarrhythmia and its variants were present at ES onset in 34%. Initial treatment with ACTH, oral corticosteroids, or vigabatrin started within 1 month of ES onset in 27 of 59 (46%) of the CDD cohort and 182 of 232 (78%) of the NISC cohort (p < .0001). Fourteen-day clinical remission of ES was lower for the CDD group (26%, 7/27) than for the NISC cohort (58%, 106/182, p = .0002). Sustained ES remission at 3 months occurred in 1 of 27 (4%) of CDD patients vs 96 of 182 (53%) of the NISC cohort (p < .0001). Comparable results were observed with longer lead time (>=1 month) or prior treatment. Ketogenic diet, used within 3 months of ES onset, resulted in ES remission at 1 month, sustained at 3 months, in at least 2 of 13 (15%) individuals with CDD. SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to the broad group of infants with ES, children with ES in the setting of CDD often experience longer lead time to treatment and respond poorly to standard treatments. Development of alternative treatments for ES in CDD is needed.",

Surgical removal is the traditional treatment, and expert opinion is strongly against the use of radiotherapy. Recently, success has been reported with the mTor inhibitor everolimus in reducing tumor volume, but regrowth has been observed after dose reduction or cessation. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 40-year-old Asian female patient treated successfully for growing bilateral subependymal giant cell astrocytoma with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy before everolimus became available. After a follow-up of 8 years, everolimus was administered for renal angiomyolipoma and the patient was followed up until 13 years after radiotherapy. Successive magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an 80% volume reduction after radiotherapy that increased to 90% with everolimus. A review of the literature was done leveraging Medline via PubMed, and we assembled a database of 1298 article references and 780 full-text articles in search of evidence for contraindicating radiotherapy in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Varying results of single-fraction radiosurgery were described in a total of 13 cases. Only in two published cases was the radiation dose of fractionated radiotherapy mentioned. One single publication mentions an induced secondary brain tumor 8 years after whole-brain radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of contraindication and exclusion of fractionated radiotherapy in treating subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Our experience demonstrates that subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, as other benign intracranial tumors, responds slowly but progressively to radiotherapy and suggests that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy holds promise to consolidate responses obtained with mTor inhibitors avoiding regrowth after cessation.",

We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of mTOR inhibitor nab-sirolimus when combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously treated patients >=18 years with confirmed diagnosis of advanced sarcoma or tumor with mutations in the mTOR pathway were treated with 3 mg/kg nivolumab intravenously every 3 weeks; escalating doses of nab-sirolimus at 56, 75 or 100 mg/m2 were administered intravenously on days 8 and 15 beginning in cycle 2. The primary aim was to determine the maximum-tolerated dose; we also determined disease control, objective response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and correlation between response using Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (irRECIST) versus RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: The maximum-tolerated dose was 100 mg/m2 There were two patients with partial response, 12 with stable disease and 11 with progressive disease. Median progression-free and overall survival were 12 and 47 weeks, respectively. The best responders (partial responses) were patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) mutation and estrogen receptor-positive leiomyosarcoma. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or more included thrombocytopenia, oral mucositis, rash, hyperlipidemia and increased serum alanine aminotransferase. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that (i) treatment with nivolumab plus nab-sirolimus is safe with no unexpected adverse events; (ii) treatment outcome parameters were not improved by combining nivolumab with nab-sirolimus; and (iii) best responders were patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with PTEN loss and TSC2 mutation and estrogen receptor-positive leiomyosarcoma.

This study aims at evaluating the presence and outcome of COVID-19 in a cohort of Italian patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and/or lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and at reviewing the possible effects of mTOR inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included 102 unselected individuals with a diagnosis of TSC and/or LAM assessed between January 1, 2020 and April 24, 2020 (29% children, 71% adults). Twenty-six patients were on mTOR inhibitors. Demographic data, TSC manifestations, presence, and outcomes in individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Health status and outcomes of all patients on mTOR inhibitors were assessed. One patient with severe TSC had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, was admitted to ICU, and died. Nine additional patients either met the definition of suspect case or presented with at least two of the most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All recovered fully. None of the patients treated with mTOR inhibitors for their underlying comorbidities was diagnosed with COVID-19, and those who showed suspicious respiratory symptoms recovered fully. This cohort study provides preliminary information on COVID-19 in people with TSC in Italy and suggests feasibility to systematically evaluate the role of mTOR inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1) controls metabolism and protein homeostasis and is activated following ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury and by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, studies vary as to whether this activation is beneficial or detrimental, and its influence on metabolism after IR is little reported. A limitation of prior investigations is their use of broad gain/loss of mTORC1 function, mostly applied before ischemic stress. This can be circumvented by regulating one serine (S1365) on TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex) to achieve bidirectional mTORC1 modulation but only with TCS2-regulated costimulation. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation protects the myocardium against IR and is required for IPC by amplifying mTORC1 activity to favor glycolytic metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with either S1365A (TSC2SA; phospho-null) or S1365E (TSC2SE; phosphomimetic) knockin mutations were studied ex vivo and in vivo. In response to IR, hearts from TSC2SA mice had amplified mTORC1 activation and improved heart function compared with wild-type and TSC2SE hearts. The magnitude of protection matched IPC. IPC requited less S1365 phosphorylation, as TSC2SE hearts gained no benefit and failed to activate mTORC1 with IPC. IR metabolism was altered in TSC2SA, with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and glycolytic capacity (stressed/maximal extracellular acidification) after myocyte hypoxia-reperfusion. In whole heart, lactate increased and long-chain acylcarnitine levels declined during ischemia. The relative IR protection in TSC2SA was lost by lowering glucose in the perfusate by 36%. Adding fatty acid (palmitate) compensated for reduced glucose in wild type and TSC2SE but not TSC2SA which had the worst post-IR function under these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: TSC2-S1365 phosphorylation status regulates myocardial substrate utilization, and its decline activates mTORC1 biasing metabolism away from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis to confer protection against IR. This pathway is also engaged and reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation required for effective IPC. Graphic Abstract: A graphic abstract is available for this article.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to reduce seizures among patients with refractory epilepsies of various etiologies in recent clinical trials and an expanded access program (EAP). Most studies report efficacy over short time periods (<1 year), with little published on longer term efficacy. Here, we investigate the efficacy of CBD for a treatment period of up to 60 months (median = 45.5 months). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patient-reported seizure logs and medical records for 54 subjects with refractory epilepsy who enrolled in the Massachusetts General Hospital's open-label EAP for CBD as a new treatment for epilepsy. We analyzed the effect of CBD on seizure frequencies and concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use at 1 year after starting treatment and the most recent study visit. RESULTS: Our results indicate that CBD maintains its efficacy for controlling seizures from Year 1 to the most recent study visit. The percentage of seizure responders remained similar at these time points (41.7%-42.6%), and the seizure response rate was also maintained (p = .12). Efficacy was also seen over a broad dose range, and up to 50 mg/kg/day. CBD was particularly effective for controlling seizures in the setting of tuberous sclerosis complex and for reducing epileptic spasms and absence seizures. Although CBD use did not lead to an overall decrease in concomitant AEDs, most subjects reduced the dose of at least one concomitant AED compared to baseline. CBD was generally well tolerated, with drowsiness and diarrhea as the primary adverse reactions. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates CBD does not lose its efficacy in controlling seizures over a treatment period of up to 60 months. Taken alongside other results on the efficacy and tolerability of CBD in the treatment of refractory epilepsies, our results provide evidence that CBD is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated AED for long-term use.",

Few studies have been reported in the literature on renal artery stenosis (RAS) as the cause of hypertension in TSC. Hence, we reported a boy who presented with uncontrolled hypertension under five anti-hypertension drugs and was diagnosed with TSC complicated with left RAS. His high blood pressure was relieved by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA). In one and a half years follow-up, his blood pressure was normal whilst he took four anti-hypertensive drugs.

Clinical studies on TSC, particularly surgical interventions, have achieved rapid and substantial progress. The TSC-Task Force Committee of the China Association Against Epilepsy (CAAE-TFTSC) was founded in 2012, and annual academic conferences on the surgical treatment of TSC-related epilepsy have been held since 2013. 'China experts' consensus on surgical treatment of TSC-related epilepsy' was published in 2019. This review focuses on surgical treatment, including resective surgery, neuromodulations, corpus callosotomy and mini-invasive ablations, as well as studies on phenotype, genotype and anti-seizure therapies of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, vigabatrin and ketogenic diet in patients with TSC-related DRE in China.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Keratinocyte carcinomas such as basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are a major burden affecting morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Best treatment includes frequent skin checks for early detection and surgery for high incidence of skin cancers. Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive drug which may reduce the burden of skin cancer but may be poorly tolerated when given orally. Topical sirolimus has been proven effective at reducing the burden of skin cancers in animal models, and its safety has long been established in children with tuberous sclerosis. A recent 12-week phase II trial of topical sirolimus suggested it was safe and effective at reducing the early signs of skin cancer in the absence of major side effects. The aim of the SiroSkin trial is to determine whether topical sirolimus can fill a major gap in current therapies by reducing the onset and number of new skin cancers thus reducing burden of disease and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Protocol for a multi-centred phase III, participant- and clinician assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial in SOTRs. A minimum 146 participants randomised 1:1 will be treated with 1% topical sirolimus versus placebo applied to the face on a regular basis for 24 weeks. Participation is 24 months in total-24 weeks of treatment and 18 months of follow-up. Outcomes include the number of keratinocyte carcinomas at 24 weeks of treatment compared to placebo and then at 12 and 24 months after initiation of treatment. Analysis will be as per protocol and intention to treat. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will inform management strategies for skin cancers in SOTRs and provide evidence for cost-effectiveness.

The disease involves the mTOR pathway and the cutaneous manifestation responds to topical treatment with sirolimus (SIR). However, there are no approved topical SIR products and extemporaneous formulations have been sub-optimal. The aims of this study were (i) to develop aqueous formulations of SIR loaded in polymeric micelles prepared using D-alpha-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and (ii) to use the cutaneous biodistribution method, in conjunction with a new statistical approach, to investigate the feasibility of SIR delivery to the viable epidermis. Optimized micelle solutions and hydrogels (0.2%) were developed and stable at 4  C for at least 6 and 3 months, respectively. Cutaneous delivery experiments (infinite and finite dose) using porcine skin demonstrated that both formulations increased SIR cutaneous bioavailability as compared to the control (ointment 0.2%). Moreover, studies with the micellar hydrogel 0.2% demonstrated SIR deposition in the viable epidermis with no transdermal permeation. These encouraging results confirmed that polymeric micelles enabled development of aqueous SIR formulations capable of targeted epidermal delivery. Furthermore, the cutaneous biodistribution provided a detailed insight into drug bioavailability in the different skin compartments that could complement/explain clinical observations of formulation efficacy.",

Statistical analysis was performed. Results: 40 patients with TSC received anticonvulsants. Neglected hygiene (PLI: 1.50+-0.96 vs 0.92+-0.72), gingival hyperplasia (50.0% vs.1.7%), gingivitis (80.7% vs. 53.4%), oral mucosal fibromas (10.0% vs. 0.0%), mucous membrane traumatic lesions (11.7% vs. 1.7%), enamel pits and hypoplasia of incisal borders (41.7% vs. 6.7%), tooth wear (35.0% vs. 11.7%) were more common in patients with TSC compared to controls; increased gingival hyperplasia was correlated with vigabatrin and levetiracetam treatment (r = 0.266 and 0.279, respectively), gingivitis was correlated with PLI (r= 0.635). Conclusions: Although gingival fibromas in TSC are independent of patient's age, young age, anticonvulsant therapy and local factors increase their severity. Enamel defects in TSC include pits, but also enamel loss on the incisal edges and tooth wear.",

                    "abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy, the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.",

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin changes, benign systemic or central nervous system tumors [subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)], mental retardation, or epilepsy. Hemorrhage into SEGA is exceedingly rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We evaluated a 21-year-old college student with migraine. Biopsy of numerous popular skin lesions on his nose revealed adenoma sebaceum. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed a subependymal nodule near the foramen of Monro suspected to be SEGA. Genetic analysis identified a tuberous sclerosis complex-1 germ line mutation. Surveillance imaging was recommended for the subependymal tumor. Fourteen months later, he presented with spontaneous hemorrhage into the tumor. Hematoma evacuation and tumor resection revealed SEGA. The college graduate was able to return to full-time work. CONCLUSIONS: We present an unusual cause of intracranial hemorrhage in a young adult. Thorough work-up and recognition of an underlying genetic predisposition can curtails diagnostic delay when life-threatening complications occur.",

While cannabidiol has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive treatment in Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), and epilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), its more global effectiveness in adult patients with DRE apart from these three specific contexts needs to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the epilepsy unit of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital. Patients initiating pharmaceutical cannabidiol treatment and followed for at least 1 year were included. Patients were categorized into \"authorized\" (LGS, DS, or TSC) and \"off-label\" groups. Cannabidiol effectiveness and tolerance were compared between groups, and characteristics of responders (patients with >50% reduction in seizure frequency) in the off-label group were examined. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients, followed by a median duration of 24 months, were included. A total of 35.2% of the patients were in the authorized group. No significant differences were observed in responder rates between groups (31.3% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.85) and retention rates at 1 year (75.0% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.97). Sleepiness was more commonly reported in the authorized group (50.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.01), with no other significant differences. Among off-label patients (n = 59), clobazam co-prescription was more prevalent in responders (71.4% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cannabidiol may benefit all adult patients with DRE, particularly those already receiving clobazam. Randomized controlled trials are warranted in off-label patients to validate these observational findings.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is highly prevalent in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus showed higher efficacy than placebo for seizures in the primary analysis of the EXIST-3 study. Here, we present the long-term outcomes of everolimus at the end of the postextension phase (PEP; data cutoff date: October 25, 2017). METHODS: After completion of the extension phase, patients were invited to continue everolimus in the PEP with everolimus (targeted trough concentration = 5-15 ng/ml, investigator-judged). Efficacy assessments included changes in seizure status during the PEP collected at 12-week intervals as parent/caregiver-reported data through a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 361 patients, 343 entered the extension phase and 249 entered the PEP. After 12 weeks in the PEP, 18.9% (46/244) of patients were seizure-free since the last visit of the extension phase and 64.8% (158/244) had a stable/improved seizure status. At 24 weeks, the corresponding percentages were 18.2% (42/231) and 64.5% (149/231). Among 244 patients, the response rate was 32.8% (80/244) during the 12-week maintenance period of the core phase and 63.9% (156/244) at the end of the extension phase. Of the 149 responders at the end of the extension phase, 70.5% were seizure-free or had stable/improved seizure status. Long-term efficacy data showed persistent responses were observed in 183 of 361 patients (50.7%); 63.9% of these patients had a response that lasted at least 48 weeks. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse events (>=2% incidence) reported throughout the study were pneumonia, status epilepticus, seizure, stomatitis, neutropenia, and gastroenteritis. Four patients died during the study. SIGNIFICANCE: The final analysis of EXIST-3 demonstrated the sustained efficacy of everolimus as adjunctive therapy in patients with TSC-associated treatment-refractory seizures, with a tolerable safety profile.",

While cannabidiol has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive treatment in Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), and epilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), its more global effectiveness in adult patients with DRE apart from these three specific contexts needs to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the epilepsy unit of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital. Patients initiating pharmaceutical cannabidiol treatment and followed for at least 1 year were included. Patients were categorized into \"authorized\" (LGS, DS, or TSC) and \"off-label\" groups. Cannabidiol effectiveness and tolerance were compared between groups, and characteristics of responders (patients with >50% reduction in seizure frequency) in the off-label group were examined. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients, followed by a median duration of 24 months, were included. A total of 35.2% of the patients were in the authorized group. No significant differences were observed in responder rates between groups (31.3% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.85) and retention rates at 1 year (75.0% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.97). Sleepiness was more commonly reported in the authorized group (50.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.01), with no other significant differences. Among off-label patients (n = 59), clobazam co-prescription was more prevalent in responders (71.4% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cannabidiol may benefit all adult patients with DRE, particularly those already receiving clobazam. Randomized controlled trials are warranted in off-label patients to validate these observational findings.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Magnetic Resonance Imaging guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (MRIgLITT) is a promising treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) and an alternative to open surgery. However, the relationship between clinical and radiological factors and postoperative outcomes is unclear. This study explores the indications, technical challenges, and outcomes of MRIgLITT in terms of seizure control and cognitive changes across various pathologies. METHODS: A retrospective single-center analysis included 32 MRIgLITT procedures performed between January 2019 and December 2023. Procedures used the Visualase  system for laser ablation, with stereotactic robotic guidance for fiber placement. Data included demographics, clinical and surgical details (ablated volume, timing, power and accuracy), and postoperative follow-up assessed seizure outcomes and complications. Cognitive changes were analyzed using a Reliable Change Index (RCI) before and one year after the procedure. RESULTS: The 32 procedures involved 28 patients with MRI-diagnosed pathologies: 14 hippocampal sclerosis (HS), 7 hypothalamic hamartoma (HH), 3 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), 2 periventricular heterotopia (PVH), 1 tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and 1 low-grade glioma. Some cases required multiple approaches. Postoperative follow-up averaged 33 months. Among HS patients, 71.42% achieved Engel I, and 21.43% Engel II. In HH, 85.7% initially became gelastic seizure-free, with complete freedom after additional treatment. Engel I outcomes were 28.6%, while 57.2% showed significant improvement (Engel I + II). FCD patients had a 66.6% Engel I success rate. One PVH patient became seizure-free, while the TSC patient was Engel III at last follow-up. RCI analysis showed that 71.44% of patients experienced cognitive stability (RCI > -1.64) or improvement (RCI > 1.64) at one-year post-procedure. CONCLUSIONS: MRIgLITT is a safe, minimally invasive alternative for epilepsy surgery, offering quicker recovery and showing better performance preserving cognitive function. It is particularly effective for deep or complex epileptic foci and patients who might refuse open surgery.",

                    "abstract": "Combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy improves clinical outcome in advanced oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, however relapse is inevitable. Here, we show in model systems that other than loss of RB1 few gene-copy number (CN) alterations are associated with irreversible-resistance to endocrine therapy and subsequent secondary resistance to palbociclib. Resistance to palbociclib occurred as a result of tumour cell re-wiring leading to increased expression of EGFR, MAPK, CDK4, CDK2, CDK7, CCNE1 and CCNE2. Resistance altered the ER genome wide-binding pattern, leading to decreased expression of 'classical' oestrogen-regulated genes and was accompanied by reduced sensitivity to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. Persistent CDK4 blockade decreased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) enhancing EGFR signalling, leading to the re-wiring of ER. Kinome-knockdown confirmed dependency on ERBB-signalling and G2/M-checkpoint proteins such as WEE1, together with the cell cycle master regulator, CDK7. Noteworthy, sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition was associated with loss of ER and RB1 CN. Overall, we show that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors is dependent on kinase re-wiring and the redeployment of signalling cascades previously associated with endocrine resistance and highlights new therapeutic networks that can be exploited upon relapse after CDK4/6 inhibition.",

                    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Topical sirolimus is increasingly utilised off-license to manage various dermatological conditions whilst avoiding typical adverse effects associated with systemic sirolimus. However, widespread use is limited by a highly heterogeneous evidence base of mixed quality. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the current evidence base for the indications, efficacy and safety profile for topical sirolimus in dermatology. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted from 2005 to July 4th, 2023, of English language studies, with the following databases consulted: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and EBSCO. Key words included 'topical', 'rapamycin', 'sirolimus' and 'dermatology'. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on drug efficacy, concentration, side effects, co-interventions and follow up were extracted. RESULTS: The search identified 202 studies; 71 studies met the inclusion criteria. Efficacy of topical sirolimus was demonstrated in facial angiofibromas (799 patients) compared to placebo across multiple randomised controlled trials with a predominant concentration of 0.1%. Evidence was mixed for sirolimus use in port-wine stains (61 patients), with evidence of effectiveness in combined sirolimus and pulsed-dye laser. Multiple case reports demonstrated clinical improvement with topical sirolimus use in cutaneous vascular abnormalities (33 patients) at a higher concentration of 1%. Other applications of topical sirolimus were predominantly case reports demonstrating generally favourable outcomes. Topical sirolimus was generally well tolerated - most reported adverse effects were localised irritation and pruritus. Ointment-based preparations and once-daily dosing appeared to confer a better side effect profile. CONCLUSION: Most high-quality data pertain to the efficacy of topical sirolimus in treating facial angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis. Outcomes are generally promising in other indications and good tolerability, but data quality is mixed.",

Alterations in sensory processing is a common phenotype of many genetic syndromes associated with intellectual disability (ID). It is currently unknown whether sensory processing alterations converge or diverge on brain responses between syndromes. Here, we compare for the first time four genetic conditions with ID using the same basic sensory learning paradigm. One hundred and five participants, aged between 3 and 30 years old, composing four clinical ID groups and one control group, were recruited: Fragile X syndrome (FXS; n = 14), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; n = 9), Down syndrome (DS; n = 19), SYNGAP1 mutations (n = 8) and Neurotypical controls (NT; n = 55)). All groups included female and male participants. Brain responses were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) during an audio-visual task that involved three repetitions of the pronunciation of the phoneme /a/. Event Related Potentials (ERP) were used to: 1) compare peak-to-peak amplitudes between groups, 2) evaluate the presence of repetition suppression within each group and 3) compare the relative repetition suppression between groups. Our results revealed larger overall amplitudes in FXS. A repetition suppression (RS) pattern was found in the NT group, FXS and DS, suggesting spared repetition suppression in a multimodal task in these two ID syndromes. Interestingly, FXS presented a stronger RS on one peak-to-peak value in comparison with the NT. The results of our study reveal the distinctiveness of ERP and RS brain responses in ID syndromes. Further studies should be conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in these patterns of responses.",

Initial treatment with antiseizure medications is empiric, and consideration of surgery is the standard of care for eligible patients with medically refractory epilepsy. In the past decade, advances in next generation sequencing technologies have accelerated progress in understanding the genetic etiologies of MCDs, and precision therapies for focal MCDs are emerging. Notably, mutations that lead to abnormal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which provides critical control of cell growth and proliferation, have emerged as a common cause of malformations. These include tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), hemimegalencephaly (HME), and some types of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). TSC currently represents the best example for the pathway from gene discovery to relatively safe and efficacious targeted therapy for epilepsy related to MCDs. Based on extensive pre-clinical and clinical data, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is currently approved for the treatment of focal refractory seizures in patients with TSC. Although clinical studies are just emerging for FCD and HME, we believe the next decade will bring significant advancements in precision therapies for epilepsy related to these and other MCDs.",

It can cause fatal complications if it ruptures. Although there have been reports of RAMLs rupturing, it is unusual to see RAMLs rupture during pregnancy, especially in pregnant women with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Moreover, we reported a rare complication after selective arterial embolization (SAE) for the first time, which called aseptic liquefaction necrosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is a 16-week-pregnant woman with TSC who presented with severe flank pain, which was secondary to the rupture of a large, previously unknown RAML. This was confirmed by emergency computed tomography and successfully treated with selective arterial embolization after the patient received counselling and provided prior informed written consent for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). The patient underwent abortion 3 weeks after the SAE. The patient required drainage 2 months after the SAE because of aseptic liquefaction necrosis. During follow-up, the patient's lesion remained stable. CONCLUSION: RAML rupture is a rare but rather serious complication in pregnant tuberous sclerosis patients. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) should be performed immediately, and the status of the pregnancy needs to be assessed by a multidisciplinary team. We also report for the first time the rare complication of aseptic liquefaction necrosis after SAE of RAML, for which percutaneous drainage is effective.",

CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a patient with refractory TRE who received deep brain stimulation of anterior thalamic nucleus (ANT-DBS) and achieved a satisfactory response. To our knowledge, this is the first case of TRE being treated with ANT-DBS. A 22-year-old male was admitted to the hospital for refractory TRE seeking surgical treatment. Seizures were mainly manifested by deep temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy and suspected to originate in the limbic system. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive potentially epileptogenic nodules in the brain lacking significant nodules. Scalp electroencephalogram showed a comprehensive, bilateral synchronous low-voltage rapid rhythm, unable to localize seizure origin. We performed bilateral ANT-DBS according to the preoperative evaluation, and the frequency and intensity of seizures were significantly reduced after the 15-month follow-up (P <0.05, Student's t-test). Our case extends the therapeutic indications of ANT-DBS to a certain extent, providing a neuromodulation alternative to vagus nerve stimulation for patients with TRE who are unsuitable candidates or refuse resection.",

                    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) constitutes the most frequent kidney cancer of the adult population and one of the most lethal malignant tumors worldwide. RCC often presents without early symptoms, leading to late diagnosis. Prognosis varies widely based on the stage of cancer at diagnosis. In the early-stage, localized RCC has a relatively good prognosis, while advanced or metastatic RCC has a poor outcome. Obesity, smoking, genetic mutations and family history are all considered risk factors for RCC, while inherited disorders, such as Tuberous Sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, are causally associated with RCC development. Genetic screening, deep sequencing analysis, quantitative proteomics and immunostaining analysis on RCC tissues, biological fluids and blood samples have been employed to identify novel biomarkers, predisposing factors and therapeutic targets for RCC with important clinical implications for patient treatment. Combined approaches of gene-targeting strategies coupled to a deep functional analysis of cancer cell biology, both in vitro and in appropriate animal models of RCC, significantly contributed to identify and characterize relevant pathogenic mechanisms underlying development and progression of RCC. These studies provided also important cues for the generation of novel target-specific therapeutics that selectively restore deranged cancer cell signalling and dysfunctional immune checkpoints, positively impacting on the survival rate of treated RCC patients. In this review, we will describe the recent discoveries concerning the most relevant pathogenic mechanisms of RCC and will highlight novel therapeutic strategies that interrupt oncogenic pathways and restore immune defences in RCC patients.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fetal tumors are rare and usually followed by poor outcome. We describe our single-center experience with fetal tumors evaluated by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our aims were to evaluate mortality and morbidity including long-term outcome and to determine which ultrasound and MRI characteristics were helpful for pre- and perinatal management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on prenatally diagnosed tumors between 1998 and 2018. Poor outcome included fetal or neonatal death and survival with serious illness. MRI addressed tumor morphology (sacrococcygeal teratomas), compromise of surrounding structures (head and neck tumors) and early depiction of brain alterations specific to tuberous sclerosis (rhabdomyomas). RESULTS: Of 68 pregnancies, 15 (22%) were terminated and eight children (8/53, 15%) died pre- or postnatally. Of the 45 survivors (45/68, 66%), 24 (24/45, 53%) were healthy, eight (8/45, 18%) had a minor illness and 13 (13/45, 29%) a serious illness. Diffusion- and T1-weighted MRI reliably predicted tumor morphology in teratomas. To detect head and neck tumors critical to airway obstruction, MRI was superior to ultrasound in delivery planning. Rhabdomyomas were frequently associated with tuberous sclerosis, regardless of their number or size in ultrasound; MRI could depict specific brain alterations from the early third trimester onwards. For several rare tumors, MRI provided critical differential diagnoses that could not be clearly displayed in ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of survivors with serious long-term illness among fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of a tumor was high. MRI is specifically helpful for risk stratification in fetal teratomas and delivery planning in head and neck tumors.",

We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of mTOR inhibitor nab-sirolimus when combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously treated patients >=18 years with confirmed diagnosis of advanced sarcoma or tumor with mutations in the mTOR pathway were treated with 3 mg/kg nivolumab intravenously every 3 weeks; escalating doses of nab-sirolimus at 56, 75 or 100 mg/m2 were administered intravenously on days 8 and 15 beginning in cycle 2. The primary aim was to determine the maximum-tolerated dose; we also determined disease control, objective response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and correlation between response using Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (irRECIST) versus RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: The maximum-tolerated dose was 100 mg/m2 There were two patients with partial response, 12 with stable disease and 11 with progressive disease. Median progression-free and overall survival were 12 and 47 weeks, respectively. The best responders (partial responses) were patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) mutation and estrogen receptor-positive leiomyosarcoma. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or more included thrombocytopenia, oral mucositis, rash, hyperlipidemia and increased serum alanine aminotransferase. CONCLUSION: The data indicate that (i) treatment with nivolumab plus nab-sirolimus is safe with no unexpected adverse events; (ii) treatment outcome parameters were not improved by combining nivolumab with nab-sirolimus; and (iii) best responders were patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with PTEN loss and TSC2 mutation and estrogen receptor-positive leiomyosarcoma.

The aims of this study were (i) to develop aqueous formulations of SIR loaded in polymeric micelles prepared using D-alpha-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and (ii) to use the cutaneous biodistribution method, in conjunction with a new statistical approach, to investigate the feasibility of SIR delivery to the viable epidermis. Optimized micelle solutions and hydrogels (0.2%) were developed and stable at 4  C for at least 6 and 3 months, respectively. Cutaneous delivery experiments (infinite and finite dose) using porcine skin demonstrated that both formulations increased SIR cutaneous bioavailability as compared to the control (ointment 0.2%). Moreover, studies with the micellar hydrogel 0.2% demonstrated SIR deposition in the viable epidermis with no transdermal permeation. These encouraging results confirmed that polymeric micelles enabled development of aqueous SIR formulations capable of targeted epidermal delivery. Furthermore, the cutaneous biodistribution provided a detailed insight into drug bioavailability in the different skin compartments that could complement/explain clinical observations of formulation efficacy.",

During the past decade, efforts have focused on development of new treatment options for DEEs, with several recently approved in the United States or Europe, including cannabidiol as an orphan drug in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and everolimus as a possible antiepileptogenic and precision drug for tuberous sclerosis complex, with its impact on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Furthermore, fenfluramine, an old drug, was repurposed as a novel therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The evolution of new insights into pathophysiological processes of various DEEs provides possibilities to investigate novel and repurposed drugs and to place them into the context of their role in future management of these patients. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these new medical treatment options for the DEEs and to discuss the clinical implications of these results for improved treatment.",

Here, we present the long-term efficacy and safety outcomes for add-on CBD treatment in patients with TSC. METHODS: Patients received plant-derived, highly purified CBD (Epidiolex  100 mg/mL, oral solution), increasing from 2 to 10 mg/kg/d to tolerance or maximum of 25-50 mg/kg/d. Efficacy endpoints were percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive, focal, and total seizure frequency and >= 50%, >=75%, and 100% responder rates across 12-week visit windows through 144 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) are reported through 233 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with confirmed TSC were included. Mean age was 12.4 years (range, 1.8-31.2), and patients were receiving a median of 3 (range, 1-7) antiseizure medications (ASMs) at baseline. Median CBD dose was 25-28 mg/kg/d for 36 weeks and then 20-50 mg/kg/d through 228 weeks. Dose reduction from baseline occurred for most ASMs, except topiramate. Median reduction in the frequency of convulsive, focal, and total seizures was 44%-81%, 51%-87%, and 44%-87%, respectively, through 144 weeks.

A total of 94% of patients experienced >=1 AE; 47% had serious AEs, considered treatment unrelated by the investigator. Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 71% of patients. The most frequently reported TRAEs were somnolence, diarrhea, and ataxia. Two patients experienced AEs leading to discontinuation. There were no deaths. SIGNIFICANCE: Long-term add-on CBD use was associated with reduced seizure frequency through 144 weeks. The safety profile was consistent with previous reports. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In this study, we evaluated efficacy and safety of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex receiving CBD in addition to other antiseizure treatments in an Expanded Access Program. After starting CBD, 46%-79% of patients had at least 50% reduction and 26%-65% had at least 75% reduction in the number of seizures per month; up to 13% had no seizures through 144 weeks. Safety results were similar to prior studies; sleepiness and diarrhea were common treatment-related side effects.

These results show that long-term CBD treatment was associated with fewer seizures and mild/moderate side effects.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus have activity against multiple manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex and are approved to treat astrocytomas, angiomyolipomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and epilepsy. Cannabidiol is a novel antiepileptic medication. There is lack of information regarding drug-drug interactions between mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors and cannabidiol in clinical practice. METHODS: We reviewed patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who were treated with a mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor (everolimus, sirolimus) and cannabidiol. Clinical information, mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor and cannabidiol dosing, concomitant antiepileptic drugs, as well as laboratory and adverse events were reviewed before and after initiation of cannabidiol. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were treated with cannabidiol and a mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor (18 everolimus, seven sirolimus). All mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor levels were drawn as troughs. Levels were significantly higher in 76% patients after cannabidiol treatment (P = 0.0003). Median change from baseline was +9.8 ng/mL for everolimus and +5.1 ng/mL for sirolimus. Adverse events occurred in 40%, with diarrhea being the most frequent adverse event occurring in three patients. No severe adverse events occurred during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabidiol resulted in increased serum levels of everolimus and/or sirolimus. Some patients experienced doubling or tripling of their mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor trough following the addition of cannabidiol. In some cases, this resulted in clinical toxicity, as well as laboratory abnormalities. Awareness of this interaction can lead clinicians to evaluate serum levels and other safety laboratory studies more closely, and thereby avoid potentially significant adverse effects. In patients known to be prone to mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor toxicity, preemptive reduction in dose may be warranted upon initiation of cannabidiol.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We implemented an infantile spasms management guideline recommending standard therapies and, early start of next treatment. After six years, we determined (1) our compliance with standard therapies, (2) time to next treatment, and (3) rate of initial and three-month electroclinical remission with first, second, and third treatments. METHODS: This is a retrospective record review of newly diagnosed spasms from September 2012 to September 2018, with the onset age of two months to two years. RESULTS: Standard therapies (hormone or vigabatrin) were the first treatments in 114 of 115 consecutive patients. The second and third treatments were started within 14 days of failed treatment in only 21% and 24%, respectively. Remission with the first and second treatments was similar (41% and 40%). Remission was lower for the third treatment (15%), although higher if standard therapy was used (36%). Initial and three-month remission by the first treatment was significantly higher for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 66% and 79%, respectively) and prednisolone (53% and 83%, respectively) than for vigabatrin (19% and 40%, respectively). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or rates of remission between ACTH and prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Although we achieved excellent compliance with standard therapies as initial treatment, a next treatment often started after two weeks. Given the superiority of hormone therapies over vigabatrin and standard therapies over nonstandard therapies, as well as the potentially negative impact of delays in effective treatment, future interventions need to focus on increasing the use of hormone over vigabatrin (for patients without tuberous sclerosis complex), use of standard therapies as second and third treatments, and reducing delays to next treatment.",

                    "abstract": "Since its approval as an adjunct treatment for refractory partial epilepsy, the positive effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on seizure frequency and severity have been supported by many studies. Seizure reduction of more than 50 % can be expected in at least 50 % of patients. However, a complete post-VNS seizure freedom is rarely achieved and 25 % of patients do not benefit from VNS. Our study provides an overview of the potential predictors of VNS response, from the most simple and basic data to sophisticated EEG processing studies and functional imaging studying brain connectivity. The data support better outcomes in younger patients with early VNS implantation, in patients with posttraumatic epilepsy or tuberous sclerosis, and in patients without bilateral interictal epileptiform discharges. The variability of heart activity has also been studied with some promising results. Because the generally accepted hypothesis of the VNS mechanism is the modulation of synaptic activity in multiple cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, the studies of brain response to external stimulation and/or of brain connectivity were used for models predicting the effect of VNS in individual patients. Although the predictive value of these models is high, the required special equipment and sophisticated mathematical tools limit their routine use (Ref. 58).

Alterations in sensory processing is a common phenotype of many genetic syndromes associated with intellectual disability (ID). It is currently unknown whether sensory processing alterations converge or diverge on brain responses between syndromes. Here, we compare for the first time four genetic conditions with ID using the same basic sensory learning paradigm. One hundred and five participants, aged between 3 and 30 years old, composing four clinical ID groups and one control group, were recruited: Fragile X syndrome (FXS; n = 14), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; n = 9), Down syndrome (DS; n = 19), SYNGAP1 mutations (n = 8) and Neurotypical controls (NT; n = 55)). All groups included female and male participants. Brain responses were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) during an audio-visual task that involved three repetitions of the pronunciation of the phoneme /a/. Event Related Potentials (ERP) were used to: 1) compare peak-to-peak amplitudes between groups, 2) evaluate the presence of repetition suppression within each group and 3) compare the relative repetition suppression between groups. Our results revealed larger overall amplitudes in FXS. A repetition suppression (RS) pattern was found in the NT group, FXS and DS, suggesting spared repetition suppression in a multimodal task in these two ID syndromes. Interestingly, FXS presented a stronger RS on one peak-to-peak value in comparison with the NT. The results of our study reveal the distinctiveness of ERP and RS brain responses in ID syndromes. Further studies should be conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in these patterns of responses.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disordered hepatic energy metabolism is found in obese rats with insulin resistance (IR). There are insufficient experimental studies of electroacupuncture (EA) for IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to probe the effect of EA on disordered hepatic energy metabolism and the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70-kDa (p70S6K) signaling pathway. METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were randomly divided into three groups: EA group receiving EA treatment; Pi group receiving pioglitazone gavage; and ZF group remaining untreated (n = 8 per group). Inbred non-insulin-resistant Zucker lean rats formed an (untreated) healthy control group (ZL, n = 8). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate the liver morphologically. The mitochondrial structure of hepatocytes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blotting was adopted to determine protein expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK, tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and p70S6K, and their phosphorylation. RT-PCR was used to quantify IRS-1, mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK and p70S6K mRNA levels. RESULTS: Compared with the ZF group, FPG, FINS, C-peptide, CRP and HOMA-IR levels were significantly reduced in the EA group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Evaluation of histopathology showed improvement in liver appearances following EA. Phosphorylation levels of AMPK, mTOR and TSC2 decreased, and IRS-1 and p70S6K increased, in hepatocytes of the ZF group, while these negative effects appeared to be alleviated by EA. CONCLUSIONS: EA can effectively ameliorate IR and regulate energy metabolism in the ZDF rat model. AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K and related molecules may represent a potential mechanism of action underlying these effects.",

However, very little is known about its potential to reduce interictal epileptiform activity and improve sleep architecture. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the influence of cannabidiol therapy on the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and sleep microstructure in a cohort of children with drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: Children with drug-resistant epilepsy were prospectively followed from November 2019 to January 2021 during an open-label trial of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day) and stable concomitant medication. Electroencephalograms were recorded at baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1). Two independent raters, blinded to clinical outcome, evaluated 5-min segments of sleep stage 2 or low-noise awake state. IEDs were visually identified and rates per minute calculated. Sleep microstructure was considered improved if sleep structures were seen at T1 that were not present at T0. IED rates at T0 and T1 were compared and correlated with seizure outcome, cannabidiol dose, initial IED rate, and disease duration. RESULTS: In total, 35 children (mean +- standard deviation age 10.1 +- 0.86) were included. The IED rate at T1 was significantly lower than at T0 (19.6 +- 19.5 vs. 36.8 +- 27.2, respectively; p < 0.0001). We found a moderate correlation between IED reduction and percentage of seizure reduction compared with baseline (Pearson's r = 0.39; p = 0.02), a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and IED rate at T0 (r = - 0.34; p = 0.04), and a trend towards a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and disease duration (r = - 0.32; p = 0.06). Sleep was recorded in 23 patients. Sleep microstructure was initially abnormal in 56.5% of sleep recordings and improved in 84.6% of those cases. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest the utility of cannabidiol in reducing IEDs and improving sleep microstructure in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Larger controlled studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of this effect in different epilepsy types. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00013177; 25 June 2019.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditionally, intervention was recommended for angiomyolipomas (AMLs) >4 cm due to the risk of catastrophic hemorrhage. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the natural history of AMLs, including growth rates and need for intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review was performed of an AML series from 2002 to 2013, which have been followed prospectively until 2018. We defined lesion size by maximum axial diameter and categorized lesion size at baseline. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A total of 458 patients with 593 AMLs, with a median follow-up of 65.2 mo, were identified. At diagnosis, 534 (90.1%) lesions were <=4 cm. Forty-three interventions were required for 34 (5.7%) AMLs: 30 were treated with embolization, seven surgery, two with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), three with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and one with nivolumab when epithelioid AML was confirmed. The median size at intervention was 4.9 cm (range 1.1-29 cm). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Most (94%) of the lesions grew slowly (growth rate of <0.25 cm/yr) during the period of observation. The number of AMLs <4 cm needed to treat (NNT) prophylactically to prevent one emergent bleed would have been 136 or that to prevent one blood transfusion would have been 205. The NNT (<4 cm) prophylactically to prevent one elective intervention would have been 82. On multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in intervention rates based on tuberous sclerosis complex, size at presentation, and clinical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This large single-institution updated series of renal AMLs demonstrates that early intervention is not required, regardless of the traditional 4 cm cut-off. The vast majority of AMLs are indolent lesions that are predominantly asymptomatic and slow growing. Follow-up should be no more frequent than annually. PATIENT SUMMARY: The majority of angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are indolent, slow-growing lesions that do not require intervention, regardless of size at presentation. We suggest that surveillance is a safe initial approach for patients presenting with AMLs.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Renal angiomyolipoma (RAML) is a rare benign kidney tumour comprised of adipose tissue, smooth muscle, and blood vessels. It can cause fatal complications if it ruptures. Although there have been reports of RAMLs rupturing, it is unusual to see RAMLs rupture during pregnancy, especially in pregnant women with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Moreover, we reported a rare complication after selective arterial embolization (SAE) for the first time, which called aseptic liquefaction necrosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is a 16-week-pregnant woman with TSC who presented with severe flank pain, which was secondary to the rupture of a large, previously unknown RAML. This was confirmed by emergency computed tomography and successfully treated with selective arterial embolization after the patient received counselling and provided prior informed written consent for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). The patient underwent abortion 3 weeks after the SAE. The patient required drainage 2 months after the SAE because of aseptic liquefaction necrosis. During follow-up, the patient's lesion remained stable. CONCLUSION: RAML rupture is a rare but rather serious complication in pregnant tuberous sclerosis patients. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) should be performed immediately, and the status of the pregnancy needs to be assessed by a multidisciplinary team. We also report for the first time the rare complication of aseptic liquefaction necrosis after SAE of RAML, for which percutaneous drainage is effective.",

For those with infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a genetic diagnosis is now obtained in more than 50% of patients. There is considerable motivation to utilize these molecular diagnostic data to help guide treatment, as children with DEEs often have drug-resistant seizures as well as developmental impairment related to cerebral epileptiform activity. Precision medicine approaches have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for these children and their families. At present, treatment can be targeted for patients with diagnoses in many genetic causes of infantile-onset DEE, including genes encoding sodium or potassium channel subunits, tuberous sclerosis, and congenital metabolic diseases. Precision medicine may refer to more intelligent choices of conventional antiseizure medications, repurposed agents previously used for other indications, novel compounds, enzyme replacement, or gene therapy approaches.",

Pre-clinical studies suggest that simvastatin in combination with sirolimus induces LAM cell death. The objective of this study was to assess the safety of simvastatin with either sirolimus or everolimus in LAM patients. METHODS: This was a phase II single arm trial evaluating the safety of escalating daily simvastatin (20-40 mg) in LAM patients already treated with sirolimus or everolimus. Adverse events and changes in lipid panel profile, pulmonary function tests, and VEGF-D were assessed. RESULTS: Ten LAM patients on a stable dose of mTORi for >3 months were treated with 20 mg simvastatin for two months followed by 40 mg for two months. The most common adverse events were peripheral edema (30%), cough (30%), and diarrhea (30%). No patients withdrew or had a reduction in simvastatin dose because of adverse events. Two patients required sirolumus dose reduction for supratherapeutic trough levels following simvastatin initiation. Total cholesterol and low density lipoproteins declined over the study period (-46.0 mg/dL+-20.8, p = 0.008; -41.9 mg/dL+-22.0, p = 0.01, respectively). There was also a decline in FEV1 (-82.0 mL+-86.4, p = 0.02) but no significant change in FVC, DLCO, or VEGF-D. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of simvastatin with mTORi in LAM patients is safe and well-tolerated from an adverse events perspective. The addition of simvastatin, however, was associated with decline in FEV1 and the efficacy of this combination should be explored in larger trials.",

Alterations in sensory processing is a common phenotype of many genetic syndromes associated with intellectual disability (ID). It is currently unknown whether sensory processing alterations converge or diverge on brain responses between syndromes. Here, we compare for the first time four genetic conditions with ID using the same basic sensory learning paradigm. One hundred and five participants, aged between 3 and 30 years old, composing four clinical ID groups and one control group, were recruited: Fragile X syndrome (FXS; n = 14), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC; n = 9), Down syndrome (DS; n = 19), SYNGAP1 mutations (n = 8) and Neurotypical controls (NT; n = 55)). All groups included female and male participants. Brain responses were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) during an audio-visual task that involved three repetitions of the pronunciation of the phoneme /a/. Event Related Potentials (ERP) were used to: 1) compare peak-to-peak amplitudes between groups, 2) evaluate the presence of repetition suppression within each group and 3) compare the relative repetition suppression between groups. Our results revealed larger overall amplitudes in FXS. A repetition suppression (RS) pattern was found in the NT group, FXS and DS, suggesting spared repetition suppression in a multimodal task in these two ID syndromes. Interestingly, FXS presented a stronger RS on one peak-to-peak value in comparison with the NT. The results of our study reveal the distinctiveness of ERP and RS brain responses in ID syndromes. Further studies should be conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in these patterns of responses.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus have activity against multiple manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex and are approved to treat astrocytomas, angiomyolipomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and epilepsy. Cannabidiol is a novel antiepileptic medication. There is lack of information regarding drug-drug interactions between mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors and cannabidiol in clinical practice. METHODS: We reviewed patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who were treated with a mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor (everolimus, sirolimus) and cannabidiol. Clinical information, mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor and cannabidiol dosing, concomitant antiepileptic drugs, as well as laboratory and adverse events were reviewed before and after initiation of cannabidiol. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were treated with cannabidiol and a mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor (18 everolimus, seven sirolimus). All mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor levels were drawn as troughs. Levels were significantly higher in 76% patients after cannabidiol treatment (P = 0.0003). Median change from baseline was +9.8 ng/mL for everolimus and +5.1 ng/mL for sirolimus. Adverse events occurred in 40%, with diarrhea being the most frequent adverse event occurring in three patients. No severe adverse events occurred during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabidiol resulted in increased serum levels of everolimus and/or sirolimus. Some patients experienced doubling or tripling of their mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor trough following the addition of cannabidiol. In some cases, this resulted in clinical toxicity, as well as laboratory abnormalities. Awareness of this interaction can lead clinicians to evaluate serum levels and other safety laboratory studies more closely, and thereby avoid potentially significant adverse effects. In patients known to be prone to mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor toxicity, preemptive reduction in dose may be warranted upon initiation of cannabidiol.",

Pre-clinical studies suggest that simvastatin in combination with sirolimus induces LAM cell death. The objective of this study was to assess the safety of simvastatin with either sirolimus or everolimus in LAM patients. METHODS: This was a phase II single arm trial evaluating the safety of escalating daily simvastatin (20-40 mg) in LAM patients already treated with sirolimus or everolimus. Adverse events and changes in lipid panel profile, pulmonary function tests, and VEGF-D were assessed. RESULTS: Ten LAM patients on a stable dose of mTORi for >3 months were treated with 20 mg simvastatin for two months followed by 40 mg for two months. The most common adverse events were peripheral edema (30%), cough (30%), and diarrhea (30%). No patients withdrew or had a reduction in simvastatin dose because of adverse events. Two patients required sirolumus dose reduction for supratherapeutic trough levels following simvastatin initiation. Total cholesterol and low density lipoproteins declined over the study period (-46.0 mg/dL+-20.8, p = 0.008; -41.9 mg/dL+-22.0, p = 0.01, respectively). There was also a decline in FEV1 (-82.0 mL+-86.4, p = 0.02) but no significant change in FVC, DLCO, or VEGF-D. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of simvastatin with mTORi in LAM patients is safe and well-tolerated from an adverse events perspective. The addition of simvastatin, however, was associated with decline in FEV1 and the efficacy of this combination should be explored in larger trials.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are WHO grade 1 tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis that classically arise from the ventricular wall near the caudate groove and foramen of Monro. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive surgical technique, which works by heating a stereotactically placed laser fiber to ablative temperatures under MRI thermometry monitoring. In this paper, the authors present LITT as a surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs. METHODS: Twelve patients with SEGAs who underwent 16 procedures between 2007 and 2022 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. These patients underwent either open resection or LITT. Clinical data, imaging, recurrence rate, further treatments, and related complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 16 procedures, 9 were open resection and 7 were LITT. An external ventricular drain was placed in 66% (6/9) of open procedures and 57.1% (4/7) of LITT cases. A septostomy was performed in 56% (5/9) of open procedures and 29% (2/7) of LITT cases. Complication rates were higher in open cases than in LITT procedures (44% vs 0%, p < 0.05). Complications included hydrocephalus, transient venous ischemia, wound infection, and bone flap migration. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 3.3-5.5 days) for open cases and 4 days (IQR 3.0-7.0 days) for LITT procedures. Recurrence or progression occurred after 3 open cases and 2 LITT cases (33% vs 33%, p = 0.803). For the recurrences, 2 open cases underwent stereotactic radiosurgery, 1 open case underwent LITT, and 1 LITT case underwent repeat LITT. Among the LITT cases, only the patients with no decrease in tumor size by 6 months experienced tumor progression afterward. The 2 LITT cases with progression were the only ones with calcification present on preoperative imaging. The median follow-up times for cases assessed for progression were 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-14.4 years) for open resection and 3.9 years (IQR 3.4-5.1 years) for LITT. CONCLUSIONS: The small size of this case series limits generalizability or adequate comparison of safety. However, this series adds to the literature supporting LITT as a less invasive surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs and demonstrates that LITT has similar recurrence and/or progression rates to open resection. Additional studies with more data are necessary for comprehensive comparisons between open resection and LITT for treating SEGA.",

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of optimized and high-density stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) in treating TSC-related epilepsy. METHODS: Nine TSC children with refractory epilepsy were treated with first-stage SEEG-Guided RF-TC, and four underwent second-stage-optimized high-density array of SEEG-Guided RF-TC. Patients' clinical data and postoperative outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The patients' median age at surgery was 4 years and 2 month (range from 3 years and 5 month to 16 years and 7 month). The mean age at surgery was 6.7 years old. Eight in 9 (88.9%) patients achieved complete remission after the final operation at half-year follow-up. Of seven patients with final postoperative time beyond 1 year, 6 (85.7%) reached completely seizure-free. No severe or long-term neurologic impairment existed in all nine patients.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is a benign brain tumor that occurs in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Surgical removal is the traditional treatment, and expert opinion is strongly against the use of radiotherapy. Recently, success has been reported with the mTor inhibitor everolimus in reducing tumor volume, but regrowth has been observed after dose reduction or cessation. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 40-year-old Asian female patient treated successfully for growing bilateral subependymal giant cell astrocytoma with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy before everolimus became available. After a follow-up of 8 years, everolimus was administered for renal angiomyolipoma and the patient was followed up until 13 years after radiotherapy. Successive magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an 80% volume reduction after radiotherapy that increased to 90% with everolimus. A review of the literature was done leveraging Medline via PubMed, and we assembled a database of 1298 article references and 780 full-text articles in search of evidence for contraindicating radiotherapy in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Varying results of single-fraction radiosurgery were described in a total of 13 cases. Only in two published cases was the radiation dose of fractionated radiotherapy mentioned. One single publication mentions an induced secondary brain tumor 8 years after whole-brain radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of contraindication and exclusion of fractionated radiotherapy in treating subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Our experience demonstrates that subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, as other benign intracranial tumors, responds slowly but progressively to radiotherapy and suggests that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy holds promise to consolidate responses obtained with mTor inhibitors avoiding regrowth after cessation.",

RCC often presents without early symptoms, leading to late diagnosis. Prognosis varies widely based on the stage of cancer at diagnosis. In the early-stage, localized RCC has a relatively good prognosis, while advanced or metastatic RCC has a poor outcome. Obesity, smoking, genetic mutations and family history are all considered risk factors for RCC, while inherited disorders, such as Tuberous Sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, are causally associated with RCC development. Genetic screening, deep sequencing analysis, quantitative proteomics and immunostaining analysis on RCC tissues, biological fluids and blood samples have been employed to identify novel biomarkers, predisposing factors and therapeutic targets for RCC with important clinical implications for patient treatment. Combined approaches of gene-targeting strategies coupled to a deep functional analysis of cancer cell biology, both in vitro and in appropriate animal models of RCC, significantly contributed to identify and characterize relevant pathogenic mechanisms underlying development and progression of RCC. These studies provided also important cues for the generation of novel target-specific therapeutics that selectively restore deranged cancer cell signalling and dysfunctional immune checkpoints, positively impacting on the survival rate of treated RCC patients. In this review, we will describe the recent discoveries concerning the most relevant pathogenic mechanisms of RCC and will highlight novel therapeutic strategies that interrupt oncogenic pathways and restore immune defences in RCC patients.",

                    "abstract": "Since its approval as an adjunct treatment for refractory partial epilepsy, the positive effects of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on seizure frequency and severity have been supported by many studies. Seizure reduction of more than 50 % can be expected in at least 50 % of patients. However, a complete post-VNS seizure freedom is rarely achieved and 25 % of patients do not benefit from VNS. Our study provides an overview of the potential predictors of VNS response, from the most simple and basic data to sophisticated EEG processing studies and functional imaging studying brain connectivity. The data support better outcomes in younger patients with early VNS implantation, in patients with posttraumatic epilepsy or tuberous sclerosis, and in patients without bilateral interictal epileptiform discharges. The variability of heart activity has also been studied with some promising results. Because the generally accepted hypothesis of the VNS mechanism is the modulation of synaptic activity in multiple cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, the studies of brain response to external stimulation and/or of brain connectivity were used for models predicting the effect of VNS in individual patients. Although the predictive value of these models is high, the required special equipment and sophisticated mathematical tools limit their routine use (Ref. 58).

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disordered hepatic energy metabolism is found in obese rats with insulin resistance (IR). There are insufficient experimental studies of electroacupuncture (EA) for IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to probe the effect of EA on disordered hepatic energy metabolism and the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70-kDa (p70S6K) signaling pathway. METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were randomly divided into three groups: EA group receiving EA treatment; Pi group receiving pioglitazone gavage; and ZF group remaining untreated (n = 8 per group). Inbred non-insulin-resistant Zucker lean rats formed an (untreated) healthy control group (ZL, n = 8). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate the liver morphologically. The mitochondrial structure of hepatocytes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blotting was adopted to determine protein expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK, tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and p70S6K, and their phosphorylation. RT-PCR was used to quantify IRS-1, mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK and p70S6K mRNA levels. RESULTS: Compared with the ZF group, FPG, FINS, C-peptide, CRP and HOMA-IR levels were significantly reduced in the EA group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Evaluation of histopathology showed improvement in liver appearances following EA. Phosphorylation levels of AMPK, mTOR and TSC2 decreased, and IRS-1 and p70S6K increased, in hepatocytes of the ZF group, while these negative effects appeared to be alleviated by EA. CONCLUSIONS: EA can effectively ameliorate IR and regulate energy metabolism in the ZDF rat model. AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K and related molecules may represent a potential mechanism of action underlying these effects.",

For those with infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a genetic diagnosis is now obtained in more than 50% of patients. There is considerable motivation to utilize these molecular diagnostic data to help guide treatment, as children with DEEs often have drug-resistant seizures as well as developmental impairment related to cerebral epileptiform activity. Precision medicine approaches have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for these children and their families. At present, treatment can be targeted for patients with diagnoses in many genetic causes of infantile-onset DEE, including genes encoding sodium or potassium channel subunits, tuberous sclerosis, and congenital metabolic diseases. Precision medicine may refer to more intelligent choices of conventional antiseizure medications, repurposed agents previously used for other indications, novel compounds, enzyme replacement, or gene therapy approaches.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: General anesthesia or sedation is commonly required for pediatric patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and airway management during the procedure is the highest concern for anesthesiologists owing to the limited access to the patient in the MRI unit. The use of supraglottic airway devices (SADs) has recently become more popular than endotracheal tubes; however, the feasibility of using SADs for children in MRI suites was reported only in a few studies that involved healthy patients. METHODS: We present a successful case series of 30 pediatric patients, and the majority are high-risk patients, including patients with aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency, mitochondrial disease, and tuberous sclerosis, using either i-gel or laryngeal masks for airway maintenance during MRI examination. RESULTS: A total of 38 MRI exams were conducted; the patients' median age was 4 (range 1.6-17.0 years), and the mean examination time was 50.87 minutes. No patient experienced oxygen desaturation, and only 1 patient with AADC deficiency had an episode of hypotension. The MRI scans were completed without interruption with an adequate image quality according to a specialized radiologist. CONCLUSION: From the clinical point of view, this case series demonstrated a broader application of SADs for airway maintenance during MRI scans for pediatric patients with a high risk during anesthesia rather than only for a healthy patient population.",

                    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) constitutes the most frequent kidney cancer of the adult population and one of the most lethal malignant tumors worldwide. RCC often presents without early symptoms, leading to late diagnosis. Prognosis varies widely based on the stage of cancer at diagnosis. In the early-stage, localized RCC has a relatively good prognosis, while advanced or metastatic RCC has a poor outcome. Obesity, smoking, genetic mutations and family history are all considered risk factors for RCC, while inherited disorders, such as Tuberous Sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, are causally associated with RCC development. Genetic screening, deep sequencing analysis, quantitative proteomics and immunostaining analysis on RCC tissues, biological fluids and blood samples have been employed to identify novel biomarkers, predisposing factors and therapeutic targets for RCC with important clinical implications for patient treatment. Combined approaches of gene-targeting strategies coupled to a deep functional analysis of cancer cell biology, both in vitro and in appropriate animal models of RCC, significantly contributed to identify and characterize relevant pathogenic mechanisms underlying development and progression of RCC. These studies provided also important cues for the generation of novel target-specific therapeutics that selectively restore deranged cancer cell signalling and dysfunctional immune checkpoints, positively impacting on the survival rate of treated RCC patients. In this review, we will describe the recent discoveries concerning the most relevant pathogenic mechanisms of RCC and will highlight novel therapeutic strategies that interrupt oncogenic pathways and restore immune defences in RCC patients.",

Lack of HCT preparation contributes to poor health outcomes. This study measures readiness to transition in individuals with genetic skin conditions. METHODS: Participants signed IRB-approved consents/assents. Participants ages 14-22 years with genetic skin disorders were surveyed with measures of QoL (Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index/CDLQI or DLQI) and HCT readiness using the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) and adapted non-validated measures of Skin Knowledge and Psychosocial Factors (5 = highest readiness). Mean TRAQ was compared with historical data on controls and other chronic conditions (t-tests) and correlated (Pearson) with Skin Knowledge and Psychosocial. Multivariable regression compared demographics and QoL with transition readiness. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants were enrolled (mean age 17.8 years, 67% female, 71% White; disorders of cornification [n = 31], ectodermal dysplasias [n = 7], epidermolysis bullosa [n = 4], tuberous sclerosis [n = 3]). Mean TRAQ (3.3 +- 0.9) was lower than controls (3.9; p < .001) and some chronic disorders (sickle cell [3.7; p < .05], type 1 diabetes [3.7; p < .01]), but higher than with spina bifida (2.8; p < .001) and congenital heart disease (2.9; p < .01). Mean Skin Knowledge was 4.2 +- 1.0, and mean Psychosocial was 3.4 +- 0.8. TRAQ correlated strongly with Skin Knowledge (r = .61; p < .05), but not Psychosocial (r = .12; p = .6). Ages 14-17 years versus 18-22 years and public versus private insurance predicted lower TRAQ scores. Poor DLQI predicted higher TRAQ and Skin Knowledge, but poor DLQI and CDLQI predicted lower Psychosocial. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults with genetic skin disorders demonstrated low transition readiness, especially among younger-aged and lower socioeconomic groups. We recommend a HCT intervention to improve health outcomes.",

Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed a subependymal nodule near the foramen of Monro suspected to be SEGA. Genetic analysis identified a tuberous sclerosis complex-1 germ line mutation. Surveillance imaging was recommended for the subependymal tumor. Fourteen months later, he presented with spontaneous hemorrhage into the tumor. Hematoma evacuation and tumor resection revealed SEGA.

Astute recognition of an index patient affected by a hereditary syndrome can lead to a \"tip-of-the-iceberg\" phenomenon whereby their entire kindred can then be proactively monitored and managed potentially with substantial reduction of morbidity and mortality. Through careful history-taking, as well as thoughtful assimilation of findings from the physical exam, biochemical laboratories, scans, and pathology reports, the clinician can spot phenotypic clues that distinguish these familial patterns from sporadic cases of tumorigenesis.",

                    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) constitutes the most frequent kidney cancer of the adult population and one of the most lethal malignant tumors worldwide. RCC often presents without early symptoms, leading to late diagnosis. Prognosis varies widely based on the stage of cancer at diagnosis. In the early-stage, localized RCC has a relatively good prognosis, while advanced or metastatic RCC has a poor outcome. Obesity, smoking, genetic mutations and family history are all considered risk factors for RCC, while inherited disorders, such as Tuberous Sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, are causally associated with RCC development. Genetic screening, deep sequencing analysis, quantitative proteomics and immunostaining analysis on RCC tissues, biological fluids and blood samples have been employed to identify novel biomarkers, predisposing factors and therapeutic targets for RCC with important clinical implications for patient treatment. Combined approaches of gene-targeting strategies coupled to a deep functional analysis of cancer cell biology, both in vitro and in appropriate animal models of RCC, significantly contributed to identify and characterize relevant pathogenic mechanisms underlying development and progression of RCC. These studies provided also important cues for the generation of novel target-specific therapeutics that selectively restore deranged cancer cell signalling and dysfunctional immune checkpoints, positively impacting on the survival rate of treated RCC patients. In this review, we will describe the recent discoveries concerning the most relevant pathogenic mechanisms of RCC and will highlight novel therapeutic strategies that interrupt oncogenic pathways and restore immune defences in RCC patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of the immunosuppressive agent sirolimus (SRL) following liver transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Sirolimus is a typical mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, and tuberous sclerosis 1-tuberous sclerosis 2 complex (TSC1/TSC2) is an important negative effector in the mTOR pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of SRL-based immunosuppression on the prognosis of LT recipients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria based on TSC1/2 expression and explored the effect of TSC1 on HCC in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 120 HCC patients who underwent LT in our hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 30, 2018. All patients had HCC beyond the Milan criteria and were divided into the SRL group (n = 50) and non-SRL group (n = 70). TSC1/2 expression levels in paraffin-embedded tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and then analyzed as subgroups. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. TSC1 expression was silenced in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 cell lines for further cell function experiments. RESULTS: 88.3% of patients were HBV LT recipients. The SRL group exhibited better DFS and OS compared to the non-SRL group (P = 0.02, P = 0.003). Subgroup (TSC1-based or TSC2-based) analyses revealed that patients with low TSC1 or TSC2 expression benefited from sirolimus (DFS: P = 0.046, OS: P = 0.006 for TSC1; DFS: P = 0.05, OS: P = 0.003 for TSC2) compared with patients with high expression. TSC1 knockdown in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 HCC cell lines activated the mTORC1 pathway and enhanced cell proliferation, migration and sensitivity to SRL in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: TSC1/2 expression could be used to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent SRL-based immunosuppression following LT. TSC1 knockdown promoted HCC malignancy and enhanced sensitivity to SRL.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the preferred treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), while preemptive (PE) living donor (LD) KT is associated with better survival, quality of life, and lower costs. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder. Renal involvement (multiple bilateral angiomyolipoma [AMLs], cysts, renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) is related to significant morbidity, including ESKD and KT. Nephrectomy in TSC patients before KT is controversial. Affected kidneys carry a risk of hemorrhage or malignancy, while AMLs may be fat-poor and are often hardly distinguishable from RCC in magnetic resonance (MR)/computed tomography. On the other hand nephrectomy impedes PE KT. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) have proved efficacy in many TSC complications, including AMLs, fat-poor AMLs, TSC-related RCC, and immunosuppressive (IS) treatment. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female TSC patient was referred for evaluation to the TSC reference center. Her family history was negative for TSC. A clinical evaluation revealed multisystem TSC manifestation (skin, brain, lungs, kidneys). MR disclosed indeterminate fat-poor renal lesions, possibly AMLs, but RCC could not be excluded. A comparison with previous MR did not show any significant progression. Due to ESKD, the patient was qualified for PE LD (mother) KT. mTORi, sirolimus, was used in IS. Creatinine at discharge was 2.1 mg/dL. Sixteen months later, MR showed significant reduction in tumor size. Two years after KT, graft function remained stable (creatinine 1.98 mg/dL). No complications related to renal lesions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: mTORi are the therapy of choice in TSC patients after KT, achieving IS effect and improvement in TSC manifestations while avoiding nephrectomy and management of patients with indeterminate renal lesions, especially in the case of PE KT.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We implemented an infantile spasms management guideline recommending standard therapies and, early start of next treatment. After six years, we determined (1) our compliance with standard therapies, (2) time to next treatment, and (3) rate of initial and three-month electroclinical remission with first, second, and third treatments. METHODS: This is a retrospective record review of newly diagnosed spasms from September 2012 to September 2018, with the onset age of two months to two years. RESULTS: Standard therapies (hormone or vigabatrin) were the first treatments in 114 of 115 consecutive patients. The second and third treatments were started within 14 days of failed treatment in only 21% and 24%, respectively. Remission with the first and second treatments was similar (41% and 40%). Remission was lower for the third treatment (15%), although higher if standard therapy was used (36%). Initial and three-month remission by the first treatment was significantly higher for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 66% and 79%, respectively) and prednisolone (53% and 83%, respectively) than for vigabatrin (19% and 40%, respectively). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or rates of remission between ACTH and prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Although we achieved excellent compliance with standard therapies as initial treatment, a next treatment often started after two weeks. Given the superiority of hormone therapies over vigabatrin and standard therapies over nonstandard therapies, as well as the potentially negative impact of delays in effective treatment, future interventions need to focus on increasing the use of hormone over vigabatrin (for patients without tuberous sclerosis complex), use of standard therapies as second and third treatments, and reducing delays to next treatment.",

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of singletons without common genetic defects born in Sweden during 1992-2006, and followed them from birth until 31 December 2014 (n=1 186 836). Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyse the association between maternal BMI in early pregnancy and the risk of offspring's ID. RESULTS: The risk of ID was higher in children born to mothers who were underweight (HR=1.21, 95% CI=1.07 to 1.36), overweight (HR=1.28, 95% CI=1.21 to 1.34) or had obesity class I (HR=1.63, 95% CI=1.53 to 1.74), obesity class II (HR=2.08, 95% CI=1.88 to 2.30) and obesity class III (HR=2.31, 95% CI=1.46 to 3.65) than in children born to normal weight mothers. Results remained consistent after excluding children with adverse birth outcome or born to mothers with gestational hypertension/diabetes. Analysis stratified by maternal education and annual household income showed that the association between maternal underweight and children's ID risk was attenuated among children of mothers with tertiary education or with high income. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that maternal underweight or overweight/obesity in early pregnancy was associated with the development of ID in their offspring. This association was independent of the effect of adverse birth outcomes and maternal hypertension/diabetes. High socioeconomic status may attenuate the risk of ID among children of underweight mothers. This study highlights the importance of improving health education before conception to reduce children's ID risk.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of 3-T intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) on the extent of resection of pediatric focal epileptogenic lesions, residual lesion volumes, and postoperative seizure outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. All surgical procedures for focal epilepsy from 2003 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent ioMRI and those who did not. Each group was subdivided into two subcategories according to preoperative MRI visualization of the lesion: those with well-defined and those with poorly defined lesions. The volumes of preoperative lesions and postoperative residual lesions were delineated. Outcome data and patient characteristics were reviewed. The results were compared between the two groups and the two subcategories. RESULTS. Eighty patients were included: 45 in the ioMRI group (24 with well-defined lesions, 21 with poorly defined lesions) and 35 in the non-ioMRI group (18 with well-defined lesions, 17 with poorly defined lesions). The well-defined lesions included tumors and vascular lesions. The poorly defined lesions included malformations of cortical development, hippocampal sclerosis, and tuberous sclerosis. The mean follow-up duration was 5.1 +- 3.3 years. The rate of gross total resection was not significantly different between the ioMRI and non-ioMRI groups (p = 0.46). However, ioMRI findings facilitated further resection during surgery, increasing gross total resection by an additional 11.1%. The ioMRI group had a significant reduction in percentage of residual volume (p < 0.001). Outcome data suggested that ioMRI is protective against poor Engel score (p = 0.048). Although ioMRI prolonged the mean operative time by 1.2 hours (p = 0.002), the additional time was not associated with additional complications. CONCLUSION. Integration of ioMRI into focal epilepsy surgery was associated with smaller residual lesions and was protective against poor Engel score. It prolonged the operative time but without increasing the number of complications.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1) controls metabolism and protein homeostasis and is activated following ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury and by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, studies vary as to whether this activation is beneficial or detrimental, and its influence on metabolism after IR is little reported. A limitation of prior investigations is their use of broad gain/loss of mTORC1 function, mostly applied before ischemic stress. This can be circumvented by regulating one serine (S1365) on TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex) to achieve bidirectional mTORC1 modulation but only with TCS2-regulated costimulation. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation protects the myocardium against IR and is required for IPC by amplifying mTORC1 activity to favor glycolytic metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with either S1365A (TSC2SA; phospho-null) or S1365E (TSC2SE; phosphomimetic) knockin mutations were studied ex vivo and in vivo. In response to IR, hearts from TSC2SA mice had amplified mTORC1 activation and improved heart function compared with wild-type and TSC2SE hearts. The magnitude of protection matched IPC. IPC requited less S1365 phosphorylation, as TSC2SE hearts gained no benefit and failed to activate mTORC1 with IPC. IR metabolism was altered in TSC2SA, with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and glycolytic capacity (stressed/maximal extracellular acidification) after myocyte hypoxia-reperfusion. In whole heart, lactate increased and long-chain acylcarnitine levels declined during ischemia. The relative IR protection in TSC2SA was lost by lowering glucose in the perfusate by 36%. Adding fatty acid (palmitate) compensated for reduced glucose in wild type and TSC2SE but not TSC2SA which had the worst post-IR function under these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: TSC2-S1365 phosphorylation status regulates myocardial substrate utilization, and its decline activates mTORC1 biasing metabolism away from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis to confer protection against IR. This pathway is also engaged and reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation required for effective IPC. Graphic Abstract: A graphic abstract is available for this article.",

                    "abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy, the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.",

It can cause fatal complications if it ruptures. Although there have been reports of RAMLs rupturing, it is unusual to see RAMLs rupture during pregnancy, especially in pregnant women with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Moreover, we reported a rare complication after selective arterial embolization (SAE) for the first time, which called aseptic liquefaction necrosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is a 16-week-pregnant woman with TSC who presented with severe flank pain, which was secondary to the rupture of a large, previously unknown RAML. This was confirmed by emergency computed tomography and successfully treated with selective arterial embolization after the patient received counselling and provided prior informed written consent for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). The patient underwent abortion 3 weeks after the SAE. The patient required drainage 2 months after the SAE because of aseptic liquefaction necrosis. During follow-up, the patient's lesion remained stable. CONCLUSION: RAML rupture is a rare but rather serious complication in pregnant tuberous sclerosis patients. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) should be performed immediately, and the status of the pregnancy needs to be assessed by a multidisciplinary team. We also report for the first time the rare complication of aseptic liquefaction necrosis after SAE of RAML, for which percutaneous drainage is effective.",

Inhalation bypasses the pharmacokinetic (PK) variability attributed to irregular gastrointestinal absorption and first-pass hepatic metabolism and may efficiently deliver CBD into systemic circulation. This phase 1 study compared the PK of a dry-powder inhaler (DPI) CBD formulation (10 mg powder containing 2.1 mg CBD) with an oral CBD solution (Epidiolex , 50 mg) in healthy participants. Following a single dose of Epidiolex or DPI CBD (n=10 PK evaluable participants each), the maximum CBD concentration for the inhaled powder was 71-fold higher than that of Epidiolex while administering 24-fold less CBD. The mean time to reach maximum concentration was 3.8 min for the DPI CBD formulation compared with 122 min for Epidiolex. Both Epidiolex and DPI CBD were generally safe and well-tolerated.

Initial treatment with antiseizure medications is empiric, and consideration of surgery is the standard of care for eligible patients with medically refractory epilepsy. In the past decade, advances in next generation sequencing technologies have accelerated progress in understanding the genetic etiologies of MCDs, and precision therapies for focal MCDs are emerging. Notably, mutations that lead to abnormal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which provides critical control of cell growth and proliferation, have emerged as a common cause of malformations. These include tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), hemimegalencephaly (HME), and some types of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). TSC currently represents the best example for the pathway from gene discovery to relatively safe and efficacious targeted therapy for epilepsy related to MCDs. Based on extensive pre-clinical and clinical data, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is currently approved for the treatment of focal refractory seizures in patients with TSC.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of 3-T intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) on the extent of resection of pediatric focal epileptogenic lesions, residual lesion volumes, and postoperative seizure outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. All surgical procedures for focal epilepsy from 2003 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent ioMRI and those who did not. Each group was subdivided into two subcategories according to preoperative MRI visualization of the lesion: those with well-defined and those with poorly defined lesions. The volumes of preoperative lesions and postoperative residual lesions were delineated. Outcome data and patient characteristics were reviewed. The results were compared between the two groups and the two subcategories. RESULTS. Eighty patients were included: 45 in the ioMRI group (24 with well-defined lesions, 21 with poorly defined lesions) and 35 in the non-ioMRI group (18 with well-defined lesions, 17 with poorly defined lesions). The well-defined lesions included tumors and vascular lesions. The poorly defined lesions included malformations of cortical development, hippocampal sclerosis, and tuberous sclerosis. The mean follow-up duration was 5.1 +- 3.3 years. The rate of gross total resection was not significantly different between the ioMRI and non-ioMRI groups (p = 0.46). However, ioMRI findings facilitated further resection during surgery, increasing gross total resection by an additional 11.1%. The ioMRI group had a significant reduction in percentage of residual volume (p < 0.001). Outcome data suggested that ioMRI is protective against poor Engel score (p = 0.048). Although ioMRI prolonged the mean operative time by 1.2 hours (p = 0.002), the additional time was not associated with additional complications. CONCLUSION. Integration of ioMRI into focal epilepsy surgery was associated with smaller residual lesions and was protective against poor Engel score. It prolonged the operative time but without increasing the number of complications.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgery has become integral in treating children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes of a multimodal diagnostic and therapeutic approach comprising invasive intracranial monitoring and surgical treatment and compare the complementary techniques of open resection and magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy. METHODS: Clinical and radiographic data were prospectively collected for pediatric patients undergoing surgical evaluation for TSC-related DRE at our tertiary academic hospital. Seizure freedom, developmental improvement, and Engel class were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20 females) underwent treatment in January 2016 to April 2019. Thirty-five underwent phase II invasive monitoring with intracranial electrodes: 24 stereoencephalography, 9 craniotomy for grid/electrode placement, and 2 grids + stereoencephalography. With the multimodal approach, 33/38 patients (87%) achieved >50% seizure freedom of the targeted seizure type after initial treatment; 6/9 requiring secondary treatment and 2/2 requiring a third treatment achieved >50% freedom. The median Engel class was II at last follow-up (1.65 years), and 55% of patients were Engel class I/II. The mean age was lower for children undergoing open resection (2.4 vs 4.9 years, P = .04). Rates of >50% reduction in seizures (86% open resection vs 88% laser interstitial thermal therapy) and developmental improvement (86% open resection vs 83% magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy) were similar. CONCLUSION: This hybrid approach of using both open surgical and minimally invasive techniques is safe and effective in treating DRE secondary to TSC. Clinical trials focused on treatment method with longer follow-up are needed to determine the optimal candidates for each approach and compare the treatment modalities more effectively.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1) controls metabolism and protein homeostasis and is activated following ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury and by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, studies vary as to whether this activation is beneficial or detrimental, and its influence on metabolism after IR is little reported. A limitation of prior investigations is their use of broad gain/loss of mTORC1 function, mostly applied before ischemic stress. This can be circumvented by regulating one serine (S1365) on TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex) to achieve bidirectional mTORC1 modulation but only with TCS2-regulated costimulation. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation protects the myocardium against IR and is required for IPC by amplifying mTORC1 activity to favor glycolytic metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with either S1365A (TSC2SA; phospho-null) or S1365E (TSC2SE; phosphomimetic) knockin mutations were studied ex vivo and in vivo. In response to IR, hearts from TSC2SA mice had amplified mTORC1 activation and improved heart function compared with wild-type and TSC2SE hearts. The magnitude of protection matched IPC. IPC requited less S1365 phosphorylation, as TSC2SE hearts gained no benefit and failed to activate mTORC1 with IPC. IR metabolism was altered in TSC2SA, with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and glycolytic capacity (stressed/maximal extracellular acidification) after myocyte hypoxia-reperfusion. In whole heart, lactate increased and long-chain acylcarnitine levels declined during ischemia. The relative IR protection in TSC2SA was lost by lowering glucose in the perfusate by 36%. Adding fatty acid (palmitate) compensated for reduced glucose in wild type and TSC2SE but not TSC2SA which had the worst post-IR function under these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: TSC2-S1365 phosphorylation status regulates myocardial substrate utilization, and its decline activates mTORC1 biasing metabolism away from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis to confer protection against IR. This pathway is also engaged and reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation required for effective IPC. Graphic Abstract: A graphic abstract is available for this article.",

Regarding clinical manifestations, a wide range of phenotypic variability exists, with symptoms constellations that may differ in affected organs (brain, skin, heart, eyes, kidneys, lungs), age of presentation and severity, but usually with great impact in biopsychosocial aspects of health and in quality of life. Main clinical neurological features are epilepsy (frequently, antiepileptic drug-resistant epilepsy), neuropsychiatric disorders, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Recently, many therapeutic strategies have developed, including preventive treatment of epilepsy, new options for treatment of epilepsy as cannabidiol, mTOR inhibitors, ketogenic diet, and a more precise epilepsy surgery. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas may require surgical procedures or mTOR inhibitors treatment. mTOR inhibitors may also be useful for other comorbidities. To improve quality of life of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, it is essential to be able to deliver an integrated approach by specialized multidisciplinary teams, coordinated with primary care physicians and health professionals, that include access to treatments, attention of psychosocial aspects, and an adequate health care transition from pediatric to adult care.",

METHODS: We evaluated patients with ES from the CDKL5 Centers of Excellence and the National Infantile Spasms Consortium (NISC), with onset from 2 months to 2 years, treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), oral corticosteroids, vigabatrin, and/or the ketogenic diet. We excluded children with tuberous sclerosis complex, trisomy 21, or unknown etiology with normal development because of known differential treatment responses. We compared the two cohorts for time to treatment and ES remission at 14 days and 3 months. RESULTS: We evaluated 59 individuals with CDD (79% female, median ES onset 6 months) and 232 individuals from the NISC database (46% female, median onset 7 months). In the CDD cohort, seizures prior to ES were common (88%), and hypsarrhythmia and its variants were present at ES onset in 34%. Initial treatment with ACTH, oral corticosteroids, or vigabatrin started within 1 month of ES onset in 27 of 59 (46%) of the CDD cohort and 182 of 232 (78%) of the NISC cohort (p < .0001). Fourteen-day clinical remission of ES was lower for the CDD group (26%, 7/27) than for the NISC cohort (58%, 106/182, p = .0002). Sustained ES remission at 3 months occurred in 1 of 27 (4%) of CDD patients vs 96 of 182 (53%) of the NISC cohort (p < .0001). Comparable results were observed with longer lead time (>=1 month) or prior treatment. Ketogenic diet, used within 3 months of ES onset, resulted in ES remission at 1 month, sustained at 3 months, in at least 2 of 13 (15%) individuals with CDD. SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to the broad group of infants with ES, children with ES in the setting of CDD often experience longer lead time to treatment and respond poorly to standard treatments. Development of alternative treatments for ES in CDD is needed.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the preferred treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), while preemptive (PE) living donor (LD) KT is associated with better survival, quality of life, and lower costs. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder. Renal involvement (multiple bilateral angiomyolipoma [AMLs], cysts, renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) is related to significant morbidity, including ESKD and KT. Nephrectomy in TSC patients before KT is controversial. Affected kidneys carry a risk of hemorrhage or malignancy, while AMLs may be fat-poor and are often hardly distinguishable from RCC in magnetic resonance (MR)/computed tomography. On the other hand nephrectomy impedes PE KT. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) have proved efficacy in many TSC complications, including AMLs, fat-poor AMLs, TSC-related RCC, and immunosuppressive (IS) treatment. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female TSC patient was referred for evaluation to the TSC reference center. Her family history was negative for TSC. A clinical evaluation revealed multisystem TSC manifestation (skin, brain, lungs, kidneys). MR disclosed indeterminate fat-poor renal lesions, possibly AMLs, but RCC could not be excluded. A comparison with previous MR did not show any significant progression. Due to ESKD, the patient was qualified for PE LD (mother) KT. mTORi, sirolimus, was used in IS. Creatinine at discharge was 2.1 mg/dL. Sixteen months later, MR showed significant reduction in tumor size. Two years after KT, graft function remained stable (creatinine 1.98 mg/dL). No complications related to renal lesions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: mTORi are the therapy of choice in TSC patients after KT, achieving IS effect and improvement in TSC manifestations while avoiding nephrectomy and management of patients with indeterminate renal lesions, especially in the case of PE KT.",

They typically grow in the region of the foramen of Monro and can occlude it, leading to hydrocephalus. Currently, gross total resection is the standard of care, with low rates of recurrence but high rates of complication, especially with larger lesions. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a newly emerging treatment modality for a variety of pathologies. Here, we present a case series of SEGAs managed via LITT and endoscopic, stereotactic septostomy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify three cases in which SEGAs were treated via LITT and septostomy. Stereotactic ablation was performed via magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry with laser output set to 69% for 2.5 min, with post-ablation scans for visualization of treatment area. RESULTS: Average age at surgery was 8.2 years. Pre-operative tumor volumes were 0.43, 1.51, and 3.88 cm3. Post-operative tumor volumes were 0.25, 0.21, and 0.68 cm3. Mean tumor volume reduction was 70%. No complications occurred. CONCLUSION: LITT with septostomy should be considered a viable primary or adjunct treatment modality for SEGAs.",

METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive pediatric epilepsy patients at a single pediatric center who underwent LITT ablation of epileptogenic foci between May 2017 and December 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, medication use, seizure frequency, prior surgical interventions, procedural details, and pre- and postoperative seizure history were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven pediatric patients (24 male, 13 female) with severe medically refractory epilepsy were included; all underwent stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) prior to LITT. The SEEG electrode placement was based on the preoperative workup and tailored to each patient by the epileptologist and neurosurgeons working together to identify the epileptic network and hopefully quiet borders. Seizure onset was at a mean age of 2.70 +- 2.82 years (range 0.25-12 years), and the mean age at the time of LITT was 9.46 +- 5.08 years (range 2.41-17.86 years). Epilepsy was lesional in 23 patients (18 tuberous sclerosis, 4 focal cortical dysplasia, 1 gliosis) and nonlesional in 14. Eighteen patients had prior surgical interventions including open resections (n = 13: 11 single and 2 multiple), LITT (n = 4), or both (n = 1). LITT targeted a region adjacent to the previous target in 5 cases. The median number of lasers placed during the procedure was 3 (range 1-5). Complications occurred in 14 (37.8%) cases, only 3 (8.11%) of which resulted in a permanent deficit: 1 venous hemorrhage requiring evacuation following laser ablation, 1 aseptic meningitis, 2 immediate postoperative seizures, and 10 neurological deficits (7 transient and 3 permanent). Postoperatively, 22 (59.5%) patients were seizure free at the last follow-up (median follow-up 18.35 months, range 7.40-48.76 months), and the median modified Engel class was I (Engel class I in 22 patients, Engel class II in 2, Engel class III in 2, and Engel class IV in 11). Patients having tried a greater number of antiseizure medications before LITT were less likely to achieve seizure improvement (p = 0.046) or freedom (p = 0.017). Seizure improvement following LITT was associated with a shorter duration of epilepsy prior to LITT (p = 0.044), although postoperative seizure freedom was not associated with a shorter epilepsy duration (p = 0.667). Caregivers reported postoperative neurocognitive improvement in 17 (45.9%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this large single-institution cohort of pediatric patients with medically refractory seizures due to various etiologies, LITT was a relatively safe and effective surgical approach for seizure reduction and seizure freedom at 1 year of follow-up.",

They typically grow in the region of the foramen of Monro and can occlude it, leading to hydrocephalus. Currently, gross total resection is the standard of care, with low rates of recurrence but high rates of complication, especially with larger lesions. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a newly emerging treatment modality for a variety of pathologies. Here, we present a case series of SEGAs managed via LITT and endoscopic, stereotactic septostomy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify three cases in which SEGAs were treated via LITT and septostomy. Stereotactic ablation was performed via magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry with laser output set to 69% for 2.5 min, with post-ablation scans for visualization of treatment area. RESULTS: Average age at surgery was 8.2 years. Pre-operative tumor volumes were 0.43, 1.51, and 3.88 cm3. Post-operative tumor volumes were 0.25, 0.21, and 0.68 cm3. Mean tumor volume reduction was 70%. No complications occurred. CONCLUSION: LITT with septostomy should be considered a viable primary or adjunct treatment modality for SEGAs.",

Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive surgical technique, which works by heating a stereotactically placed laser fiber to ablative temperatures under MRI thermometry monitoring. In this paper, the authors present LITT as a surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs. METHODS: Twelve patients with SEGAs who underwent 16 procedures between 2007 and 2022 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. These patients underwent either open resection or LITT. Clinical data, imaging, recurrence rate, further treatments, and related complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 16 procedures, 9 were open resection and 7 were LITT. An external ventricular drain was placed in 66% (6/9) of open procedures and 57.1% (4/7) of LITT cases. A septostomy was performed in 56% (5/9) of open procedures and 29% (2/7) of LITT cases. Complication rates were higher in open cases than in LITT procedures (44% vs 0%, p < 0.05). Complications included hydrocephalus, transient venous ischemia, wound infection, and bone flap migration. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 3.3-5.5 days) for open cases and 4 days (IQR 3.0-7.0 days) for LITT procedures. Recurrence or progression occurred after 3 open cases and 2 LITT cases (33% vs 33%, p = 0.803). For the recurrences, 2 open cases underwent stereotactic radiosurgery, 1 open case underwent LITT, and 1 LITT case underwent repeat LITT. Among the LITT cases, only the patients with no decrease in tumor size by 6 months experienced tumor progression afterward. The 2 LITT cases with progression were the only ones with calcification present on preoperative imaging. The median follow-up times for cases assessed for progression were 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-14.4 years) for open resection and 3.9 years (IQR 3.4-5.1 years) for LITT. CONCLUSIONS: The small size of this case series limits generalizability or adequate comparison of safety. However, this series adds to the literature supporting LITT as a less invasive surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs and demonstrates that LITT has similar recurrence and/or progression rates to open resection. Additional studies with more data are necessary for comprehensive comparisons between open resection and LITT for treating SEGA.",

METHODS: The electronic databases such as MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched from inception to October 10, 2023, for eligible records. RESULTS: Forty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria, representing a total of 217 patients with TS-related facial angiofibroma who received laser treatment. Several lasers have been trialed in patients including carbon dioxide (n = 95, 43.7%), pulsed dye (n = 21, 9.7%), argon (n = 16, 7.4%), neodymium-doped: yttrium aluminum garnet (n = 12, 5.5%), copper vapor (n = 9, 4.1%), potassium titanyl phosphate (n = 7, 3.2%), erbium: yttrium aluminum garnet (n = 2, 0.9%), lasers and various combination therapies (n = 55, 25.3%). CONCLUSION: Potassium titanyl phosphate, pulsed dye, and neodymium-dopsed:yttrium aluminum garnet lasers are better suited to manage the vascular components of angiofibroma while ablative lasers such as erbium: yttrium aluminum garnet and carbon dioxide lasers may present better options for lesions with a prominent fibrous component. While several lasers have been trialed with broadly favorable results, the low level of evidence precludes definitive conclusions, and no single laser appears superior.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disordered hepatic energy metabolism is found in obese rats with insulin resistance (IR). There are insufficient experimental studies of electroacupuncture (EA) for IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to probe the effect of EA on disordered hepatic energy metabolism and the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70-kDa (p70S6K) signaling pathway. METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were randomly divided into three groups: EA group receiving EA treatment; Pi group receiving pioglitazone gavage; and ZF group remaining untreated (n = 8 per group). Inbred non-insulin-resistant Zucker lean rats formed an (untreated) healthy control group (ZL, n = 8). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate the liver morphologically. The mitochondrial structure of hepatocytes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blotting was adopted to determine protein expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK, tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and p70S6K, and their phosphorylation. RT-PCR was used to quantify IRS-1, mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK and p70S6K mRNA levels. RESULTS: Compared with the ZF group, FPG, FINS, C-peptide, CRP and HOMA-IR levels were significantly reduced in the EA group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Evaluation of histopathology showed improvement in liver appearances following EA. Phosphorylation levels of AMPK, mTOR and TSC2 decreased, and IRS-1 and p70S6K increased, in hepatocytes of the ZF group, while these negative effects appeared to be alleviated by EA. CONCLUSIONS: EA can effectively ameliorate IR and regulate energy metabolism in the ZDF rat model. AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K and related molecules may represent a potential mechanism of action underlying these effects.",

METHODS: Data from 24 consecutive TSC surgical candidates who underwent both HR-ESI and LTM-VEEG was retrospectively collected. PHS and VS were analyzed to hypothesize the symptomatogenic zone localization. LTM-VEEG and HR-ESI localization results were extracted from the diagnostic reports. Localizing value was compared between modalities, taken the resected/disconnected area of surgical patients in consideration. HR-ESI's impact on the epileptogenic zone hypothesis and surgical workup was evaluated. RESULTS: Semiology, interictal EEG, ictal EEG and HR-ESI were localizing in 25%, 54%, 63% and 79% of patients. Inter-modality concordance ranged between 33-89%. In good surgical outcome patients, PHS, VS, interictal EEG, ictal EEG and HR-ESI showed concordance with resected area in 1/9 (11%), 0/9 (0%), 4/9 (44%), 3/9 (33%) and 6/9 patients (67%). HR-ESI positively impacts clinical management in 50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In presurgical evaluation of TSC patients, semiology often has limited localizing value. Presurgical work-up benefits from HR-ESI. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings may advice future presurgical epilepsy workup of TSC patients with the ultimate aim to improve outcome.",

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin changes, benign systemic or central nervous system tumors [subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)], mental retardation, or epilepsy. Hemorrhage into SEGA is exceedingly rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We evaluated a 21-year-old college student with migraine. Biopsy of numerous popular skin lesions on his nose revealed adenoma sebaceum. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed a subependymal nodule near the foramen of Monro suspected to be SEGA. Genetic analysis identified a tuberous sclerosis complex-1 germ line mutation. Surveillance imaging was recommended for the subependymal tumor. Fourteen months later, he presented with spontaneous hemorrhage into the tumor. Hematoma evacuation and tumor resection revealed SEGA. The college graduate was able to return to full-time work. CONCLUSIONS: We present an unusual cause of intracranial hemorrhage in a young adult. Thorough work-up and recognition of an underlying genetic predisposition can curtails diagnostic delay when life-threatening complications occur.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) may offer seizure freedom and benefits for quality of life. Yet, concerns remain regarding invasiveness, morbidity, and neurocognitive side effects. Magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) has emerged as a less invasive option for stereotactic ablation rather than resection of the EZ. OBJECTIVE: To provide an introduction to MRgLITT for epilepsy, including historical development, surgical technique, and role in therapy. METHODS: The development of MRgLITT is briefly recounted. A systematic review identified reported techniques and indication-specific outcomes of MRgLITT for DRE in human studies regardless of sample size or follow-up duration. Potential advantages and disadvantages compared to available alternatives for each indication are assessed in an unstructured review. RESULTS: Techniques and outcomes are reported for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, hypothalamic hamartoma, focal cortical dysplasia, nonlesional epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis, periventricular nodular heterotopia, cerebral cavernous malformations, poststroke epilepsy, temporal encephalocele, and corpus callosotomy. CONCLUSION: MRgLITT offers access to foci virtually anywhere in the brain with minimal disruption of the overlying cortex and white matter, promising fewer neurological side effects and less surgical morbidity and pain. Compared to other ablative techniques, MRgLITT offers immediate, discrete lesions with real-time monitoring of temperature beyond the fiber tip for damage estimates and off-target injury prevention. Applications of MRgLITT for epilepsy are growing rapidly and, although more evidence of safety and efficacy is needed, there are potential advantages for some patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgery has become integral in treating children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes of a multimodal diagnostic and therapeutic approach comprising invasive intracranial monitoring and surgical treatment and compare the complementary techniques of open resection and magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy. METHODS: Clinical and radiographic data were prospectively collected for pediatric patients undergoing surgical evaluation for TSC-related DRE at our tertiary academic hospital. Seizure freedom, developmental improvement, and Engel class were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20 females) underwent treatment in January 2016 to April 2019. Thirty-five underwent phase II invasive monitoring with intracranial electrodes: 24 stereoencephalography, 9 craniotomy for grid/electrode placement, and 2 grids + stereoencephalography. With the multimodal approach, 33/38 patients (87%) achieved >50% seizure freedom of the targeted seizure type after initial treatment; 6/9 requiring secondary treatment and 2/2 requiring a third treatment achieved >50% freedom. The median Engel class was II at last follow-up (1.65 years), and 55% of patients were Engel class I/II. The mean age was lower for children undergoing open resection (2.4 vs 4.9 years, P = .04). Rates of >50% reduction in seizures (86% open resection vs 88% laser interstitial thermal therapy) and developmental improvement (86% open resection vs 83% magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy) were similar. CONCLUSION: This hybrid approach of using both open surgical and minimally invasive techniques is safe and effective in treating DRE secondary to TSC. Clinical trials focused on treatment method with longer follow-up are needed to determine the optimal candidates for each approach and compare the treatment modalities more effectively.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditionally, intervention was recommended for angiomyolipomas (AMLs) >4 cm due to the risk of catastrophic hemorrhage. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the natural history of AMLs, including growth rates and need for intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review was performed of an AML series from 2002 to 2013, which have been followed prospectively until 2018. We defined lesion size by maximum axial diameter and categorized lesion size at baseline. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A total of 458 patients with 593 AMLs, with a median follow-up of 65.2 mo, were identified. At diagnosis, 534 (90.1%) lesions were <=4 cm. Forty-three interventions were required for 34 (5.7%) AMLs: 30 were treated with embolization, seven surgery, two with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), three with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and one with nivolumab when epithelioid AML was confirmed. The median size at intervention was 4.9 cm (range 1.1-29 cm). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Most (94%) of the lesions grew slowly (growth rate of <0.25 cm/yr) during the period of observation. The number of AMLs <4 cm needed to treat (NNT) prophylactically to prevent one emergent bleed would have been 136 or that to prevent one blood transfusion would have been 205. The NNT (<4 cm) prophylactically to prevent one elective intervention would have been 82. On multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in intervention rates based on tuberous sclerosis complex, size at presentation, and clinical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This large single-institution updated series of renal AMLs demonstrates that early intervention is not required, regardless of the traditional 4 cm cut-off. The vast majority of AMLs are indolent lesions that are predominantly asymptomatic and slow growing. Follow-up should be no more frequent than annually. PATIENT SUMMARY: The majority of angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are indolent, slow-growing lesions that do not require intervention, regardless of size at presentation. We suggest that surveillance is a safe initial approach for patients presenting with AMLs.",

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder. Renal involvement (multiple bilateral angiomyolipoma [AMLs], cysts, renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) is related to significant morbidity, including ESKD and KT. Nephrectomy in TSC patients before KT is controversial. Affected kidneys carry a risk of hemorrhage or malignancy, while AMLs may be fat-poor and are often hardly distinguishable from RCC in magnetic resonance (MR)/computed tomography. On the other hand nephrectomy impedes PE KT. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) have proved efficacy in many TSC complications, including AMLs, fat-poor AMLs, TSC-related RCC, and immunosuppressive (IS) treatment. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female TSC patient was referred for evaluation to the TSC reference center. Her family history was negative for TSC. A clinical evaluation revealed multisystem TSC manifestation (skin, brain, lungs, kidneys). MR disclosed indeterminate fat-poor renal lesions, possibly AMLs, but RCC could not be excluded. A comparison with previous MR did not show any significant progression. Due to ESKD, the patient was qualified for PE LD (mother) KT. mTORi, sirolimus, was used in IS.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disordered hepatic energy metabolism is found in obese rats with insulin resistance (IR). There are insufficient experimental studies of electroacupuncture (EA) for IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to probe the effect of EA on disordered hepatic energy metabolism and the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70-kDa (p70S6K) signaling pathway. METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were randomly divided into three groups: EA group receiving EA treatment; Pi group receiving pioglitazone gavage; and ZF group remaining untreated (n = 8 per group). Inbred non-insulin-resistant Zucker lean rats formed an (untreated) healthy control group (ZL, n = 8). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate the liver morphologically. The mitochondrial structure of hepatocytes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blotting was adopted to determine protein expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK, tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and p70S6K, and their phosphorylation. RT-PCR was used to quantify IRS-1, mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK and p70S6K mRNA levels. RESULTS: Compared with the ZF group, FPG, FINS, C-peptide, CRP and HOMA-IR levels were significantly reduced in the EA group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Evaluation of histopathology showed improvement in liver appearances following EA. Phosphorylation levels of AMPK, mTOR and TSC2 decreased, and IRS-1 and p70S6K increased, in hepatocytes of the ZF group, while these negative effects appeared to be alleviated by EA. CONCLUSIONS: EA can effectively ameliorate IR and regulate energy metabolism in the ZDF rat model. AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K and related molecules may represent a potential mechanism of action underlying these effects.",

It can cause fatal complications if it ruptures. Although there have been reports of RAMLs rupturing, it is unusual to see RAMLs rupture during pregnancy, especially in pregnant women with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Moreover, we reported a rare complication after selective arterial embolization (SAE) for the first time, which called aseptic liquefaction necrosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is a 16-week-pregnant woman with TSC who presented with severe flank pain, which was secondary to the rupture of a large, previously unknown RAML. This was confirmed by emergency computed tomography and successfully treated with selective arterial embolization after the patient received counselling and provided prior informed written consent for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). The patient underwent abortion 3 weeks after the SAE. The patient required drainage 2 months after the SAE because of aseptic liquefaction necrosis. During follow-up, the patient's lesion remained stable. CONCLUSION: RAML rupture is a rare but rather serious complication in pregnant tuberous sclerosis patients. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) should be performed immediately, and the status of the pregnancy needs to be assessed by a multidisciplinary team. We also report for the first time the rare complication of aseptic liquefaction necrosis after SAE of RAML, for which percutaneous drainage is effective.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to better understand the safety and efficacy of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for children with medically refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive pediatric epilepsy patients at a single pediatric center who underwent LITT ablation of epileptogenic foci between May 2017 and December 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, medication use, seizure frequency, prior surgical interventions, procedural details, and pre- and postoperative seizure history were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven pediatric patients (24 male, 13 female) with severe medically refractory epilepsy were included; all underwent stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) prior to LITT. The SEEG electrode placement was based on the preoperative workup and tailored to each patient by the epileptologist and neurosurgeons working together to identify the epileptic network and hopefully quiet borders. Seizure onset was at a mean age of 2.70 +- 2.82 years (range 0.25-12 years), and the mean age at the time of LITT was 9.46 +- 5.08 years (range 2.41-17.86 years). Epilepsy was lesional in 23 patients (18 tuberous sclerosis, 4 focal cortical dysplasia, 1 gliosis) and nonlesional in 14. Eighteen patients had prior surgical interventions including open resections (n = 13: 11 single and 2 multiple), LITT (n = 4), or both (n = 1). LITT targeted a region adjacent to the previous target in 5 cases. The median number of lasers placed during the procedure was 3 (range 1-5). Complications occurred in 14 (37.8%) cases, only 3 (8.11%) of which resulted in a permanent deficit: 1 venous hemorrhage requiring evacuation following laser ablation, 1 aseptic meningitis, 2 immediate postoperative seizures, and 10 neurological deficits (7 transient and 3 permanent). Postoperatively, 22 (59.5%) patients were seizure free at the last follow-up (median follow-up 18.35 months, range 7.40-48.76 months), and the median modified Engel class was I (Engel class I in 22 patients, Engel class II in 2, Engel class III in 2, and Engel class IV in 11). Patients having tried a greater number of antiseizure medications before LITT were less likely to achieve seizure improvement (p = 0.046) or freedom (p = 0.017). Seizure improvement following LITT was associated with a shorter duration of epilepsy prior to LITT (p = 0.044), although postoperative seizure freedom was not associated with a shorter epilepsy duration (p = 0.667). Caregivers reported postoperative neurocognitive improvement in 17 (45.9%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this large single-institution cohort of pediatric patients with medically refractory seizures due to various etiologies, LITT was a relatively safe and effective surgical approach for seizure reduction and seizure freedom at 1 year of follow-up.",

We present the case of a young woman with severe TS, who developed DLBCL. She was treated consecutively with the mCHEMO schedule R-DEVEC (prednisone, vinorelbine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide plus rituximab) and then ibrutinib, achieving an impressive long-lasting complete remission.

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1) controls metabolism and protein homeostasis and is activated following ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury and by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, studies vary as to whether this activation is beneficial or detrimental, and its influence on metabolism after IR is little reported. A limitation of prior investigations is their use of broad gain/loss of mTORC1 function, mostly applied before ischemic stress. This can be circumvented by regulating one serine (S1365) on TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex) to achieve bidirectional mTORC1 modulation but only with TCS2-regulated costimulation. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation protects the myocardium against IR and is required for IPC by amplifying mTORC1 activity to favor glycolytic metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with either S1365A (TSC2SA; phospho-null) or S1365E (TSC2SE; phosphomimetic) knockin mutations were studied ex vivo and in vivo. In response to IR, hearts from TSC2SA mice had amplified mTORC1 activation and improved heart function compared with wild-type and TSC2SE hearts. The magnitude of protection matched IPC. IPC requited less S1365 phosphorylation, as TSC2SE hearts gained no benefit and failed to activate mTORC1 with IPC. IR metabolism was altered in TSC2SA, with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and glycolytic capacity (stressed/maximal extracellular acidification) after myocyte hypoxia-reperfusion. In whole heart, lactate increased and long-chain acylcarnitine levels declined during ischemia. The relative IR protection in TSC2SA was lost by lowering glucose in the perfusate by 36%. Adding fatty acid (palmitate) compensated for reduced glucose in wild type and TSC2SE but not TSC2SA which had the worst post-IR function under these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: TSC2-S1365 phosphorylation status regulates myocardial substrate utilization, and its decline activates mTORC1 biasing metabolism away from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis to confer protection against IR. This pathway is also engaged and reduced TSC2 S1365 phosphorylation required for effective IPC. Graphic Abstract: A graphic abstract is available for this article.",

Cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures in Dravet/Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. We report on the efficacy and safety of CBD for the treatment of DRE in patients with genetically proven GPI-AD. Patients and Methods: Patients received add-on treatment with purified GW-pharma CBD (Epidyolex ). Efficacy endpoints were the percentage of patients with >=50% (responders) or >25<50% (partial responders) reduction in monthly seizures from baseline and at 12 (M12) months of follow-up. Safety was evaluated through adverse events (AEs) monitoring. Results: Six patients (5 males) were enrolled. The median age at seizures onset was 5 months and the syndromic diagnosis was early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathy in 4 patients and focal non-lesional epilepsy or GEFS+ in one patient each. Five out of six (83%) patients were responders at M12, while one was a partial responder. No severe AEs were reported. Mean prescribed CBD dose was 17.85 mg/kg/day and median treatment duration is currently 27 months. Conclusions: In summary, off-label treatment with CBD was effective and safe in patients with DRE due to GPI-ADs.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fetal tumors are rare and usually followed by poor outcome. We describe our single-center experience with fetal tumors evaluated by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our aims were to evaluate mortality and morbidity including long-term outcome and to determine which ultrasound and MRI characteristics were helpful for pre- and perinatal management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on prenatally diagnosed tumors between 1998 and 2018. Poor outcome included fetal or neonatal death and survival with serious illness. MRI addressed tumor morphology (sacrococcygeal teratomas), compromise of surrounding structures (head and neck tumors) and early depiction of brain alterations specific to tuberous sclerosis (rhabdomyomas). RESULTS: Of 68 pregnancies, 15 (22%) were terminated and eight children (8/53, 15%) died pre- or postnatally. Of the 45 survivors (45/68, 66%), 24 (24/45, 53%) were healthy, eight (8/45, 18%) had a minor illness and 13 (13/45, 29%) a serious illness. Diffusion- and T1-weighted MRI reliably predicted tumor morphology in teratomas. To detect head and neck tumors critical to airway obstruction, MRI was superior to ultrasound in delivery planning. Rhabdomyomas were frequently associated with tuberous sclerosis, regardless of their number or size in ultrasound; MRI could depict specific brain alterations from the early third trimester onwards. For several rare tumors, MRI provided critical differential diagnoses that could not be clearly displayed in ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of survivors with serious long-term illness among fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of a tumor was high.

We describe our single-center experience with fetal tumors evaluated by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on prenatally diagnosed tumors between 1998 and 2018. Poor outcome included fetal or neonatal death and survival with serious illness. MRI addressed tumor morphology (sacrococcygeal teratomas), compromise of surrounding structures (head and neck tumors) and early depiction of brain alterations specific to tuberous sclerosis (rhabdomyomas). RESULTS: Of 68 pregnancies, 15 (22%) were terminated and eight children (8/53, 15%) died pre- or postnatally. Of the 45 survivors (45/68, 66%), 24 (24/45, 53%) were healthy, eight (8/45, 18%) had a minor illness and 13 (13/45, 29%) a serious illness.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Magnetic Resonance Imaging guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (MRIgLITT) is a promising treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) and an alternative to open surgery. However, the relationship between clinical and radiological factors and postoperative outcomes is unclear. This study explores the indications, technical challenges, and outcomes of MRIgLITT in terms of seizure control and cognitive changes across various pathologies. METHODS: A retrospective single-center analysis included 32 MRIgLITT procedures performed between January 2019 and December 2023. Procedures used the Visualase  system for laser ablation, with stereotactic robotic guidance for fiber placement. Data included demographics, clinical and surgical details (ablated volume, timing, power and accuracy), and postoperative follow-up assessed seizure outcomes and complications. Cognitive changes were analyzed using a Reliable Change Index (RCI) before and one year after the procedure. RESULTS: The 32 procedures involved 28 patients with MRI-diagnosed pathologies: 14 hippocampal sclerosis (HS), 7 hypothalamic hamartoma (HH), 3 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), 2 periventricular heterotopia (PVH), 1 tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and 1 low-grade glioma. Some cases required multiple approaches. Postoperative follow-up averaged 33 months. Among HS patients, 71.42% achieved Engel I, and 21.43% Engel II. In HH, 85.7% initially became gelastic seizure-free, with complete freedom after additional treatment. Engel I outcomes were 28.6%, while 57.2% showed significant improvement (Engel I + II). FCD patients had a 66.6% Engel I success rate. One PVH patient became seizure-free, while the TSC patient was Engel III at last follow-up. RCI analysis showed that 71.44% of patients experienced cognitive stability (RCI > -1.64) or improvement (RCI > 1.64) at one-year post-procedure. CONCLUSIONS: MRIgLITT is a safe, minimally invasive alternative for epilepsy surgery, offering quicker recovery and showing better performance preserving cognitive function. It is particularly effective for deep or complex epileptic foci and patients who might refuse open surgery.",

This study aims at evaluating the presence and outcome of COVID-19 in a cohort of Italian patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and/or lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and at reviewing the possible effects of mTOR inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included 102 unselected individuals with a diagnosis of TSC and/or LAM assessed between January 1, 2020 and April 24, 2020 (29% children, 71% adults). Twenty-six patients were on mTOR inhibitors. Demographic data, TSC manifestations, presence, and outcomes in individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Health status and outcomes of all patients on mTOR inhibitors were assessed. One patient with severe TSC had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, was admitted to ICU, and died. Nine additional patients either met the definition of suspect case or presented with at least two of the most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All recovered fully. None of the patients treated with mTOR inhibitors for their underlying comorbidities was diagnosed with COVID-19, and those who showed suspicious respiratory symptoms recovered fully. This cohort study provides preliminary information on COVID-19 in people with TSC in Italy and suggests feasibility to systematically evaluate the role of mTOR inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

                    "abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy, the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.",

CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a patient with refractory TRE who received deep brain stimulation of anterior thalamic nucleus (ANT-DBS) and achieved a satisfactory response. To our knowledge, this is the first case of TRE being treated with ANT-DBS. A 22-year-old male was admitted to the hospital for refractory TRE seeking surgical treatment. Seizures were mainly manifested by deep temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy and suspected to originate in the limbic system. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive potentially epileptogenic nodules in the brain lacking significant nodules. Scalp electroencephalogram showed a comprehensive, bilateral synchronous low-voltage rapid rhythm, unable to localize seizure origin. We performed bilateral ANT-DBS according to the preoperative evaluation, and the frequency and intensity of seizures were significantly reduced after the 15-month follow-up (P <0.05, Student's t-test). Our case extends the therapeutic indications of ANT-DBS to a certain extent, providing a neuromodulation alternative to vagus nerve stimulation for patients with TRE who are unsuitable candidates or refuse resection.",

TSC1 and TSC2 pathogenic variants lead to hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which disrupts cellular growth and differentiation. Epilepsy, affecting 85-90% of individuals with TSC, often presents within the first year of life and is commonly resistant to conventional therapies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and current treatment strategies for TSC-associated epilepsy, including pharmacological approaches such as vigabatrin, cannabidiol, and mTOR inhibitors, as well as non-pharmacological interventions such as ketogenic diet and epilepsy surgery. Preventive strategies, highlighted by robust trials, delay seizure onset and reduce its severity but have a limited impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Challenges include the heterogeneity of cortical tubers, suboptimal seizure control with existing therapies, and underutilization of neuropsychiatric care for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Advances in biomarkers, precision medicine, and surgical techniques have paved the way for personalized treatment approaches. Future research providing earlier detection strategies and integrating therapies targeting both the neurological and behavioral dimensions of TSC is ongoing. By addressing these needs, clinicians and researchers can enhance the quality of life and developmental outcomes of individuals with TSC.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditionally, intervention was recommended for angiomyolipomas (AMLs) >4 cm due to the risk of catastrophic hemorrhage. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the natural history of AMLs, including growth rates and need for intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review was performed of an AML series from 2002 to 2013, which have been followed prospectively until 2018. We defined lesion size by maximum axial diameter and categorized lesion size at baseline. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A total of 458 patients with 593 AMLs, with a median follow-up of 65.2 mo, were identified. At diagnosis, 534 (90.1%) lesions were <=4 cm. Forty-three interventions were required for 34 (5.7%) AMLs: 30 were treated with embolization, seven surgery, two with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), three with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and one with nivolumab when epithelioid AML was confirmed. The median size at intervention was 4.9 cm (range 1.1-29 cm). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Most (94%) of the lesions grew slowly (growth rate of <0.25 cm/yr) during the period of observation. The number of AMLs <4 cm needed to treat (NNT) prophylactically to prevent one emergent bleed would have been 136 or that to prevent one blood transfusion would have been 205. The NNT (<4 cm) prophylactically to prevent one elective intervention would have been 82. On multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in intervention rates based on tuberous sclerosis complex, size at presentation, and clinical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This large single-institution updated series of renal AMLs demonstrates that early intervention is not required, regardless of the traditional 4 cm cut-off. The vast majority of AMLs are indolent lesions that are predominantly asymptomatic and slow growing. Follow-up should be no more frequent than annually. PATIENT SUMMARY: The majority of angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are indolent, slow-growing lesions that do not require intervention, regardless of size at presentation. We suggest that surveillance is a safe initial approach for patients presenting with AMLs.",

TSC1 and TSC2 pathogenic variants lead to hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which disrupts cellular growth and differentiation. Epilepsy, affecting 85-90% of individuals with TSC, often presents within the first year of life and is commonly resistant to conventional therapies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and current treatment strategies for TSC-associated epilepsy, including pharmacological approaches such as vigabatrin, cannabidiol, and mTOR inhibitors, as well as non-pharmacological interventions such as ketogenic diet and epilepsy surgery. Preventive strategies, highlighted by robust trials, delay seizure onset and reduce its severity but have a limited impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Challenges include the heterogeneity of cortical tubers, suboptimal seizure control with existing therapies, and underutilization of neuropsychiatric care for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Advances in biomarkers, precision medicine, and surgical techniques have paved the way for personalized treatment approaches. Future research providing earlier detection strategies and integrating therapies targeting both the neurological and behavioral dimensions of TSC is ongoing. By addressing these needs, clinicians and researchers can enhance the quality of life and developmental outcomes of individuals with TSC.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgery has become integral in treating children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes of a multimodal diagnostic and therapeutic approach comprising invasive intracranial monitoring and surgical treatment and compare the complementary techniques of open resection and magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy. METHODS: Clinical and radiographic data were prospectively collected for pediatric patients undergoing surgical evaluation for TSC-related DRE at our tertiary academic hospital. Seizure freedom, developmental improvement, and Engel class were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20 females) underwent treatment in January 2016 to April 2019. Thirty-five underwent phase II invasive monitoring with intracranial electrodes: 24 stereoencephalography, 9 craniotomy for grid/electrode placement, and 2 grids + stereoencephalography. With the multimodal approach, 33/38 patients (87%) achieved >50% seizure freedom of the targeted seizure type after initial treatment; 6/9 requiring secondary treatment and 2/2 requiring a third treatment achieved >50% freedom. The median Engel class was II at last follow-up (1.65 years), and 55% of patients were Engel class I/II. The mean age was lower for children undergoing open resection (2.4 vs 4.9 years, P = .04). Rates of >50% reduction in seizures (86% open resection vs 88% laser interstitial thermal therapy) and developmental improvement (86% open resection vs 83% magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy) were similar. CONCLUSION: This hybrid approach of using both open surgical and minimally invasive techniques is safe and effective in treating DRE secondary to TSC. Clinical trials focused on treatment method with longer follow-up are needed to determine the optimal candidates for each approach and compare the treatment modalities more effectively.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are WHO grade 1 tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis that classically arise from the ventricular wall near the caudate groove and foramen of Monro. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive surgical technique, which works by heating a stereotactically placed laser fiber to ablative temperatures under MRI thermometry monitoring. In this paper, the authors present LITT as a surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs. METHODS: Twelve patients with SEGAs who underwent 16 procedures between 2007 and 2022 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. These patients underwent either open resection or LITT. Clinical data, imaging, recurrence rate, further treatments, and related complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 16 procedures, 9 were open resection and 7 were LITT. An external ventricular drain was placed in 66% (6/9) of open procedures and 57.1% (4/7) of LITT cases. A septostomy was performed in 56% (5/9) of open procedures and 29% (2/7) of LITT cases. Complication rates were higher in open cases than in LITT procedures (44% vs 0%, p < 0.05). Complications included hydrocephalus, transient venous ischemia, wound infection, and bone flap migration. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 3.3-5.5 days) for open cases and 4 days (IQR 3.0-7.0 days) for LITT procedures. Recurrence or progression occurred after 3 open cases and 2 LITT cases (33% vs 33%, p = 0.803). For the recurrences, 2 open cases underwent stereotactic radiosurgery, 1 open case underwent LITT, and 1 LITT case underwent repeat LITT. Among the LITT cases, only the patients with no decrease in tumor size by 6 months experienced tumor progression afterward. The 2 LITT cases with progression were the only ones with calcification present on preoperative imaging. The median follow-up times for cases assessed for progression were 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-14.4 years) for open resection and 3.9 years (IQR 3.4-5.1 years) for LITT. CONCLUSIONS: The small size of this case series limits generalizability or adequate comparison of safety. However, this series adds to the literature supporting LITT as a less invasive surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs and demonstrates that LITT has similar recurrence and/or progression rates to open resection. Additional studies with more data are necessary for comprehensive comparisons between open resection and LITT for treating SEGA.",

METHODS: We evaluated patients with ES from the CDKL5 Centers of Excellence and the National Infantile Spasms Consortium (NISC), with onset from 2 months to 2 years, treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), oral corticosteroids, vigabatrin, and/or the ketogenic diet. We excluded children with tuberous sclerosis complex, trisomy 21, or unknown etiology with normal development because of known differential treatment responses. We compared the two cohorts for time to treatment and ES remission at 14 days and 3 months. RESULTS: We evaluated 59 individuals with CDD (79% female, median ES onset 6 months) and 232 individuals from the NISC database (46% female, median onset 7 months). In the CDD cohort, seizures prior to ES were common (88%), and hypsarrhythmia and its variants were present at ES onset in 34%. Initial treatment with ACTH, oral corticosteroids, or vigabatrin started within 1 month of ES onset in 27 of 59 (46%) of the CDD cohort and 182 of 232 (78%) of the NISC cohort (p < .0001). Fourteen-day clinical remission of ES was lower for the CDD group (26%, 7/27) than for the NISC cohort (58%, 106/182, p = .0002). Sustained ES remission at 3 months occurred in 1 of 27 (4%) of CDD patients vs 96 of 182 (53%) of the NISC cohort (p < .0001). Comparable results were observed with longer lead time (>=1 month) or prior treatment. Ketogenic diet, used within 3 months of ES onset, resulted in ES remission at 1 month, sustained at 3 months, in at least 2 of 13 (15%) individuals with CDD. SIGNIFICANCE: Compared to the broad group of infants with ES, children with ES in the setting of CDD often experience longer lead time to treatment and respond poorly to standard treatments. Development of alternative treatments for ES in CDD is needed.",

                    "abstract": "Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign tumor of the kidney. It consists of blood vessels, smooth muscle and fat components in varying proportions. AML is divided into the sporadic type and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated type. TSC-associated AML develops at a younger age and tends to exhibit a much faster growth rate over time than sporadic AML. AMLs are classified as classic AML, fat-poor AML and epithelioid AML. Epithelioid AML, though rare, shows aggressive behavior leading to distant metastasis and mortality. TSC-associated AML is more likely to have an epithelioid component than sporadic AML. Active surveillance is the suggested management for small AML. Clinical intervention is mainly indicated when there is a substantial risk of rupture. Minimally invasive therapies, including partial nephrectomy, transcatheter arterial embolization, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor treatment are employed for patients who require treatment. An updated algorithm for the management of AML is herein described. According to this algorithm, treatment intervention is recommended for TSC-associated AML >3 cm, even in asymptomatic cases. In cases with asymptomatic sporadic AML >4 cm in size or with an intra-tumoral aneurysm of >5 mm, treatment, including transcatheter arterial embolization or partial nephrectomy, is advised. The major complication of AML is intra-tumoral or retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to rupture that may be serious and life threatening. Thus, correct diagnosis, proper observation, and appropriate treatment are very important in the management of renal AML.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multi-institutional retrospective study enrolled renal AML patients who underwent partial nephrectomy (PN) or total nephrectomy after receiving at least 1 month of pre-operative everolimus. Imaging evaluations were collected before and after treatment, along with demographic, surgical, and follow-up information. The primary outcome was tumor volume reduction of >=25%, with additional outcomes including recurrence, perioperative outcomes, renal function, and safety. RESULTS: From January 2015 to July 2022, 68 renal AML patients were studied-41 with TSC and 27 without. During everolimus treatment, 61.0% (25/41) of TSC patients and 44.4% (12/27) of non-TSC patients achieved tumor reduction of >=25%. Additionally, 41.5% (17/41) of TSC patients and 18.5% (5/27) of non-TSC patients achieved a >= 50% reduction. Three TSC patients and 1 non-TSC patient discontinued treatment due to side-effects. Most patients (92.7% TSC, 85.2% non-TSC) underwent PN. After everolimus treatment, the necessary total nephrectomy decreased to 41.2% (7/17) from baseline. Postoperatively, 1 grade 3 and 3 grade 2 complications occurred, with no grade 4 or 5 complications. After a median follow-up of 24 months, only 1 TSC patient recurred with a diameter >3 cm. Retrospective nature is the major limitation of this study. CONCLUSION: Everolimus was effective and well-tolerated in neoadjuvant treatment for renal AML, especially in TSC patients. This neoadjuvant combination strategy of everolimus and PN could effectively controls recurrence and preserves renal function.",

Astute recognition of an index patient affected by a hereditary syndrome can lead to a \"tip-of-the-iceberg\" phenomenon whereby their entire kindred can then be proactively monitored and managed potentially with substantial reduction of morbidity and mortality. Through careful history-taking, as well as thoughtful assimilation of findings from the physical exam, biochemical laboratories, scans, and pathology reports, the clinician can spot phenotypic clues that distinguish these familial patterns from sporadic cases of tumorigenesis.",

This study aims at evaluating the presence and outcome of COVID-19 in a cohort of Italian patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and/or lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and at reviewing the possible effects of mTOR inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included 102 unselected individuals with a diagnosis of TSC and/or LAM assessed between January 1, 2020 and April 24, 2020 (29% children, 71% adults). Twenty-six patients were on mTOR inhibitors. Demographic data, TSC manifestations, presence, and outcomes in individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Health status and outcomes of all patients on mTOR inhibitors were assessed. One patient with severe TSC had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, was admitted to ICU, and died. Nine additional patients either met the definition of suspect case or presented with at least two of the most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All recovered fully. None of the patients treated with mTOR inhibitors for their underlying comorbidities was diagnosed with COVID-19, and those who showed suspicious respiratory symptoms recovered fully. This cohort study provides preliminary information on COVID-19 in people with TSC in Italy and suggests feasibility to systematically evaluate the role of mTOR inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

It can cause fatal complications if it ruptures. Although there have been reports of RAMLs rupturing, it is unusual to see RAMLs rupture during pregnancy, especially in pregnant women with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Moreover, we reported a rare complication after selective arterial embolization (SAE) for the first time, which called aseptic liquefaction necrosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is a 16-week-pregnant woman with TSC who presented with severe flank pain, which was secondary to the rupture of a large, previously unknown RAML. This was confirmed by emergency computed tomography and successfully treated with selective arterial embolization after the patient received counselling and provided prior informed written consent for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). The patient underwent abortion 3 weeks after the SAE. The patient required drainage 2 months after the SAE because of aseptic liquefaction necrosis. During follow-up, the patient's lesion remained stable. CONCLUSION: RAML rupture is a rare but rather serious complication in pregnant tuberous sclerosis patients. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) should be performed immediately, and the status of the pregnancy needs to be assessed by a multidisciplinary team. We also report for the first time the rare complication of aseptic liquefaction necrosis after SAE of RAML, for which percutaneous drainage is effective.",

Arterial hypertension is one of its uncommon complications, which is supposed to be caused by renal cysts or angiomyolipomas. Few studies have been reported in the literature on renal artery stenosis (RAS) as the cause of hypertension in TSC. Hence, we reported a boy who presented with uncontrolled hypertension under five anti-hypertension drugs and was diagnosed with TSC complicated with left RAS. His high blood pressure was relieved by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA). In one and a half years follow-up, his blood pressure was normal whilst he took four anti-hypertensive drugs. In conclusion, children with TCS complicated with hypertension should be carefully screened for RAS, which might be relieved by percutaneous balloon dilatation.",

Here, we show in model systems that other than loss of RB1 few gene-copy number (CN) alterations are associated with irreversible-resistance to endocrine therapy and subsequent secondary resistance to palbociclib. Resistance to palbociclib occurred as a result of tumour cell re-wiring leading to increased expression of EGFR, MAPK, CDK4, CDK2, CDK7, CCNE1 and CCNE2. Resistance altered the ER genome wide-binding pattern, leading to decreased expression of 'classical' oestrogen-regulated genes and was accompanied by reduced sensitivity to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. Persistent CDK4 blockade decreased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) enhancing EGFR signalling, leading to the re-wiring of ER. Kinome-knockdown confirmed dependency on ERBB-signalling and G2/M-checkpoint proteins such as WEE1, together with the cell cycle master regulator, CDK7. Noteworthy, sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition was associated with loss of ER and RB1 CN. Overall, we show that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors is dependent on kinase re-wiring and the redeployment of signalling cascades previously associated with endocrine resistance and highlights new therapeutic networks that can be exploited upon relapse after CDK4/6 inhibition.",

Rapalogs and mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKi) have recently been applied to alleviate epileptic seizures in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Herein, we describe a pharmacophore exploration to identify a highly potent, selective, brain penetrant TORKi. An extensive investigation of the morpholine ring engaging the mTOR solvent exposed region led to the discovery of PQR626 (8). 8 displayed excellent brain penetration and was well-tolerated in mice. In mice with a conditionally inactivated Tsc1 gene in glia, 8 significantly reduced the loss of Tsc1-induced mortality at 50 mg/kg p.o. twice a day. 8 overcomes the metabolic liabilities of PQR620 (52), the first-in-class brain penetrant TORKi showing efficacy in a TSC mouse model. The improved stability in human hepatocytes, excellent brain penetration, and efficacy in Tsc1GFAPCKO mice qualify 8 as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neurological disorders.",

METHODS: Data from 24 consecutive TSC surgical candidates who underwent both HR-ESI and LTM-VEEG was retrospectively collected. PHS and VS were analyzed to hypothesize the symptomatogenic zone localization. LTM-VEEG and HR-ESI localization results were extracted from the diagnostic reports. Localizing value was compared between modalities, taken the resected/disconnected area of surgical patients in consideration. HR-ESI's impact on the epileptogenic zone hypothesis and surgical workup was evaluated. RESULTS: Semiology, interictal EEG, ictal EEG and HR-ESI were localizing in 25%, 54%, 63% and 79% of patients. Inter-modality concordance ranged between 33-89%. In good surgical outcome patients, PHS, VS, interictal EEG, ictal EEG and HR-ESI showed concordance with resected area in 1/9 (11%), 0/9 (0%), 4/9 (44%), 3/9 (33%) and 6/9 patients (67%). HR-ESI positively impacts clinical management in 50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In presurgical evaluation of TSC patients, semiology often has limited localizing value. Presurgical work-up benefits from HR-ESI. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings may advice future presurgical epilepsy workup of TSC patients with the ultimate aim to improve outcome.",

Astute recognition of an index patient affected by a hereditary syndrome can lead to a \"tip-of-the-iceberg\" phenomenon whereby their entire kindred can then be proactively monitored and managed potentially with substantial reduction of morbidity and mortality. Through careful history-taking, as well as thoughtful assimilation of findings from the physical exam, biochemical laboratories, scans, and pathology reports, the clinician can spot phenotypic clues that distinguish these familial patterns from sporadic cases of tumorigenesis.",

Initial treatment with antiseizure medications is empiric, and consideration of surgery is the standard of care for eligible patients with medically refractory epilepsy. In the past decade, advances in next generation sequencing technologies have accelerated progress in understanding the genetic etiologies of MCDs, and precision therapies for focal MCDs are emerging. Notably, mutations that lead to abnormal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which provides critical control of cell growth and proliferation, have emerged as a common cause of malformations. These include tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), hemimegalencephaly (HME), and some types of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). TSC currently represents the best example for the pathway from gene discovery to relatively safe and efficacious targeted therapy for epilepsy related to MCDs. Based on extensive pre-clinical and clinical data, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is currently approved for the treatment of focal refractory seizures in patients with TSC. Although clinical studies are just emerging for FCD and HME, we believe the next decade will bring significant advancements in precision therapies for epilepsy related to these and other MCDs.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus have activity against multiple manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex and are approved to treat astrocytomas, angiomyolipomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and epilepsy. Cannabidiol is a novel antiepileptic medication. There is lack of information regarding drug-drug interactions between mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors and cannabidiol in clinical practice. METHODS: We reviewed patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who were treated with a mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor (everolimus, sirolimus) and cannabidiol. Clinical information, mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor and cannabidiol dosing, concomitant antiepileptic drugs, as well as laboratory and adverse events were reviewed before and after initiation of cannabidiol. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were treated with cannabidiol and a mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor (18 everolimus, seven sirolimus). All mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor levels were drawn as troughs. Levels were significantly higher in 76% patients after cannabidiol treatment (P = 0.0003). Median change from baseline was +9.8 ng/mL for everolimus and +5.1 ng/mL for sirolimus. Adverse events occurred in 40%, with diarrhea being the most frequent adverse event occurring in three patients. No severe adverse events occurred during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabidiol resulted in increased serum levels of everolimus and/or sirolimus. Some patients experienced doubling or tripling of their mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor trough following the addition of cannabidiol. In some cases, this resulted in clinical toxicity, as well as laboratory abnormalities. Awareness of this interaction can lead clinicians to evaluate serum levels and other safety laboratory studies more closely, and thereby avoid potentially significant adverse effects. In patients known to be prone to mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor toxicity, preemptive reduction in dose may be warranted upon initiation of cannabidiol.",

TSC1 and TSC2 pathogenic variants lead to hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which disrupts cellular growth and differentiation. Epilepsy, affecting 85-90% of individuals with TSC, often presents within the first year of life and is commonly resistant to conventional therapies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and current treatment strategies for TSC-associated epilepsy, including pharmacological approaches such as vigabatrin, cannabidiol, and mTOR inhibitors, as well as non-pharmacological interventions such as ketogenic diet and epilepsy surgery. Preventive strategies, highlighted by robust trials, delay seizure onset and reduce its severity but have a limited impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Challenges include the heterogeneity of cortical tubers, suboptimal seizure control with existing therapies, and underutilization of neuropsychiatric care for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Advances in biomarkers, precision medicine, and surgical techniques have paved the way for personalized treatment approaches. Future research providing earlier detection strategies and integrating therapies targeting both the neurological and behavioral dimensions of TSC is ongoing. By addressing these needs, clinicians and researchers can enhance the quality of life and developmental outcomes of individuals with TSC.",

Regarding clinical manifestations, a wide range of phenotypic variability exists, with symptoms constellations that may differ in affected organs (brain, skin, heart, eyes, kidneys, lungs), age of presentation and severity, but usually with great impact in biopsychosocial aspects of health and in quality of life. Main clinical neurological features are epilepsy (frequently, antiepileptic drug-resistant epilepsy), neuropsychiatric disorders, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Recently, many therapeutic strategies have developed, including preventive treatment of epilepsy, new options for treatment of epilepsy as cannabidiol, mTOR inhibitors, ketogenic diet, and a more precise epilepsy surgery. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas may require surgical procedures or mTOR inhibitors treatment. mTOR inhibitors may also be useful for other comorbidities. To improve quality of life of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, it is essential to be able to deliver an integrated approach by specialized multidisciplinary teams, coordinated with primary care physicians and health professionals, that include access to treatments, attention of psychosocial aspects, and an adequate health care transition from pediatric to adult care.",

RCC often presents without early symptoms, leading to late diagnosis. Prognosis varies widely based on the stage of cancer at diagnosis. In the early-stage, localized RCC has a relatively good prognosis, while advanced or metastatic RCC has a poor outcome. Obesity, smoking, genetic mutations and family history are all considered risk factors for RCC, while inherited disorders, such as Tuberous Sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, are causally associated with RCC development. Genetic screening, deep sequencing analysis, quantitative proteomics and immunostaining analysis on RCC tissues, biological fluids and blood samples have been employed to identify novel biomarkers, predisposing factors and therapeutic targets for RCC with important clinical implications for patient treatment. Combined approaches of gene-targeting strategies coupled to a deep functional analysis of cancer cell biology, both in vitro and in appropriate animal models of RCC, significantly contributed to identify and characterize relevant pathogenic mechanisms underlying development and progression of RCC. These studies provided also important cues for the generation of novel target-specific therapeutics that selectively restore deranged cancer cell signalling and dysfunctional immune checkpoints, positively impacting on the survival rate of treated RCC patients. In this review, we will describe the recent discoveries concerning the most relevant pathogenic mechanisms of RCC and will highlight novel therapeutic strategies that interrupt oncogenic pathways and restore immune defences in RCC patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditionally, intervention was recommended for angiomyolipomas (AMLs) >4 cm due to the risk of catastrophic hemorrhage. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the natural history of AMLs, including growth rates and need for intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review was performed of an AML series from 2002 to 2013, which have been followed prospectively until 2018. We defined lesion size by maximum axial diameter and categorized lesion size at baseline. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A total of 458 patients with 593 AMLs, with a median follow-up of 65.2 mo, were identified. At diagnosis, 534 (90.1%) lesions were <=4 cm. Forty-three interventions were required for 34 (5.7%) AMLs: 30 were treated with embolization, seven surgery, two with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), three with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and one with nivolumab when epithelioid AML was confirmed. The median size at intervention was 4.9 cm (range 1.1-29 cm). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Most (94%) of the lesions grew slowly (growth rate of <0.25 cm/yr) during the period of observation. The number of AMLs <4 cm needed to treat (NNT) prophylactically to prevent one emergent bleed would have been 136 or that to prevent one blood transfusion would have been 205. The NNT (<4 cm) prophylactically to prevent one elective intervention would have been 82. On multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in intervention rates based on tuberous sclerosis complex, size at presentation, and clinical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This large single-institution updated series of renal AMLs demonstrates that early intervention is not required, regardless of the traditional 4 cm cut-off. The vast majority of AMLs are indolent lesions that are predominantly asymptomatic and slow growing. Follow-up should be no more frequent than annually. PATIENT SUMMARY: The majority of angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are indolent, slow-growing lesions that do not require intervention, regardless of size at presentation. We suggest that surveillance is a safe initial approach for patients presenting with AMLs.",

Material and methods: A retrospective review of all 58 consecutive embolisations at two institutions, between 1999 and 2018, was performed. Clinical notes, laboratory data and imaging were reviewed. RESULTS: The overall complication rate was 6.8%, with no Clavien-Dindo grades III-V complications. Kidney function was unaffected by embolisation as measured by creatinine. Median radiological follow-up was 4.8 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.8-7.8), and median clinical follow-up was 7.5 years (IQR: 4.7-14.0). Decreasing AML size was observed in 96% of procedures. Maximal shrinkage (30% median diameter decrease; IQR: 15-44) was reached after median 2.2 years (IQR: 0.6-4.8). During follow-up, regrowth occurred in 38% of patients, and four bleeding episodes occurred in three patients with tuberous sclerosis. Growing size and/or rebleeding prompted a redo embolisation in 9% of spontaneous AML and 50% of tuberous sclerosis-associated AML. CONCLUSIONS: Being a well-tolerated treatment with few complications, selective arterial embolisation renders a pronounced size-reduction in most patients with AML, and kidney function is preserved. Regrowth is common, and a radiological follow-up is necessary. Tuberous sclerosis is a risk factor for the need of reintervention.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We implemented an infantile spasms management guideline recommending standard therapies and, early start of next treatment. After six years, we determined (1) our compliance with standard therapies, (2) time to next treatment, and (3) rate of initial and three-month electroclinical remission with first, second, and third treatments. METHODS: This is a retrospective record review of newly diagnosed spasms from September 2012 to September 2018, with the onset age of two months to two years. RESULTS: Standard therapies (hormone or vigabatrin) were the first treatments in 114 of 115 consecutive patients. The second and third treatments were started within 14 days of failed treatment in only 21% and 24%, respectively. Remission with the first and second treatments was similar (41% and 40%). Remission was lower for the third treatment (15%), although higher if standard therapy was used (36%). Initial and three-month remission by the first treatment was significantly higher for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 66% and 79%, respectively) and prednisolone (53% and 83%, respectively) than for vigabatrin (19% and 40%, respectively). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or rates of remission between ACTH and prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Although we achieved excellent compliance with standard therapies as initial treatment, a next treatment often started after two weeks. Given the superiority of hormone therapies over vigabatrin and standard therapies over nonstandard therapies, as well as the potentially negative impact of delays in effective treatment, future interventions need to focus on increasing the use of hormone over vigabatrin (for patients without tuberous sclerosis complex), use of standard therapies as second and third treatments, and reducing delays to next treatment.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of 3-T intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) on the extent of resection of pediatric focal epileptogenic lesions, residual lesion volumes, and postoperative seizure outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. All surgical procedures for focal epilepsy from 2003 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent ioMRI and those who did not. Each group was subdivided into two subcategories according to preoperative MRI visualization of the lesion: those with well-defined and those with poorly defined lesions. The volumes of preoperative lesions and postoperative residual lesions were delineated. Outcome data and patient characteristics were reviewed. The results were compared between the two groups and the two subcategories. RESULTS. Eighty patients were included: 45 in the ioMRI group (24 with well-defined lesions, 21 with poorly defined lesions) and 35 in the non-ioMRI group (18 with well-defined lesions, 17 with poorly defined lesions). The well-defined lesions included tumors and vascular lesions. The poorly defined lesions included malformations of cortical development, hippocampal sclerosis, and tuberous sclerosis. The mean follow-up duration was 5.1 +- 3.3 years. The rate of gross total resection was not significantly different between the ioMRI and non-ioMRI groups (p = 0.46). However, ioMRI findings facilitated further resection during surgery, increasing gross total resection by an additional 11.1%. The ioMRI group had a significant reduction in percentage of residual volume (p < 0.001). Outcome data suggested that ioMRI is protective against poor Engel score (p = 0.048). Although ioMRI prolonged the mean operative time by 1.2 hours (p = 0.002), the additional time was not associated with additional complications. CONCLUSION. Integration of ioMRI into focal epilepsy surgery was associated with smaller residual lesions and was protective against poor Engel score. It prolonged the operative time but without increasing the number of complications.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by mutations of either of 2 genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Renal manifestations include angiomyolipomas (AMLs), multiple cysts, and renal cell carcinoma. AMLs increase bleeding tendency and the risk of renal insufficiency which end-stage develops in 1% of affected patients. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman suffering from TSC since early childhood has developed multiple complications associated with this disease. The patient was diagnosed with brain tumor-giant cell astrocytoma-which was removed in 1992. In 2006, right nephrectomy was performed due to the unsuccessful right renal artery embolization after the massive hemorrhage into the AML. Moreover, the right idiopathic pneumothorax occurred twice. Therefore, the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pleurodesis were conducted (2006, 2013). The patient is intellectually disabled and unable to make decisions on her own. Her legal guardians (parents) make all decisions associated with her treatment. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures demanding cooperation were conducted under anesthesia. Because of end-stage renal failure, the patient required the renal replacement therapy (RRT). Preemptive kidney transplantation (KTx) was the best solution for this patient. Procedures such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were infeasible to perform due to the intellectual disability that inhibits essential cooperation. During KTx qualification tests, the expanding AML with risk of hemorrhage was noticed. The patient was qualified for simultaneous left nephrectomy and KTx from the living donor (her father). The surgery was performed on the 2nd of June 2020. The patient is looked after by her parents, stays in good general condition. The patient's creatinine level is maintained at 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: Patients with significant intellectual disability that prevents maintaining conscious cooperation who require RRT must have individually adjusted therapy. In the case of the presented patient, it was decided to perform the preemptive kidney transplantation from her determined father.",

Both TSC1 and TSC2 inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation, and is stimulated by various energy sources and hormonal signaling pathways. Pathogenic variants in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to mTORC1 hyperactivation, producing benign tumours in multiple organs, including the brain and kidneys, and drug-resistant epilepsy, a typical sign of TSC. Brain tumours, sudden unexpected death from epilepsy, and respiratory conditions are the three leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Even though several therapeutic options are available for the treatment of TSC, there is further need for a better understanding of the pathophysiological basis of the neurologic and other manifestations seen in TSC, and for novel therapeutic approaches. This review provides an overview of the main current therapies for TSC and discusses recent studies highlighting the repurposing of approved drugs and the emerging role of novel targets for future drug design.",

During the past decade, efforts have focused on development of new treatment options for DEEs, with several recently approved in the United States or Europe, including cannabidiol as an orphan drug in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes and everolimus as a possible antiepileptogenic and precision drug for tuberous sclerosis complex, with its impact on the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Furthermore, fenfluramine, an old drug, was repurposed as a novel therapy in the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The evolution of new insights into pathophysiological processes of various DEEs provides possibilities to investigate novel and repurposed drugs and to place them into the context of their role in future management of these patients. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of these new medical treatment options for the DEEs and to discuss the clinical implications of these results for improved treatment.",

Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden. This research establishes mRNA LNPs as a promising therapeutic intervention for the treatment of LAM.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to reduce seizures among patients with refractory epilepsies of various etiologies in recent clinical trials and an expanded access program (EAP). Most studies report efficacy over short time periods (<1 year), with little published on longer term efficacy. Here, we investigate the efficacy of CBD for a treatment period of up to 60 months (median = 45.5 months). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patient-reported seizure logs and medical records for 54 subjects with refractory epilepsy who enrolled in the Massachusetts General Hospital's open-label EAP for CBD as a new treatment for epilepsy. We analyzed the effect of CBD on seizure frequencies and concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use at 1 year after starting treatment and the most recent study visit. RESULTS: Our results indicate that CBD maintains its efficacy for controlling seizures from Year 1 to the most recent study visit. The percentage of seizure responders remained similar at these time points (41.7%-42.6%), and the seizure response rate was also maintained (p = .12). Efficacy was also seen over a broad dose range, and up to 50 mg/kg/day. CBD was particularly effective for controlling seizures in the setting of tuberous sclerosis complex and for reducing epileptic spasms and absence seizures. Although CBD use did not lead to an overall decrease in concomitant AEDs, most subjects reduced the dose of at least one concomitant AED compared to baseline. CBD was generally well tolerated, with drowsiness and diarrhea as the primary adverse reactions. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates CBD does not lose its efficacy in controlling seizures over a treatment period of up to 60 months. Taken alongside other results on the efficacy and tolerability of CBD in the treatment of refractory epilepsies, our results provide evidence that CBD is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated AED for long-term use.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fetal tumors are rare and usually followed by poor outcome. We describe our single-center experience with fetal tumors evaluated by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our aims were to evaluate mortality and morbidity including long-term outcome and to determine which ultrasound and MRI characteristics were helpful for pre- and perinatal management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on prenatally diagnosed tumors between 1998 and 2018. Poor outcome included fetal or neonatal death and survival with serious illness. MRI addressed tumor morphology (sacrococcygeal teratomas), compromise of surrounding structures (head and neck tumors) and early depiction of brain alterations specific to tuberous sclerosis (rhabdomyomas). RESULTS: Of 68 pregnancies, 15 (22%) were terminated and eight children (8/53, 15%) died pre- or postnatally. Of the 45 survivors (45/68, 66%), 24 (24/45, 53%) were healthy, eight (8/45, 18%) had a minor illness and 13 (13/45, 29%) a serious illness. Diffusion- and T1-weighted MRI reliably predicted tumor morphology in teratomas. To detect head and neck tumors critical to airway obstruction, MRI was superior to ultrasound in delivery planning. Rhabdomyomas were frequently associated with tuberous sclerosis, regardless of their number or size in ultrasound; MRI could depict specific brain alterations from the early third trimester onwards. For several rare tumors, MRI provided critical differential diagnoses that could not be clearly displayed in ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of survivors with serious long-term illness among fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of a tumor was high. MRI is specifically helpful for risk stratification in fetal teratomas and delivery planning in head and neck tumors.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disordered hepatic energy metabolism is found in obese rats with insulin resistance (IR). There are insufficient experimental studies of electroacupuncture (EA) for IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to probe the effect of EA on disordered hepatic energy metabolism and the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70-kDa (p70S6K) signaling pathway. METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were randomly divided into three groups: EA group receiving EA treatment; Pi group receiving pioglitazone gavage; and ZF group remaining untreated (n = 8 per group). Inbred non-insulin-resistant Zucker lean rats formed an (untreated) healthy control group (ZL, n = 8). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate the liver morphologically. The mitochondrial structure of hepatocytes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blotting was adopted to determine protein expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK, tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and p70S6K, and their phosphorylation. RT-PCR was used to quantify IRS-1, mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK and p70S6K mRNA levels. RESULTS: Compared with the ZF group, FPG, FINS, C-peptide, CRP and HOMA-IR levels were significantly reduced in the EA group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Evaluation of histopathology showed improvement in liver appearances following EA. Phosphorylation levels of AMPK, mTOR and TSC2 decreased, and IRS-1 and p70S6K increased, in hepatocytes of the ZF group, while these negative effects appeared to be alleviated by EA. CONCLUSIONS: EA can effectively ameliorate IR and regulate energy metabolism in the ZDF rat model. AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K and related molecules may represent a potential mechanism of action underlying these effects.",

Arterial hypertension is one of its uncommon complications, which is supposed to be caused by renal cysts or angiomyolipomas. Few studies have been reported in the literature on renal artery stenosis (RAS) as the cause of hypertension in TSC. Hence, we reported a boy who presented with uncontrolled hypertension under five anti-hypertension drugs and was diagnosed with TSC complicated with left RAS. His high blood pressure was relieved by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA). In one and a half years follow-up, his blood pressure was normal whilst he took four anti-hypertensive drugs. In conclusion, children with TCS complicated with hypertension should be carefully screened for RAS, which might be relieved by percutaneous balloon dilatation.",

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of optimized and high-density stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) in treating TSC-related epilepsy. METHODS: Nine TSC children with refractory epilepsy were treated with first-stage SEEG-Guided RF-TC, and four underwent second-stage-optimized high-density array of SEEG-Guided RF-TC. Patients' clinical data and postoperative outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The patients' median age at surgery was 4 years and 2 month (range from 3 years and 5 month to 16 years and 7 month). The mean age at surgery was 6.7 years old. Eight in 9 (88.9%) patients achieved complete remission after the final operation at half-year follow-up. Of seven patients with final postoperative time beyond 1 year, 6 (85.7%) reached completely seizure-free. No severe or long-term neurologic impairment existed in all nine patients.

However, the relationship between clinical and radiological factors and postoperative outcomes is unclear. This study explores the indications, technical challenges, and outcomes of MRIgLITT in terms of seizure control and cognitive changes across various pathologies. METHODS: A retrospective single-center analysis included 32 MRIgLITT procedures performed between January 2019 and December 2023. Procedures used the Visualase  system for laser ablation, with stereotactic robotic guidance for fiber placement. Data included demographics, clinical and surgical details (ablated volume, timing, power and accuracy), and postoperative follow-up assessed seizure outcomes and complications. Cognitive changes were analyzed using a Reliable Change Index (RCI) before and one year after the procedure. RESULTS: The 32 procedures involved 28 patients with MRI-diagnosed pathologies: 14 hippocampal sclerosis (HS), 7 hypothalamic hamartoma (HH), 3 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), 2 periventricular heterotopia (PVH), 1 tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and 1 low-grade glioma. Some cases required multiple approaches. Postoperative follow-up averaged 33 months. Among HS patients, 71.42% achieved Engel I, and 21.43% Engel II. In HH, 85.7% initially became gelastic seizure-free, with complete freedom after additional treatment. Engel I outcomes were 28.6%, while 57.2% showed significant improvement (Engel I + II). FCD patients had a 66.6% Engel I success rate. One PVH patient became seizure-free, while the TSC patient was Engel III at last follow-up. RCI analysis showed that 71.44% of patients experienced cognitive stability (RCI > -1.64) or improvement (RCI > 1.64) at one-year post-procedure. CONCLUSIONS: MRIgLITT is a safe, minimally invasive alternative for epilepsy surgery, offering quicker recovery and showing better performance preserving cognitive function. It is particularly effective for deep or complex epileptic foci and patients who might refuse open surgery.",

Median radiological follow-up was 4.8 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.8-7.8), and median clinical follow-up was 7.5 years (IQR: 4.7-14.0). Decreasing AML size was observed in 96% of procedures. Maximal shrinkage (30% median diameter decrease; IQR: 15-44) was reached after median 2.2 years (IQR: 0.6-4.8). During follow-up, regrowth occurred in 38% of patients, and four bleeding episodes occurred in three patients with tuberous sclerosis. Growing size and/or rebleeding prompted a redo embolisation in 9% of spontaneous AML and 50% of tuberous sclerosis-associated AML. CONCLUSIONS: Being a well-tolerated treatment with few complications, selective arterial embolisation renders a pronounced size-reduction in most patients with AML, and kidney function is preserved. Regrowth is common, and a radiological follow-up is necessary. Tuberous sclerosis is a risk factor for the need of reintervention.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Renal angiomyolipoma (RAML) is a rare benign kidney tumour comprised of adipose tissue, smooth muscle, and blood vessels. It can cause fatal complications if it ruptures. Although there have been reports of RAMLs rupturing, it is unusual to see RAMLs rupture during pregnancy, especially in pregnant women with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Moreover, we reported a rare complication after selective arterial embolization (SAE) for the first time, which called aseptic liquefaction necrosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The case is a 16-week-pregnant woman with TSC who presented with severe flank pain, which was secondary to the rupture of a large, previously unknown RAML. This was confirmed by emergency computed tomography and successfully treated with selective arterial embolization after the patient received counselling and provided prior informed written consent for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). The patient underwent abortion 3 weeks after the SAE. The patient required drainage 2 months after the SAE because of aseptic liquefaction necrosis. During follow-up, the patient's lesion remained stable. CONCLUSION: RAML rupture is a rare but rather serious complication in pregnant tuberous sclerosis patients. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) should be performed immediately, and the status of the pregnancy needs to be assessed by a multidisciplinary team. We also report for the first time the rare complication of aseptic liquefaction necrosis after SAE of RAML, for which percutaneous drainage is effective.",

Here, we show in model systems that other than loss of RB1 few gene-copy number (CN) alterations are associated with irreversible-resistance to endocrine therapy and subsequent secondary resistance to palbociclib. Resistance to palbociclib occurred as a result of tumour cell re-wiring leading to increased expression of EGFR, MAPK, CDK4, CDK2, CDK7, CCNE1 and CCNE2. Resistance altered the ER genome wide-binding pattern, leading to decreased expression of 'classical' oestrogen-regulated genes and was accompanied by reduced sensitivity to fulvestrant and tamoxifen. Persistent CDK4 blockade decreased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) enhancing EGFR signalling, leading to the re-wiring of ER.

                    "title": "Laser interstitial thermal therapy compared with open resection for treating subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.",
                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are WHO grade 1 tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis that classically arise from the ventricular wall near the caudate groove and foramen of Monro. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive surgical technique, which works by heating a stereotactically placed laser fiber to ablative temperatures under MRI thermometry monitoring. In this paper, the authors present LITT as a surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs. METHODS: Twelve patients with SEGAs who underwent 16 procedures between 2007 and 2022 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. These patients underwent either open resection or LITT. Clinical data, imaging, recurrence rate, further treatments, and related complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 16 procedures, 9 were open resection and 7 were LITT. An external ventricular drain was placed in 66% (6/9) of open procedures and 57.1% (4/7) of LITT cases. A septostomy was performed in 56% (5/9) of open procedures and 29% (2/7) of LITT cases. Complication rates were higher in open cases than in LITT procedures (44% vs 0%, p < 0.05). Complications included hydrocephalus, transient venous ischemia, wound infection, and bone flap migration. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 3.3-5.5 days) for open cases and 4 days (IQR 3.0-7.0 days) for LITT procedures. Recurrence or progression occurred after 3 open cases and 2 LITT cases (33% vs 33%, p = 0.803). For the recurrences, 2 open cases underwent stereotactic radiosurgery, 1 open case underwent LITT, and 1 LITT case underwent repeat LITT. Among the LITT cases, only the patients with no decrease in tumor size by 6 months experienced tumor progression afterward. The 2 LITT cases with progression were the only ones with calcification present on preoperative imaging. The median follow-up times for cases assessed for progression were 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-14.4 years) for open resection and 3.9 years (IQR 3.4-5.1 years) for LITT. CONCLUSIONS: The small size of this case series limits generalizability or adequate comparison of safety. However, this series adds to the literature supporting LITT as a less invasive surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs and demonstrates that LITT has similar recurrence and/or progression rates to open resection. Additional studies with more data are necessary for comprehensive comparisons between open resection and LITT for treating SEGA.",

                    "abstract": "Using a targeted transcriptomics approach, we have analyzed resected brain tissue from a cohort of 53 pediatric epilepsy surgery cases, and have found that there is a spectrum of involvement of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as evidenced by the differential expression of immune-specific genes in the affected brain tissue. The specimens with the highest expression of immune-specific genes were from two Rasmussen encephalitis cases, which is known to be a neuro-immunological disease, but also from tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), focal cortical dysplasia, and hemimegalencephaly surgery cases. We obtained T cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta chain sequence data from brain tissue and blood from patients with the highest levels of T cell transcripts. The clonality indices and the frequency of the top 50 Vbeta clonotypes indicated that T cells in the brain were clonally restricted. The top 50 Vbeta clonotypes comprised both public and private (patient specific) clonotypes, and the TCR Vbeta chain third complementarity region (CDR3) of the most abundant public Vbeta clonotype in each brain sample was strikingly similar to a CDR3 that recognizes an immunodominant epitope in either human cytomegalovirus or Epstein Barr virus, or influenza virus A. We found that the frequency of 14 of the top 50 brain Vbeta clonotypes from a TSC surgery case had significantly increased in brain tissue removed to control recurrent seizures 11 months after the first surgery. Conversely, we found that the frequency in the blood of 18 of the top 50 brain clonotypes from a second TSC patient, who was seizure free, had significantly decreased 5 months after surgery indicating that T cell clones found in the brain had contracted in the periphery after removal of the brain area associated with seizure activity and inflammation. However, the frequency of a public and a private clonotype significantly increased in the brain after seizures recurred and the patient underwent a second surgery. Combined single cell gene expression and TCR sequencing of brain-infiltrating leukocytes from the second surgery showed that the two clones were CD8 effector T cells, indicating that they are likely to be pathologically relevant.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of the immunosuppressive agent sirolimus (SRL) following liver transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Sirolimus is a typical mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, and tuberous sclerosis 1-tuberous sclerosis 2 complex (TSC1/TSC2) is an important negative effector in the mTOR pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of SRL-based immunosuppression on the prognosis of LT recipients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria based on TSC1/2 expression and explored the effect of TSC1 on HCC in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 120 HCC patients who underwent LT in our hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 30, 2018. All patients had HCC beyond the Milan criteria and were divided into the SRL group (n = 50) and non-SRL group (n = 70). TSC1/2 expression levels in paraffin-embedded tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and then analyzed as subgroups. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. TSC1 expression was silenced in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 cell lines for further cell function experiments. RESULTS: 88.3% of patients were HBV LT recipients. The SRL group exhibited better DFS and OS compared to the non-SRL group (P = 0.02, P = 0.003). Subgroup (TSC1-based or TSC2-based) analyses revealed that patients with low TSC1 or TSC2 expression benefited from sirolimus (DFS: P = 0.046, OS: P = 0.006 for TSC1; DFS: P = 0.05, OS: P = 0.003 for TSC2) compared with patients with high expression. TSC1 knockdown in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 HCC cell lines activated the mTORC1 pathway and enhanced cell proliferation, migration and sensitivity to SRL in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: TSC1/2 expression could be used to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent SRL-based immunosuppression following LT. TSC1 knockdown promoted HCC malignancy and enhanced sensitivity to SRL.",

Pre-clinical studies suggest that simvastatin in combination with sirolimus induces LAM cell death. The objective of this study was to assess the safety of simvastatin with either sirolimus or everolimus in LAM patients. METHODS: This was a phase II single arm trial evaluating the safety of escalating daily simvastatin (20-40 mg) in LAM patients already treated with sirolimus or everolimus. Adverse events and changes in lipid panel profile, pulmonary function tests, and VEGF-D were assessed. RESULTS: Ten LAM patients on a stable dose of mTORi for >3 months were treated with 20 mg simvastatin for two months followed by 40 mg for two months. The most common adverse events were peripheral edema (30%), cough (30%), and diarrhea (30%). No patients withdrew or had a reduction in simvastatin dose because of adverse events. Two patients required sirolumus dose reduction for supratherapeutic trough levels following simvastatin initiation. Total cholesterol and low density lipoproteins declined over the study period (-46.0 mg/dL+-20.8, p = 0.008; -41.9 mg/dL+-22.0, p = 0.01, respectively). There was also a decline in FEV1 (-82.0 mL+-86.4, p = 0.02) but no significant change in FVC, DLCO, or VEGF-D. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of simvastatin with mTORi in LAM patients is safe and well-tolerated from an adverse events perspective. The addition of simvastatin, however, was associated with decline in FEV1 and the efficacy of this combination should be explored in larger trials.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Keratinocyte carcinomas such as basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are a major burden affecting morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Best treatment includes frequent skin checks for early detection and surgery for high incidence of skin cancers. Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive drug which may reduce the burden of skin cancer but may be poorly tolerated when given orally. Topical sirolimus has been proven effective at reducing the burden of skin cancers in animal models, and its safety has long been established in children with tuberous sclerosis. A recent 12-week phase II trial of topical sirolimus suggested it was safe and effective at reducing the early signs of skin cancer in the absence of major side effects. The aim of the SiroSkin trial is to determine whether topical sirolimus can fill a major gap in current therapies by reducing the onset and number of new skin cancers thus reducing burden of disease and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Protocol for a multi-centred phase III, participant- and clinician assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial in SOTRs. A minimum 146 participants randomised 1:1 will be treated with 1% topical sirolimus versus placebo applied to the face on a regular basis for 24 weeks. Participation is 24 months in total-24 weeks of treatment and 18 months of follow-up. Outcomes include the number of keratinocyte carcinomas at 24 weeks of treatment compared to placebo and then at 12 and 24 months after initiation of treatment. Analysis will be as per protocol and intention to treat. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will inform management strategies for skin cancers in SOTRs and provide evidence for cost-effectiveness.

However, very little is known about its potential to reduce interictal epileptiform activity and improve sleep architecture. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the influence of cannabidiol therapy on the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and sleep microstructure in a cohort of children with drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: Children with drug-resistant epilepsy were prospectively followed from November 2019 to January 2021 during an open-label trial of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day) and stable concomitant medication. Electroencephalograms were recorded at baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1). Two independent raters, blinded to clinical outcome, evaluated 5-min segments of sleep stage 2 or low-noise awake state. IEDs were visually identified and rates per minute calculated. Sleep microstructure was considered improved if sleep structures were seen at T1 that were not present at T0. IED rates at T0 and T1 were compared and correlated with seizure outcome, cannabidiol dose, initial IED rate, and disease duration. RESULTS: In total, 35 children (mean +- standard deviation age 10.1 +- 0.86) were included. The IED rate at T1 was significantly lower than at T0 (19.6 +- 19.5 vs. 36.8 +- 27.2, respectively; p < 0.0001). We found a moderate correlation between IED reduction and percentage of seizure reduction compared with baseline (Pearson's r = 0.39; p = 0.02), a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and IED rate at T0 (r = - 0.34; p = 0.04), and a trend towards a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and disease duration (r = - 0.32; p = 0.06). Sleep was recorded in 23 patients. Sleep microstructure was initially abnormal in 56.5% of sleep recordings and improved in 84.6% of those cases. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest the utility of cannabidiol in reducing IEDs and improving sleep microstructure in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Larger controlled studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of this effect in different epilepsy types. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00013177; 25 June 2019.",

An extensive investigation of the morpholine ring engaging the mTOR solvent exposed region led to the discovery of PQR626 (8). 8 displayed excellent brain penetration and was well-tolerated in mice. In mice with a conditionally inactivated Tsc1 gene in glia, 8 significantly reduced the loss of Tsc1-induced mortality at 50 mg/kg p.o. twice a day. 8 overcomes the metabolic liabilities of PQR620 (52), the first-in-class brain penetrant TORKi showing efficacy in a TSC mouse model.

At the same time, epilepsy is the most common manifestation and more than 50% of TSC patients present with intractable epilepsy. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of optimized and high-density stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC) in treating TSC-related epilepsy. METHODS: Nine TSC children with refractory epilepsy were treated with first-stage SEEG-Guided RF-TC, and four underwent second-stage-optimized high-density array of SEEG-Guided RF-TC. Patients' clinical data and postoperative outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The patients' median age at surgery was 4 years and 2 month (range from 3 years and 5 month to 16 years and 7 month). The mean age at surgery was 6.7 years old. Eight in 9 (88.9%) patients achieved complete remission after the final operation at half-year follow-up. Of seven patients with final postoperative time beyond 1 year, 6 (85.7%) reached completely seizure-free. No severe or long-term neurologic impairment existed in all nine patients. CONCLUSION: Optimized high-density array of SEEG-guided RF-TC is a safe and highly effective approach and can be an alternative application applied for TSC patients with refractory epilepsy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) may offer seizure freedom and benefits for quality of life. Yet, concerns remain regarding invasiveness, morbidity, and neurocognitive side effects. Magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) has emerged as a less invasive option for stereotactic ablation rather than resection of the EZ. OBJECTIVE: To provide an introduction to MRgLITT for epilepsy, including historical development, surgical technique, and role in therapy. METHODS: The development of MRgLITT is briefly recounted. A systematic review identified reported techniques and indication-specific outcomes of MRgLITT for DRE in human studies regardless of sample size or follow-up duration. Potential advantages and disadvantages compared to available alternatives for each indication are assessed in an unstructured review. RESULTS: Techniques and outcomes are reported for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, hypothalamic hamartoma, focal cortical dysplasia, nonlesional epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis, periventricular nodular heterotopia, cerebral cavernous malformations, poststroke epilepsy, temporal encephalocele, and corpus callosotomy. CONCLUSION: MRgLITT offers access to foci virtually anywhere in the brain with minimal disruption of the overlying cortex and white matter, promising fewer neurological side effects and less surgical morbidity and pain. Compared to other ablative techniques, MRgLITT offers immediate, discrete lesions with real-time monitoring of temperature beyond the fiber tip for damage estimates and off-target injury prevention. Applications of MRgLITT for epilepsy are growing rapidly and, although more evidence of safety and efficacy is needed, there are potential advantages for some patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Keratinocyte carcinomas such as basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are a major burden affecting morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Best treatment includes frequent skin checks for early detection and surgery for high incidence of skin cancers. Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive drug which may reduce the burden of skin cancer but may be poorly tolerated when given orally. Topical sirolimus has been proven effective at reducing the burden of skin cancers in animal models, and its safety has long been established in children with tuberous sclerosis. A recent 12-week phase II trial of topical sirolimus suggested it was safe and effective at reducing the early signs of skin cancer in the absence of major side effects. The aim of the SiroSkin trial is to determine whether topical sirolimus can fill a major gap in current therapies by reducing the onset and number of new skin cancers thus reducing burden of disease and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Protocol for a multi-centred phase III, participant- and clinician assessor-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial in SOTRs. A minimum 146 participants randomised 1:1 will be treated with 1% topical sirolimus versus placebo applied to the face on a regular basis for 24 weeks. Participation is 24 months in total-24 weeks of treatment and 18 months of follow-up. Outcomes include the number of keratinocyte carcinomas at 24 weeks of treatment compared to placebo and then at 12 and 24 months after initiation of treatment. Analysis will be as per protocol and intention to treat. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will inform management strategies for skin cancers in SOTRs and provide evidence for cost-effectiveness.

Regarding clinical manifestations, a wide range of phenotypic variability exists, with symptoms constellations that may differ in affected organs (brain, skin, heart, eyes, kidneys, lungs), age of presentation and severity, but usually with great impact in biopsychosocial aspects of health and in quality of life. Main clinical neurological features are epilepsy (frequently, antiepileptic drug-resistant epilepsy), neuropsychiatric disorders, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Recently, many therapeutic strategies have developed, including preventive treatment of epilepsy, new options for treatment of epilepsy as cannabidiol, mTOR inhibitors, ketogenic diet, and a more precise epilepsy surgery. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas may require surgical procedures or mTOR inhibitors treatment. mTOR inhibitors may also be useful for other comorbidities. To improve quality of life of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, it is essential to be able to deliver an integrated approach by specialized multidisciplinary teams, coordinated with primary care physicians and health professionals, that include access to treatments, attention of psychosocial aspects, and an adequate health care transition from pediatric to adult care.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) may offer seizure freedom and benefits for quality of life. Yet, concerns remain regarding invasiveness, morbidity, and neurocognitive side effects. Magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) has emerged as a less invasive option for stereotactic ablation rather than resection of the EZ. OBJECTIVE: To provide an introduction to MRgLITT for epilepsy, including historical development, surgical technique, and role in therapy. METHODS: The development of MRgLITT is briefly recounted. A systematic review identified reported techniques and indication-specific outcomes of MRgLITT for DRE in human studies regardless of sample size or follow-up duration. Potential advantages and disadvantages compared to available alternatives for each indication are assessed in an unstructured review. RESULTS: Techniques and outcomes are reported for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, hypothalamic hamartoma, focal cortical dysplasia, nonlesional epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis, periventricular nodular heterotopia, cerebral cavernous malformations, poststroke epilepsy, temporal encephalocele, and corpus callosotomy. CONCLUSION: MRgLITT offers access to foci virtually anywhere in the brain with minimal disruption of the overlying cortex and white matter, promising fewer neurological side effects and less surgical morbidity and pain. Compared to other ablative techniques, MRgLITT offers immediate, discrete lesions with real-time monitoring of temperature beyond the fiber tip for damage estimates and off-target injury prevention. Applications of MRgLITT for epilepsy are growing rapidly and, although more evidence of safety and efficacy is needed, there are potential advantages for some patients.",

METHODS: Data from 24 consecutive TSC surgical candidates who underwent both HR-ESI and LTM-VEEG was retrospectively collected. PHS and VS were analyzed to hypothesize the symptomatogenic zone localization. LTM-VEEG and HR-ESI localization results were extracted from the diagnostic reports. Localizing value was compared between modalities, taken the resected/disconnected area of surgical patients in consideration. HR-ESI's impact on the epileptogenic zone hypothesis and surgical workup was evaluated. RESULTS: Semiology, interictal EEG, ictal EEG and HR-ESI were localizing in 25%, 54%, 63% and 79% of patients. Inter-modality concordance ranged between 33-89%. In good surgical outcome patients, PHS, VS, interictal EEG, ictal EEG and HR-ESI showed concordance with resected area in 1/9 (11%), 0/9 (0%), 4/9 (44%), 3/9 (33%) and 6/9 patients (67%). HR-ESI positively impacts clinical management in 50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In presurgical evaluation of TSC patients, semiology often has limited localizing value. Presurgical work-up benefits from HR-ESI. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings may advice future presurgical epilepsy workup of TSC patients with the ultimate aim to improve outcome.",

METHODS: Data from an ongoing prospective, multi-center registry were assessed. Procedural information, Engel seizure outcomes, and quality of life (QoL) scores were analyzed. A responder analysis was performed to better understand potential clinical characteristics that could influence seizure outcome. RESULTS: Sixty patients have been enrolled into LAANTERN (Laser Ablation of Abnormal Neurological Tissue Using Robotic NeuroBlate System) specifically for epilepsy treatment, of which 42 reached one year follow up. Engel I outcome was achieved in 64.3 % at one year follow up. Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) comprised 56.7 % of this cohort of multiple epilepsy types. Other significant etiologies included focal cortical dysplasia, hypothalamic hamartoma, cavernoma, heterotopias, and tuberous sclerosis. Median length of stay was 32.7 h. At discharge, head pain score averaged 1.4 +- 2.1 on a scale from 1 to 10. Five adverse events were reported, one categorized as serious. Seizure worry and social functioning scores improved significantly in quality of life measures. SIGNIFICANCE: Surgical treatment with LITT for epileptic foci is a safe and effective treatment option for people with drug resistant epilepsy. Our multicenter prospective seizure outcomes continue to expand published LITT experience in MTLE as well as non-MTLE epilepsies. The minimally invasive nature allows for short hospitalizations with minimal reported pain and discomfort.",

OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes of a multimodal diagnostic and therapeutic approach comprising invasive intracranial monitoring and surgical treatment and compare the complementary techniques of open resection and magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy. METHODS: Clinical and radiographic data were prospectively collected for pediatric patients undergoing surgical evaluation for TSC-related DRE at our tertiary academic hospital. Seizure freedom, developmental improvement, and Engel class were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20 females) underwent treatment in January 2016 to April 2019. Thirty-five underwent phase II invasive monitoring with intracranial electrodes: 24 stereoencephalography, 9 craniotomy for grid/electrode placement, and 2 grids + stereoencephalography. With the multimodal approach, 33/38 patients (87%) achieved >50% seizure freedom of the targeted seizure type after initial treatment; 6/9 requiring secondary treatment and 2/2 requiring a third treatment achieved >50% freedom. The median Engel class was II at last follow-up (1.65 years), and 55% of patients were Engel class I/II. The mean age was lower for children undergoing open resection (2.4 vs 4.9 years, P = .04). Rates of >50% reduction in seizures (86% open resection vs 88% laser interstitial thermal therapy) and developmental improvement (86% open resection vs 83% magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy) were similar. CONCLUSION: This hybrid approach of using both open surgical and minimally invasive techniques is safe and effective in treating DRE secondary to TSC. Clinical trials focused on treatment method with longer follow-up are needed to determine the optimal candidates for each approach and compare the treatment modalities more effectively.",

We defined lesion size by maximum axial diameter and categorized lesion size at baseline. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A total of 458 patients with 593 AMLs, with a median follow-up of 65.2 mo, were identified. At diagnosis, 534 (90.1%) lesions were <=4 cm. Forty-three interventions were required for 34 (5.7%) AMLs: 30 were treated with embolization, seven surgery, two with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), three with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and one with nivolumab when epithelioid AML was confirmed. The median size at intervention was 4.9 cm (range 1.1-29 cm). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Most (94%) of the lesions grew slowly (growth rate of <0.25 cm/yr) during the period of observation. The number of AMLs <4 cm needed to treat (NNT) prophylactically to prevent one emergent bleed would have been 136 or that to prevent one blood transfusion would have been 205. The NNT (<4 cm) prophylactically to prevent one elective intervention would have been 82. On multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in intervention rates based on tuberous sclerosis complex, size at presentation, and clinical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This large single-institution updated series of renal AMLs demonstrates that early intervention is not required, regardless of the traditional 4 cm cut-off. The vast majority of AMLs are indolent lesions that are predominantly asymptomatic and slow growing. Follow-up should be no more frequent than annually. PATIENT SUMMARY: The majority of angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are indolent, slow-growing lesions that do not require intervention, regardless of size at presentation. We suggest that surveillance is a safe initial approach for patients presenting with AMLs.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We present an uncommon cause of intracranial hemorrhage in a young adult. Tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin changes, benign systemic or central nervous system tumors [subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)], mental retardation, or epilepsy. Hemorrhage into SEGA is exceedingly rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We evaluated a 21-year-old college student with migraine. Biopsy of numerous popular skin lesions on his nose revealed adenoma sebaceum. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed a subependymal nodule near the foramen of Monro suspected to be SEGA. Genetic analysis identified a tuberous sclerosis complex-1 germ line mutation. Surveillance imaging was recommended for the subependymal tumor. Fourteen months later, he presented with spontaneous hemorrhage into the tumor. Hematoma evacuation and tumor resection revealed SEGA. The college graduate was able to return to full-time work. CONCLUSIONS: We present an unusual cause of intracranial hemorrhage in a young adult. Thorough work-up and recognition of an underlying genetic predisposition can curtails diagnostic delay when life-threatening complications occur.",

Given the difficulty of conducting dedicated clinical trials, there is a lack of therapies for these tumours supported by high quality evidence, and knowledge regarding the impact of standard treatments (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy) is commonly based on retrospective studies. Recently, new molecular techniques have led to the discovery of actionable molecular alterations. The aim of this article is to review recent progress in the molecular understanding of and therapeutic options for rare brain tumours, both in children and adults. We will discuss options such as targeting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in subependymal giant cells astrocytomas (SEGAs) of tuberous sclerosis and BRAF V600E mutation in rare glial (pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas) or glioneuronal (gangliogliomas) tumours, which are a model of how specific molecular treatments can also favourably impact neurological symptoms (such as seizures) and quality of life. Moreover, we will discuss initial experiences in targeting new molecular alterations in gliomas, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations and neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusions, and in medulloblastomas such as the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway.",

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing telemedicine and in-person visits within the timeframe spanning from June 1, 2021, to June 1, 2022. Disparities in demographics, emergency visits, hospitalizations, adverse effects (AEs) associated with sirolimus, and the incidence of drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) between telehealth and in-person care were assessed. Additionally, distinctions between audio and video telehealth, as well as varying frequencies of telehealth encounters, were investigated and reported as odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 378 patients with 1206 visits were included, of which 137 were telemedicine patients and 241 were in-person patients. The median age was 5.0 years (IQR 2.8-10.0 years). There were 197 males (52.12%), 691 in-person visits (57.30%), and 515 telemedicine visits (42.70%). Children under 12 years old, those farther away from the center, mothers with more than 12 years of education, and children treated with sirolimus were more likely to visit via telemedicine. Telehealth was associated with significantly fewer emergency visits, hospitalizations, AEs of sirolimus, and DRE. With 10 or more visits, the incidence of emergency visits, hospitalization, and DRE was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine visits are almost as close in number as in-person visits. Younger patients, patients in remote areas, and mothers with higher education levels are more willing to complete telemedicine visits.

                    "abstract": "AIMS: To evaluate the benefits of telemedicine in children with tuberous sclerosis complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing telemedicine and in-person visits within the timeframe spanning from June 1, 2021, to June 1, 2022. Disparities in demographics, emergency visits, hospitalizations, adverse effects (AEs) associated with sirolimus, and the incidence of drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) between telehealth and in-person care were assessed. Additionally, distinctions between audio and video telehealth, as well as varying frequencies of telehealth encounters, were investigated and reported as odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 378 patients with 1206 visits were included, of which 137 were telemedicine patients and 241 were in-person patients. The median age was 5.0 years (IQR 2.8-10.0 years). There were 197 males (52.12%), 691 in-person visits (57.30%), and 515 telemedicine visits (42.70%). Children under 12 years old, those farther away from the center, mothers with more than 12 years of education, and children treated with sirolimus were more likely to visit via telemedicine. Telehealth was associated with significantly fewer emergency visits, hospitalizations, AEs of sirolimus, and DRE. With 10 or more visits, the incidence of emergency visits, hospitalization, and DRE was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine visits are almost as close in number as in-person visits. Younger patients, patients in remote areas, and mothers with higher education levels are more willing to complete telemedicine visits. Telemedicine visits were associated with a significantly lower number of emergency visits, hospitalizations, and AEs of sirolimus. Patients with more than 10 visits per year seemed to have better clinical outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "The mTOR-inhibitor everolimus is a precision drug with antiepileptogenic properties approved for treatment of epilepsy in persons with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in combination with other antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, the pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus is scarcely described, and the available information on pharmacokinetic interactions is scarce. The purpose of this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus in patients with TSC, and the impact of age, sex and comedication. In this retrospective observational study we used anonymized data from medical records of patients with TSC using everolimus in Norway and Denmark, 2012 to 2020. Long-term therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) identified inter-patient and intra-patient variability. The study included 59 patients, (36 females (61%)), median age 22 (range 3-59 years). Polytherapy was used in 50 patients (85%). The most frequently used ASMs were lamotrigine (n = 21), valproate (n = 17), and levetiracetam (n = 13). Blood concentrations of everolimus were measured in all patients. Pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus between patients was extensive, as demonstrated by a 24-fold variability from minimum-maximum concentration/dose (C/D)-ratios. The coefficient of variation (CV) for intra-patient (n = 59) and inter-patient variability (n = 47, >=3 measurements) was 40% and 43%, respectively. The C/D-ratio of everolimus was 50% lower in 13 patients (22%) using enzyme-inducing ASMs compared to the 30 patients who did not (0.7 vs 1.4 ng/mL mg, P < .05). Age and sex were not significantly associated with changes in C/D-ratios of everolimus. Long-term TDM identified extensive variability in concentrations over time for everolimus both within and between patients, where comedication with enzyme-inducing ASMs was an important contributing factor. The findings suggest a need for TDM in patients with TSC treated with everolimus.",

Calcitriol has been shown to lessen skin fibrosis and may be therapeutically beneficial to FAs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether topical rapamycin-calcitriol combination is an effective and safe treatment for TSC-related FAs. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with TSC with FAs were enrolled in this prospective study including three 12-week periods. In period 1, either topical rapamycin 0 1% or calcitriol 0 0003% single-agent therapy vs. their combination was applied in a double-blind, left-right-randomized, split-face comparison. The primary outcome was the reduction of modified Facial Angiofibroma Severity Index (mFASI) at week 12. In period 2, the patients were reassigned to use on both cheeks the ointment that resulted in the better primary outcome in period 1. The treatment was discontinued in period 3 (week 25-36) and a follow-up mFASI was scored to evaluate the degree of recurrence. RESULTS: The mean changes in mFASI at week 12 compared with baseline were -0 92, -0 44 and -1 09 for rapamycin (P <= 0 001), calcitriol (P = 0 039) and rapamycin-calcitriol combination (P <= 0 001), respectively. Although rapamycin-calcitriol combination and rapamycin had similar statistically significant decreases of mFASI at week 12, rapamycin-calcitriol combination resulted in faster improvement in erythema, greater reduction of papule elevation and longer durability after discontinuing treatment than rapamycin alone. The treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized clinical trial demonstrates that topical rapamycin-calcitriol combination therapy is an effective and safe regimen for TSC-related FAs. What is already known about this topic? Facial angiofibromas (FAs) cause substantial psychological distress in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but invasive procedural treatments are not applicable to all patients. Topical rapamycin has been demonstrated as an effective and safe treatment regimen for TSC-related FAs. What does this study add? Compared with baseline (day 0), both topical rapamycin 0 1% and rapamycin 0 1%-calcitriol 0 0003% combination ointment achieved statistically significant reductions in modified Facial Angiofibroma Severity Index at week 12. Compared with rapamycin alone, extended use of the rapamycin-calcitriol combination regimen until week 24 showed more effectiveness in decreasing papule elevation and could maintain a longer therapeutic effect after treatment discontinuation.

Although rapamycin-calcitriol combination and rapamycin had similar statistically significant decreases of mFASI at week 12, rapamycin-calcitriol combination resulted in faster improvement in erythema, greater reduction of papule elevation and longer durability after discontinuing treatment than rapamycin alone. The treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized clinical trial demonstrates that topical rapamycin-calcitriol combination therapy is an effective and safe regimen for TSC-related FAs. What is already known about this topic? Facial angiofibromas (FAs) cause substantial psychological distress in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but invasive procedural treatments are not applicable to all patients. Topical rapamycin has been demonstrated as an effective and safe treatment regimen for TSC-related FAs. What does this study add? Compared with baseline (day 0), both topical rapamycin 0 1% and rapamycin 0 1%-calcitriol 0 0003% combination ointment achieved statistically significant reductions in modified Facial Angiofibroma Severity Index at week 12. Compared with rapamycin alone, extended use of the rapamycin-calcitriol combination regimen until week 24 showed more effectiveness in decreasing papule elevation and could maintain a longer therapeutic effect after treatment discontinuation.

Rapalogs and mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKi) have recently been applied to alleviate epileptic seizures in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Herein, we describe a pharmacophore exploration to identify a highly potent, selective, brain penetrant TORKi. An extensive investigation of the morpholine ring engaging the mTOR solvent exposed region led to the discovery of PQR626 (8). 8 displayed excellent brain penetration and was well-tolerated in mice. In mice with a conditionally inactivated Tsc1 gene in glia, 8 significantly reduced the loss of Tsc1-induced mortality at 50 mg/kg p.o. twice a day. 8 overcomes the metabolic liabilities of PQR620 (52), the first-in-class brain penetrant TORKi showing efficacy in a TSC mouse model. The improved stability in human hepatocytes, excellent brain penetration, and efficacy in Tsc1GFAPCKO mice qualify 8 as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neurological disorders.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of preoperative neoadjuvant everolimus in renal angiomyolipomas (AML) patients with or without Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multi-institutional retrospective study enrolled renal AML patients who underwent partial nephrectomy (PN) or total nephrectomy after receiving at least 1 month of pre-operative everolimus. Imaging evaluations were collected before and after treatment, along with demographic, surgical, and follow-up information. The primary outcome was tumor volume reduction of >=25%, with additional outcomes including recurrence, perioperative outcomes, renal function, and safety. RESULTS: From January 2015 to July 2022, 68 renal AML patients were studied-41 with TSC and 27 without. During everolimus treatment, 61.0% (25/41) of TSC patients and 44.4% (12/27) of non-TSC patients achieved tumor reduction of >=25%. Additionally, 41.5% (17/41) of TSC patients and 18.5% (5/27) of non-TSC patients achieved a >= 50% reduction. Three TSC patients and 1 non-TSC patient discontinued treatment due to side-effects. Most patients (92.7% TSC, 85.2% non-TSC) underwent PN. After everolimus treatment, the necessary total nephrectomy decreased to 41.2% (7/17) from baseline. Postoperatively, 1 grade 3 and 3 grade 2 complications occurred, with no grade 4 or 5 complications. After a median follow-up of 24 months, only 1 TSC patient recurred with a diameter >3 cm. Retrospective nature is the major limitation of this study. CONCLUSION: Everolimus was effective and well-tolerated in neoadjuvant treatment for renal AML, especially in TSC patients. This neoadjuvant combination strategy of everolimus and PN could effectively controls recurrence and preserves renal function.",

                    "abstract": "Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign tumor of the kidney. It consists of blood vessels, smooth muscle and fat components in varying proportions. AML is divided into the sporadic type and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated type. TSC-associated AML develops at a younger age and tends to exhibit a much faster growth rate over time than sporadic AML. AMLs are classified as classic AML, fat-poor AML and epithelioid AML. Epithelioid AML, though rare, shows aggressive behavior leading to distant metastasis and mortality. TSC-associated AML is more likely to have an epithelioid component than sporadic AML. Active surveillance is the suggested management for small AML. Clinical intervention is mainly indicated when there is a substantial risk of rupture. Minimally invasive therapies, including partial nephrectomy, transcatheter arterial embolization, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor treatment are employed for patients who require treatment. An updated algorithm for the management of AML is herein described. According to this algorithm, treatment intervention is recommended for TSC-associated AML >3 cm, even in asymptomatic cases. In cases with asymptomatic sporadic AML >4 cm in size or with an intra-tumoral aneurysm of >5 mm, treatment, including transcatheter arterial embolization or partial nephrectomy, is advised. The major complication of AML is intra-tumoral or retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to rupture that may be serious and life threatening. Thus, correct diagnosis, proper observation, and appropriate treatment are very important in the management of renal AML.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Disordered hepatic energy metabolism is found in obese rats with insulin resistance (IR). There are insufficient experimental studies of electroacupuncture (EA) for IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to probe the effect of EA on disordered hepatic energy metabolism and the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70-kDa (p70S6K) signaling pathway. METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were randomly divided into three groups: EA group receiving EA treatment; Pi group receiving pioglitazone gavage; and ZF group remaining untreated (n = 8 per group). Inbred non-insulin-resistant Zucker lean rats formed an (untreated) healthy control group (ZL, n = 8). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), C-peptide, C-reactive protein (CRP) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to investigate the liver morphologically. The mitochondrial structure of hepatocytes was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blotting was adopted to determine protein expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK, tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) and p70S6K, and their phosphorylation. RT-PCR was used to quantify IRS-1, mTOR, mTORC1, AMPK and p70S6K mRNA levels. RESULTS: Compared with the ZF group, FPG, FINS, C-peptide, CRP and HOMA-IR levels were significantly reduced in the EA group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Evaluation of histopathology showed improvement in liver appearances following EA. Phosphorylation levels of AMPK, mTOR and TSC2 decreased, and IRS-1 and p70S6K increased, in hepatocytes of the ZF group, while these negative effects appeared to be alleviated by EA. CONCLUSIONS: EA can effectively ameliorate IR and regulate energy metabolism in the ZDF rat model. AMPK/mTORC1/p70S6K and related molecules may represent a potential mechanism of action underlying these effects.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease that affects multiple organs including the brain. TSC is strongly associated with broad neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder symptomatology. Preclinical TSC studies have indicated altered neuronal chloride homeostasis affecting the polarity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic transmission as a potential treatment target. Bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist, may attenuate depolarizing GABA action, and in that way reduce disease burden. In this open-label pilot study, we tested the effect of bumetanide on a variety of neurophysiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures in children with TSC. METHODS: Participants were treated with bumetanide (2dd 0.5-1.0 mg) for 13 weeks in an open-label trial. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included other behavioral questionnaires in addition to event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests if tolerated. Additionally, the treatment effect on seizure frequency and quality of life was assessed. Endpoint data were collected at baseline, after 91 days of treatment and after a 28-day wash-out period. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (8-21-years old) with TSC were included of which 13 patients completed the study. Treatment was well-tolerated with only expected adverse events due to the diuretic effects of bumetanide. Irritable behavior (ABC-I) showed significant improvement after treatment in 11 out of 13 patients (t(12) = 4.41, p = .001, d = .773). A favorable effect was also found for social behavior (Social Responsiveness Scale) (t(11) = 4.01, p = .002, d = .549) and hyperactive behavior (ABC-hyperactivity subscale) (t(12) = 3.65, p = .003, d = .686). Moreover, patients rated their own health-related quality of life higher after treatment. At baseline, TSC patients showed several atypical ERPs versus typically developing peers of which prepulse inhibition was significantly decreased in the TSC group. Neuropsychological measurements showed no change and bumetanide had no effect on seizure frequency. LIMITATIONS: The sample size and open-label design of this pilot study warrant caution when interpreting outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Bumetanide treatment is a potential treatment to alleviate the behavioral burden and quality of life associated with TSC. More elaborate trials are needed to determine the application and effect size of bumetanide for the TSC population.

While cannabidiol has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive treatment in Dravet syndrome (DS), Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), and epilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), its more global effectiveness in adult patients with DRE apart from these three specific contexts needs to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the epilepsy unit of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital. Patients initiating pharmaceutical cannabidiol treatment and followed for at least 1 year were included. Patients were categorized into \"authorized\" (LGS, DS, or TSC) and \"off-label\" groups. Cannabidiol effectiveness and tolerance were compared between groups, and characteristics of responders (patients with >50% reduction in seizure frequency) in the off-label group were examined. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients, followed by a median duration of 24 months, were included. A total of 35.2% of the patients were in the authorized group. No significant differences were observed in responder rates between groups (31.3% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.85) and retention rates at 1 year (75.0% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.97). Sleepiness was more commonly reported in the authorized group (50.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.01), with no other significant differences. Among off-label patients (n = 59), clobazam co-prescription was more prevalent in responders (71.4% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cannabidiol may benefit all adult patients with DRE, particularly those already receiving clobazam. Randomized controlled trials are warranted in off-label patients to validate these observational findings.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease that affects multiple organs including the brain. TSC is strongly associated with broad neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder symptomatology. Preclinical TSC studies have indicated altered neuronal chloride homeostasis affecting the polarity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic transmission as a potential treatment target. Bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist, may attenuate depolarizing GABA action, and in that way reduce disease burden. In this open-label pilot study, we tested the effect of bumetanide on a variety of neurophysiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures in children with TSC. METHODS: Participants were treated with bumetanide (2dd 0.5-1.0 mg) for 13 weeks in an open-label trial. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included other behavioral questionnaires in addition to event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests if tolerated. Additionally, the treatment effect on seizure frequency and quality of life was assessed. Endpoint data were collected at baseline, after 91 days of treatment and after a 28-day wash-out period. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (8-21-years old) with TSC were included of which 13 patients completed the study. Treatment was well-tolerated with only expected adverse events due to the diuretic effects of bumetanide. Irritable behavior (ABC-I) showed significant improvement after treatment in 11 out of 13 patients (t(12) = 4.41, p = .001, d = .773). A favorable effect was also found for social behavior (Social Responsiveness Scale) (t(11) = 4.01, p = .002, d = .549) and hyperactive behavior (ABC-hyperactivity subscale) (t(12) = 3.65, p = .003, d = .686). Moreover, patients rated their own health-related quality of life higher after treatment. At baseline, TSC patients showed several atypical ERPs versus typically developing peers of which prepulse inhibition was significantly decreased in the TSC group. Neuropsychological measurements showed no change and bumetanide had no effect on seizure frequency. LIMITATIONS: The sample size and open-label design of this pilot study warrant caution when interpreting outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Bumetanide treatment is a potential treatment to alleviate the behavioral burden and quality of life associated with TSC. More elaborate trials are needed to determine the application and effect size of bumetanide for the TSC population.

                    "abstract": "The mTOR-inhibitor everolimus is a precision drug with antiepileptogenic properties approved for treatment of epilepsy in persons with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in combination with other antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, the pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus is scarcely described, and the available information on pharmacokinetic interactions is scarce. The purpose of this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus in patients with TSC, and the impact of age, sex and comedication. In this retrospective observational study we used anonymized data from medical records of patients with TSC using everolimus in Norway and Denmark, 2012 to 2020. Long-term therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) identified inter-patient and intra-patient variability. The study included 59 patients, (36 females (61%)), median age 22 (range 3-59 years). Polytherapy was used in 50 patients (85%). The most frequently used ASMs were lamotrigine (n = 21), valproate (n = 17), and levetiracetam (n = 13). Blood concentrations of everolimus were measured in all patients. Pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus between patients was extensive, as demonstrated by a 24-fold variability from minimum-maximum concentration/dose (C/D)-ratios. The coefficient of variation (CV) for intra-patient (n = 59) and inter-patient variability (n = 47, >=3 measurements) was 40% and 43%, respectively. The C/D-ratio of everolimus was 50% lower in 13 patients (22%) using enzyme-inducing ASMs compared to the 30 patients who did not (0.7 vs 1.4 ng/mL mg, P < .05). Age and sex were not significantly associated with changes in C/D-ratios of everolimus. Long-term TDM identified extensive variability in concentrations over time for everolimus both within and between patients, where comedication with enzyme-inducing ASMs was an important contributing factor. The findings suggest a need for TDM in patients with TSC treated with everolimus.",

                    "abstract": "Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign tumor of the kidney. It consists of blood vessels, smooth muscle and fat components in varying proportions. AML is divided into the sporadic type and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated type. TSC-associated AML develops at a younger age and tends to exhibit a much faster growth rate over time than sporadic AML. AMLs are classified as classic AML, fat-poor AML and epithelioid AML. Epithelioid AML, though rare, shows aggressive behavior leading to distant metastasis and mortality. TSC-associated AML is more likely to have an epithelioid component than sporadic AML. Active surveillance is the suggested management for small AML. Clinical intervention is mainly indicated when there is a substantial risk of rupture. Minimally invasive therapies, including partial nephrectomy, transcatheter arterial embolization, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor treatment are employed for patients who require treatment. An updated algorithm for the management of AML is herein described. According to this algorithm, treatment intervention is recommended for TSC-associated AML >3 cm, even in asymptomatic cases. In cases with asymptomatic sporadic AML >4 cm in size or with an intra-tumoral aneurysm of >5 mm, treatment, including transcatheter arterial embolization or partial nephrectomy, is advised. The major complication of AML is intra-tumoral or retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to rupture that may be serious and life threatening. Thus, correct diagnosis, proper observation, and appropriate treatment are very important in the management of renal AML.",

Regarding clinical manifestations, a wide range of phenotypic variability exists, with symptoms constellations that may differ in affected organs (brain, skin, heart, eyes, kidneys, lungs), age of presentation and severity, but usually with great impact in biopsychosocial aspects of health and in quality of life. Main clinical neurological features are epilepsy (frequently, antiepileptic drug-resistant epilepsy), neuropsychiatric disorders, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Recently, many therapeutic strategies have developed, including preventive treatment of epilepsy, new options for treatment of epilepsy as cannabidiol, mTOR inhibitors, ketogenic diet, and a more precise epilepsy surgery. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas may require surgical procedures or mTOR inhibitors treatment. mTOR inhibitors may also be useful for other comorbidities.

Most studies report efficacy over short time periods (<1 year), with little published on longer term efficacy. Here, we investigate the efficacy of CBD for a treatment period of up to 60 months (median = 45.5 months). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patient-reported seizure logs and medical records for 54 subjects with refractory epilepsy who enrolled in the Massachusetts General Hospital's open-label EAP for CBD as a new treatment for epilepsy. We analyzed the effect of CBD on seizure frequencies and concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) use at 1 year after starting treatment and the most recent study visit. RESULTS: Our results indicate that CBD maintains its efficacy for controlling seizures from Year 1 to the most recent study visit. The percentage of seizure responders remained similar at these time points (41.7%-42.6%), and the seizure response rate was also maintained (p = .12). Efficacy was also seen over a broad dose range, and up to 50 mg/kg/day. CBD was particularly effective for controlling seizures in the setting of tuberous sclerosis complex and for reducing epileptic spasms and absence seizures. Although CBD use did not lead to an overall decrease in concomitant AEDs, most subjects reduced the dose of at least one concomitant AED compared to baseline. CBD was generally well tolerated, with drowsiness and diarrhea as the primary adverse reactions. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates CBD does not lose its efficacy in controlling seizures over a treatment period of up to 60 months. Taken alongside other results on the efficacy and tolerability of CBD in the treatment of refractory epilepsies, our results provide evidence that CBD is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated AED for long-term use.",

However, the pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus is scarcely described, and the available information on pharmacokinetic interactions is scarce. The purpose of this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus in patients with TSC, and the impact of age, sex and comedication. In this retrospective observational study we used anonymized data from medical records of patients with TSC using everolimus in Norway and Denmark, 2012 to 2020. Long-term therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) identified inter-patient and intra-patient variability. The study included 59 patients, (36 females (61%)), median age 22 (range 3-59 years). Polytherapy was used in 50 patients (85%). The most frequently used ASMs were lamotrigine (n = 21), valproate (n = 17), and levetiracetam (n = 13). Blood concentrations of everolimus were measured in all patients. Pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus between patients was extensive, as demonstrated by a 24-fold variability from minimum-maximum concentration/dose (C/D)-ratios. The coefficient of variation (CV) for intra-patient (n = 59) and inter-patient variability (n = 47, >=3 measurements) was 40% and 43%, respectively. The C/D-ratio of everolimus was 50% lower in 13 patients (22%) using enzyme-inducing ASMs compared to the 30 patients who did not (0.7 vs 1.4 ng/mL mg, P < .05). Age and sex were not significantly associated with changes in C/D-ratios of everolimus. Long-term TDM identified extensive variability in concentrations over time for everolimus both within and between patients, where comedication with enzyme-inducing ASMs was an important contributing factor. The findings suggest a need for TDM in patients with TSC treated with everolimus.",

                    "abstract": "Malformations of cortical development (MCDs) represent a range of neurodevelopmental disorders that are collectively common causes of developmental delay and epilepsy, especially refractory childhood epilepsy. Initial treatment with antiseizure medications is empiric, and consideration of surgery is the standard of care for eligible patients with medically refractory epilepsy. In the past decade, advances in next generation sequencing technologies have accelerated progress in understanding the genetic etiologies of MCDs, and precision therapies for focal MCDs are emerging. Notably, mutations that lead to abnormal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which provides critical control of cell growth and proliferation, have emerged as a common cause of malformations. These include tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), hemimegalencephaly (HME), and some types of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). TSC currently represents the best example for the pathway from gene discovery to relatively safe and efficacious targeted therapy for epilepsy related to MCDs. Based on extensive pre-clinical and clinical data, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus is currently approved for the treatment of focal refractory seizures in patients with TSC. Although clinical studies are just emerging for FCD and HME, we believe the next decade will bring significant advancements in precision therapies for epilepsy related to these and other MCDs.",

Pathogenic variants in TSC2 are typically associated with a more severe phenotype compared with TSC1; the TSC2 R905Q variant has been shown to be an exception, where patients have been reported to present with unusually mild TSC features that may be undetected. METHODS: We studied the TSC phenotype of a 13-year-old individual and three family members with a TSC2 c.2714G>A (R905Q) pathogenic variant. RESULTS: Patient 1 presented with severe medically refractory epilepsy without tubers or subependymal nodules and only mild dermatologic features of TSC missed on virtual examinations. Her mother and maternal aunt (Patients 2 and 3-diagnosed after age 50 years) presented with a mild phenotype, with dermatologic features and TAND.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystemic disorder caused by inactivating variants in the mTOR pathway inhibitor genes TSC1 and TSC2. Individuals with TSC are predisposed to benign tumors in multiple organs as well as TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) and epilepsy. Pathogenic variants in TSC2 are typically associated with a more severe phenotype compared with TSC1; the TSC2 R905Q variant has been shown to be an exception, where patients have been reported to present with unusually mild TSC features that may be undetected. METHODS: We studied the TSC phenotype of a 13-year-old individual and three family members with a TSC2 c.2714G>A (R905Q) pathogenic variant. RESULTS: Patient 1 presented with severe medically refractory epilepsy without tubers or subependymal nodules and only mild dermatologic features of TSC missed on virtual examinations. Her mother and maternal aunt (Patients 2 and 3-diagnosed after age 50 years) presented with a mild phenotype, with dermatologic features and TAND. Her maternal uncle (Patient 4-diagnosed at age 47 years) displayed the most severe phenotype, presenting with intellectual disability, medically refractory epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study expands the possible phenotypic spectrum of TSC2 R905Q variant, demonstrating an association with severe epilepsy without associated neuroradiological stigmata. This presentation highlights the possibility of occult focal cortical dysplasia in TSC and emphasizes the importance of genetic testing in individuals with severe epilepsy. Moreover, a late adult diagnosis was subsequently made in other family members allowing for appropriate TSC surveillance to occur.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of the immunosuppressive agent sirolimus (SRL) following liver transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Sirolimus is a typical mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, and tuberous sclerosis 1-tuberous sclerosis 2 complex (TSC1/TSC2) is an important negative effector in the mTOR pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of SRL-based immunosuppression on the prognosis of LT recipients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria based on TSC1/2 expression and explored the effect of TSC1 on HCC in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 120 HCC patients who underwent LT in our hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 30, 2018. All patients had HCC beyond the Milan criteria and were divided into the SRL group (n = 50) and non-SRL group (n = 70). TSC1/2 expression levels in paraffin-embedded tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and then analyzed as subgroups. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. TSC1 expression was silenced in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 cell lines for further cell function experiments. RESULTS: 88.3% of patients were HBV LT recipients. The SRL group exhibited better DFS and OS compared to the non-SRL group (P = 0.02, P = 0.003). Subgroup (TSC1-based or TSC2-based) analyses revealed that patients with low TSC1 or TSC2 expression benefited from sirolimus (DFS: P = 0.046, OS: P = 0.006 for TSC1; DFS: P = 0.05, OS: P = 0.003 for TSC2) compared with patients with high expression. TSC1 knockdown in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 HCC cell lines activated the mTORC1 pathway and enhanced cell proliferation, migration and sensitivity to SRL in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: TSC1/2 expression could be used to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent SRL-based immunosuppression following LT. TSC1 knockdown promoted HCC malignancy and enhanced sensitivity to SRL.",

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin changes, benign systemic or central nervous system tumors [subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA)], mental retardation, or epilepsy. Hemorrhage into SEGA is exceedingly rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We evaluated a 21-year-old college student with migraine. Biopsy of numerous popular skin lesions on his nose revealed adenoma sebaceum. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed a subependymal nodule near the foramen of Monro suspected to be SEGA. Genetic analysis identified a tuberous sclerosis complex-1 germ line mutation. Surveillance imaging was recommended for the subependymal tumor. Fourteen months later, he presented with spontaneous hemorrhage into the tumor. Hematoma evacuation and tumor resection revealed SEGA. The college graduate was able to return to full-time work. CONCLUSIONS: We present an unusual cause of intracranial hemorrhage in a young adult. Thorough work-up and recognition of an underlying genetic predisposition can curtails diagnostic delay when life-threatening complications occur.",

We describe our single-center experience with fetal tumors evaluated by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our aims were to evaluate mortality and morbidity including long-term outcome and to determine which ultrasound and MRI characteristics were helpful for pre- and perinatal management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on prenatally diagnosed tumors between 1998 and 2018. Poor outcome included fetal or neonatal death and survival with serious illness. MRI addressed tumor morphology (sacrococcygeal teratomas), compromise of surrounding structures (head and neck tumors) and early depiction of brain alterations specific to tuberous sclerosis (rhabdomyomas). RESULTS: Of 68 pregnancies, 15 (22%) were terminated and eight children (8/53, 15%) died pre- or postnatally. Of the 45 survivors (45/68, 66%), 24 (24/45, 53%) were healthy, eight (8/45, 18%) had a minor illness and 13 (13/45, 29%) a serious illness. Diffusion- and T1-weighted MRI reliably predicted tumor morphology in teratomas. To detect head and neck tumors critical to airway obstruction, MRI was superior to ultrasound in delivery planning. Rhabdomyomas were frequently associated with tuberous sclerosis, regardless of their number or size in ultrasound; MRI could depict specific brain alterations from the early third trimester onwards.

For those with infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), a genetic diagnosis is now obtained in more than 50% of patients. There is considerable motivation to utilize these molecular diagnostic data to help guide treatment, as children with DEEs often have drug-resistant seizures as well as developmental impairment related to cerebral epileptiform activity. Precision medicine approaches have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for these children and their families. At present, treatment can be targeted for patients with diagnoses in many genetic causes of infantile-onset DEE, including genes encoding sodium or potassium channel subunits, tuberous sclerosis, and congenital metabolic diseases. Precision medicine may refer to more intelligent choices of conventional antiseizure medications, repurposed agents previously used for other indications, novel compounds, enzyme replacement, or gene therapy approaches.",

After six years, we determined (1) our compliance with standard therapies, (2) time to next treatment, and (3) rate of initial and three-month electroclinical remission with first, second, and third treatments. METHODS: This is a retrospective record review of newly diagnosed spasms from September 2012 to September 2018, with the onset age of two months to two years. RESULTS: Standard therapies (hormone or vigabatrin) were the first treatments in 114 of 115 consecutive patients. The second and third treatments were started within 14 days of failed treatment in only 21% and 24%, respectively. Remission with the first and second treatments was similar (41% and 40%). Remission was lower for the third treatment (15%), although higher if standard therapy was used (36%). Initial and three-month remission by the first treatment was significantly higher for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 66% and 79%, respectively) and prednisolone (53% and 83%, respectively) than for vigabatrin (19% and 40%, respectively). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or rates of remission between ACTH and prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Although we achieved excellent compliance with standard therapies as initial treatment, a next treatment often started after two weeks. Given the superiority of hormone therapies over vigabatrin and standard therapies over nonstandard therapies, as well as the potentially negative impact of delays in effective treatment, future interventions need to focus on increasing the use of hormone over vigabatrin (for patients without tuberous sclerosis complex), use of standard therapies as second and third treatments, and reducing delays to next treatment.",

The TSC-Task Force Committee of the China Association Against Epilepsy (CAAE-TFTSC) was founded in 2012, and annual academic conferences on the surgical treatment of TSC-related epilepsy have been held since 2013. 'China experts' consensus on surgical treatment of TSC-related epilepsy' was published in 2019. This review focuses on surgical treatment, including resective surgery, neuromodulations, corpus callosotomy and mini-invasive ablations, as well as studies on phenotype, genotype and anti-seizure therapies of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, vigabatrin and ketogenic diet in patients with TSC-related DRE in China.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS: To evaluate the benefits of telemedicine in children with tuberous sclerosis complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing telemedicine and in-person visits within the timeframe spanning from June 1, 2021, to June 1, 2022. Disparities in demographics, emergency visits, hospitalizations, adverse effects (AEs) associated with sirolimus, and the incidence of drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) between telehealth and in-person care were assessed. Additionally, distinctions between audio and video telehealth, as well as varying frequencies of telehealth encounters, were investigated and reported as odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 378 patients with 1206 visits were included, of which 137 were telemedicine patients and 241 were in-person patients. The median age was 5.0 years (IQR 2.8-10.0 years). There were 197 males (52.12%), 691 in-person visits (57.30%), and 515 telemedicine visits (42.70%). Children under 12 years old, those farther away from the center, mothers with more than 12 years of education, and children treated with sirolimus were more likely to visit via telemedicine. Telehealth was associated with significantly fewer emergency visits, hospitalizations, AEs of sirolimus, and DRE. With 10 or more visits, the incidence of emergency visits, hospitalization, and DRE was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine visits are almost as close in number as in-person visits. Younger patients, patients in remote areas, and mothers with higher education levels are more willing to complete telemedicine visits. Telemedicine visits were associated with a significantly lower number of emergency visits, hospitalizations, and AEs of sirolimus. Patients with more than 10 visits per year seemed to have better clinical outcomes.",

After six years, we determined (1) our compliance with standard therapies, (2) time to next treatment, and (3) rate of initial and three-month electroclinical remission with first, second, and third treatments. METHODS: This is a retrospective record review of newly diagnosed spasms from September 2012 to September 2018, with the onset age of two months to two years. RESULTS: Standard therapies (hormone or vigabatrin) were the first treatments in 114 of 115 consecutive patients. The second and third treatments were started within 14 days of failed treatment in only 21% and 24%, respectively. Remission with the first and second treatments was similar (41% and 40%). Remission was lower for the third treatment (15%), although higher if standard therapy was used (36%). Initial and three-month remission by the first treatment was significantly higher for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 66% and 79%, respectively) and prednisolone (53% and 83%, respectively) than for vigabatrin (19% and 40%, respectively). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or rates of remission between ACTH and prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: Although we achieved excellent compliance with standard therapies as initial treatment, a next treatment often started after two weeks. Given the superiority of hormone therapies over vigabatrin and standard therapies over nonstandard therapies, as well as the potentially negative impact of delays in effective treatment, future interventions need to focus on increasing the use of hormone over vigabatrin (for patients without tuberous sclerosis complex), use of standard therapies as second and third treatments, and reducing delays to next treatment.",

However, widespread use is limited by a highly heterogeneous evidence base of mixed quality. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the current evidence base for the indications, efficacy and safety profile for topical sirolimus in dermatology. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted from 2005 to July 4th, 2023, of English language studies, with the following databases consulted: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and EBSCO. Key words included 'topical', 'rapamycin', 'sirolimus' and 'dermatology'. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on drug efficacy, concentration, side effects, co-interventions and follow up were extracted. RESULTS: The search identified 202 studies; 71 studies met the inclusion criteria. Efficacy of topical sirolimus was demonstrated in facial angiofibromas (799 patients) compared to placebo across multiple randomised controlled trials with a predominant concentration of 0.1%. Evidence was mixed for sirolimus use in port-wine stains (61 patients), with evidence of effectiveness in combined sirolimus and pulsed-dye laser. Multiple case reports demonstrated clinical improvement with topical sirolimus use in cutaneous vascular abnormalities (33 patients) at a higher concentration of 1%. Other applications of topical sirolimus were predominantly case reports demonstrating generally favourable outcomes. Topical sirolimus was generally well tolerated - most reported adverse effects were localised irritation and pruritus. Ointment-based preparations and once-daily dosing appeared to confer a better side effect profile. CONCLUSION: Most high-quality data pertain to the efficacy of topical sirolimus in treating facial angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis. Outcomes are generally promising in other indications and good tolerability, but data quality is mixed.",

Key words included 'topical', 'rapamycin', 'sirolimus' and 'dermatology'. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on drug efficacy, concentration, side effects, co-interventions and follow up were extracted. RESULTS: The search identified 202 studies; 71 studies met the inclusion criteria. Efficacy of topical sirolimus was demonstrated in facial angiofibromas (799 patients) compared to placebo across multiple randomised controlled trials with a predominant concentration of 0.1%. Evidence was mixed for sirolimus use in port-wine stains (61 patients), with evidence of effectiveness in combined sirolimus and pulsed-dye laser. Multiple case reports demonstrated clinical improvement with topical sirolimus use in cutaneous vascular abnormalities (33 patients) at a higher concentration of 1%. Other applications of topical sirolimus were predominantly case reports demonstrating generally favourable outcomes. Topical sirolimus was generally well tolerated - most reported adverse effects were localised irritation and pruritus. Ointment-based preparations and once-daily dosing appeared to confer a better side effect profile. CONCLUSION: Most high-quality data pertain to the efficacy of topical sirolimus in treating facial angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis. Outcomes are generally promising in other indications and good tolerability, but data quality is mixed.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) often present with refractory epilepsy and may be undergoing treatment with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to control seizures. Surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary to monitor for the renal angiomyolipomas associated with TSC; however, MRI of the abdomen is not approved for patients withVNS therapy. We have many TSC patients with refractory epilelpsy who benefitted from VNS therapy, so we developed an MRI protocol that allows MRI of the abdomen to be performed in these patients to permit safe imaging of their kidneys. Here we report our results using this protocol. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review for all TSC patients seen from 01/01/1997 to 10/01/2022 at a single center to determine VNS implantation status. Patients with VNS implants and abdomen imaging performed according to the protocol for kidney surveillance were included. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with 48 total MRIs of the abdomen were found: 34 (71 %) scans were conducted under sedation and 14 (29 %) without sedation. None of the patients reported any adverse effects (pain or discomfort). No instances of VNS dysfunction were noted when re-interrogating the device immediately after completion of the imaging studies or at later neurology follow-up appointments. All MRI scans were of good quality for interpretation. CONCLUSION: Abdominal MRIs performed in typical VNS exclusion zones were not associated with adverse events or VNS dysfunction. We believe this protocol is safe and permits the best method for monitoring renal disease in TSC patients with VNS.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by mutations of either of 2 genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Renal manifestations include angiomyolipomas (AMLs), multiple cysts, and renal cell carcinoma. AMLs increase bleeding tendency and the risk of renal insufficiency which end-stage develops in 1% of affected patients. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman suffering from TSC since early childhood has developed multiple complications associated with this disease. The patient was diagnosed with brain tumor-giant cell astrocytoma-which was removed in 1992. In 2006, right nephrectomy was performed due to the unsuccessful right renal artery embolization after the massive hemorrhage into the AML. Moreover, the right idiopathic pneumothorax occurred twice. Therefore, the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pleurodesis were conducted (2006, 2013). The patient is intellectually disabled and unable to make decisions on her own. Her legal guardians (parents) make all decisions associated with her treatment. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures demanding cooperation were conducted under anesthesia. Because of end-stage renal failure, the patient required the renal replacement therapy (RRT). Preemptive kidney transplantation (KTx) was the best solution for this patient. Procedures such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were infeasible to perform due to the intellectual disability that inhibits essential cooperation. During KTx qualification tests, the expanding AML with risk of hemorrhage was noticed. The patient was qualified for simultaneous left nephrectomy and KTx from the living donor (her father). The surgery was performed on the 2nd of June 2020. The patient is looked after by her parents, stays in good general condition. The patient's creatinine level is maintained at 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: Patients with significant intellectual disability that prevents maintaining conscious cooperation who require RRT must have individually adjusted therapy. In the case of the presented patient, it was decided to perform the preemptive kidney transplantation from her determined father.",

METHODS: Data from 24 consecutive TSC surgical candidates who underwent both HR-ESI and LTM-VEEG was retrospectively collected. PHS and VS were analyzed to hypothesize the symptomatogenic zone localization. LTM-VEEG and HR-ESI localization results were extracted from the diagnostic reports. Localizing value was compared between modalities, taken the resected/disconnected area of surgical patients in consideration. HR-ESI's impact on the epileptogenic zone hypothesis and surgical workup was evaluated. RESULTS: Semiology, interictal EEG, ictal EEG and HR-ESI were localizing in 25%, 54%, 63% and 79% of patients. Inter-modality concordance ranged between 33-89%. In good surgical outcome patients, PHS, VS, interictal EEG, ictal EEG and HR-ESI showed concordance with resected area in 1/9 (11%), 0/9 (0%), 4/9 (44%), 3/9 (33%) and 6/9 patients (67%). HR-ESI positively impacts clinical management in 50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In presurgical evaluation of TSC patients, semiology often has limited localizing value. Presurgical work-up benefits from HR-ESI. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings may advice future presurgical epilepsy workup of TSC patients with the ultimate aim to improve outcome.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a disorder of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway associated with the development of multisystem tumors, including renal angiomyolipoma (AML). These renal tumors are benign by nature but locally invasive and carry a risk for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). The frequency of subsequent renal transplantation in this population is largely uncharacterized, although single-center data suggests that 5%-15% of adult TSC patients are kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data. We included candidates waitlisted between 1987 and 2020 for a first kidney transplant with TSC-associated kidney failure. We utilized descriptive statistics to characterize the frequency of first-time kidney transplant waitlisting and transplantation among persons with TSC and the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model to evaluate characteristics associated with progression from waitlist. RESULTS: We identified 200 TSC-associated kidney failure patients within the waitlist cohort. Of these, 12 were pediatric patients. Two-thirds (N = 134) of waitlisted persons were female. One hundred forty patients received a transplant with a median waitlist time of 2 years. Younger age at waitlisting was associated with a greater probability of progressing to transplant (HR 0.98 [95% CI: 0.96-0.99]). 91.8% of kidney transplant recipients survived 1-year post-transplant with a functioning allograft. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with TSC who are waitlisted for a kidney transplant progress onto transplantation with excellent 1-year post transplant patient and allograft survival.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditionally, intervention was recommended for angiomyolipomas (AMLs) >4 cm due to the risk of catastrophic hemorrhage. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the natural history of AMLs, including growth rates and need for intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review was performed of an AML series from 2002 to 2013, which have been followed prospectively until 2018. We defined lesion size by maximum axial diameter and categorized lesion size at baseline. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A total of 458 patients with 593 AMLs, with a median follow-up of 65.2 mo, were identified. At diagnosis, 534 (90.1%) lesions were <=4 cm. Forty-three interventions were required for 34 (5.7%) AMLs: 30 were treated with embolization, seven surgery, two with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), three with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and one with nivolumab when epithelioid AML was confirmed. The median size at intervention was 4.9 cm (range 1.1-29 cm). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Most (94%) of the lesions grew slowly (growth rate of <0.25 cm/yr) during the period of observation. The number of AMLs <4 cm needed to treat (NNT) prophylactically to prevent one emergent bleed would have been 136 or that to prevent one blood transfusion would have been 205. The NNT (<4 cm) prophylactically to prevent one elective intervention would have been 82. On multivariate analysis, there were significant differences in intervention rates based on tuberous sclerosis complex, size at presentation, and clinical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This large single-institution updated series of renal AMLs demonstrates that early intervention is not required, regardless of the traditional 4 cm cut-off. The vast majority of AMLs are indolent lesions that are predominantly asymptomatic and slow growing. Follow-up should be no more frequent than annually. PATIENT SUMMARY: The majority of angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are indolent, slow-growing lesions that do not require intervention, regardless of size at presentation. We suggest that surveillance is a safe initial approach for patients presenting with AMLs.",

                    "abstract": "Using a targeted transcriptomics approach, we have analyzed resected brain tissue from a cohort of 53 pediatric epilepsy surgery cases, and have found that there is a spectrum of involvement of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as evidenced by the differential expression of immune-specific genes in the affected brain tissue. The specimens with the highest expression of immune-specific genes were from two Rasmussen encephalitis cases, which is known to be a neuro-immunological disease, but also from tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), focal cortical dysplasia, and hemimegalencephaly surgery cases. We obtained T cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta chain sequence data from brain tissue and blood from patients with the highest levels of T cell transcripts. The clonality indices and the frequency of the top 50 Vbeta clonotypes indicated that T cells in the brain were clonally restricted. The top 50 Vbeta clonotypes comprised both public and private (patient specific) clonotypes, and the TCR Vbeta chain third complementarity region (CDR3) of the most abundant public Vbeta clonotype in each brain sample was strikingly similar to a CDR3 that recognizes an immunodominant epitope in either human cytomegalovirus or Epstein Barr virus, or influenza virus A. We found that the frequency of 14 of the top 50 brain Vbeta clonotypes from a TSC surgery case had significantly increased in brain tissue removed to control recurrent seizures 11 months after the first surgery. Conversely, we found that the frequency in the blood of 18 of the top 50 brain clonotypes from a second TSC patient, who was seizure free, had significantly decreased 5 months after surgery indicating that T cell clones found in the brain had contracted in the periphery after removal of the brain area associated with seizure activity and inflammation. However, the frequency of a public and a private clonotype significantly increased in the brain after seizures recurred and the patient underwent a second surgery. Combined single cell gene expression and TCR sequencing of brain-infiltrating leukocytes from the second surgery showed that the two clones were CD8 effector T cells, indicating that they are likely to be pathologically relevant.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of 3-T intraoperative MRI (ioMRI) on the extent of resection of pediatric focal epileptogenic lesions, residual lesion volumes, and postoperative seizure outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. All surgical procedures for focal epilepsy from 2003 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent ioMRI and those who did not. Each group was subdivided into two subcategories according to preoperative MRI visualization of the lesion: those with well-defined and those with poorly defined lesions. The volumes of preoperative lesions and postoperative residual lesions were delineated. Outcome data and patient characteristics were reviewed. The results were compared between the two groups and the two subcategories. RESULTS. Eighty patients were included: 45 in the ioMRI group (24 with well-defined lesions, 21 with poorly defined lesions) and 35 in the non-ioMRI group (18 with well-defined lesions, 17 with poorly defined lesions). The well-defined lesions included tumors and vascular lesions. The poorly defined lesions included malformations of cortical development, hippocampal sclerosis, and tuberous sclerosis. The mean follow-up duration was 5.1 +- 3.3 years. The rate of gross total resection was not significantly different between the ioMRI and non-ioMRI groups (p = 0.46). However, ioMRI findings facilitated further resection during surgery, increasing gross total resection by an additional 11.1%. The ioMRI group had a significant reduction in percentage of residual volume (p < 0.001). Outcome data suggested that ioMRI is protective against poor Engel score (p = 0.048). Although ioMRI prolonged the mean operative time by 1.2 hours (p = 0.002), the additional time was not associated with additional complications. CONCLUSION. Integration of ioMRI into focal epilepsy surgery was associated with smaller residual lesions and was protective against poor Engel score. It prolonged the operative time but without increasing the number of complications.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to better understand the safety and efficacy of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for children with medically refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive pediatric epilepsy patients at a single pediatric center who underwent LITT ablation of epileptogenic foci between May 2017 and December 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, medication use, seizure frequency, prior surgical interventions, procedural details, and pre- and postoperative seizure history were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven pediatric patients (24 male, 13 female) with severe medically refractory epilepsy were included; all underwent stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) prior to LITT. The SEEG electrode placement was based on the preoperative workup and tailored to each patient by the epileptologist and neurosurgeons working together to identify the epileptic network and hopefully quiet borders. Seizure onset was at a mean age of 2.70 +- 2.82 years (range 0.25-12 years), and the mean age at the time of LITT was 9.46 +- 5.08 years (range 2.41-17.86 years). Epilepsy was lesional in 23 patients (18 tuberous sclerosis, 4 focal cortical dysplasia, 1 gliosis) and nonlesional in 14. Eighteen patients had prior surgical interventions including open resections (n = 13: 11 single and 2 multiple), LITT (n = 4), or both (n = 1). LITT targeted a region adjacent to the previous target in 5 cases. The median number of lasers placed during the procedure was 3 (range 1-5). Complications occurred in 14 (37.8%) cases, only 3 (8.11%) of which resulted in a permanent deficit: 1 venous hemorrhage requiring evacuation following laser ablation, 1 aseptic meningitis, 2 immediate postoperative seizures, and 10 neurological deficits (7 transient and 3 permanent). Postoperatively, 22 (59.5%) patients were seizure free at the last follow-up (median follow-up 18.35 months, range 7.40-48.76 months), and the median modified Engel class was I (Engel class I in 22 patients, Engel class II in 2, Engel class III in 2, and Engel class IV in 11). Patients having tried a greater number of antiseizure medications before LITT were less likely to achieve seizure improvement (p = 0.046) or freedom (p = 0.017). Seizure improvement following LITT was associated with a shorter duration of epilepsy prior to LITT (p = 0.044), although postoperative seizure freedom was not associated with a shorter epilepsy duration (p = 0.667). Caregivers reported postoperative neurocognitive improvement in 17 (45.9%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this large single-institution cohort of pediatric patients with medically refractory seizures due to various etiologies, LITT was a relatively safe and effective surgical approach for seizure reduction and seizure freedom at 1 year of follow-up.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystemic disorder caused by inactivating variants in the mTOR pathway inhibitor genes TSC1 and TSC2. Individuals with TSC are predisposed to benign tumors in multiple organs as well as TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) and epilepsy. Pathogenic variants in TSC2 are typically associated with a more severe phenotype compared with TSC1; the TSC2 R905Q variant has been shown to be an exception, where patients have been reported to present with unusually mild TSC features that may be undetected. METHODS: We studied the TSC phenotype of a 13-year-old individual and three family members with a TSC2 c.2714G>A (R905Q) pathogenic variant. RESULTS: Patient 1 presented with severe medically refractory epilepsy without tubers or subependymal nodules and only mild dermatologic features of TSC missed on virtual examinations. Her mother and maternal aunt (Patients 2 and 3-diagnosed after age 50 years) presented with a mild phenotype, with dermatologic features and TAND. Her maternal uncle (Patient 4-diagnosed at age 47 years) displayed the most severe phenotype, presenting with intellectual disability, medically refractory epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study expands the possible phenotypic spectrum of TSC2 R905Q variant, demonstrating an association with severe epilepsy without associated neuroradiological stigmata. This presentation highlights the possibility of occult focal cortical dysplasia in TSC and emphasizes the importance of genetic testing in individuals with severe epilepsy. Moreover, a late adult diagnosis was subsequently made in other family members allowing for appropriate TSC surveillance to occur.",

Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed a subependymal nodule near the foramen of Monro suspected to be SEGA. Genetic analysis identified a tuberous sclerosis complex-1 germ line mutation. Surveillance imaging was recommended for the subependymal tumor. Fourteen months later, he presented with spontaneous hemorrhage into the tumor. Hematoma evacuation and tumor resection revealed SEGA. The college graduate was able to return to full-time work. CONCLUSIONS: We present an unusual cause of intracranial hemorrhage in a young adult.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is a benign brain tumor that occurs in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Surgical removal is the traditional treatment, and expert opinion is strongly against the use of radiotherapy. Recently, success has been reported with the mTor inhibitor everolimus in reducing tumor volume, but regrowth has been observed after dose reduction or cessation. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 40-year-old Asian female patient treated successfully for growing bilateral subependymal giant cell astrocytoma with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy before everolimus became available. After a follow-up of 8 years, everolimus was administered for renal angiomyolipoma and the patient was followed up until 13 years after radiotherapy. Successive magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an 80% volume reduction after radiotherapy that increased to 90% with everolimus. A review of the literature was done leveraging Medline via PubMed, and we assembled a database of 1298 article references and 780 full-text articles in search of evidence for contraindicating radiotherapy in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Varying results of single-fraction radiosurgery were described in a total of 13 cases. Only in two published cases was the radiation dose of fractionated radiotherapy mentioned. One single publication mentions an induced secondary brain tumor 8 years after whole-brain radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of contraindication and exclusion of fractionated radiotherapy in treating subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Our experience demonstrates that subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, as other benign intracranial tumors, responds slowly but progressively to radiotherapy and suggests that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy holds promise to consolidate responses obtained with mTor inhibitors avoiding regrowth after cessation.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is defined as an inherited disorder characterized by renal cyst formation due to mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene, whereas tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome caused by mutation or deletion of the TSC2 gene. A TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, which is caused by a chromosomal mutation that disrupts both the TSC2 and PKD1 genes, has been identified in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and severe early-onset autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The tumor tissue of patients with breast cancer with contiguous gene syndrome has a high mutation burden and produces several neoantigens. A diffuse positive immunohistochemistry staining for cluster of differentiation 8+ in the T cells of breast cancer tissue is consistent with neoantigen production due to high mutation burden. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Japanese woman who had been undergoing dialysis for 23 years because of end-stage renal failure secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was diagnosed as having triple-negative breast cancer and underwent mastectomy in 2015. She had a history of epilepsy and skin hamartoma. Her grandmother, mother, two aunts, four cousins, and one brother were also on dialysis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Her brother had epilepsy and a brain nodule. Another brother had a syndrome of kidney failure, intellectual disability, and diabetes mellitus, which seemed to be caused by mutation in the CREBBP gene. Immunohistochemistry of our patient's breast tissue showed cluster of differentiation 8 and programmed cell death ligand 1 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Programmed cell death ligand 1 checkpoint therapy may be effective for recurrence of triple-negative breast cancer in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and tuberous sclerosis complex.",

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the predominant non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents and young adults. Metronomic chemotherapy (mCHEMO) ca be defined as the frequent, regular administration of drug doses able to maintain a low, but active, range of concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs, during prolonged periods of time. We present the case of a young woman with severe TS, who developed DLBCL. She was treated consecutively with the mCHEMO schedule R-DEVEC (prednisone, vinorelbine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide plus rituximab) and then ibrutinib, achieving an impressive long-lasting complete remission. In conclusion, alternative treatments could be necessary when comorbidities are present in patients and mCHEMO can be a potential successful therapeutic approach in frail subjects.",

                    "abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy, the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the dynamic and long-term efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) induced by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In addition, the impact of VNS on cognition and emotion after a one-year follow-up was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 17 patients diagnosed with DRE induced by TSC were retrospectively recruited between 2008 and 2019. Dynamic changes in seizure frequency were observed in the responders (>=50% reduction of seizure frequency at last follow-up) and non-responders. Clinical characteristics and seizure outcomes were comprehensively analyzed to determine factors associated with seizure outcomes. The Wechsler intelligence scale was applied in a subgroup of six pediatric patients, whereas the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were assessed in a subgroup of nine patients to determine the impact of VNS therapy on cognitive performance and emotional state. RESULTS: The follow-up duration for the 17 patients who underwent VNS treatment ranged from 0.5 to 10 years (mean +- SD: 4.1 +- 3.2 years). Monthly seizures decreased significantly from three months to four years post-treatment (p < 0.05). At the last follow-up, 70.6% of the patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and three patients were completely seizure free. Comparatively, non-responder patients experienced deterioration of seizure frequency after the first year. Notably, after one-year follow-up the mean standard score of full-scale intelligence quotient increased from 67.33 to 69.5 (p = 0.078) while the mean, standard score of SDS decreased from 49.22 to 45.67 (p = 0.003) compared to preoperative neuropsychological evaluation results. CONCLUSION: VNS is a safe and effective treatment for patients with DRE caused by TSC. Although early outcomes were encouraging, a follow-up of at least one-year was required to predict long-term outcomes in patients receiving VNS treatment. Moreover, VNS may improve depressive mood in patients with DRE caused by TSC. Further investigations are needed to validate the present results.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a patient with refractory TRE who received deep brain stimulation of anterior thalamic nucleus (ANT-DBS) and achieved a satisfactory response. To our knowledge, this is the first case of TRE being treated with ANT-DBS. A 22-year-old male was admitted to the hospital for refractory TRE seeking surgical treatment. Seizures were mainly manifested by deep temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy and suspected to originate in the limbic system. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive potentially epileptogenic nodules in the brain lacking significant nodules. Scalp electroencephalogram showed a comprehensive, bilateral synchronous low-voltage rapid rhythm, unable to localize seizure origin. We performed bilateral ANT-DBS according to the preoperative evaluation, and the frequency and intensity of seizures were significantly reduced after the 15-month follow-up (P <0.05, Student's t-test). Our case extends the therapeutic indications of ANT-DBS to a certain extent, providing a neuromodulation alternative to vagus nerve stimulation for patients with TRE who are unsuitable candidates or refuse resection.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the dynamic and long-term efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) induced by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In addition, the impact of VNS on cognition and emotion after a one-year follow-up was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 17 patients diagnosed with DRE induced by TSC were retrospectively recruited between 2008 and 2019. Dynamic changes in seizure frequency were observed in the responders (>=50% reduction of seizure frequency at last follow-up) and non-responders. Clinical characteristics and seizure outcomes were comprehensively analyzed to determine factors associated with seizure outcomes. The Wechsler intelligence scale was applied in a subgroup of six pediatric patients, whereas the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were assessed in a subgroup of nine patients to determine the impact of VNS therapy on cognitive performance and emotional state. RESULTS: The follow-up duration for the 17 patients who underwent VNS treatment ranged from 0.5 to 10 years (mean +- SD: 4.1 +- 3.2 years). Monthly seizures decreased significantly from three months to four years post-treatment (p < 0.05). At the last follow-up, 70.6% of the patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and three patients were completely seizure free. Comparatively, non-responder patients experienced deterioration of seizure frequency after the first year. Notably, after one-year follow-up the mean standard score of full-scale intelligence quotient increased from 67.33 to 69.5 (p = 0.078) while the mean, standard score of SDS decreased from 49.22 to 45.67 (p = 0.003) compared to preoperative neuropsychological evaluation results. CONCLUSION: VNS is a safe and effective treatment for patients with DRE caused by TSC. Although early outcomes were encouraging, a follow-up of at least one-year was required to predict long-term outcomes in patients receiving VNS treatment. Moreover, VNS may improve depressive mood in patients with DRE caused by TSC. Further investigations are needed to validate the present results.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) affects many children. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

                    "abstract": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy, the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.",

A TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, which is caused by a chromosomal mutation that disrupts both the TSC2 and PKD1 genes, has been identified in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and severe early-onset autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The tumor tissue of patients with breast cancer with contiguous gene syndrome has a high mutation burden and produces several neoantigens. A diffuse positive immunohistochemistry staining for cluster of differentiation 8+ in the T cells of breast cancer tissue is consistent with neoantigen production due to high mutation burden. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Japanese woman who had been undergoing dialysis for 23 years because of end-stage renal failure secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was diagnosed as having triple-negative breast cancer and underwent mastectomy in 2015. She had a history of epilepsy and skin hamartoma. Her grandmother, mother, two aunts, four cousins, and one brother were also on dialysis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Her brother had epilepsy and a brain nodule. Another brother had a syndrome of kidney failure, intellectual disability, and diabetes mellitus, which seemed to be caused by mutation in the CREBBP gene. Immunohistochemistry of our patient's breast tissue showed cluster of differentiation 8 and programmed cell death ligand 1 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Programmed cell death ligand 1 checkpoint therapy may be effective for recurrence of triple-negative breast cancer in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and tuberous sclerosis complex.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the preferred treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), while preemptive (PE) living donor (LD) KT is associated with better survival, quality of life, and lower costs. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder. Renal involvement (multiple bilateral angiomyolipoma [AMLs], cysts, renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) is related to significant morbidity, including ESKD and KT. Nephrectomy in TSC patients before KT is controversial. Affected kidneys carry a risk of hemorrhage or malignancy, while AMLs may be fat-poor and are often hardly distinguishable from RCC in magnetic resonance (MR)/computed tomography. On the other hand nephrectomy impedes PE KT. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) have proved efficacy in many TSC complications, including AMLs, fat-poor AMLs, TSC-related RCC, and immunosuppressive (IS) treatment. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female TSC patient was referred for evaluation to the TSC reference center. Her family history was negative for TSC. A clinical evaluation revealed multisystem TSC manifestation (skin, brain, lungs, kidneys). MR disclosed indeterminate fat-poor renal lesions, possibly AMLs, but RCC could not be excluded. A comparison with previous MR did not show any significant progression. Due to ESKD, the patient was qualified for PE LD (mother) KT. mTORi, sirolimus, was used in IS. Creatinine at discharge was 2.1 mg/dL. Sixteen months later, MR showed significant reduction in tumor size. Two years after KT, graft function remained stable (creatinine 1.98 mg/dL). No complications related to renal lesions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: mTORi are the therapy of choice in TSC patients after KT, achieving IS effect and improvement in TSC manifestations while avoiding nephrectomy and management of patients with indeterminate renal lesions, especially in the case of PE KT.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by mutations of either of 2 genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Renal manifestations include angiomyolipomas (AMLs), multiple cysts, and renal cell carcinoma. AMLs increase bleeding tendency and the risk of renal insufficiency which end-stage develops in 1% of affected patients. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman suffering from TSC since early childhood has developed multiple complications associated with this disease. The patient was diagnosed with brain tumor-giant cell astrocytoma-which was removed in 1992. In 2006, right nephrectomy was performed due to the unsuccessful right renal artery embolization after the massive hemorrhage into the AML. Moreover, the right idiopathic pneumothorax occurred twice. Therefore, the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pleurodesis were conducted (2006, 2013). The patient is intellectually disabled and unable to make decisions on her own. Her legal guardians (parents) make all decisions associated with her treatment. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures demanding cooperation were conducted under anesthesia. Because of end-stage renal failure, the patient required the renal replacement therapy (RRT). Preemptive kidney transplantation (KTx) was the best solution for this patient. Procedures such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were infeasible to perform due to the intellectual disability that inhibits essential cooperation. During KTx qualification tests, the expanding AML with risk of hemorrhage was noticed. The patient was qualified for simultaneous left nephrectomy and KTx from the living donor (her father). The surgery was performed on the 2nd of June 2020. The patient is looked after by her parents, stays in good general condition. The patient's creatinine level is maintained at 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: Patients with significant intellectual disability that prevents maintaining conscious cooperation who require RRT must have individually adjusted therapy. In the case of the presented patient, it was decided to perform the preemptive kidney transplantation from her determined father.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of the immunosuppressive agent sirolimus (SRL) following liver transplantation (LT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Sirolimus is a typical mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, and tuberous sclerosis 1-tuberous sclerosis 2 complex (TSC1/TSC2) is an important negative effector in the mTOR pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of SRL-based immunosuppression on the prognosis of LT recipients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria based on TSC1/2 expression and explored the effect of TSC1 on HCC in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 120 HCC patients who underwent LT in our hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 30, 2018. All patients had HCC beyond the Milan criteria and were divided into the SRL group (n = 50) and non-SRL group (n = 70). TSC1/2 expression levels in paraffin-embedded tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and then analyzed as subgroups. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. TSC1 expression was silenced in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 cell lines for further cell function experiments. RESULTS: 88.3% of patients were HBV LT recipients. The SRL group exhibited better DFS and OS compared to the non-SRL group (P = 0.02, P = 0.003). Subgroup (TSC1-based or TSC2-based) analyses revealed that patients with low TSC1 or TSC2 expression benefited from sirolimus (DFS: P = 0.046, OS: P = 0.006 for TSC1; DFS: P = 0.05, OS: P = 0.003 for TSC2) compared with patients with high expression. TSC1 knockdown in Huh-7 and Bel-7402 HCC cell lines activated the mTORC1 pathway and enhanced cell proliferation, migration and sensitivity to SRL in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: TSC1/2 expression could be used to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who underwent SRL-based immunosuppression following LT. TSC1 knockdown promoted HCC malignancy and enhanced sensitivity to SRL.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol has been shown to be effective in seizure reduction in patients with Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis. However, very little is known about its potential to reduce interictal epileptiform activity and improve sleep architecture. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the influence of cannabidiol therapy on the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and sleep microstructure in a cohort of children with drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: Children with drug-resistant epilepsy were prospectively followed from November 2019 to January 2021 during an open-label trial of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day) and stable concomitant medication. Electroencephalograms were recorded at baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1). Two independent raters, blinded to clinical outcome, evaluated 5-min segments of sleep stage 2 or low-noise awake state. IEDs were visually identified and rates per minute calculated. Sleep microstructure was considered improved if sleep structures were seen at T1 that were not present at T0. IED rates at T0 and T1 were compared and correlated with seizure outcome, cannabidiol dose, initial IED rate, and disease duration. RESULTS: In total, 35 children (mean +- standard deviation age 10.1 +- 0.86) were included. The IED rate at T1 was significantly lower than at T0 (19.6 +- 19.5 vs. 36.8 +- 27.2, respectively; p < 0.0001). We found a moderate correlation between IED reduction and percentage of seizure reduction compared with baseline (Pearson's r = 0.39; p = 0.02), a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and IED rate at T0 (r = - 0.34; p = 0.04), and a trend towards a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and disease duration (r = - 0.32; p = 0.06). Sleep was recorded in 23 patients. Sleep microstructure was initially abnormal in 56.5% of sleep recordings and improved in 84.6% of those cases. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest the utility of cannabidiol in reducing IEDs and improving sleep microstructure in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Larger controlled studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of this effect in different epilepsy types. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00013177; 25 June 2019.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is defined as an inherited disorder characterized by renal cyst formation due to mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene, whereas tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome caused by mutation or deletion of the TSC2 gene. A TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, which is caused by a chromosomal mutation that disrupts both the TSC2 and PKD1 genes, has been identified in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and severe early-onset autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The tumor tissue of patients with breast cancer with contiguous gene syndrome has a high mutation burden and produces several neoantigens. A diffuse positive immunohistochemistry staining for cluster of differentiation 8+ in the T cells of breast cancer tissue is consistent with neoantigen production due to high mutation burden. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Japanese woman who had been undergoing dialysis for 23 years because of end-stage renal failure secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was diagnosed as having triple-negative breast cancer and underwent mastectomy in 2015. She had a history of epilepsy and skin hamartoma. Her grandmother, mother, two aunts, four cousins, and one brother were also on dialysis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Her brother had epilepsy and a brain nodule. Another brother had a syndrome of kidney failure, intellectual disability, and diabetes mellitus, which seemed to be caused by mutation in the CREBBP gene. Immunohistochemistry of our patient's breast tissue showed cluster of differentiation 8 and programmed cell death ligand 1 positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Programmed cell death ligand 1 checkpoint therapy may be effective for recurrence of triple-negative breast cancer in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and tuberous sclerosis complex.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol has been shown to be effective in seizure reduction in patients with Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis. However, very little is known about its potential to reduce interictal epileptiform activity and improve sleep architecture. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the influence of cannabidiol therapy on the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and sleep microstructure in a cohort of children with drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: Children with drug-resistant epilepsy were prospectively followed from November 2019 to January 2021 during an open-label trial of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day) and stable concomitant medication. Electroencephalograms were recorded at baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1). Two independent raters, blinded to clinical outcome, evaluated 5-min segments of sleep stage 2 or low-noise awake state. IEDs were visually identified and rates per minute calculated. Sleep microstructure was considered improved if sleep structures were seen at T1 that were not present at T0. IED rates at T0 and T1 were compared and correlated with seizure outcome, cannabidiol dose, initial IED rate, and disease duration. RESULTS: In total, 35 children (mean +- standard deviation age 10.1 +- 0.86) were included. The IED rate at T1 was significantly lower than at T0 (19.6 +- 19.5 vs. 36.8 +- 27.2, respectively; p < 0.0001). We found a moderate correlation between IED reduction and percentage of seizure reduction compared with baseline (Pearson's r = 0.39; p = 0.02), a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and IED rate at T0 (r = - 0.34; p = 0.04), and a trend towards a moderate negative correlation between IED reduction and disease duration (r = - 0.32; p = 0.06). Sleep was recorded in 23 patients. Sleep microstructure was initially abnormal in 56.5% of sleep recordings and improved in 84.6% of those cases. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest the utility of cannabidiol in reducing IEDs and improving sleep microstructure in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Larger controlled studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of this effect in different epilepsy types. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00013177; 25 June 2019.",

The therapeutic potential of oral CBD formulations is limited by extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Following oral administration, the inactive metabolite blood concentration is ~40-fold higher than CBD. Inhalation bypasses the pharmacokinetic (PK) variability attributed to irregular gastrointestinal absorption and first-pass hepatic metabolism and may efficiently deliver CBD into systemic circulation. This phase 1 study compared the PK of a dry-powder inhaler (DPI) CBD formulation (10 mg powder containing 2.1 mg CBD) with an oral CBD solution (Epidiolex , 50 mg) in healthy participants. Following a single dose of Epidiolex or DPI CBD (n=10 PK evaluable participants each), the maximum CBD concentration for the inhaled powder was 71-fold higher than that of Epidiolex while administering 24-fold less CBD. The mean time to reach maximum concentration was 3.8 min for the DPI CBD formulation compared with 122 min for Epidiolex. Both Epidiolex and DPI CBD were generally safe and well-tolerated. These data indicate that DPI CBD provided more rapid onset and increased bioavailability than oral CBD and support further investigations on the use of DPI CBD for acute indications.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are WHO grade 1 tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis that classically arise from the ventricular wall near the caudate groove and foramen of Monro. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive surgical technique, which works by heating a stereotactically placed laser fiber to ablative temperatures under MRI thermometry monitoring. In this paper, the authors present LITT as a surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs. METHODS: Twelve patients with SEGAs who underwent 16 procedures between 2007 and 2022 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. These patients underwent either open resection or LITT. Clinical data, imaging, recurrence rate, further treatments, and related complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 16 procedures, 9 were open resection and 7 were LITT. An external ventricular drain was placed in 66% (6/9) of open procedures and 57.1% (4/7) of LITT cases. A septostomy was performed in 56% (5/9) of open procedures and 29% (2/7) of LITT cases. Complication rates were higher in open cases than in LITT procedures (44% vs 0%, p < 0.05). Complications included hydrocephalus, transient venous ischemia, wound infection, and bone flap migration. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 3.3-5.5 days) for open cases and 4 days (IQR 3.0-7.0 days) for LITT procedures. Recurrence or progression occurred after 3 open cases and 2 LITT cases (33% vs 33%, p = 0.803). For the recurrences, 2 open cases underwent stereotactic radiosurgery, 1 open case underwent LITT, and 1 LITT case underwent repeat LITT. Among the LITT cases, only the patients with no decrease in tumor size by 6 months experienced tumor progression afterward. The 2 LITT cases with progression were the only ones with calcification present on preoperative imaging. The median follow-up times for cases assessed for progression were 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-14.4 years) for open resection and 3.9 years (IQR 3.4-5.1 years) for LITT. CONCLUSIONS: The small size of this case series limits generalizability or adequate comparison of safety. However, this series adds to the literature supporting LITT as a less invasive surgical alternative to open resection of SEGAs and demonstrates that LITT has similar recurrence and/or progression rates to open resection. Additional studies with more data are necessary for comprehensive comparisons between open resection and LITT for treating SEGA.",
