However, the mechanism underlying PD-L1 expression in cancer cells is not fully understood, particularly after ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we examined the impact of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon-ion irradiation on the expression of PD-L1 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. We found that the upregulation of PD-L1 expression after high LET carbon-ion irradiation was greater than that induced by X-rays at the same physical and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) dose, and that the upregulation of PD-L1 induced by high LET carbon-ion irradiation was predominantly dependent on ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase activity. Moreover, we showed that the downstream signaling, e.g. STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression, was upregulated to a greater extent after high LET carbon-ion irradiation than X-rays, and that IRF1 upregulation was also ATR dependent. Finally, to visualize PD-L1 molecules on the cell surface in 3D, we applied immunofluorescence-based super-resolution imaging. The three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) analyses revealed substantial increases in the number of presented PD-L1 molecules on the cell surface after high LET carbon-ion irradiation compared with X-ray irradiation.",

This clinical conundrum poses three challenges for local drug delivery systems: stable and continuous delivery, good biocompatibility, and the ability to package new targeted drugs that can synergizing with other treatments.Here, we report a drug-laden hydrogel generated from pure DNA strands and highly programmable in adjusting its mesh size. Meanwhile, the DNA hydrogel could assist the micro-crystallization of a novel radiosensitizing drugs, ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor (Elimusertib), further facilitating its long-term release. When applied to the tumor site, the hydrogel system demonstrated significant antitumor activity, minimized systemic toxicity, and had a modulatory effect on the tumor-immune cell interface.

ATR inhibitor was administered combined with ablative radiotherapy to assess its radiosensitizing effect on lung cancer cells. Treatment response and survival were evaluated in vivo using A549 xenograft flank tumor and synchronous LLC lung and flank tumor mouse models. Mice received ablative radiotherapy (12 Gy/d for 2 d), ATR inhibitor, and ICI. The tumor microenvironment was assessed in irradiated flank and non-irradiated lung tumors. Programmed death-ligand 1 expression was upregulated after irradiation. ATR inhibition attenuated this upregulation. ATR inhibitor pretreatment decreased cell survival after irradiation by inhibiting DNA double-strand break repair, inducing mitotic cell death, and altering cell cycle progression. ATR inhibition enhanced radiation-induced damage-associated molecular patterns determined by high mobility group box 1 quantification and activated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Combined ATR inhibition and ablative radiotherapy inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in mice. Adding ICI therapy further enhanced local antitumor effects, reducing the metastatic lung tumor burden and remodeling the tumor microenvironment through immunogenic cell death induction and enhanced immune cell infiltration. Triple therapy increased immune cell infiltration in distant non-irradiated lung tumors and stimulated the generation of protective T-cell immunity in splenocytes. Safety analysis showed minimal toxicity. ATR inhibition enhanced the efficacy of ablative radiotherapy and immunotherapy in lung cancer. These findings underscore the importance of combination therapies for enhancing systemic antitumor immune responses and outcomes.",

Inhibition of WEE1 can increase the instability of the genome and have anti-tumor effects in some solid tumors. However, it has certain limitations for multiple cancer cells from different lineages. Therefore, we consider the use of synthetic lethal interactions to enhance the therapeutic effect. Our experiments proved that WEE1 inhibitor (WEE1i) can activate the ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) pathway and that blockage of ATR dramatically sensitized the WEE1i-induced cell death. The tumor-selective synthetic lethality between bioavailable WEE1 and ATR inhibitors led to tumor remission in vivo. Mechanistically, the combination promoted the accumulation of cytosolic double-strand DNA, which subsequently activated the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway and induced the production of type I interferon and CD8+ T cells, thereby inducing anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, our study found that immune checkpoint programmed death-ligand 1 is upregulated by the combination therapy, and blocking PD-L1 further enhances the effect of the combination therapy. In summary, as an immunomodulator, the combination of WEE1i with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) and immune checkpoint blockers provides a potential new approach for cancer treatment.",

In the chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer preclinical model, we investigated whether AZD6738 (an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor) could synergize with belotecan (a camptothecin analog and topoisomerase I inhibitor). In vitro, both chemotherapy-resistant and chemotherapy-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines showed synergistic anti-proliferative activity with a combination treatment of belotecan and AZD6738. The combination also demonstrated synergistic tumor inhibition in mice with a chemotherapy-resistant cell line xenograft. Mechanistically, belotecan, a DNA-damaging agent, increased phospho-ATR (pATR) and phospho-Chk1 (pChk1) in consecutive order, indicating the activation of the DNA repair system. This consequently induced G2/M arrest in the cell cycle analysis. However, when AZD6738 was added to belotecan, pATR and pChk1 induced by belotecan alone were suppressed again. A cell cycle analysis in betotecan showed a sub-G1 increase as well as a G2/M decrease, representing the release of G2/M arrest and the induction of apoptosis. In ascites-derived primary cancer cells from both chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer patients, this combination was also synergistic, providing further support for our hypothesis. The combined administration of ATR inhibitor and belotecan proved to be synergistic in our preclinical model. This combination warrants further investigation in a clinical trial, with a particular aim of overcoming chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer.",

Next, the mouse sperm model exhibiting oxidative stress-induced DNA damage by exogenously treating with H2O2 but overcoming the low fertilization rate of frozen-thawed sperm was used to investigate the effect of EGCG on the embryonic development and the potential EGCG-mediated effects on ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pSer-1981 in zygotes, the latter was known for leading to the activation of major kinases involved in the DNA repair pathway and the cell cycle checkpoint pathway.

EGCG promoted the development of embryos inseminated with both types of sperm at optimum concentration. In embryos inseminated with the H2O2 sperm, fertilization, embryonic development, and the time at which the cleavage rate of one-cell embryos reached >=95% were not affected by EGCG treatment. However, the EGCG-treated group required less time to achieve 50% cleavage rate of one-cell embryos, and the EGCG-treated zygotes showed enhanced expression of ATM (pSer-1981) than the untreated group.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Advances in germline genetic testing have led to a surge in identification of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) variant carriers among breast cancer patients, raising numerous questions regarding use of breast radiation therapy (RT) in this population. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed identified articles assessing association(s) between the germline ATM variant status and the risk of toxicity after breast RT. An expert panel of breast radiation oncologists, genetic counselors, and basic scientists convened to review the association between ATM variants and radiation-induced toxicity or secondary malignancy risk and to determine any impact on breast RT recommendations. RESULTS: Carriers of pathogenic variants in ATM have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk for developing breast cancer. ATM variants do not consistently increase risks of toxicities after RT, except possibly among patients with the single nucleotide variant c5557G>A (rs1801516), in whom a small increased risk for the development of both acute and late radiation effects has been identified. In most breast cancer patients with ATM variants, the excess 5-year absolute risk of developing a secondary contralateral breast cancer (CBC) after radiation is extremely low. The exception is in women younger than 45 years old with deleterious rare ATM missense variants, who may be at higher risk for developing a radiation-induced CBC over time. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiation is safe for most breast cancer patients who harbor ATM variants. The possible exceptions are patients with the variant c5557G>A (rs1801516) and patients younger than 45 years old with certain rare deleterious ATM variants, who may be at higher risk for developing CBC. These latter patients should be counseled regarding this potential risk, and every effort should be made to minimize the contralateral breast dose. However, the inconsistency of published data limits precise recommendations, magnifying the need for further prospective studies and the development of a centralized database cataloging RT outcomes and genetic status.",

This clinical conundrum poses three challenges for local drug delivery systems: stable and continuous delivery, good biocompatibility, and the ability to package new targeted drugs that can synergizing with other treatments.Here, we report a drug-laden hydrogel generated from pure DNA strands and highly programmable in adjusting its mesh size. Meanwhile, the DNA hydrogel could assist the micro-crystallization of a novel radiosensitizing drugs, ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor (Elimusertib), further facilitating its long-term release. When applied to the tumor site, the hydrogel system demonstrated significant antitumor activity, minimized systemic toxicity, and had a modulatory effect on the tumor-immune cell interface.

Abnormal apoptosis is closely related to liver-related diseases, and p53 is one of the important hallmark proteins in apoptosis progression. This study was to investigate whether arsenic poisoning-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and the underlying role of p53 signaling pathway. A rat model of arsenic poisoning was established by feeding corn powder for 90 days, which was baked with high arsenic coal, then were treated with Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) for 45 days by gavage. The results showed that arsenic induced liver damage, increased hepatocyte apoptosis and elevated the expression level of Chk1 and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 in liver tissues, which were significantly attenuated by GBE. Additionally, to further demonstrate the potential apoptosis-associated mechanism, L-02 cells were pre-incubated with p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha), ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (CGK733) or GBE, then treated with sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) for 24 h. The results showed that GBE, PFTalpha or CGK733 significantly reduced arsenic-induced Chk1 expression and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2. In conclusion, Chk1-p53 pathway was involved in arsenic poisoning-induced hepatotoxicity, and inhibiting of Chk1-p53 pathway ameliorated hepatocyte apoptosis caused by coal-burning arsenic poisoning. The study provides a pivotal clue for understanding of the mechanism of arsenic poisoning-induced liver damage, and possible intervention strategies.",

                    "abstract": "Arsenic is a naturally occurring environmental toxicant, chronic exposure to arsenic can cause multiorgan damage, except for typical skin lesions, liver damage is the main problem for health concern in population with arsenic poisoning. Abnormal apoptosis is closely related to liver-related diseases, and p53 is one of the important hallmark proteins in apoptosis progression. This study was to investigate whether arsenic poisoning-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and the underlying role of p53 signaling pathway. A rat model of arsenic poisoning was established by feeding corn powder for 90 days, which was baked with high arsenic coal, then were treated with Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) for 45 days by gavage. The results showed that arsenic induced liver damage, increased hepatocyte apoptosis and elevated the expression level of Chk1 and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 in liver tissues, which were significantly attenuated by GBE. Additionally, to further demonstrate the potential apoptosis-associated mechanism, L-02 cells were pre-incubated with p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha), ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (CGK733) or GBE, then treated with sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) for 24 h. The results showed that GBE, PFTalpha or CGK733 significantly reduced arsenic-induced Chk1 expression and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2. In conclusion, Chk1-p53 pathway was involved in arsenic poisoning-induced hepatotoxicity, and inhibiting of Chk1-p53 pathway ameliorated hepatocyte apoptosis caused by coal-burning arsenic poisoning. The study provides a pivotal clue for understanding of the mechanism of arsenic poisoning-induced liver damage, and possible intervention strategies.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of single-stranded DNA repair by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 (ATR) may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and other chemotherapeutic agents. Cisplatin with gemcitabine remains the standard up-front therapy for treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of the selective ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, could augment the activity of cisplatin with gemcitabine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, 87 patients across 23 centers in the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network were randomized to receive either cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (control arm) or cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib (experimental arm). Key eligibility criteria included confirmed metastatic urothelial cancer, no prior cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease, 12 months or more since perioperative therapy, and eligibility for cisplatin receipt based on standard criteria. The study was conducted from January 27, 2017, to December 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival. The analysis was on all patients who started therapy. RESULTS: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib. Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08). Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68). Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm. Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination. Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.

It also examined exploratory predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 36) received a fixed dose of carboplatin (AUC5) with escalating doses of ceralasertib (20 mg twice daily to 60 mg once daily) in 21-day cycles. Sequential and concurrent combination dosing schedules were assessed. RESULTS: Two ceralasertib MTD dose schedules, 20 mg twice daily on days 4-13 and 40 mg once daily on days 1-2, were tolerated with carboplatin AUC5; the latter was declared the RP2D. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade >=3) were anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and neutropenia (25%). Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2; including one grade 4 platelet count decreased) and a combination of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 3 patients. Ceralasertib was quickly absorbed (tmax ~1 hour), with a terminal plasma half-life of 8-11 hours. Upregulation of pRAD50, indicative of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, was observed in tumor biopsies during ceralasertib treatment. Two patients with absent or low ATM or SLFN11 protein expression achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial responses. Eighteen of 34 (53%) response-evaluable patients had RECIST v1.1 stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D for ceralasertib plus carboplatin was established as ceralasertib 40 mg once daily on days 1-2 administered with carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks, with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies confirming pharmacodynamic modulation and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity observed.",

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade >=3) were anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and neutropenia (25%). Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2; including one grade 4 platelet count decreased) and a combination of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 3 patients. Ceralasertib was quickly absorbed (tmax ~1 hour), with a terminal plasma half-life of 8-11 hours. Upregulation of pRAD50, indicative of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, was observed in tumor biopsies during ceralasertib treatment. Two patients with absent or low ATM or SLFN11 protein expression achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial responses. Eighteen of 34 (53%) response-evaluable patients had RECIST v1.1 stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D for ceralasertib plus carboplatin was established as ceralasertib 40 mg once daily on days 1-2 administered with carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks, with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies confirming pharmacodynamic modulation and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity observed.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of single-stranded DNA repair by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 (ATR) may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and other chemotherapeutic agents. Cisplatin with gemcitabine remains the standard up-front therapy for treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of the selective ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, could augment the activity of cisplatin with gemcitabine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, 87 patients across 23 centers in the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network were randomized to receive either cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (control arm) or cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib (experimental arm). Key eligibility criteria included confirmed metastatic urothelial cancer, no prior cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease, 12 months or more since perioperative therapy, and eligibility for cisplatin receipt based on standard criteria. The study was conducted from January 27, 2017, to December 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival. The analysis was on all patients who started therapy. RESULTS: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib. Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08). Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68). Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm. Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination. Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Ceralasertib is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with solid tumors, enriched for melanoma, received ceralasertib in combination with a fixed dose of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on D1, D8, D15) in 28-day cycles. The dose of ceralasertib was escalated to reach an MTD in a rolling 6 design. The starting dose of ceralasertib was 40 mg QD. Fifty-seven patients (33 patients with melanoma who failed prior PD1/L1 treatment) were enrolled in 7 dose cohorts ranging from 40 mg QD to 240 mg BD plus weekly paclitaxel. RESULTS: The RP2D was established as ceralasertib 240 mg BD days 1-14 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, D8, D15 every 28 days. The most common toxicities were neutropenia (n = 39, 68%), anemia (n = 25, 44%), and thrombocytopenia (n = 21, 37%). In the full analysis set of 57 patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 22.6% (95% CI, 12.5-35.3). In 33 patients with melanoma, resistant to prior anti-PD1 therapy, the ORR was 33.3% (95% CI, 18.0-51.8). In the melanoma subset, the mPFS was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.0-5.8), the median duration of response was 9.9 months (95% CI, 3.7-23.2), and the mOS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.7-11.9). CONCLUSIONS: Ceralasertib in combination with paclitaxel was well tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies and showed evidence of antitumor activity. Durable responses were observed in patients with advanced cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanoma resistant to anti-PD1/L1 treatment.See related commentary by Ashworth, p. 4667.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study reports the safety, tolerability, MTD, recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of ceralasertib combined with carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. It also examined exploratory predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 36) received a fixed dose of carboplatin (AUC5) with escalating doses of ceralasertib (20 mg twice daily to 60 mg once daily) in 21-day cycles. Sequential and concurrent combination dosing schedules were assessed. RESULTS: Two ceralasertib MTD dose schedules, 20 mg twice daily on days 4-13 and 40 mg once daily on days 1-2, were tolerated with carboplatin AUC5; the latter was declared the RP2D. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade >=3) were anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and neutropenia (25%). Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2; including one grade 4 platelet count decreased) and a combination of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 3 patients. Ceralasertib was quickly absorbed (tmax ~1 hour), with a terminal plasma half-life of 8-11 hours. Upregulation of pRAD50, indicative of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, was observed in tumor biopsies during ceralasertib treatment. Two patients with absent or low ATM or SLFN11 protein expression achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial responses. Eighteen of 34 (53%) response-evaluable patients had RECIST v1.1 stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D for ceralasertib plus carboplatin was established as ceralasertib 40 mg once daily on days 1-2 administered with carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks, with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies confirming pharmacodynamic modulation and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity observed.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of single-stranded DNA repair by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 (ATR) may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and other chemotherapeutic agents. Cisplatin with gemcitabine remains the standard up-front therapy for treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of the selective ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, could augment the activity of cisplatin with gemcitabine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, 87 patients across 23 centers in the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network were randomized to receive either cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (control arm) or cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib (experimental arm). Key eligibility criteria included confirmed metastatic urothelial cancer, no prior cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease, 12 months or more since perioperative therapy, and eligibility for cisplatin receipt based on standard criteria. The study was conducted from January 27, 2017, to December 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival. The analysis was on all patients who started therapy. RESULTS: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib. Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08). Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68). Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm. Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination. Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.

                    "abstract": "Steroid hormone signaling induces vast gene expression programs which necessitate the local formation of transcription factories at regulatory regions and large-scale alterations of the genome architecture to allow communication among distantly related cis-acting regions. This involves major stress at the genomic DNA level. Transcriptionally active regions are generally instable and prone to breakage due to the torsional stress and local depletion of nucleosomes that make DNA more accessible to damaging agents. A dedicated DNA damage response (DDR) is therefore essential to maintain genome integrity at these exposed regions. The DDR is a complex network involving DNA damage sensor proteins, such as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, as central regulators. The tight interplay between the DDR and steroid hormone receptors has been unraveled recently. Several DNA repair factors interact with the androgen and estrogen receptors and support their transcriptional functions. Conversely, both receptors directly control the expression of agents involved in the DDR. Impaired DDR is also exploited by tumors to acquire advantageous mutations. Cancer cells often harbor germline or somatic alterations in DDR genes, and their association with disease outcome and treatment response led to intensive efforts towards identifying selective inhibitors targeting the major players in this process. The PARP-1 inhibitors are now approved for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer with specific genomic alterations. Additional DDR-targeting agents are being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or in combination with treatments eliciting DNA damage (e.g., radiation therapy, including targeted radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) or addressing targets involved in maintenance of genome integrity. Recent preclinical and clinical findings made in addressing DNA repair dysfunction in hormone-dependent and -independent prostate and breast tumors are presented. Importantly, the combination of anti-hormonal therapy with DDR inhibition or with radiation has the potential to enhance efficacy but still needs further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "With the advent of precision genomics, hereditary predisposition to hematopoietic neoplasms- collectively known as hereditary predisposition syndromes (HPS)-are being increasingly recognized in clinical practice. Familial clustering was first observed in patients with leukemia, which led to the identification of several germline variants, such as RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, DDX41, and ETV6, among others, now established as HPS, with tendency to develop myeloid neoplasms. However, evidence for hereditary predisposition is also apparent in lymphoid and plasma--cell neoplasms, with recent discoveries of germline variants in genes such as IKZF1, SH2B3, PAX5 (familial acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and KDM1A/LSD1 (familial multiple myeloma). Specific inherited bone marrow failure syndromes-such as GATA2 haploinsufficiency syndromes, short telomere syndromes, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, and familial thrombocytopenias-also have an increased predisposition to develop myeloid neoplasms, whereas inherited immune deficiency syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, and Bruton agammaglobulinemia, are associated with an increased risk for lymphoid neoplasms. Timely recognition of HPS is critical to ensure safe choice of donors and/or conditioning-regimen intensity for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and to enable direction of appropriate genomics-driven personalized therapies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of HPS and serve as a useful reference for clinicians to recognize relevant signs and symptoms among patients to enable timely screening and referrals to pursue germline assessment. In addition, we also discuss our institutional approach toward identification of HPS and offer a stepwise diagnostic and management algorithm.",

Its encoded protein kinase ATM plays a fundamental role in DNA repair of double strand breaks (DSBs). Impaired function of this kinase leads to a multisystemic disorder including immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar degeneration, radiation sensitivity, dilated blood vessels, premature aging and a predisposition to cancer. Since allogenic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation improved disease outcome, gene therapy based on autologous HSCs is an alternative promising concept. However, due to the large cDNA of ATM (9.2 kb), efficient packaging of retroviral particles and sufficient transduction of HSCs remains challenging.We generated lentiviral, gammaretroviral and foamy viral vectors with a GFP.F2A.Atm fusion or a GFP transgene and systematically compared transduction efficiencies. Vector titers dropped with increasing transgene size, but despite their described limited packaging capacity, we were able to produce lentiviral and gammaretroviral particles. The reduction in titers could not be explained by impaired packaging of the viral genomes, but the main differences occurred after transduction. Finally, after transduction of Atm-deficient (ATM-KO) murine fibroblasts with the lentiviral vector expressing Atm, we could show the expression of ATM protein which phosphorylated its downstream substrates (pKap1 and p-p53).",

In the present study, we investigated 15 patients with A-T from 2 to 16 years. Our investigation included blood and CSF tests, clinical neurological examination, A-T score, and MRI findings. The albumin ratio (AR) was analyzed to determine the blood-brain-barrier function. In addition, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were measured by the multiplex cytometric bead array. We compared the results with those from an age-matched control group. Three of the A-T patients were analyzed separately (one after resection of a cerebral meningioma, one after radiation and chemotherapy due to leukemia, one after stem cell transplantation). Patient had significantly more moderate and severe side effects due to CSF puncture (vomiting, headache, need for anti-emetic drugs) compared with healthy controls. Total protein, albumin, and the AR increased with age indicating a disturbed blood barrier function in older children. There were no differences for cytokines in serum and CSF with the exception of IL-2, which was significantly higher in controls in serum. The AR is significantly altered in A-T patients, but low-grade inflammation is not detectable in serum and CSF.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Imbalance and instability in the structure of the DNA have become major characteristics of cancer. In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

                    "abstract": "Steroid hormone signaling induces vast gene expression programs which necessitate the local formation of transcription factories at regulatory regions and large-scale alterations of the genome architecture to allow communication among distantly related cis-acting regions. This involves major stress at the genomic DNA level. Transcriptionally active regions are generally instable and prone to breakage due to the torsional stress and local depletion of nucleosomes that make DNA more accessible to damaging agents. A dedicated DNA damage response (DDR) is therefore essential to maintain genome integrity at these exposed regions. The DDR is a complex network involving DNA damage sensor proteins, such as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, as central regulators. The tight interplay between the DDR and steroid hormone receptors has been unraveled recently. Several DNA repair factors interact with the androgen and estrogen receptors and support their transcriptional functions. Conversely, both receptors directly control the expression of agents involved in the DDR. Impaired DDR is also exploited by tumors to acquire advantageous mutations. Cancer cells often harbor germline or somatic alterations in DDR genes, and their association with disease outcome and treatment response led to intensive efforts towards identifying selective inhibitors targeting the major players in this process. The PARP-1 inhibitors are now approved for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer with specific genomic alterations. Additional DDR-targeting agents are being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or in combination with treatments eliciting DNA damage (e.g., radiation therapy, including targeted radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) or addressing targets involved in maintenance of genome integrity. Recent preclinical and clinical findings made in addressing DNA repair dysfunction in hormone-dependent and -independent prostate and breast tumors are presented. Importantly, the combination of anti-hormonal therapy with DDR inhibition or with radiation has the potential to enhance efficacy but still needs further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer, and is ranked the sixth most common neoplasm and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Photothermal therapy (PTT) for thermal ablation of local tumors has recently emerged as a therapeutic strategy. However, the relatively high temperature of over 50  C may lead to unexpected heat-related damage to tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Herein, we designed and synthesized ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor loaded hollow-structured CuS NPs with surface modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody (CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs are highly photo-stable, can release encapsulated drugs, and increase the temperature to an effective level in a near-infrared (NIR)-responsive manner. Moreover, CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs specifically target tumors and thereby significantly inhibit tumor growth on contribution to synergistic low-temperature PTT and chemotherapy. This system not only achieved low-temperature PTT but also resulted in reduced damage to normal tissues. Modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody enhanced target specificity and immune activation. The combination of PTT and ATM inhibitor showed synergistic effects and significantly attenuated the growth of the HCC via down regulation of heat shock protein (HSP). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs are a highly promising platform for targeted tumor ablation via hyperthermia-mediated tumor death with minimal damage to normal tissues at a low temperature. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We constructed ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor-loaded hollow-structured CuS NPs with surface modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody (CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs not only achieved low-temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) but also resulted in reduced damage to normal tissues and sufficient biocompatibility. The modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody enhanced targeted specificity, cell endocytosis, and immune activation. In addition, the combination of PTT and ATM inhibitor synergistically attenuated the growth of the HCC via downregulation of heat shock protein (HSP). This study provided proof-of-concept for the ATM inhibitor that mediated low-temperature PTT with a potential for future clinical applications.",

                    "abstract": "Although current cancer immunotherapies that target PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint to reinvigorate exhausted T cells have achieved impressive clinical outcomes, only a small proportion of patients respond. New therapeutic targets are therefore needed to be identified to further unleash the anti-tumor potential of T cells and benefit more patients. Galectin-9 (Gal-9), initially identified as a ligand for TIM-3 to induce T cell death, acts as an immunosuppressive regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME) but its potential as a therapeutic target remains largely elusive. Here we show that antibody neutralization of Gal-9, in combination with inhibition of Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a kinase essential for DNA damage response (DDR), is a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy. Genetic depletion of ATM in tumors markedly potentiated anti-Gal-9 therapy in a syngeneic mouse model. Mechanistically, ATM inhibition greatly upregulated Gal-9 expression and secretion in a variety of human and murine tumor cells via the cGAS-STING-interferon beta (IFNbeta) innate immune pathway. Combination of Gal-9 inhibition with AZD1390, a selective ATM inhibitor currently evaluated in clinical trials, significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in multiple syngeneic mouse models, including the poorly-immunogenic LLC lung tumors that do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, concomitant with increased T cell infiltration. These results reveal Gal-9 induction via STING/IFNbeta signaling as an important mechanism mediating tumor immune escape that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapies, and unveil a novel anti-Gal-9-based combination strategy for cancer immunotherapies in a wide variety of malignancies, including those resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.",

                    "abstract": "Astaxanthin (AST) is a naturally occurring xanthophyll carotenoid having the potential to be used as an anticancer agent; however, the human body has a low bioavailability of AST due to its poor solubility in the water phase. Therefore, we applied D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as an emulsifier and natural edible peanut oil to form a steady oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsion loaded with AST (denoted as TAP-nanoemulsion). TAP-nanoemulsions were stable without the droplet coalescence against thermal treatments (30-90 C), pH value changes (over a range of 2.0-8.0), and ionic strength adjustments (at NaCl concentrations of 100-500 mM) measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). AST within TAP-nanoemulsion was released up to 80% in a simulated intestinal enzymatic fluid in vitro, and the overall recovery rate was fairly consistent in the Caco-2 cellular model. In order to further evaluate in vivo melanoma inhibitory experiments, we injected the fluorescent-stained B16F10 cells into female C57BL/6 mouse tail veins and treated TAP-nanoemulsion in an oral gavage. qRT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that TAP-nanoemulsion triggered effectively the apoptosis pathway, including enhancements of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), and p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) and decreases of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2); cyclins D, D1, and E; mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK); extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK); nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB); and matrix metallopeptidase-1 and metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-1 and MMP-9) in both gene and protein expressions. In conclusion, this study suggests that TAP-nanoemulsion with the oral treatment has a positive chemotherapy effect in melanoma with lung metastases in vivo. As far as we know, this is the first time to demonstrate that an antioxidant in nanoparticle administration cures lung metastatic melanoma.",

                    "abstract": "The ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related-checkpoint kinase 1 (ATR-CHK1) pathway is involved in DNA damage responses in many cancer cells. ATR inhibitors have been used in clinical trials in combination with radiation or chemotherapeutics; however, their effects against bladder cancer remain unclear. Here, the efficacy of combining gemcitabine with the novel ATR inhibitor AZD6738 was investigated in vitro in three bladder cancer cell lines (J82, T24, and UM-UC-3 cells). The effects of gemcitabine and AZD6738 on cell viability, clonogenicity, cell cycle, and apoptosis were examined. The combined use of gemcitabine and AZD6738 inhibited the viability and colony formation of bladder cancer cells compared to either treatment alone. Gemcitabine (5 nM) and AZD6738 (1 muM) inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell accumulation in the S phase. Moreover, combined treatment enhanced cleaved poly[ADP-ribose]-polymerase expression alongside the number of annexin V-positive cells, indicating apoptosis induction. Mechanistic investigations showed that AZD6738 treatment inhibited the repair of gemcitabine-induced double-strand breaks by interfering with CHK1. Combining AZD6738 with gemcitabine could therefore be useful for bladder cancer therapy.",

The potential synergy between these two drugs was assessed using the CompuSyn software, while flow cytometry was employed to evaluate cellular apoptosis. In addition, western blotting was utilized to measure p-ATM, p-AMPK, p-mTOR, and p-p70s6k expression, while mitochondrial functionality was monitored via morphological analyses, JC-1 staining, and measurements of ATP levels. Phenformin and Ku synergistically impacted the proliferation, migration, and apoptotic death of liver cancer cells.

We assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of berzosertib plus cisplatin. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced solid tumours refractory or resistant to standard of care therapies received ascending doses of cisplatin (day 1) and berzosertib (days 2 and 9) every 3 weeks (Q3W). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received berzosertib (90-210 mg/m2) and cisplatin (40-75 mg/m2) across seven dose levels. The most common grade >=3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (20.0%) and anaemia (16.7%). There were two dose-limiting toxicities: a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction and a grade 3 increase in alanine aminotransferase. Berzosertib 140 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) Q3W was determined as the recommended Phase 2 dose. Cisplatin had no apparent effect on berzosertib pharmacokinetics. Of the 31 patients, four achieved a partial response (two confirmed and two unconfirmed) despite having previously experienced disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus cisplatin is well tolerated and shows preliminary clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumours, warranting further evaluation in a Phase 2 setting.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study reports the safety, tolerability, MTD, recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of ceralasertib combined with carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. It also examined exploratory predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 36) received a fixed dose of carboplatin (AUC5) with escalating doses of ceralasertib (20 mg twice daily to 60 mg once daily) in 21-day cycles. Sequential and concurrent combination dosing schedules were assessed. RESULTS: Two ceralasertib MTD dose schedules, 20 mg twice daily on days 4-13 and 40 mg once daily on days 1-2, were tolerated with carboplatin AUC5; the latter was declared the RP2D. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade >=3) were anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and neutropenia (25%). Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2; including one grade 4 platelet count decreased) and a combination of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 3 patients. Ceralasertib was quickly absorbed (tmax ~1 hour), with a terminal plasma half-life of 8-11 hours. Upregulation of pRAD50, indicative of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, was observed in tumor biopsies during ceralasertib treatment. Two patients with absent or low ATM or SLFN11 protein expression achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial responses. Eighteen of 34 (53%) response-evaluable patients had RECIST v1.1 stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D for ceralasertib plus carboplatin was established as ceralasertib 40 mg once daily on days 1-2 administered with carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks, with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies confirming pharmacodynamic modulation and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity observed.",

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a core component of the DNA repair system. Although the ATM gene has a significant mutation rate in many human cancers, including colorectal, prostate, lung, and breast, it remains understudied compared with other DDR-involved molecules such as PARP and ATR. Here, we found that either gene knockout or drug intervention, ATM inhibition activated the cGAS/STING pathway and augmented MHC class I in CRC cells, and these effects could be amplified by radiation. Furthermore, we found that MHC class I upregulation induced by ATM inhibition is dependent on the activation of the NFkappaB/IRF1/NLRC5 pathway and independent of STING. Animal experiments have shown increasing infiltration and cytotoxic function of T cells and better survival in ATM-deficient tumors. This work indicated that ATM nonsense mutation predicted the clinical benefits of radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade for patients with CRC. It also provides a molecular mechanism rationale for ATM-targeted agents for patients with CRC.",

                    "abstract": "Although current cancer immunotherapies that target PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint to reinvigorate exhausted T cells have achieved impressive clinical outcomes, only a small proportion of patients respond. New therapeutic targets are therefore needed to be identified to further unleash the anti-tumor potential of T cells and benefit more patients. Galectin-9 (Gal-9), initially identified as a ligand for TIM-3 to induce T cell death, acts as an immunosuppressive regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME) but its potential as a therapeutic target remains largely elusive. Here we show that antibody neutralization of Gal-9, in combination with inhibition of Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a kinase essential for DNA damage response (DDR), is a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy. Genetic depletion of ATM in tumors markedly potentiated anti-Gal-9 therapy in a syngeneic mouse model. Mechanistically, ATM inhibition greatly upregulated Gal-9 expression and secretion in a variety of human and murine tumor cells via the cGAS-STING-interferon beta (IFNbeta) innate immune pathway. Combination of Gal-9 inhibition with AZD1390, a selective ATM inhibitor currently evaluated in clinical trials, significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in multiple syngeneic mouse models, including the poorly-immunogenic LLC lung tumors that do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, concomitant with increased T cell infiltration. These results reveal Gal-9 induction via STING/IFNbeta signaling as an important mechanism mediating tumor immune escape that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapies, and unveil a novel anti-Gal-9-based combination strategy for cancer immunotherapies in a wide variety of malignancies, including those resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.",

Therefore, understanding the elevated risk for normal tissue toxicities is critical for radiosensitizer development. This study focused on modeling the relationship between acute mucosal toxicity, radiation dose, fractionation schedule, and radiosensitizer exposure. The ATM inhibitor WSD0628 was combined with single or fractionated doses of radiation delivered to the oral cavity or esophagus of FVB mice. The potentiation by WSD0628 was quantified by a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER), which describes the changes in radiation tolerance for radiation combined with WSD0628 relative to radiation-only regimens. WSD0628 profoundly enhanced radiation-induced acute oral and esophageal toxicities. For oral mucosal toxicity, the enhancement by WSD0628 with 3 fractions of radiation resulted in an SER ranging from 1.3 (0.25 mg/kg) to 3.1 (7.5 mg/kg). For the 7.5 mg/kg combination, the SER increased with increasing number of fractions from 2.2 (1 fraction) to 4.3 (7 fractions) for oral toxicity and from 2.2 (1 fraction) to 3.6 (3 fractions) for esophageal toxicity, which reflects a loss of the normal tissue sparing benefit of fractionated radiation. These findings were used to develop a modified biologically effective dose model to determine alternative radiation schedules with or without WSD0628 that result in similar levels of toxicity. Successful radiosensitizer dose-escalation to maximally effective therapeutic dose will require careful deliberation of tumor site and reduction of radiation dose-volume limits for organs at risk.",

Targeted therapies modulating DNA damage response (DDR) and more specific cell cycle checkpoints can improve the radiotherapeutic response. Here, we assessed the influence of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibition with the ATR inhibitor AZD6738 on RT response in both human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC. We found that ATR inhibition enhanced RT response in HPV-negative and HPV-positive cell lines independent of HPV status. The radiosensitizing effect of AZD6738 was correlated with checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1)-mediated abrogation of G2/M-arrest. This resulted in the inhibition of RT-induced DNA repair and in an increase in the percentage of micronucleated cells. We validated the enhanced RT response in HPV-negative and HPV-positive xenograft models. These data demonstrate the potential use of ATR inhibition in combination with RT as a treatment option for both HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC patients.",

ATR inhibitor was administered combined with ablative radiotherapy to assess its radiosensitizing effect on lung cancer cells. Treatment response and survival were evaluated in vivo using A549 xenograft flank tumor and synchronous LLC lung and flank tumor mouse models. Mice received ablative radiotherapy (12 Gy/d for 2 d), ATR inhibitor, and ICI. The tumor microenvironment was assessed in irradiated flank and non-irradiated lung tumors.

Combined ATR inhibition and ablative radiotherapy inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in mice. Adding ICI therapy further enhanced local antitumor effects, reducing the metastatic lung tumor burden and remodeling the tumor microenvironment through immunogenic cell death induction and enhanced immune cell infiltration. Triple therapy increased immune cell infiltration in distant non-irradiated lung tumors and stimulated the generation of protective T-cell immunity in splenocytes.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) demonstrates durable clinical benefits in a minority of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We aimed to identify the molecular features that determine the response and develop approaches to enhance the response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the effects of SET domain-containing protein 2 (SEDT2) loss on the DNA damage response pathway, the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the tumor immune microenvironment, and the response to Ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR) and checkpoint inhibition in RCC. RESULTS: ATR inhibition activated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, resulting in the concurrent expression of inflammatory cytokines and immune checkpoints. Among the common RCC genotypes, SETD2 loss is associated with preferential ATR activation and sensitizes cells to ATR inhibition. SETD2 knockdown promoted the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway in response to ATR inhibition. Treatment with the ATR inhibitor VE822 concurrently upregulated immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression in Setd2 knockdown Renca tumors, providing a rationale for ATR inhibition plus ICB combination therapy. Setd2 deficient Renca tumors demonstrated greater vulnerability to ICB monotherapy or combination therapy with VE822 than Setd2 proficient tumors. Moreover, SETD2 mutations were associated with a higher response rate and prolonged overall survival in ICB-treated RCC patients but not in non-ICB-treated RCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: SETD2 loss and ATR inhibition synergize to promote cGAS signaling and enhance immune cell infiltration, providing a mechanistic rationale for the combination of ATR and checkpoint inhibition in RCC patients with SETD2 mutations.",

To overcome such resistance, we tested the combination of FOLFIRINOX (DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy drugs) with VE-822 (an ataxia-telangiectasia and RAD3-related inhibitor that targets DNA damage repair). METHODS: PDAC spheroid models and organoids were used to assess the combination effects. Tumour growth and the immune and fibrotic microenvironment were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, single-cell analysis and spatial proteomics in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and orthotopic immunocompetent KPC mouse models. RESULTS: The FOLFIRINOX and VE-822 combination had a strong synergistic effect in several PDAC cell lines, whatever their BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM mutation status and resistance to standard chemotherapy agents. This was associated with high DNA damage and inhibition of DNA repair signalling pathways, leading to increased apoptosis. In immunocompetent and PDX mouse models of PDAC, the combination inhibited tumour growth more effectively than FOLFIRINOX alone. This was associated with tumour microenvironment remodelling, particularly decreased proportion of fibroblast activated protein-positive CAFs and increased anti-tumorigenic immune cell infiltration and interaction. CONCLUSION: The FOLFIRINOX and VE-822 combination is a promising strategy to improve FOLFIRINOX efficacy and overcome drug resistance in PDAC.",

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an intractable disease with rapid progression and high mortality, presenting a persistent obstacle impeding clinical management. Although recent advancements in immunotherapy have enhanced the response rates of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of acquired resistance invariably leads to recurrence and metastasis. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to explore novel therapeutic targets and optimize existing treatment strategies. This article comprehensively reviews the currently available therapeutic modalities for SCLC. It delves into the immunologic prognostic implications by analyzing selected immune-related signatures. Moreover, it conducts an in-depth exploration of the molecular subtyping of SCLC and the associated molecular pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, the focus is on clinical interventions targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), elucidating its resistance mechanisms and demonstrating its notable antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, the study examines the mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), covering resistance issues and strategies for optimizing resistance management, with particular emphasis being placed on analyzing the prospects and clinical value of CAR T therapy in the context of SCLC. Moreover, the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3/checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors is discussed and underscores the advantages of combining these inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to combat chemoresistance and enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapies. Overall, this study investigates emerging strategies for targeted therapies and optimized combination regimens to overcome resistance in SCLC and highlights future strategies for new therapeutic technologies for SCLC.",

It demands specialized care tailored to the individual patient's needs. Besides the classical ataxia-telangiectasia (classical A-T) phenotype, a variant phenotype (variant A-T) exists with partly overlapping but some distinctive disease characteristics. Here we present a case series of 6 patients with classical A-T and variant A-T, which illustrates the phenotypic variability of A-T that can present in childhood with prominent extrapyramidal features, with or without cerebellar ataxia. We report the clinical data, together with a detailed genotype description, immunological analyses, and related expression of the ATM protein. We show that the presence of some residual ATM kinase activity leads to the clinical phenotype variant A-T that differs from the classical A-T. Our data illustrate that the diagnosis of the variant form of A-T can be delayed and difficult, while early recognition of the variant form as well as the classical A-T is a prerequisite for providing a correct prognosis and appropriate rehabilitation and support, including the avoidance of diagnostic X-ray procedures, given the increased risk of malignancies and the higher risk for side effects of subsequent cancer treatment.",

To address MHC-I downregulation, we conducted a high-throughput flow cytometry screen, identifying bleomycin (BLM) as a potent inducer of cell surface MHC-I expression. BLM-induced MHC-I augmentation renders tumor cells more susceptible to T cells in co-culture assays and enhances anti-tumor responses in an adoptive cellular transfer mouse model. Mechanistically, BLM remodels the tumor immune microenvironment, inducing MHC-I expression in an ATM/ATR-NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Furthermore, BLM improves T-cell-dependent immunotherapeutic approaches, including bispecific antibodies therapy, immune checkpoint therapy (ICT), and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) therapy. Importantly, low-dose BLM treatment in mouse models amplified the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy without detectable pulmonary toxicity. In summary, our findings repurpose BLM as a potential inducer of MHC-I, enhancing its expression to improve the efficacy of T-cell-based immunotherapy.",

                    "abstract": "WEE1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell cycle G2/M checkpoints and DNA damage response (DDR). Inhibition of WEE1 can increase the instability of the genome and have anti-tumor effects in some solid tumors. However, it has certain limitations for multiple cancer cells from different lineages. Therefore, we consider the use of synthetic lethal interactions to enhance the therapeutic effect. Our experiments proved that WEE1 inhibitor (WEE1i) can activate the ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) pathway and that blockage of ATR dramatically sensitized the WEE1i-induced cell death. The tumor-selective synthetic lethality between bioavailable WEE1 and ATR inhibitors led to tumor remission in vivo. Mechanistically, the combination promoted the accumulation of cytosolic double-strand DNA, which subsequently activated the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway and induced the production of type I interferon and CD8+ T cells, thereby inducing anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, our study found that immune checkpoint programmed death-ligand 1 is upregulated by the combination therapy, and blocking PD-L1 further enhances the effect of the combination therapy. In summary, as an immunomodulator, the combination of WEE1i with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) and immune checkpoint blockers provides a potential new approach for cancer treatment.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy (RT) against head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) may lead to severe toxicity in 30-40% of patients. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, based on dosimetric data refined the normal tissue dose/volume tolerance guidelines. In parallel, the radiation-induced nucleoshuttling (RIANS) of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein (pATM) is a predictive approach of individual intrinsic radiosensitivity. Here, we combined NTCP with RADIODTECT , a blood assay derived from the RIANS model, to predict RT toxicity in HNSCC patients. METHODS: RADIODTECT  cutoff values (i.e. 57.8 ng/mL for grade>=2 toxicity and 46 ng/mL for grade>=3 toxicity) have been previously assessed. Validation was performed on a prospective cohort of 36 HNSCC patients treated with postoperative RT. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale and two criteria were considered: grade>=2 oral mucositis (OM2), grade>=3 mucositis (OM3) and grade>=2 dysphagia (DY2), grade>=3 dysphagia (DY3). pATM quantification was assessed in lymphocytes of HNSCC patients. The discrimination power of the pATM assay was evaluated through the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC). Two previously described NTCP models were considered, including the dose to the oral cavity and the mean dose to the parotid glands (OM2 and OM3) and the dose to the oral cavity, to the larynx and the volume of pharyngeal constrictor muscles (DY2 and DY3). RESULTS: Combining NTCP models with RADIODTECT  blood test improved the AUC-ROC. Considering the prediction of mucositis, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.80 was for OM2, and AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.78 for OM3. Considering the prediction of acute dysphagia, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.71 for DY2 and for DY3. CONCLUSIONS: Combining NTCP models with a radiosensitivity biomarker might significantly improve the prediction of toxicities for HNSCC patients.",

The neurological decline may be caused by multiple factors of which ongoing inflammation and oxidative stress may play a dominant role. The objective of the present investigation was to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins and possible low-grade inflammation and its relation to age and neurological deterioration. In the present study, we investigated 15 patients with A-T from 2 to 16 years. Our investigation included blood and CSF tests, clinical neurological examination, A-T score, and MRI findings. The albumin ratio (AR) was analyzed to determine the blood-brain-barrier function. In addition, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were measured by the multiplex cytometric bead array. We compared the results with those from an age-matched control group. Three of the A-T patients were analyzed separately (one after resection of a cerebral meningioma, one after radiation and chemotherapy due to leukemia, one after stem cell transplantation). Patient had significantly more moderate and severe side effects due to CSF puncture (vomiting, headache, need for anti-emetic drugs) compared with healthy controls. Total protein, albumin, and the AR increased with age indicating a disturbed blood barrier function in older children. There were no differences for cytokines in serum and CSF with the exception of IL-2, which was significantly higher in controls in serum. The AR is significantly altered in A-T patients, but low-grade inflammation is not detectable in serum and CSF.",

Moreover, it conducts an in-depth exploration of the molecular subtyping of SCLC and the associated molecular pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, the focus is on clinical interventions targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), elucidating its resistance mechanisms and demonstrating its notable antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, the study examines the mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), covering resistance issues and strategies for optimizing resistance management, with particular emphasis being placed on analyzing the prospects and clinical value of CAR T therapy in the context of SCLC. Moreover, the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3/checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors is discussed and underscores the advantages of combining these inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to combat chemoresistance and enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapies. Overall, this study investigates emerging strategies for targeted therapies and optimized combination regimens to overcome resistance in SCLC and highlights future strategies for new therapeutic technologies for SCLC.",

This trial assessed the safety, preliminary efficacy, and tolerance of berzosertib in oesophageal cancer (A1 cohort) with RT and advanced solid tumours (A2 cohort) with cisplatin and capecitabine. METHODS: Single-arm, open-label dose-escalation (Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method) trial with 16 patients in A1 and 18 in A2. A1 tested six dose levels of berzosertib with RT (35 Gy over 15 fractions in 3 weeks). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in A1. Eight grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in five patients, with rash being the most common. The highest dose (240 mg/m2) was determined as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for A1. Seven DLTs in two patients in A2. The RP2D of berzosertib was 140 mg/m2 once weekly. The most common grade >=3 treatment-related AEs were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib combined with RT is feasible and well tolerated in oesophageal cancer patients at high palliative doses. Berzosertib with cisplatin and capecitabine was well tolerated in advanced cancer. Further investigation is warranted in a phase 2 setting.

Germline ATM-deficiencies underlie ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), a disease manifested by radio-sensitivity, immunodeficiency and predisposition to lymphoid malignancies. A-T patients diagnosed with malignancies have poor tolerance to chemotherapy or radiation. We investigated chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells using primary T-cells from patients with A-T (ATM-/-), heterozygote donors (ATM+/-) and healthy donors. ATM-/- T-cells proliferate and can be successfully transduced with CARs, though functional impairment of ATM-/- CAR-T cells was observed. Retroviral transduction of the CAR in ATM-/- T-cells resulted in high rates of chromosomal lesions at CAR insertion sites, as confirmed by next-generation long-read sequencing. This work suggests that ATM is essential to preserve genome integrity of CAR-T cells during retroviral manufacturing, and its lack poses a risk of chromosomal translocations and potential leukemogenicity.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking. Observations: This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.",

DUETTE (NCT04239014) will evaluate the combination of ceralasertib (a potent, selective inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) + olaparib, or olaparib monotherapy, compared with placebo, in this patient population of unmet need. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of ceralasertib + olaparib combination, and olaparib monotherapy, compared with placebo, as second maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: This study will test the hypothesis that ceralasertib + olaparib, or olaparib monotherapy, is tolerable, and effective at prolonging progression-free survival compared with placebo. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase II, multicenter study where patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either (Arm 1) ceralasertib + olaparib, (Arm 2) olaparib monotherapy, or (Arm 3) placebo. The olaparib and placebo arms will be double-blinded, whereas the ceralasertib + olaparib arm will be open label. Patients will be stratified according to BRCA status, and response to platinum-based chemotherapy. MAJOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible patients will have histologically diagnosed high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer, with platinum-sensitive relapse on, or after, completion of at least 6 months of any prior PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy (a minimum of 12 months is required if the patient received PARP inhibitor maintenance following first-line chemotherapy). If the prior PARP inhibitor used was olaparib then patients must have received treatment without significant toxicity or the need for a permanent dose reduction. Disease relapse in the second-line or third-line setting is allowed. Patients who have received secondary debulking surgery are potentially eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoint is progression-free survival determined by blinded independent central review according to RECIST 1.1, with sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival using investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The treatment of advanced metastatic CRC relies on classical chemotherapy combinations (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin or irinotecan). However, their use is limited by the emergence of resistance mechanisms, including to oxaliplatin. In this context, we recently showed that the combination of oxaliplatin and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein inhibition (VE-822) is synergistic and may have a potential therapeutic effect in metastatic CRC management. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the role of the VE-822+oxaliplatin (Vox) combination on the immune response and its potential synergy with an anti-programmed-cell Death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody. We used cell lines and organoids from metastatic CRC to investigate in vitro Vox efficacy and orthotopic syngeneic mouse models of metastatic CRC to assess the efficacy of Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody and identify the involved immune cells. RESULTS: The Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination completely cured tumor-bearing mice and protected them from a rechallenge. Vox was associated with a reduction of tumor-infiltrated neutrophils, CD206+ macrophages and regulatory T cells. Vox also induced a deep depletion of blood neutrophils. The increased bone marrow granulopoiesis failed to compensate for the Vox-mediated mature neutrophil depletion. Neutrophil depletion using a mouse recombinant anti-Ly6G antibody partially mimicked the Vox effect on the tumor microenvironment, but to a lower extent compared with the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination. Vox, but not neutrophil depletion, led to the emergence of an Ly6C+ PD-1+ CD8+ T-cell population in the blood and spleen of tumor-harboring mice. These cells were proliferating, and expressed IFN-gamma, CD62L, CXCR3 and Eomes. Moreover, the proportion of tumor antigen-specific T cells and of CD122+ BCL6+ T cells, which shared phenotypic characteristics with stem-like CD8+ T cells, was increased in treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our work strongly suggests that the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination might significantly improve survival in patients with metastatic and treatment-refractory CRC by acting both on cancer cells and CD8+ T cells.",

The chromosomalin stability in A-T increases the toxicity to radio-chemotherapeutic agents, creating the treatment modification challenges and the deviation from the optimal management protocols. In this case report, we present a 14-month-old boy diagnosed as T cell -ALL. Based on his early presentation, family history of childhood lymphoma, and high AFP, inherited predisposition was suspected, and genetic testing confirms A-T. This report represents the crucial part of clinical suspicion of A-T in similar cases as well as highlighting the importance of an early A-T diagnosis that prevents toxic death due to the extensive regimen of radio- chemotherapeutic agents. The report summarizes the toxicity and modification challenges during management with literature review for the chemotherapy modification experience in such cases.",

Although deficient DNA double-strand break repair is considered the main basis for the reactions, pretreatment identification of high-risk patients has been challenging. METHODS: To retrospectively determine the etiology of severe local reaction to RT in a 39-year-old woman with BC, we performed next-generation sequencing followed by further clinical and functional studies. RESULTS: We found a -4 intronic variant (c.2251-4A>G) in trans with a synonymous (c.3576G>A) variant affecting the ATM DNA-repair gene (NG_009830.1, NM_000051.3) which is linked to autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We verified abnormal transcripts resulting from both variants, next to a minor wild-type transcript leading to a residual ATM kinase activity and genomic instability. Follow-up examination of the patient revealed no classic sign of A-T but previously unnoticed head dystonia and mild dysarthria, a family history of BC and late-onset ataxia segregating with the variants. Additionally, her serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated similar to A-T patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the variable presentations of A-T and devastating impact of severe reactions to RT, we suggest a routine measurement of AFP in RT-candidate BC patients followed by next-generation sequencing with special attention to non-canonical splice site and synonymous variants in ATM.",

The neurological decline may be caused by multiple factors of which ongoing inflammation and oxidative stress may play a dominant role. The objective of the present investigation was to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins and possible low-grade inflammation and its relation to age and neurological deterioration. In the present study, we investigated 15 patients with A-T from 2 to 16 years. Our investigation included blood and CSF tests, clinical neurological examination, A-T score, and MRI findings. The albumin ratio (AR) was analyzed to determine the blood-brain-barrier function. In addition, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were measured by the multiplex cytometric bead array. We compared the results with those from an age-matched control group. Three of the A-T patients were analyzed separately (one after resection of a cerebral meningioma, one after radiation and chemotherapy due to leukemia, one after stem cell transplantation). Patient had significantly more moderate and severe side effects due to CSF puncture (vomiting, headache, need for anti-emetic drugs) compared with healthy controls. Total protein, albumin, and the AR increased with age indicating a disturbed blood barrier function in older children. There were no differences for cytokines in serum and CSF with the exception of IL-2, which was significantly higher in controls in serum. The AR is significantly altered in A-T patients, but low-grade inflammation is not detectable in serum and CSF.",

                    "abstract": "Steroid hormone signaling induces vast gene expression programs which necessitate the local formation of transcription factories at regulatory regions and large-scale alterations of the genome architecture to allow communication among distantly related cis-acting regions. This involves major stress at the genomic DNA level. Transcriptionally active regions are generally instable and prone to breakage due to the torsional stress and local depletion of nucleosomes that make DNA more accessible to damaging agents. A dedicated DNA damage response (DDR) is therefore essential to maintain genome integrity at these exposed regions. The DDR is a complex network involving DNA damage sensor proteins, such as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, as central regulators. The tight interplay between the DDR and steroid hormone receptors has been unraveled recently. Several DNA repair factors interact with the androgen and estrogen receptors and support their transcriptional functions. Conversely, both receptors directly control the expression of agents involved in the DDR. Impaired DDR is also exploited by tumors to acquire advantageous mutations. Cancer cells often harbor germline or somatic alterations in DDR genes, and their association with disease outcome and treatment response led to intensive efforts towards identifying selective inhibitors targeting the major players in this process. The PARP-1 inhibitors are now approved for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer with specific genomic alterations. Additional DDR-targeting agents are being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or in combination with treatments eliciting DNA damage (e.g., radiation therapy, including targeted radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) or addressing targets involved in maintenance of genome integrity. Recent preclinical and clinical findings made in addressing DNA repair dysfunction in hormone-dependent and -independent prostate and breast tumors are presented. Importantly, the combination of anti-hormonal therapy with DDR inhibition or with radiation has the potential to enhance efficacy but still needs further investigation.",

CASE REPORT: We report three cases of MSS CRC with durable clinical benefit from immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. Two cases bear a POLE P286R mutation, which has been associated with lack of immunotherapy response in MSS CRC. Two cases bear alterations in Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) which may contribute to observed responses, including interaction with a co-administered intratumoral stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway agonist in one patient.

Treatment of malignancies in BS patients with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is believed to be associated with increased toxicity, but clinical and laboratory data are lacking. We collected clinical data of two Dutch BS patients with solid tumors. Both were treated with radiotherapy before the diagnosis BS was made and tolerated this treatment well. In addition, we collected fibroblasts from BS patients to perform in vitro clonogenic survival assays to determine radiosensitivity. BS fibroblasts showed less radiosensitivity than the severely radiosensitive Artemis fibroblasts. Moreover, studies of double strand break kinetics by counting 53BP1 foci after irradiation showed similar patterns compared to healthy controls.

DUETTE (NCT04239014) will evaluate the combination of ceralasertib (a potent, selective inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) + olaparib, or olaparib monotherapy, compared with placebo, in this patient population of unmet need. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of ceralasertib + olaparib combination, and olaparib monotherapy, compared with placebo, as second maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: This study will test the hypothesis that ceralasertib + olaparib, or olaparib monotherapy, is tolerable, and effective at prolonging progression-free survival compared with placebo. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase II, multicenter study where patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either (Arm 1) ceralasertib + olaparib, (Arm 2) olaparib monotherapy, or (Arm 3) placebo. The olaparib and placebo arms will be double-blinded, whereas the ceralasertib + olaparib arm will be open label. Patients will be stratified according to BRCA status, and response to platinum-based chemotherapy. MAJOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible patients will have histologically diagnosed high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer, with platinum-sensitive relapse on, or after, completion of at least 6 months of any prior PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy (a minimum of 12 months is required if the patient received PARP inhibitor maintenance following first-line chemotherapy). If the prior PARP inhibitor used was olaparib then patients must have received treatment without significant toxicity or the need for a permanent dose reduction. Disease relapse in the second-line or third-line setting is allowed. Patients who have received secondary debulking surgery are potentially eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoint is progression-free survival determined by blinded independent central review according to RECIST 1.1, with sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival using investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1. SAMPLE SIZE: 192 patients. ESTIMATED DATES FOR COMPLETING ACCRUAL AND PRESENTING RESULTS: December 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04239014.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Berzosertib (formerly M6620) is the first-in-class inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, a key component of the DNA damage response, and being developed in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cancers. The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of berzosertib across multiple studies and parts, estimate inter-individual variability, and identify covariates that could explain such variability. METHODS: A population PK analysis was performed using the combined dataset from two phase I clinical studies (NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34) in patients with advanced cancers receiving an intravenous infusion of berzosertib alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The analysis included data from 240 patients across 11 dose levels (18-480 mg/m2). Plasma concentration data were modeled with a non-linear mixed-effect approach and clinical covariates were evaluated. RESULTS: PK data were best described by a two-compartment linear model. For a typical patient, the estimated clearance (CL) and intercompartmental CL were 65 L/h and 295 L/h, respectively, with central and peripheral volumes estimated to be 118 L and 1030 L, respectively. Several intrinsic factors were found to influence berzosertib PK, but none were considered clinically meaningful due to a very limited effect. Model simulations indicated that concentrations of berzosertib exceeded p-Chk1 (proximal pharmacodynamic biomarker) IC50 at recommended phase II doses in combination with carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a clinically significant PK interaction between berzosertib and evaluated chemo-combinations. The covariate analysis did not highlight any need for dosing adjustments in the population studied to date. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34.",

ATR inhibitors have been used in clinical trials in combination with radiation or chemotherapeutics; however, their effects against bladder cancer remain unclear. Here, the efficacy of combining gemcitabine with the novel ATR inhibitor AZD6738 was investigated in vitro in three bladder cancer cell lines (J82, T24, and UM-UC-3 cells). The effects of gemcitabine and AZD6738 on cell viability, clonogenicity, cell cycle, and apoptosis were examined. The combined use of gemcitabine and AZD6738 inhibited the viability and colony formation of bladder cancer cells compared to either treatment alone. Gemcitabine (5 nM) and AZD6738 (1 muM) inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell accumulation in the S phase. Moreover, combined treatment enhanced cleaved poly[ADP-ribose]-polymerase expression alongside the number of annexin V-positive cells, indicating apoptosis induction. Mechanistic investigations showed that AZD6738 treatment inhibited the repair of gemcitabine-induced double-strand breaks by interfering with CHK1. Combining AZD6738 with gemcitabine could therefore be useful for bladder cancer therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an intractable disease with rapid progression and high mortality, presenting a persistent obstacle impeding clinical management. Although recent advancements in immunotherapy have enhanced the response rates of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of acquired resistance invariably leads to recurrence and metastasis. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to explore novel therapeutic targets and optimize existing treatment strategies. This article comprehensively reviews the currently available therapeutic modalities for SCLC. It delves into the immunologic prognostic implications by analyzing selected immune-related signatures. Moreover, it conducts an in-depth exploration of the molecular subtyping of SCLC and the associated molecular pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, the focus is on clinical interventions targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), elucidating its resistance mechanisms and demonstrating its notable antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, the study examines the mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), covering resistance issues and strategies for optimizing resistance management, with particular emphasis being placed on analyzing the prospects and clinical value of CAR T therapy in the context of SCLC. Moreover, the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3/checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors is discussed and underscores the advantages of combining these inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to combat chemoresistance and enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapies. Overall, this study investigates emerging strategies for targeted therapies and optimized combination regimens to overcome resistance in SCLC and highlights future strategies for new therapeutic technologies for SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "Steroid hormone signaling induces vast gene expression programs which necessitate the local formation of transcription factories at regulatory regions and large-scale alterations of the genome architecture to allow communication among distantly related cis-acting regions. This involves major stress at the genomic DNA level. Transcriptionally active regions are generally instable and prone to breakage due to the torsional stress and local depletion of nucleosomes that make DNA more accessible to damaging agents. A dedicated DNA damage response (DDR) is therefore essential to maintain genome integrity at these exposed regions. The DDR is a complex network involving DNA damage sensor proteins, such as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, as central regulators. The tight interplay between the DDR and steroid hormone receptors has been unraveled recently. Several DNA repair factors interact with the androgen and estrogen receptors and support their transcriptional functions. Conversely, both receptors directly control the expression of agents involved in the DDR. Impaired DDR is also exploited by tumors to acquire advantageous mutations. Cancer cells often harbor germline or somatic alterations in DDR genes, and their association with disease outcome and treatment response led to intensive efforts towards identifying selective inhibitors targeting the major players in this process. The PARP-1 inhibitors are now approved for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer with specific genomic alterations. Additional DDR-targeting agents are being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or in combination with treatments eliciting DNA damage (e.g., radiation therapy, including targeted radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) or addressing targets involved in maintenance of genome integrity. Recent preclinical and clinical findings made in addressing DNA repair dysfunction in hormone-dependent and -independent prostate and breast tumors are presented. Importantly, the combination of anti-hormonal therapy with DDR inhibition or with radiation has the potential to enhance efficacy but still needs further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "WEE1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell cycle G2/M checkpoints and DNA damage response (DDR). Inhibition of WEE1 can increase the instability of the genome and have anti-tumor effects in some solid tumors. However, it has certain limitations for multiple cancer cells from different lineages. Therefore, we consider the use of synthetic lethal interactions to enhance the therapeutic effect. Our experiments proved that WEE1 inhibitor (WEE1i) can activate the ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) pathway and that blockage of ATR dramatically sensitized the WEE1i-induced cell death. The tumor-selective synthetic lethality between bioavailable WEE1 and ATR inhibitors led to tumor remission in vivo. Mechanistically, the combination promoted the accumulation of cytosolic double-strand DNA, which subsequently activated the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway and induced the production of type I interferon and CD8+ T cells, thereby inducing anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, our study found that immune checkpoint programmed death-ligand 1 is upregulated by the combination therapy, and blocking PD-L1 further enhances the effect of the combination therapy. In summary, as an immunomodulator, the combination of WEE1i with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) and immune checkpoint blockers provides a potential new approach for cancer treatment.",

Homologous recombination represents a precise, DNA-template-based mechanism available during the S and G2 cell cycle phase, whereas non-homologous end joining, which requires DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), allows for fast, cell cycle-independent but less accurate DNA repair. Here, we report the discovery of BAY-8400, a novel selective inhibitor of DNA-PK. Starting from a triazoloquinoxaline, which had been identified as a hit from a screen for ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors with inhibitory activity against ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK, lead optimization efforts focusing on potency and selectivity led to the discovery of BAY-8400.

Flow cytometry-based analyses of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated activation demonstrate rapid induction of MOMP by venetoclax and DNA damage signaling by inotuzumab ozogamicin, respectively. In primary ALL samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, venetoclax and inotuzumab ozogamicin cooperated and synergized in combination with dexamethasone in vitro in all tested samples of ALL. In murine PDX models, inotuzumab ozogamicin, but not venetoclax, induced complete remission in a dose-dependent manner but constantly failed to achieve relapse-free survival. In contrast, combination therapy with venetoclax, dexamethasone, and inotuzumab ozogamicin induced long-term leukemia-free survival and treatment-free survival in all 3 ALL-PDX models tested.

We aimed to identify the molecular features that determine the response and develop approaches to enhance the response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the effects of SET domain-containing protein 2 (SEDT2) loss on the DNA damage response pathway, the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the tumor immune microenvironment, and the response to Ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR) and checkpoint inhibition in RCC. RESULTS: ATR inhibition activated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, resulting in the concurrent expression of inflammatory cytokines and immune checkpoints. Among the common RCC genotypes, SETD2 loss is associated with preferential ATR activation and sensitizes cells to ATR inhibition. SETD2 knockdown promoted the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway in response to ATR inhibition. Treatment with the ATR inhibitor VE822 concurrently upregulated immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression in Setd2 knockdown Renca tumors, providing a rationale for ATR inhibition plus ICB combination therapy. Setd2 deficient Renca tumors demonstrated greater vulnerability to ICB monotherapy or combination therapy with VE822 than Setd2 proficient tumors. Moreover, SETD2 mutations were associated with a higher response rate and prolonged overall survival in ICB-treated RCC patients but not in non-ICB-treated RCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: SETD2 loss and ATR inhibition synergize to promote cGAS signaling and enhance immune cell infiltration, providing a mechanistic rationale for the combination of ATR and checkpoint inhibition in RCC patients with SETD2 mutations.",

In the chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer preclinical model, we investigated whether AZD6738 (an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor) could synergize with belotecan (a camptothecin analog and topoisomerase I inhibitor). In vitro, both chemotherapy-resistant and chemotherapy-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines showed synergistic anti-proliferative activity with a combination treatment of belotecan and AZD6738. The combination also demonstrated synergistic tumor inhibition in mice with a chemotherapy-resistant cell line xenograft. Mechanistically, belotecan, a DNA-damaging agent, increased phospho-ATR (pATR) and phospho-Chk1 (pChk1) in consecutive order, indicating the activation of the DNA repair system.

In the chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer preclinical model, we investigated whether AZD6738 (an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor) could synergize with belotecan (a camptothecin analog and topoisomerase I inhibitor). In vitro, both chemotherapy-resistant and chemotherapy-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines showed synergistic anti-proliferative activity with a combination treatment of belotecan and AZD6738. The combination also demonstrated synergistic tumor inhibition in mice with a chemotherapy-resistant cell line xenograft. Mechanistically, belotecan, a DNA-damaging agent, increased phospho-ATR (pATR) and phospho-Chk1 (pChk1) in consecutive order, indicating the activation of the DNA repair system. This consequently induced G2/M arrest in the cell cycle analysis. However, when AZD6738 was added to belotecan, pATR and pChk1 induced by belotecan alone were suppressed again.

To overcome such resistance, we tested the combination of FOLFIRINOX (DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy drugs) with VE-822 (an ataxia-telangiectasia and RAD3-related inhibitor that targets DNA damage repair). METHODS: PDAC spheroid models and organoids were used to assess the combination effects. Tumour growth and the immune and fibrotic microenvironment were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, single-cell analysis and spatial proteomics in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and orthotopic immunocompetent KPC mouse models. RESULTS: The FOLFIRINOX and VE-822 combination had a strong synergistic effect in several PDAC cell lines, whatever their BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM mutation status and resistance to standard chemotherapy agents. This was associated with high DNA damage and inhibition of DNA repair signalling pathways, leading to increased apoptosis. In immunocompetent and PDX mouse models of PDAC, the combination inhibited tumour growth more effectively than FOLFIRINOX alone. This was associated with tumour microenvironment remodelling, particularly decreased proportion of fibroblast activated protein-positive CAFs and increased anti-tumorigenic immune cell infiltration and interaction. CONCLUSION: The FOLFIRINOX and VE-822 combination is a promising strategy to improve FOLFIRINOX efficacy and overcome drug resistance in PDAC.",

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of ATM's structure, activation mechanisms, and various functions in cancer development, progression, and treatment. I discuss ATM's dual nature as both a tumor suppressor and potential promoter of cancer cell survival in certain contexts. The article explores the complex signaling pathways mediated by ATM, its interactions with other DNA repair mechanisms, and its influence on cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and metabolism. I examine the clinical implications of ATM alterations, including their impact on cancer predisposition, prognosis, and treatment response. The review highlights recent advances in ATM-targeted therapies, discussing ongoing clinical trials of ATM inhibitors and their potential in combination with other treatment modalities. I also address the challenges in developing effective biomarkers for ATM activity and patient selection strategies for personalized cancer therapy. Finally, I outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for refined biomarker development, optimized combination therapies, and strategies to overcome potential resistance mechanisms. This comprehensive overview underscores the critical importance of ATM in cancer biology and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target in precision oncology.",

We evaluate ZL-2201, an orally bioavailable, highly potent, and selective pharmacologic inhibitor of DNA-PK activity, for the treatment of human cancerous malignancies. ZL-2201 demonstrated greater selectivity for DNA-PK and effectively inhibited DNA-PK autophosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Initial data suggested a potential correlation between ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) deficiency and ZL-2201 sensitivity. More so, ZL-2201 showed strong synergy with topoisomerase II inhibitors independent of ATM status in vitro. In vivo oral administration of ZL-2201 demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activity in the NCI-H1703 xenograft model and significantly enhanced the activity of approved DNA-damaging agents in A549 and FaDu models. From a phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry screen, we identified and validated that ZL-2201 and PRKDC siRNA decreased Ser108 phosphorylation of MCM2, a key DNA replication factor. Collectively, we have characterized a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor with promising monotherapy and combinatory therapeutic potential with approved DNA-damaging agents. More importantly, we identified phospho-MCM2 (Ser108) as a potential proximal biomarker of DNA-PK inhibition that warrants further preclinical and clinical evaluation. Significance: ZL-2201, a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor, can target tumor models in combination with DNA DSB-inducing agents such as radiation or doxorubicin, with potential to improve recurrent therapies in the clinic.",

This trial assessed the safety, preliminary efficacy, and tolerance of berzosertib in oesophageal cancer (A1 cohort) with RT and advanced solid tumours (A2 cohort) with cisplatin and capecitabine. METHODS: Single-arm, open-label dose-escalation (Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method) trial with 16 patients in A1 and 18 in A2. A1 tested six dose levels of berzosertib with RT (35 Gy over 15 fractions in 3 weeks). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in A1. Eight grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in five patients, with rash being the most common. The highest dose (240 mg/m2) was determined as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for A1. Seven DLTs in two patients in A2. The RP2D of berzosertib was 140 mg/m2 once weekly. The most common grade >=3 treatment-related AEs were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib combined with RT is feasible and well tolerated in oesophageal cancer patients at high palliative doses. Berzosertib with cisplatin and capecitabine was well tolerated in advanced cancer. Further investigation is warranted in a phase 2 setting.

                    "abstract": "PARP inhibitor monotherapy (olaparib) was recently FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutant, homologous recombination (HR) repair-deficient pancreatic cancer. Most pancreatic cancers, however, are HR proficient and thus resistant to PARP inhibitor monotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that combined therapy with radiation and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (AZD6738) would extend the therapeutic indication of olaparib to HR-proficient pancreatic cancers. We show that olaparib combined with AZD6738 significantly reduced radiation survival relative to either agent alone, regardless of HR status. Whereas catalytic inhibition of PARP with low concentrations of olaparib radiosensitized HR-deficient models, maximal sensitization in HR-proficient models required concentrations of olaparib that induce formation of PARP1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated PARP1 deletion failed to recapitulate the effects of olaparib on radiosensitivity and negated the combinatorial efficacy of olaparib and AZD6738 on radiosensitization, suggesting that PARP1-DNA complexes, rather than PARP catalytic inhibition, were responsible for radiosensitization. Mechanistically, therapeutic concentrations of olaparib in combination with radiation and AZD6738 increased DNA double-strand breaks. DNA fiber combing revealed that high concentrations of olaparib did not stall replication forks but instead accelerated replication fork progression in association with an ATR-mediated replication stress response that was antagonized by AZD6738. Finally, in HR-proficient tumor xenografts, the combination of olaparib, radiation, and AZD6738 significantly delayed tumor growth compared with all other treatments. These findings suggest that PARP1-DNA complexes are required for the therapeutic activity of olaparib combined with radiation and ATR inhibitor in HR-proficient pancreatic cancer and support the clinical development of this combination for tumors intrinsically resistant to PARP inhibitors.",

It is urgent to develop novel chemotherapeutic strategies to improve patient survival. DNA damaging agents have been shown to sensitize cancer to genotoxic chemotherapies. We first found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG) can activate the NF-kB signalling pathway. Our results showed that NF-kB signalling was reduced when cells were treated with 6-TG/disulfiram (DSF)/Cu. DSF/Cu enhanced the 6-TG-mediated inhibition of proliferation. 6-TG/DSF/Cu inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell cycle arrest in the S phase and G2/M phase. Moreover, the combined effect of 6-TG and DSF/Cu induced apoptosis, and either agent alone was able to induce apoptosis. The accumulation of gammaH2A indicated that DSF/Cu increased the DNA damage induced by 6-TG. Combined treatment with 6-TG and DSF/Cu synergistically reduced the levels of both phosphorylated and total ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related kinase (ATR), suggesting that DSF/Cu promoted 6-TG-induced DNA damage by suppressing ATR protein kinases, therefore enhancing cell apoptosis.

In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein complex is an apical initiator of DNA damage response pathways. Several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) are in clinical development including berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970). Although clinical studies have examined plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans, little is known regarding dose/exposure relationships and tissue distribution. To understand these concepts, we extensively characterized the PK of berzosertib in mouse plasma and tissues. METHODS: A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method was utilized to quantitate berzosertib in plasma and tissues. Dose proportionality was assessed in female BALB/c mice following single IV doses (2, 6, 20 or 60 mg/kg). A more extensive PK study was conducted in tumor-bearing mice following a single IV dose of 20 mg/kg to evaluate distribution to tissues. PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA). A compartmental model was developed to describe the PK behavior of berzosertib. Plasma protein binding was determined in vitro. RESULTS: Increased doses of berzosertib were associated with less than proportional increases in early plasma concentrations and greater than proportional increase in tissue exposure, attributable to saturation of plasma protein binding. Berzosertib extensively distributed into bone marrow, tumor, thymus, and lymph nodes, however; brain and spinal cord exposure was less than plasma. CONCLUSION: The nonlinear PK of berzosertib displayed here can be attributed to saturation of plasma protein binding and occurred at concentrations close to those observed in clinical trials. Our results will help to understand preclinical pharmacodynamic and toxicity data and to inform optimal dosing and deployment of berzosertib.",

In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

METHODS: A literature search using PubMed identified articles assessing association(s) between the germline ATM variant status and the risk of toxicity after breast RT. An expert panel of breast radiation oncologists, genetic counselors, and basic scientists convened to review the association between ATM variants and radiation-induced toxicity or secondary malignancy risk and to determine any impact on breast RT recommendations. RESULTS: Carriers of pathogenic variants in ATM have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk for developing breast cancer. ATM variants do not consistently increase risks of toxicities after RT, except possibly among patients with the single nucleotide variant c5557G>A (rs1801516), in whom a small increased risk for the development of both acute and late radiation effects has been identified. In most breast cancer patients with ATM variants, the excess 5-year absolute risk of developing a secondary contralateral breast cancer (CBC) after radiation is extremely low. The exception is in women younger than 45 years old with deleterious rare ATM missense variants, who may be at higher risk for developing a radiation-induced CBC over time. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiation is safe for most breast cancer patients who harbor ATM variants. The possible exceptions are patients with the variant c5557G>A (rs1801516) and patients younger than 45 years old with certain rare deleterious ATM variants, who may be at higher risk for developing CBC. These latter patients should be counseled regarding this potential risk, and every effort should be made to minimize the contralateral breast dose.

The objective of the present investigation was to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins and possible low-grade inflammation and its relation to age and neurological deterioration. In the present study, we investigated 15 patients with A-T from 2 to 16 years. Our investigation included blood and CSF tests, clinical neurological examination, A-T score, and MRI findings. The albumin ratio (AR) was analyzed to determine the blood-brain-barrier function. In addition, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were measured by the multiplex cytometric bead array. We compared the results with those from an age-matched control group. Three of the A-T patients were analyzed separately (one after resection of a cerebral meningioma, one after radiation and chemotherapy due to leukemia, one after stem cell transplantation). Patient had significantly more moderate and severe side effects due to CSF puncture (vomiting, headache, need for anti-emetic drugs) compared with healthy controls. Total protein, albumin, and the AR increased with age indicating a disturbed blood barrier function in older children. There were no differences for cytokines in serum and CSF with the exception of IL-2, which was significantly higher in controls in serum. The AR is significantly altered in A-T patients, but low-grade inflammation is not detectable in serum and CSF.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study reports the safety, tolerability, MTD, recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of ceralasertib combined with carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. It also examined exploratory predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 36) received a fixed dose of carboplatin (AUC5) with escalating doses of ceralasertib (20 mg twice daily to 60 mg once daily) in 21-day cycles. Sequential and concurrent combination dosing schedules were assessed. RESULTS: Two ceralasertib MTD dose schedules, 20 mg twice daily on days 4-13 and 40 mg once daily on days 1-2, were tolerated with carboplatin AUC5; the latter was declared the RP2D. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade >=3) were anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and neutropenia (25%). Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2; including one grade 4 platelet count decreased) and a combination of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 3 patients. Ceralasertib was quickly absorbed (tmax ~1 hour), with a terminal plasma half-life of 8-11 hours. Upregulation of pRAD50, indicative of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, was observed in tumor biopsies during ceralasertib treatment. Two patients with absent or low ATM or SLFN11 protein expression achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial responses. Eighteen of 34 (53%) response-evaluable patients had RECIST v1.1 stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D for ceralasertib plus carboplatin was established as ceralasertib 40 mg once daily on days 1-2 administered with carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks, with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies confirming pharmacodynamic modulation and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity observed.",

One promising avenue is targeting the shelterin protein complex, a safeguard for telomeres crucial in preventing DNA damage. The role of shelterin in modulating ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases, key players in the DNA damage response (DDR), establishes its significance in cancer cells. Disrupting these defence mechanisms of shelterins, especially in cancer cells, renders telomeres vulnerable, potentially leading to genomic instability and hindering cancer cell survival. In this review, we outline recent approaches exploring shelterins as potential anticancer targets, highlighting the prospect of developing selective molecules to exploit telomere vulnerabilities toward new innovative cancer treatments.",

                    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is one of the most common countermeasures for treating a wide range of tumors. However, the radioresistance of cancer cells is still a major limitation for radiotherapy applications. Efforts are continuously ongoing to explore sensitizing targets and develop radiosensitizers for improving the outcomes of radiotherapy. DNA double-strand breaks are the most lethal lesions induced by ionizing radiation and can trigger a series of cellular DNA damage responses (DDRs), including those helping cells recover from radiation injuries, such as the activation of DNA damage sensing and early transduction pathways, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. Obviously, these protective DDRs confer tumor radioresistance. Targeting DDR signaling pathways has become an attractive strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance, and some important advances and breakthroughs have already been achieved in recent years. On the basis of comprehensively reviewing the DDR signal pathways, we provide an update on the novel and promising druggable targets emerging from DDR pathways that can be exploited for radiosensitization. We further discuss recent advances identified from preclinical studies, current clinical trials, and clinical application of chemical inhibitors targeting key DDR proteins, including DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit), ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related), the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex, the PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) family, MDC1, Wee1, LIG4 (ligase IV), CDK1, BRCA1 (BRCA1 C terminal), CHK1, and HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1). Challenges for ionizing radiation-induced signal transduction and targeted therapy are also discussed based on recent achievements in the biological field of radiotherapy.",

Therefore, understanding the elevated risk for normal tissue toxicities is critical for radiosensitizer development. This study focused on modeling the relationship between acute mucosal toxicity, radiation dose, fractionation schedule, and radiosensitizer exposure. The ATM inhibitor WSD0628 was combined with single or fractionated doses of radiation delivered to the oral cavity or esophagus of FVB mice. The potentiation by WSD0628 was quantified by a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER), which describes the changes in radiation tolerance for radiation combined with WSD0628 relative to radiation-only regimens. WSD0628 profoundly enhanced radiation-induced acute oral and esophageal toxicities. For oral mucosal toxicity, the enhancement by WSD0628 with 3 fractions of radiation resulted in an SER ranging from 1.3 (0.25 mg/kg) to 3.1 (7.5 mg/kg). For the 7.5 mg/kg combination, the SER increased with increasing number of fractions from 2.2 (1 fraction) to 4.3 (7 fractions) for oral toxicity and from 2.2 (1 fraction) to 3.6 (3 fractions) for esophageal toxicity, which reflects a loss of the normal tissue sparing benefit of fractionated radiation. These findings were used to develop a modified biologically effective dose model to determine alternative radiation schedules with or without WSD0628 that result in similar levels of toxicity. Successful radiosensitizer dose-escalation to maximally effective therapeutic dose will require careful deliberation of tumor site and reduction of radiation dose-volume limits for organs at risk.",

We developed a predictive taxonomy to assess the amenability of each individual to splice-switching ASO intervention; 9% and 6% of the individuals had variants that were 'probably' or 'possibly' amenable to ASO splice modulation, respectively. Most amenable variants were in deep intronic regions that are inaccessible to exon-targeted sequencing. We developed ASOs that successfully rescued mis-splicing and ATM cellular signalling in patient fibroblasts for two recurrent variants. In a pilot clinical study, one of these ASOs was used to treat a child who had been diagnosed with ataxia-telangiectasia soon after birth, and showed good tolerability without serious adverse events for three years. Our study provides a framework for the prospective identification of individuals with genetic diseases who might benefit from a therapeutic approach involving splice-switching ASOs.",

I examine the clinical implications of ATM alterations, including their impact on cancer predisposition, prognosis, and treatment response. The review highlights recent advances in ATM-targeted therapies, discussing ongoing clinical trials of ATM inhibitors and their potential in combination with other treatment modalities. I also address the challenges in developing effective biomarkers for ATM activity and patient selection strategies for personalized cancer therapy.

Based on his early presentation, family history of childhood lymphoma, and high AFP, inherited predisposition was suspected, and genetic testing confirms A-T. This report represents the crucial part of clinical suspicion of A-T in similar cases as well as highlighting the importance of an early A-T diagnosis that prevents toxic death due to the extensive regimen of radio- chemotherapeutic agents. The report summarizes the toxicity and modification challenges during management with literature review for the chemotherapy modification experience in such cases.",

AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the currently approved and most promising candidate pharmacotherapies in relation to the known disease mechanisms of the most prevalent autosomal recessive ataxias. Omaveloxolone is an Nrf2 activator that increases antioxidant defense and was recently approved for treatment of Friedreich ataxia. Its therapeutic effect is modest, and further research is needed to find synergistic treatments that would halt or reverse disease progression. Promising approaches include upregulation of frataxin expression by epigenetic mechanisms, direct protein replacement, and gene replacement therapy. For ataxia-telangiectasia, promising approaches include splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Rare recessive ataxias for which disease-modifying therapies exist are also reviewed, emphasizing recently approved therapies. Evidence supporting the use of riluzole and acetyl-leucine in recessive ataxias is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Advances in genetic therapies for other neurogenetic conditions have paved the way to implement feasible approaches with potential dramatic benefits. Particularly, as we develop effective treatments for these conditions, we may need to combine therapies, consider newborn testing for pre-symptomatic treatment, and optimize non-pharmacological approaches.",

                    "abstract": "Because of the lack of specific molecular targeted therapies, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has high tumour recurrence and metastasis rates. It is urgent to develop novel chemotherapeutic strategies to improve patient survival. DNA damaging agents have been shown to sensitize cancer to genotoxic chemotherapies. We first found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG) can activate the NF-kB signalling pathway. Our results showed that NF-kB signalling was reduced when cells were treated with 6-TG/disulfiram (DSF)/Cu. DSF/Cu enhanced the 6-TG-mediated inhibition of proliferation. 6-TG/DSF/Cu inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell cycle arrest in the S phase and G2/M phase. Moreover, the combined effect of 6-TG and DSF/Cu induced apoptosis, and either agent alone was able to induce apoptosis. The accumulation of gammaH2A indicated that DSF/Cu increased the DNA damage induced by 6-TG. Combined treatment with 6-TG and DSF/Cu synergistically reduced the levels of both phosphorylated and total ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related kinase (ATR), suggesting that DSF/Cu promoted 6-TG-induced DNA damage by suppressing ATR protein kinases, therefore enhancing cell apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the combination of 6-TG and DSF/Cu exerted a significant synergistic antitumour effect on human TNBC in vitro and in vivo by enhancing DNA damage and disrupting DNA damage checkpoints. We propose that this combination therapy could be a novel strategy for the treatment of TNBC.",

                    "abstract": "Although current cancer immunotherapies that target PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint to reinvigorate exhausted T cells have achieved impressive clinical outcomes, only a small proportion of patients respond. New therapeutic targets are therefore needed to be identified to further unleash the anti-tumor potential of T cells and benefit more patients. Galectin-9 (Gal-9), initially identified as a ligand for TIM-3 to induce T cell death, acts as an immunosuppressive regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME) but its potential as a therapeutic target remains largely elusive. Here we show that antibody neutralization of Gal-9, in combination with inhibition of Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a kinase essential for DNA damage response (DDR), is a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy. Genetic depletion of ATM in tumors markedly potentiated anti-Gal-9 therapy in a syngeneic mouse model. Mechanistically, ATM inhibition greatly upregulated Gal-9 expression and secretion in a variety of human and murine tumor cells via the cGAS-STING-interferon beta (IFNbeta) innate immune pathway. Combination of Gal-9 inhibition with AZD1390, a selective ATM inhibitor currently evaluated in clinical trials, significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in multiple syngeneic mouse models, including the poorly-immunogenic LLC lung tumors that do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, concomitant with increased T cell infiltration. These results reveal Gal-9 induction via STING/IFNbeta signaling as an important mechanism mediating tumor immune escape that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapies, and unveil a novel anti-Gal-9-based combination strategy for cancer immunotherapies in a wide variety of malignancies, including those resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.",

                    "abstract": "Eukaryotes have evolved two major pathways to repair potentially lethal DNA double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination represents a precise, DNA-template-based mechanism available during the S and G2 cell cycle phase, whereas non-homologous end joining, which requires DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), allows for fast, cell cycle-independent but less accurate DNA repair. Here, we report the discovery of BAY-8400, a novel selective inhibitor of DNA-PK. Starting from a triazoloquinoxaline, which had been identified as a hit from a screen for ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors with inhibitory activity against ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK, lead optimization efforts focusing on potency and selectivity led to the discovery of BAY-8400. In in vitro studies, BAY-8400 showed synergistic activity of DNA-PK inhibition with DNA damage-inducing targeted alpha therapy. Combination of PSMA-targeted thorium-227 conjugate BAY 2315497 treatment of human prostate tumor-bearing mice with BAY-8400 oral treatment increased antitumor efficacy, as compared to PSMA-targeted thorium-227 conjugate monotherapy.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Ceralasertib is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with solid tumors, enriched for melanoma, received ceralasertib in combination with a fixed dose of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on D1, D8, D15) in 28-day cycles. The dose of ceralasertib was escalated to reach an MTD in a rolling 6 design. The starting dose of ceralasertib was 40 mg QD. Fifty-seven patients (33 patients with melanoma who failed prior PD1/L1 treatment) were enrolled in 7 dose cohorts ranging from 40 mg QD to 240 mg BD plus weekly paclitaxel. RESULTS: The RP2D was established as ceralasertib 240 mg BD days 1-14 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, D8, D15 every 28 days. The most common toxicities were neutropenia (n = 39, 68%), anemia (n = 25, 44%), and thrombocytopenia (n = 21, 37%). In the full analysis set of 57 patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 22.6% (95% CI, 12.5-35.3). In 33 patients with melanoma, resistant to prior anti-PD1 therapy, the ORR was 33.3% (95% CI, 18.0-51.8). In the melanoma subset, the mPFS was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.0-5.8), the median duration of response was 9.9 months (95% CI, 3.7-23.2), and the mOS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.7-11.9). CONCLUSIONS: Ceralasertib in combination with paclitaxel was well tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies and showed evidence of antitumor activity. Durable responses were observed in patients with advanced cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanoma resistant to anti-PD1/L1 treatment.See related commentary by Ashworth, p. 4667.",

Ceralasertib (AZD6738) is an oral kinase inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein, which is a master regulator of DDR. We conducted a phase II trial of ceralasertib plus durvalumab in patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer (AGC) to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the combination. METHODS: This phase II, open-label, single-center, non-randomized study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ceralasertib in combination with durvalumab in patients with AGC. The study drug regimen was ceralasertib (240 mg two times a day) days 15-28 in a 28-day cycle in combination with durvalumab (1500 mg) at day 1 every 4 weeks. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (V.1.1). Exploratory biomarker analysis was performed using fresh tumor biopsies in all enrolled patients. RESULTS: Among 31 patients, the ORR, disease control rate, median progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were 22.6% (95% CI 9.6% to 41.1%), 58.1% (95% CI 39.1% to 75.5%), 3.0 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.9) months, and 6.7 (95% CI 3.8 to 9.6) months, respectively. Common adverse events were manageable with dose modification. A subgroup of patients with a loss of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) expression and/or high proportion of mutational signature attributable to homologous repair deficiency (sig. HRD) demonstrated a significantly longer PFS than those with intact ATM and low sig. HRD (5.60 vs 1.65 months; HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.045 to 0.39; long-rank p<0.001). During the study treatment, upregulation of the innate immune response by cytosolic DNA, activation of intratumoral lymphocytes, and expansion of circulating tumor-reactive CD8 +T cell clones were identified in responders. Enrichment of the tumor vasculature signature was associated with treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Ceralasertib plus durvalumab has promising antitumor activity, with durable responses in patients with refractory AGC. Thus, a biomarker-driven trial is required.

Several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) are in clinical development including berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970). Although clinical studies have examined plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans, little is known regarding dose/exposure relationships and tissue distribution. To understand these concepts, we extensively characterized the PK of berzosertib in mouse plasma and tissues. METHODS: A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method was utilized to quantitate berzosertib in plasma and tissues. Dose proportionality was assessed in female BALB/c mice following single IV doses (2, 6, 20 or 60 mg/kg). A more extensive PK study was conducted in tumor-bearing mice following a single IV dose of 20 mg/kg to evaluate distribution to tissues. PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA). A compartmental model was developed to describe the PK behavior of berzosertib. Plasma protein binding was determined in vitro. RESULTS: Increased doses of berzosertib were associated with less than proportional increases in early plasma concentrations and greater than proportional increase in tissue exposure, attributable to saturation of plasma protein binding. Berzosertib extensively distributed into bone marrow, tumor, thymus, and lymph nodes, however; brain and spinal cord exposure was less than plasma. CONCLUSION: The nonlinear PK of berzosertib displayed here can be attributed to saturation of plasma protein binding and occurred at concentrations close to those observed in clinical trials. Our results will help to understand preclinical pharmacodynamic and toxicity data and to inform optimal dosing and deployment of berzosertib.",

Cisplatin with gemcitabine remains the standard up-front therapy for treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of the selective ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, could augment the activity of cisplatin with gemcitabine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, 87 patients across 23 centers in the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network were randomized to receive either cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (control arm) or cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib (experimental arm). Key eligibility criteria included confirmed metastatic urothelial cancer, no prior cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease, 12 months or more since perioperative therapy, and eligibility for cisplatin receipt based on standard criteria. The study was conducted from January 27, 2017, to December 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival. The analysis was on all patients who started therapy. RESULTS: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib. Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08). Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68). Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm. Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination. Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.

INTERVENTIONS: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival. The analysis was on all patients who started therapy. RESULTS: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib. Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08). Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68). Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm. Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination. Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.

                    "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as promising therapy in cancers with homologous recombination repair deficiency. However, efficacy is limited by both intrinsic and acquired resistance. The Olaparib Combinations basket trial explored olaparib alone and in combination with other homologous recombination-directed targeted therapies. Here, we report the results of the arm in which olaparib was combined with the orally bioavailable ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related inhibitor ceralasertib in patients with relapsed or refractory cancers harboring DNA damage response and repair alterations, including patients with BRCA-mutated PARP inhibitor-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Germline and somatic mutations had to be deleterious by COSMIC or ClinVar for eligibility. Olaparib was administered at 300 mg twice daily and ceralasertib at 160 mg daily on days 1-7 in 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicities. Primary end points were confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) rates and clinical benefit rate (CBR; CR + PR + stable disease [SD] at 16 weeks). RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, with median four prior therapies. Five patients required dose reductions for myelosuppression. Overall response rate was 8.3% and CBR was 62.5% among the entire cohort. Two of five patients with tumor harboring ATM mutation achieved CR or SD ongoing at 24+ months, respectively (CBR 40%). Of seven patients with PARP inhibitor-resistant HGSOC, one achieved PR (-90%) and five had SD ranging 16-72 weeks (CBR 86%). CONCLUSION: Olaparib with ceralasertib demonstrated preliminary activity in ATM-mutated tumors and in PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOC. These data warrant additional studies to further confirm activity in these settings.",

Therefore, understanding the elevated risk for normal tissue toxicities is critical for radiosensitizer development. This study focused on modeling the relationship between acute mucosal toxicity, radiation dose, fractionation schedule, and radiosensitizer exposure. The ATM inhibitor WSD0628 was combined with single or fractionated doses of radiation delivered to the oral cavity or esophagus of FVB mice. The potentiation by WSD0628 was quantified by a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER), which describes the changes in radiation tolerance for radiation combined with WSD0628 relative to radiation-only regimens. WSD0628 profoundly enhanced radiation-induced acute oral and esophageal toxicities. For oral mucosal toxicity, the enhancement by WSD0628 with 3 fractions of radiation resulted in an SER ranging from 1.3 (0.25 mg/kg) to 3.1 (7.5 mg/kg). For the 7.5 mg/kg combination, the SER increased with increasing number of fractions from 2.2 (1 fraction) to 4.3 (7 fractions) for oral toxicity and from 2.2 (1 fraction) to 3.6 (3 fractions) for esophageal toxicity, which reflects a loss of the normal tissue sparing benefit of fractionated radiation. These findings were used to develop a modified biologically effective dose model to determine alternative radiation schedules with or without WSD0628 that result in similar levels of toxicity. Successful radiosensitizer dose-escalation to maximally effective therapeutic dose will require careful deliberation of tumor site and reduction of radiation dose-volume limits for organs at risk.",

This trial assessed the safety, preliminary efficacy, and tolerance of berzosertib in oesophageal cancer (A1 cohort) with RT and advanced solid tumours (A2 cohort) with cisplatin and capecitabine. METHODS: Single-arm, open-label dose-escalation (Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method) trial with 16 patients in A1 and 18 in A2. A1 tested six dose levels of berzosertib with RT (35 Gy over 15 fractions in 3 weeks). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in A1. Eight grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in five patients, with rash being the most common. The highest dose (240 mg/m2) was determined as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for A1. Seven DLTs in two patients in A2. The RP2D of berzosertib was 140 mg/m2 once weekly. The most common grade >=3 treatment-related AEs were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib combined with RT is feasible and well tolerated in oesophageal cancer patients at high palliative doses. Berzosertib with cisplatin and capecitabine was well tolerated in advanced cancer. Further investigation is warranted in a phase 2 setting.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Berzosertib (formerly M6620) is the first-in-class inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, a key component of the DNA damage response, and being developed in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cancers. The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of berzosertib across multiple studies and parts, estimate inter-individual variability, and identify covariates that could explain such variability. METHODS: A population PK analysis was performed using the combined dataset from two phase I clinical studies (NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34) in patients with advanced cancers receiving an intravenous infusion of berzosertib alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The analysis included data from 240 patients across 11 dose levels (18-480 mg/m2). Plasma concentration data were modeled with a non-linear mixed-effect approach and clinical covariates were evaluated. RESULTS: PK data were best described by a two-compartment linear model. For a typical patient, the estimated clearance (CL) and intercompartmental CL were 65 L/h and 295 L/h, respectively, with central and peripheral volumes estimated to be 118 L and 1030 L, respectively. Several intrinsic factors were found to influence berzosertib PK, but none were considered clinically meaningful due to a very limited effect. Model simulations indicated that concentrations of berzosertib exceeded p-Chk1 (proximal pharmacodynamic biomarker) IC50 at recommended phase II doses in combination with carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a clinically significant PK interaction between berzosertib and evaluated chemo-combinations. The covariate analysis did not highlight any need for dosing adjustments in the population studied to date. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34.",

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a core component of the DNA repair system. Although the ATM gene has a significant mutation rate in many human cancers, including colorectal, prostate, lung, and breast, it remains understudied compared with other DDR-involved molecules such as PARP and ATR. Here, we found that either gene knockout or drug intervention, ATM inhibition activated the cGAS/STING pathway and augmented MHC class I in CRC cells, and these effects could be amplified by radiation. Furthermore, we found that MHC class I upregulation induced by ATM inhibition is dependent on the activation of the NFkappaB/IRF1/NLRC5 pathway and independent of STING. Animal experiments have shown increasing infiltration and cytotoxic function of T cells and better survival in ATM-deficient tumors. This work indicated that ATM nonsense mutation predicted the clinical benefits of radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade for patients with CRC. It also provides a molecular mechanism rationale for ATM-targeted agents for patients with CRC.",

We assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of berzosertib plus cisplatin. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced solid tumours refractory or resistant to standard of care therapies received ascending doses of cisplatin (day 1) and berzosertib (days 2 and 9) every 3 weeks (Q3W). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received berzosertib (90-210 mg/m2) and cisplatin (40-75 mg/m2) across seven dose levels. The most common grade >=3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (20.0%) and anaemia (16.7%). There were two dose-limiting toxicities: a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction and a grade 3 increase in alanine aminotransferase. Berzosertib 140 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) Q3W was determined as the recommended Phase 2 dose. Cisplatin had no apparent effect on berzosertib pharmacokinetics. Of the 31 patients, four achieved a partial response (two confirmed and two unconfirmed) despite having previously experienced disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus cisplatin is well tolerated and shows preliminary clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumours, warranting further evaluation in a Phase 2 setting.

                    "abstract": "Because of the lack of specific molecular targeted therapies, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has high tumour recurrence and metastasis rates. It is urgent to develop novel chemotherapeutic strategies to improve patient survival. DNA damaging agents have been shown to sensitize cancer to genotoxic chemotherapies. We first found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG) can activate the NF-kB signalling pathway. Our results showed that NF-kB signalling was reduced when cells were treated with 6-TG/disulfiram (DSF)/Cu. DSF/Cu enhanced the 6-TG-mediated inhibition of proliferation. 6-TG/DSF/Cu inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell cycle arrest in the S phase and G2/M phase. Moreover, the combined effect of 6-TG and DSF/Cu induced apoptosis, and either agent alone was able to induce apoptosis. The accumulation of gammaH2A indicated that DSF/Cu increased the DNA damage induced by 6-TG. Combined treatment with 6-TG and DSF/Cu synergistically reduced the levels of both phosphorylated and total ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related kinase (ATR), suggesting that DSF/Cu promoted 6-TG-induced DNA damage by suppressing ATR protein kinases, therefore enhancing cell apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the combination of 6-TG and DSF/Cu exerted a significant synergistic antitumour effect on human TNBC in vitro and in vivo by enhancing DNA damage and disrupting DNA damage checkpoints. We propose that this combination therapy could be a novel strategy for the treatment of TNBC.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Overwhelming stress potentially results in the occurrence of many mental diseases. The amygdala is one region in the brain targeted by stress. Recent studies have shown that changes in the amygdala of subjects under stress are related to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, researchers have not clearly elucidated the changes in the amygdala in response to stress and the underlying mechanism. We conducted several experiments to understand this mechanism. METHODS: In this study, we first established a rat model of chronic restraint stress (CRS) and observed the changes in behavior and neurons in the amygdala. Second, an integrated metabolomics and proteomics experiment was conducted to identify potential stress-related biomarkers. Finally, we validated two molecules of interest and detected four apoptosis-related proteins using Western blotting to further determine the related mechanisms. RESULTS: Our study revealed the presence of anxiety-like behaviors and pathological changes in amygdalar neurons in the rat model. In the multi-omics analysis, 19 potential molecules were identified. Western blotting confirmed consistent changes in the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 obtained in previous results. The levels of proteins in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway were increased in the CRS group. CONCLUSIONS: CRS causes anxiety-like behaviors that are potentially related to decreased levels of GABA in the amygdala. Moreover, CRS potentially alters the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 and results in circadian rhythm disorder and impairments in DNA repair and apoptosis in the amygdala through a mechanism mediated by the ATM pathway.",

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant malignancy with elusive mechanism of pathogenesis and dismal prognosis. Over the past decades, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the backbone treatment for SCLC. However, subsequent chemoresistance after initial effectiveness urges researchers to explore novel therapeutic targets of SCLC. Recent years have witnessed significant improvements in targeted therapy in SCLC. New molecular candidates such as Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related protein (ATR), WEE1, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) have shown promising therapeutic utility in SCLC. While immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has emerged as an indispensable treatment modality for SCLC, approaches to boost efficacy and reduce toxicity as well as selection of reliable biomarkers for ICI in SCLC have remained elusive and warrants our further investigation. Given the increasing importance of precision medicine in SCLC, optimal subtyping of SCLC using multi-omics have gradually applied into clinical practice, which may identify more drug targets and better tailor treatment strategies to each individual patient. The present review summarizes recent progress and future directions in SCLC. In addition to the emerging new therapeutics, we also focus on the establishment of predictive model for early detection of SCLC. More importantly, we also propose a multi-dimensional model in the prognosis of SCLC to ultimately attain the goal of accurate treatment of SCLC.",

We assessed the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of berzosertib plus gemcitabine in an expansion cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The association of efficacy with TP53 status and other tumor markers was also explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with advanced histologically confirmed NSCLC received berzosertib 210 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8) at the recommended phase 2 dose established in the dose escalation part of the study. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients received at least one dose of study treatment. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue (55.3%), anemia (52.6%), and nausea (39.5%). Gemcitabine had no apparent effect on the PK of berzosertib. The objective response rate (ORR) was 10.5% (4/38, 90% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-22.5%). In the exploratory analysis, the ORR was 30.0% (3/10, 90% CI: 9.0-61.0%) in patients with high loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and 11.0% (1/9, 90% CI: 1.0-43.0%) in patients with low LOH. The ORR was 33.0% (2/6, 90% CI: 6.0-73.0%) in patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), 12.5% (2/16, 90% CI: 2.0-34.0%) in patients with intermediate TMB, and 0% (0/3, 90% CI: 0.0-53.6%) in patients with low TMB. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus gemcitabine was well tolerated in patients with advanced, pre-treated NSCLC.

                    "abstract": "Importance: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking. Observations: This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Platinum-resistant, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has limited treatment options. Preclinical data suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitors (ATRi) are synergistic. CAPRI (NCT03462342) is an investigator-initiated study of olaparib plus ceralasertib in recurrent HGSOC. Herein, we present results from the platinum-resistant cohort. METHODS: A Simon 2-stage design was utilized. Platinum-resistant HGSOC patients received ceralasertib 160 mg orally daily, days 1-7 and olaparib 300 mg orally twice daily, days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle until toxicity or progression. Primary endpoints were toxicity and efficacy including objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST. Secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The null hypothesis (<=5% ORR) would be rejected if there were >= 1 responses in 12 patients. RESULTS: Fourteen PARPi-naive patients were evaluable for toxicity; 12 were evaluable for response. Three had BRCA1 mutations (1 germline, 2 somatic). Adverse events possibly related to treatment were primarily grade (G) 1/2. G3 toxicities included nausea (14.3%), fatigue (7.1%), anorexia (7.1%), and anemia (7.1%). No objective responses occurred. Best response was stable disease in 9 patients and progressive disease in three. Five patients had a >= 20% to <30% reduction in disease burden, including 3 with BRCA1 mutations. Three of 11 patients (27%; 2 with BRCA1 mutations) evaluable by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria had >50% CA-125 decline, including 2 with CA-125 normalization. Median PFS was 4.2 months overall (90% CI:3.5-8.2) and 8.2 months (3.6 months-not determined) for patients with BRCA1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib plus ceralasertib is well-tolerated. No objective responses occurred, though a signal of activity was seen particularly in disease associated with BRCA1.

Replication stress is a common state that must be tolerated in many cancers. One promising therapeutic approach is targeting replication stress response factors such as the ataxia telangiectasia and rad 3-related kinase (ATR) or checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) kinases that some cancers depend upon to survive endogenous replication stress. However, research revealing the complexity of the replication stress response suggests new genetic interactions and candidate therapeutic targets. Many of these candidates regulate DNA transactions around reversed replication forks, including helicases, nucleases and alternative polymerases that promote fork stability and restart. Here we review emerging strategies to exploit replication stress for cancer therapy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Targeting the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways is an attractive strategy for boosting cancer immunotherapy. Ceralasertib (AZD6738) is an oral kinase inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein, which is a master regulator of DDR. We conducted a phase II trial of ceralasertib plus durvalumab in patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer (AGC) to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the combination. METHODS: This phase II, open-label, single-center, non-randomized study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ceralasertib in combination with durvalumab in patients with AGC. The study drug regimen was ceralasertib (240 mg two times a day) days 15-28 in a 28-day cycle in combination with durvalumab (1500 mg) at day 1 every 4 weeks. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (V.1.1). Exploratory biomarker analysis was performed using fresh tumor biopsies in all enrolled patients. RESULTS: Among 31 patients, the ORR, disease control rate, median progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were 22.6% (95% CI 9.6% to 41.1%), 58.1% (95% CI 39.1% to 75.5%), 3.0 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.9) months, and 6.7 (95% CI 3.8 to 9.6) months, respectively. Common adverse events were manageable with dose modification. A subgroup of patients with a loss of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) expression and/or high proportion of mutational signature attributable to homologous repair deficiency (sig. HRD) demonstrated a significantly longer PFS than those with intact ATM and low sig. HRD (5.60 vs 1.65 months; HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.045 to 0.39; long-rank p<0.001). During the study treatment, upregulation of the innate immune response by cytosolic DNA, activation of intratumoral lymphocytes, and expansion of circulating tumor-reactive CD8 +T cell clones were identified in responders. Enrichment of the tumor vasculature signature was associated with treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Ceralasertib plus durvalumab has promising antitumor activity, with durable responses in patients with refractory AGC. Thus, a biomarker-driven trial is required.

In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

We aimed to identify the relationship between ATM expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and survival outcomes in patients with advanced BTC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 113 patients with advanced BTC who received first-line gemcitabine and platinum. RESULTS: The tumor location was intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH-CCC) in 43 patients, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCC) in 49, and gallbladder (GB) cancer in 21 patients. Fifty-four patients (47.8%) exhibited loss of ATM protein expression. The overall response rate (ORR) of ATM loss and intact ATM was 13.3% and 19.6%, respectively. In a subgroup analysis, EH-CCC patients with ATM loss tended to have improved PFS after platinum-based chemotherapy compared to those with intact ATM (7.9 vs. 6.2 months, respectively; p=0.050).

Although deficient DNA double-strand break repair is considered the main basis for the reactions, pretreatment identification of high-risk patients has been challenging. METHODS: To retrospectively determine the etiology of severe local reaction to RT in a 39-year-old woman with BC, we performed next-generation sequencing followed by further clinical and functional studies. RESULTS: We found a -4 intronic variant (c.2251-4A>G) in trans with a synonymous (c.3576G>A) variant affecting the ATM DNA-repair gene (NG_009830.1, NM_000051.3) which is linked to autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We verified abnormal transcripts resulting from both variants, next to a minor wild-type transcript leading to a residual ATM kinase activity and genomic instability. Follow-up examination of the patient revealed no classic sign of A-T but previously unnoticed head dystonia and mild dysarthria, a family history of BC and late-onset ataxia segregating with the variants. Additionally, her serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated similar to A-T patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the variable presentations of A-T and devastating impact of severe reactions to RT, we suggest a routine measurement of AFP in RT-candidate BC patients followed by next-generation sequencing with special attention to non-canonical splice site and synonymous variants in ATM.",

Therefore, understanding the elevated risk for normal tissue toxicities is critical for radiosensitizer development. This study focused on modeling the relationship between acute mucosal toxicity, radiation dose, fractionation schedule, and radiosensitizer exposure. The ATM inhibitor WSD0628 was combined with single or fractionated doses of radiation delivered to the oral cavity or esophagus of FVB mice. The potentiation by WSD0628 was quantified by a sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER), which describes the changes in radiation tolerance for radiation combined with WSD0628 relative to radiation-only regimens. WSD0628 profoundly enhanced radiation-induced acute oral and esophageal toxicities. For oral mucosal toxicity, the enhancement by WSD0628 with 3 fractions of radiation resulted in an SER ranging from 1.3 (0.25 mg/kg) to 3.1 (7.5 mg/kg). For the 7.5 mg/kg combination, the SER increased with increasing number of fractions from 2.2 (1 fraction) to 4.3 (7 fractions) for oral toxicity and from 2.2 (1 fraction) to 3.6 (3 fractions) for esophageal toxicity, which reflects a loss of the normal tissue sparing benefit of fractionated radiation. These findings were used to develop a modified biologically effective dose model to determine alternative radiation schedules with or without WSD0628 that result in similar levels of toxicity. Successful radiosensitizer dose-escalation to maximally effective therapeutic dose will require careful deliberation of tumor site and reduction of radiation dose-volume limits for organs at risk.",

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a core component of the DNA repair system. Although the ATM gene has a significant mutation rate in many human cancers, including colorectal, prostate, lung, and breast, it remains understudied compared with other DDR-involved molecules such as PARP and ATR. Here, we found that either gene knockout or drug intervention, ATM inhibition activated the cGAS/STING pathway and augmented MHC class I in CRC cells, and these effects could be amplified by radiation. Furthermore, we found that MHC class I upregulation induced by ATM inhibition is dependent on the activation of the NFkappaB/IRF1/NLRC5 pathway and independent of STING. Animal experiments have shown increasing infiltration and cytotoxic function of T cells and better survival in ATM-deficient tumors. This work indicated that ATM nonsense mutation predicted the clinical benefits of radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade for patients with CRC.

Its therapeutic effect is modest, and further research is needed to find synergistic treatments that would halt or reverse disease progression. Promising approaches include upregulation of frataxin expression by epigenetic mechanisms, direct protein replacement, and gene replacement therapy. For ataxia-telangiectasia, promising approaches include splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Rare recessive ataxias for which disease-modifying therapies exist are also reviewed, emphasizing recently approved therapies. Evidence supporting the use of riluzole and acetyl-leucine in recessive ataxias is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Advances in genetic therapies for other neurogenetic conditions have paved the way to implement feasible approaches with potential dramatic benefits. Particularly, as we develop effective treatments for these conditions, we may need to combine therapies, consider newborn testing for pre-symptomatic treatment, and optimize non-pharmacological approaches.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is one of the most common treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the insensitivity of some tumor cells to radiation is one of the major reasons for the poor efficacy of radiotherapy and the poor prognosis of patients, and exploring the underlying mechanisms behind radioresistance is the key to solving this clinical challenge. This study aimed to identify the molecules associated with radioresistance in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), identified thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13 (TRIP13) as the main target initially, and explored whether TRIP13 is related to radioresistance in LUAD and the specific mechanism, with the aim of providing theoretical basis and potential targets for the combination therapy of LUAD patients receiving radiotherapy in the clinic. METHODS: Three datasets, GSE18842, GSE19188 and GSE33532, were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and screened for differentially expressed genes ( log FC >1.5, P<0.05) in each of the three datasets using the R 4.1.3 software, and then Venn diagram was used to find out the differentially expressed genes common to the three datasets. The screened differential genes were then subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and module analysis with the help of STRING online tool and Cytoscape software, and survival prognosis analysis was performed for each gene with the help of Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, and the TRIP13 gene was identified as the main molecule for subsequent studies. Subsequently, the human LUAD cell line H292 was irradiated with multiple X-rays using a sub-lethal dose irradiation method to construct a radioresistant cell line, H292DR. The radioresistance of H292DR cells was verified using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and clone formation assay. The expression levels of TRIP13 in H292 and H292DR cells were measured by Western blot. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence the expression of TRIP13 in H292DR cells and Western blot assay was performed. The clone formation ability and migration ability of H292DR cells were observed after TRIP13 silencing, followed by the detection of changes in the expression levels of proteins closely related to homologous recombination, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein. RESULTS: Screening of multiple GEO datasets, validation of external datasets and survival analysis revealed that TRIP13 was highly expressed in LUAD and was associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients who had received radiation therapy. And the results of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of TRIP13 suggested that TRIP13 might be closely associated with LUAD radioresistance by promoting homologous recombination repair after radiation therapy. Experimentally, TRIP13 expression was found to be upregulated in H292DR, and silencing of TRIP13 was able to increase the sensitivity of H292DR cells to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: TRIP13 is associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients treated with radiation, possibly by promoting a homologous recombination repair pathway to mediate resistance of LUAD cells to radiation.",

                    "abstract": "Proton Bragg peak irradiation has a higher ionizing density than conventional photon irradiation or the entrance of the proton beam profile. Whether targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) could enhance vulnerability to the distinct pattern of damage induced by proton Bragg peak irradiation is currently unknown. Here, we performed genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of key DDR elements and evaluated DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and tumor control in cell lines and xenografts treated with the same physical dose across a radiotherapy linear energy transfer spectrum. Radiotherapy consisted of 6 MV photons and the entrance beam or Bragg peak of a 76.8 MeV spot scanning proton beam. More complex DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced by Bragg peak proton irradiation preferentially underwent resection and engaged homologous recombination (HR) machinery. Unexpectedly, the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor, AZD0156, but not an inhibitor of ATM and Rad3-related, rendered cells hypersensitive to more densely ionizing proton Bragg peak irradiation. ATM inhibition blocked resection and shunted more DSBs to processing by toxic ligation through nonhomologous end-joining, whereas loss of DNA ligation via XRCC4 or Lig4 knockdown rescued resection and abolished the enhanced Bragg peak cell killing. Proton Bragg peak monotherapy selectively sensitized cell lines and tumor xenografts with inherent HR defects, and the repair defect induced by ATM inhibitor coadministration showed enhanced efficacy in HR-proficient models. In summary, inherent defects in HR or administration of an ATM inhibitor in HR-proficient tumors selectively enhances the relative biological effectiveness of proton Bragg peak irradiation. SIGNIFICANCE: Coadministration of an ATM inhibitor rewires DNA repair machinery to render cancer cells uniquely hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by the proton Bragg peak, which is characterized by higher density ionization.See related commentary by Nickoloff, p. 3156.",

In this case report, we present a 14-month-old boy diagnosed as T cell -ALL. Based on his early presentation, family history of childhood lymphoma, and high AFP, inherited predisposition was suspected, and genetic testing confirms A-T. This report represents the crucial part of clinical suspicion of A-T in similar cases as well as highlighting the importance of an early A-T diagnosis that prevents toxic death due to the extensive regimen of radio- chemotherapeutic agents.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Advances in germline genetic testing have led to a surge in identification of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) variant carriers among breast cancer patients, raising numerous questions regarding use of breast radiation therapy (RT) in this population. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed identified articles assessing association(s) between the germline ATM variant status and the risk of toxicity after breast RT. An expert panel of breast radiation oncologists, genetic counselors, and basic scientists convened to review the association between ATM variants and radiation-induced toxicity or secondary malignancy risk and to determine any impact on breast RT recommendations. RESULTS: Carriers of pathogenic variants in ATM have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk for developing breast cancer. ATM variants do not consistently increase risks of toxicities after RT, except possibly among patients with the single nucleotide variant c5557G>A (rs1801516), in whom a small increased risk for the development of both acute and late radiation effects has been identified. In most breast cancer patients with ATM variants, the excess 5-year absolute risk of developing a secondary contralateral breast cancer (CBC) after radiation is extremely low. The exception is in women younger than 45 years old with deleterious rare ATM missense variants, who may be at higher risk for developing a radiation-induced CBC over time. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiation is safe for most breast cancer patients who harbor ATM variants. The possible exceptions are patients with the variant c5557G>A (rs1801516) and patients younger than 45 years old with certain rare deleterious ATM variants, who may be at higher risk for developing CBC. These latter patients should be counseled regarding this potential risk, and every effort should be made to minimize the contralateral breast dose. However, the inconsistency of published data limits precise recommendations, magnifying the need for further prospective studies and the development of a centralized database cataloging RT outcomes and genetic status.",

                    "abstract": "With the advent of precision genomics, hereditary predisposition to hematopoietic neoplasms- collectively known as hereditary predisposition syndromes (HPS)-are being increasingly recognized in clinical practice. Familial clustering was first observed in patients with leukemia, which led to the identification of several germline variants, such as RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, DDX41, and ETV6, among others, now established as HPS, with tendency to develop myeloid neoplasms. However, evidence for hereditary predisposition is also apparent in lymphoid and plasma--cell neoplasms, with recent discoveries of germline variants in genes such as IKZF1, SH2B3, PAX5 (familial acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and KDM1A/LSD1 (familial multiple myeloma). Specific inherited bone marrow failure syndromes-such as GATA2 haploinsufficiency syndromes, short telomere syndromes, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, and familial thrombocytopenias-also have an increased predisposition to develop myeloid neoplasms, whereas inherited immune deficiency syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, and Bruton agammaglobulinemia, are associated with an increased risk for lymphoid neoplasms. Timely recognition of HPS is critical to ensure safe choice of donors and/or conditioning-regimen intensity for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and to enable direction of appropriate genomics-driven personalized therapies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of HPS and serve as a useful reference for clinicians to recognize relevant signs and symptoms among patients to enable timely screening and referrals to pursue germline assessment. In addition, we also discuss our institutional approach toward identification of HPS and offer a stepwise diagnostic and management algorithm.",

                    "abstract": "OPINION STATEMENT: Metastatic (and locally advanced) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDA) represents a major challenge for the oncology community given the rising mortality burden from the disease and the preponderance of patients diagnosed with unresectable disease. Although systemic therapies have become more potent with the development of fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatments, the median overall survival for patients treated with either of these regimens remains just above 1 year. A significant need exists to build upon the effectiveness of first-line regimens, incorporate tolerable maintenance treatments, and add effective later-line options for patients with this disease. We believe every newly diagnosed mPDA patient should undergo next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing, preferably from tumor tissue, to assess for the presence of DNA damage repair (DDR) defects, microsatellite instability, and other possible actionable molecular alterations (such as neurotrophic tropomysin receptor kinase (NTRK) fusions, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification). Existing clinical data suggests that patients, whose tumors harbor DDR defects, benefit from treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Preclinically, inhibitors of other critical players in DDR such as ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and WEE1 have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in PDA cell lines and xenografts. How to move forward the preclinical promise of these newer DDR-targeting therapies into rational clinical trial combinations and sequence PARP inhibitors in relation to platinum chemotherapy remain areas of tremendous clinical research interest. We believe clinical trials should be considered early for mPDA patients, in all treatment lines, so that novel therapies may be added to the treatment armamentarium for patients with this disease. Beyond NGS testing from tumor tissue, we believe it is important to consider germline genetic testing for all patients diagnosed with PDA given recent data suggesting a much stronger hereditary component of the disease than previously understood, and the potential screening implications for family members.",

                    "abstract": "Cancer-specific metabolic changes support the anabolic needs of the rapidly growing tumor, maintain a favorable redox balance, and help cells adapt to microenvironmental stresses like hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Radiation is extensively applied in a large number of cancer treatment protocols but despite its curative potential, radiation resistance and treatment failures pose a serious problem. Metabolic control of DNA integrity and genomic stability can occur through multiple processes, encompassing cell cycle regulation, nucleotide synthesis, epigenetic regulation of gene activity, and antioxidant defenses. Given the important role of metabolic pathways in oxidative damage responses, it is necessary to assess the potential for tumor-specific radiosensitization by novel metabolism-targeted therapies. Additionally, there are opportunities to identify molecular and functional biomarkers of vulnerabilities to combination treatments, which could then inform clinical decisions. Here, we present a curated list of metabolic pathways in the context of ionizing radiation responses. Glutamine metabolism influences DNA damage responses by mechanisms such as synthesis of nucleotides for DNA repair or of glutathione for ROS detoxification. Repurposed oxygen consumption inhibitors have shown promising radiosensitizing activity against murine model tumors and are now in clinical trials. Production of 2-hydroxy glutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase1/2 neomorphic oncogenic mutants interferes with the function of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes and modulates Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) signaling and glutathione pools. Radiation-induced oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids promotes ferroptotic cell loss and cooperates with immunotherapies to improve tumor control. In summary, there are opportunities to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy by exploiting cell-inherent vulnerabilities and dynamic microenvironmental components of the tumor.",

To address MHC-I downregulation, we conducted a high-throughput flow cytometry screen, identifying bleomycin (BLM) as a potent inducer of cell surface MHC-I expression. BLM-induced MHC-I augmentation renders tumor cells more susceptible to T cells in co-culture assays and enhances anti-tumor responses in an adoptive cellular transfer mouse model. Mechanistically, BLM remodels the tumor immune microenvironment, inducing MHC-I expression in an ATM/ATR-NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Furthermore, BLM improves T-cell-dependent immunotherapeutic approaches, including bispecific antibodies therapy, immune checkpoint therapy (ICT), and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) therapy. Importantly, low-dose BLM treatment in mouse models amplified the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy without detectable pulmonary toxicity. In summary, our findings repurpose BLM as a potential inducer of MHC-I, enhancing its expression to improve the efficacy of T-cell-based immunotherapy.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) demonstrates durable clinical benefits in a minority of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We aimed to identify the molecular features that determine the response and develop approaches to enhance the response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the effects of SET domain-containing protein 2 (SEDT2) loss on the DNA damage response pathway, the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the tumor immune microenvironment, and the response to Ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR) and checkpoint inhibition in RCC. RESULTS: ATR inhibition activated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, resulting in the concurrent expression of inflammatory cytokines and immune checkpoints. Among the common RCC genotypes, SETD2 loss is associated with preferential ATR activation and sensitizes cells to ATR inhibition. SETD2 knockdown promoted the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway in response to ATR inhibition. Treatment with the ATR inhibitor VE822 concurrently upregulated immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression in Setd2 knockdown Renca tumors, providing a rationale for ATR inhibition plus ICB combination therapy. Setd2 deficient Renca tumors demonstrated greater vulnerability to ICB monotherapy or combination therapy with VE822 than Setd2 proficient tumors. Moreover, SETD2 mutations were associated with a higher response rate and prolonged overall survival in ICB-treated RCC patients but not in non-ICB-treated RCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: SETD2 loss and ATR inhibition synergize to promote cGAS signaling and enhance immune cell infiltration, providing a mechanistic rationale for the combination of ATR and checkpoint inhibition in RCC patients with SETD2 mutations.",

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a core component of the DNA repair system. Although the ATM gene has a significant mutation rate in many human cancers, including colorectal, prostate, lung, and breast, it remains understudied compared with other DDR-involved molecules such as PARP and ATR. Here, we found that either gene knockout or drug intervention, ATM inhibition activated the cGAS/STING pathway and augmented MHC class I in CRC cells, and these effects could be amplified by radiation. Furthermore, we found that MHC class I upregulation induced by ATM inhibition is dependent on the activation of the NFkappaB/IRF1/NLRC5 pathway and independent of STING. Animal experiments have shown increasing infiltration and cytotoxic function of T cells and better survival in ATM-deficient tumors. This work indicated that ATM nonsense mutation predicted the clinical benefits of radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade for patients with CRC. It also provides a molecular mechanism rationale for ATM-targeted agents for patients with CRC.",

In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

Here, we examined the impact of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon-ion irradiation on the expression of PD-L1 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. We found that the upregulation of PD-L1 expression after high LET carbon-ion irradiation was greater than that induced by X-rays at the same physical and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) dose, and that the upregulation of PD-L1 induced by high LET carbon-ion irradiation was predominantly dependent on ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase activity. Moreover, we showed that the downstream signaling, e.g. STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression, was upregulated to a greater extent after high LET carbon-ion irradiation than X-rays, and that IRF1 upregulation was also ATR dependent. Finally, to visualize PD-L1 molecules on the cell surface in 3D, we applied immunofluorescence-based super-resolution imaging. The three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) analyses revealed substantial increases in the number of presented PD-L1 molecules on the cell surface after high LET carbon-ion irradiation compared with X-ray irradiation.",

                    "abstract": "Cancer-specific metabolic changes support the anabolic needs of the rapidly growing tumor, maintain a favorable redox balance, and help cells adapt to microenvironmental stresses like hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Radiation is extensively applied in a large number of cancer treatment protocols but despite its curative potential, radiation resistance and treatment failures pose a serious problem. Metabolic control of DNA integrity and genomic stability can occur through multiple processes, encompassing cell cycle regulation, nucleotide synthesis, epigenetic regulation of gene activity, and antioxidant defenses. Given the important role of metabolic pathways in oxidative damage responses, it is necessary to assess the potential for tumor-specific radiosensitization by novel metabolism-targeted therapies. Additionally, there are opportunities to identify molecular and functional biomarkers of vulnerabilities to combination treatments, which could then inform clinical decisions. Here, we present a curated list of metabolic pathways in the context of ionizing radiation responses. Glutamine metabolism influences DNA damage responses by mechanisms such as synthesis of nucleotides for DNA repair or of glutathione for ROS detoxification. Repurposed oxygen consumption inhibitors have shown promising radiosensitizing activity against murine model tumors and are now in clinical trials. Production of 2-hydroxy glutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase1/2 neomorphic oncogenic mutants interferes with the function of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes and modulates Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) signaling and glutathione pools. Radiation-induced oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids promotes ferroptotic cell loss and cooperates with immunotherapies to improve tumor control. In summary, there are opportunities to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy by exploiting cell-inherent vulnerabilities and dynamic microenvironmental components of the tumor.",

To address MHC-I downregulation, we conducted a high-throughput flow cytometry screen, identifying bleomycin (BLM) as a potent inducer of cell surface MHC-I expression. BLM-induced MHC-I augmentation renders tumor cells more susceptible to T cells in co-culture assays and enhances anti-tumor responses in an adoptive cellular transfer mouse model. Mechanistically, BLM remodels the tumor immune microenvironment, inducing MHC-I expression in an ATM/ATR-NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Furthermore, BLM improves T-cell-dependent immunotherapeutic approaches, including bispecific antibodies therapy, immune checkpoint therapy (ICT), and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) therapy. Importantly, low-dose BLM treatment in mouse models amplified the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy without detectable pulmonary toxicity. In summary, our findings repurpose BLM as a potential inducer of MHC-I, enhancing its expression to improve the efficacy of T-cell-based immunotherapy.",

Identification of patients with exceptional responses in MSS CRC and predictive biomarkers is an unmet need that needs to be addressed. CASE REPORT: We report three cases of MSS CRC with durable clinical benefit from immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. Two cases bear a POLE P286R mutation, which has been associated with lack of immunotherapy response in MSS CRC. Two cases bear alterations in Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) which may contribute to observed responses, including interaction with a co-administered intratumoral stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway agonist in one patient. CONCLUSION: Novel DNA damage repair alterations, including mutations in ATM, can provide insight into additional mechanisms by which genomic alterations can sensitize MSS CRC to diverse immunotherapies.",

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an intractable disease with rapid progression and high mortality, presenting a persistent obstacle impeding clinical management. Although recent advancements in immunotherapy have enhanced the response rates of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of acquired resistance invariably leads to recurrence and metastasis. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to explore novel therapeutic targets and optimize existing treatment strategies. This article comprehensively reviews the currently available therapeutic modalities for SCLC. It delves into the immunologic prognostic implications by analyzing selected immune-related signatures. Moreover, it conducts an in-depth exploration of the molecular subtyping of SCLC and the associated molecular pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, the focus is on clinical interventions targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), elucidating its resistance mechanisms and demonstrating its notable antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, the study examines the mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), covering resistance issues and strategies for optimizing resistance management, with particular emphasis being placed on analyzing the prospects and clinical value of CAR T therapy in the context of SCLC. Moreover, the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3/checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors is discussed and underscores the advantages of combining these inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to combat chemoresistance and enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapies. Overall, this study investigates emerging strategies for targeted therapies and optimized combination regimens to overcome resistance in SCLC and highlights future strategies for new therapeutic technologies for SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking. Observations: This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking. Observations: This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.",

Here we show that modelling of intermittent ceralasertib treatment in mouse tumor models reveals CD8+ T-cell dependent antitumor activity, which is separate from the effects on tumor cells. Ceralasertib suppresses proliferating CD8+ T-cells on treatment which is rapidly reversed off-treatment. Ceralasertib causes up-regulation of type I interferon (IFNI) pathway in cancer patients and in tumor-bearing mice. IFNI is experimentally found to be a major mediator of antitumor activity of ceralasertib in combination with PD-L1 antibody. Improvement of T-cell function after ceralasertib treatment is linked to changes in myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. IFNI also promotes anti-proliferative effects of ceralasertib on tumor cells. Here, we report that broad immunomodulatory changes following intermittent ATR inhibition underpins the clinical therapeutic benefit and indicates its wider impact on antitumor immunity.",

The clinical phenotype includes growth retardation, immunodeficiency and a strong predisposition to different types of malignancies. Treatment of malignancies in BS patients with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is believed to be associated with increased toxicity, but clinical and laboratory data are lacking. We collected clinical data of two Dutch BS patients with solid tumors. Both were treated with radiotherapy before the diagnosis BS was made and tolerated this treatment well. In addition, we collected fibroblasts from BS patients to perform in vitro clonogenic survival assays to determine radiosensitivity. BS fibroblasts showed less radiosensitivity than the severely radiosensitive Artemis fibroblasts. Moreover, studies of double strand break kinetics by counting 53BP1 foci after irradiation showed similar patterns compared to healthy controls. In combination, the clinical cases and laboratory experiments are valuable information in the discussion whether radiotherapy is absolutely contraindicated in BS, which is the Case in other DNA repair syndromes like Ataxia Telangiectasia and Artemis.",

Prenatal genetic counseling is crucial, especially in tribal societies with consanguineous unions. Ten families with confirmed inborn errors of immunity were studied, revealing diverse pregnancy decisions: An architect with autosomal dominant STAT-1 gain of function underwent prenatal diagnosis despite initial plans for preimplantation genetic diagnosis. In a consanguineous family, two children died from leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 because the father refused prenatal diagnosis. First cousins opted against terminating the second pregnancy, resulting in two children affected by Bruton disease. Another consanguineous couple, with two children afflicted by ataxia-telangiectasia, chose oocyte donation for their third child, ensuring a healthy birth. Recurrent pregnancy loss was observed in a mother subsequently diagnosed with ZAP70 deficiency. A mother with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome child opted for in vitro fertilization, leading to a healthy birth post-prenatal diagnosis. A misdiagnosis of anaplastic anemia occurred in a family with multiple instances of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. A leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 case led to parental dissolution due to the father's refusal to acknowledge the condition. In a non-consanguineous couple, the father's diagnosis of TACI deficiency influenced the mother's decision to discontinue pregnancy post-prenatal diagnosis. Genetic diagnosis alone cannot optimize prenatal care for immune dysregulation disorders. Various factors, including patient education, societal norms, ethics, and economics, impact pregnancy decisions. Clinical immunologists must integrate these elements into guidance strategies to enhance patient outcomes.",

In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

                    "abstract": "Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) inactivation in ~50% of cancer cells confers broad chemoresistance. To identify therapeutic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms for overcoming chemoresistance, we performed an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen in SLFN11-WT and -knockout (KO) cells. We found that inactivation of Ataxia Telangiectasia- and Rad3-related (ATR), CHK1, BRCA2, and RPA1 overcome chemoresistance to camptothecin (CPT) in SLFN11-KO cells. Accordingly, we validate that clinical inhibitors of ATR (M4344 and M6620) and CHK1 (SRA737) resensitize SLFN11-KO cells to topotecan, indotecan, etoposide, cisplatin, and talazoparib. We uncover that ATR inhibition significantly increases mitotic defects along with increased CDT1 phosphorylation, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments in SLFN11-KO cells. We also reveal a chemoresistance mechanism by which CDT1 degradation is retarded, eventually inducing replication reactivation under DNA damage in SLFN11-KO cells. In contrast, in SLFN11-expressing cells, SLFN11 promotes the degradation of CDT1 in response to CPT by binding to DDB1 of CUL4CDT2 E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with replication forks. We show that the C terminus and ATPase domain of SLFN11 are required for DDB1 binding and CDT1 degradation. Furthermore, we identify a therapy-relevant ATPase mutant (E669K) of the SLFN11 gene in human TCGA and show that the mutant contributes to chemoresistance and retarded CDT1 degradation. Taken together, our study reveals new chemotherapeutic insights on how targeting the ATR pathway overcomes chemoresistance of SLFN11-deficient cancers. It also demonstrates that SLFN11 irreversibly arrests replication by degrading CDT1 through the DDB1-CUL4CDT2 ubiquitin ligase.",

                    "abstract": "Elevated levels of replicative stress in gynecological cancers arising from uncontrolled oncogenic activation, loss of key tumor suppressors, and frequent defects in the DNA repair machinery are an intrinsic vulnerability for therapeutic exploitation. The presence of replication stress activates the DNA damage response and downstream checkpoint proteins including ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related kinase (ATR), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), and WEE1-like protein kinase (WEE1), which trigger cell cycle arrest while protecting and restoring stalled replication forks. Strategies that increase replicative stress while lowering cell cycle checkpoint thresholds may allow unrepaired DNA damage to be inappropriately carried forward in replicating cells, leading to mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Moreover, the identification of fork protection as a key mechanism of resistance to chemo- and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapy in ovarian cancer further increases the priority that should be accorded to the development of strategies targeting replicative stress. Small molecule inhibitors designed to target the DNA damage sensors, such as inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), ATR, CHK1 and WEE1, impair smooth cell cycle modulation and disrupt efficient DNA repair, or a combination of the above, have demonstrated interesting monotherapy and combinatorial activity, including the potential to reverse drug resistance and have entered developmental pipelines. Yet unresolved challenges lie in balancing the toxicity profile of these drugs in order to achieve a suitable therapeutic index while maintaining clinical efficacy, and selective biomarkers are urgently required. Here we describe the premise for targeting of replicative stress in gynecological cancers and discuss the clinical advancement of this strategy.",

                    "abstract": "Because of the lack of specific molecular targeted therapies, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has high tumour recurrence and metastasis rates. It is urgent to develop novel chemotherapeutic strategies to improve patient survival. DNA damaging agents have been shown to sensitize cancer to genotoxic chemotherapies. We first found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG) can activate the NF-kB signalling pathway. Our results showed that NF-kB signalling was reduced when cells were treated with 6-TG/disulfiram (DSF)/Cu. DSF/Cu enhanced the 6-TG-mediated inhibition of proliferation. 6-TG/DSF/Cu inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell cycle arrest in the S phase and G2/M phase. Moreover, the combined effect of 6-TG and DSF/Cu induced apoptosis, and either agent alone was able to induce apoptosis. The accumulation of gammaH2A indicated that DSF/Cu increased the DNA damage induced by 6-TG. Combined treatment with 6-TG and DSF/Cu synergistically reduced the levels of both phosphorylated and total ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related kinase (ATR), suggesting that DSF/Cu promoted 6-TG-induced DNA damage by suppressing ATR protein kinases, therefore enhancing cell apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the combination of 6-TG and DSF/Cu exerted a significant synergistic antitumour effect on human TNBC in vitro and in vivo by enhancing DNA damage and disrupting DNA damage checkpoints. We propose that this combination therapy could be a novel strategy for the treatment of TNBC.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is limited by the development of drug resistance. Recent studies demonstrated the efficacy of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunotherapies in metastatic prostate cancer. The ataxia telangiectasia mutation (ATM) protein plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and function of mitosis. Here, we aimed to determine whether PD-1/PD-L1 signaling contributes to the resistance to DTX and to elucidate the mechanism underlying DTX-induced PD-L1 expression. METHODS: In this retrospective study, PD-L1 expression was analyzed in 33 tumor tissue samples from prostate cancer patients. Prostate cell lines were used to perform functional assays and examine underlying mechanisms in vitro. A fully mouse prostate cancer model and a humanized chimeric mouse bearing human prostate tumors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used for in vivo assays. RESULTS: We have shown that DTX, a chemotherapeutic drug which causing microtubule interference, could significantly induce the expression of PD-L1 in prostate cancer cells. This effect is blocked by the inhibition of ATM, suggesting that it plays an essential role in PD-L1 expression upregulated by DTX. Mechanistic studies have shown that ATM activity in cancer cells enhances the stability of the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), which leading to an increase in the NF-kappaB activity and PD-L1 expression. Using the mouse model, it was further demonstrated that a combination of ATM and NEMO inhibitors along with DTX augmented the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy, which are comparable to that of PD-L1 antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have revealed that a previously unrecognized ATM-NEMO signaling which induced by DTX is capable of suppressing tumor immunity by activating the expression of PD-L1, suggesting that the ATM-NEMO-NF-kappaB axis can be exploited to restore the immune balance and overcome cancer resistance triggered by DTX.Graphic Abstract: supplementary file 1.",

ATR inhibitors have been used in clinical trials in combination with radiation or chemotherapeutics; however, their effects against bladder cancer remain unclear. Here, the efficacy of combining gemcitabine with the novel ATR inhibitor AZD6738 was investigated in vitro in three bladder cancer cell lines (J82, T24, and UM-UC-3 cells). The effects of gemcitabine and AZD6738 on cell viability, clonogenicity, cell cycle, and apoptosis were examined. The combined use of gemcitabine and AZD6738 inhibited the viability and colony formation of bladder cancer cells compared to either treatment alone. Gemcitabine (5 nM) and AZD6738 (1 muM) inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell accumulation in the S phase. Moreover, combined treatment enhanced cleaved poly[ADP-ribose]-polymerase expression alongside the number of annexin V-positive cells, indicating apoptosis induction. Mechanistic investigations showed that AZD6738 treatment inhibited the repair of gemcitabine-induced double-strand breaks by interfering with CHK1. Combining AZD6738 with gemcitabine could therefore be useful for bladder cancer therapy.",

We evaluate ZL-2201, an orally bioavailable, highly potent, and selective pharmacologic inhibitor of DNA-PK activity, for the treatment of human cancerous malignancies. ZL-2201 demonstrated greater selectivity for DNA-PK and effectively inhibited DNA-PK autophosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Initial data suggested a potential correlation between ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) deficiency and ZL-2201 sensitivity. More so, ZL-2201 showed strong synergy with topoisomerase II inhibitors independent of ATM status in vitro. In vivo oral administration of ZL-2201 demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activity in the NCI-H1703 xenograft model and significantly enhanced the activity of approved DNA-damaging agents in A549 and FaDu models. From a phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry screen, we identified and validated that ZL-2201 and PRKDC siRNA decreased Ser108 phosphorylation of MCM2, a key DNA replication factor. Collectively, we have characterized a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor with promising monotherapy and combinatory therapeutic potential with approved DNA-damaging agents. More importantly, we identified phospho-MCM2 (Ser108) as a potential proximal biomarker of DNA-PK inhibition that warrants further preclinical and clinical evaluation. Significance: ZL-2201, a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor, can target tumor models in combination with DNA DSB-inducing agents such as radiation or doxorubicin, with potential to improve recurrent therapies in the clinic.",

Recent studies have shown that changes in the amygdala of subjects under stress are related to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, researchers have not clearly elucidated the changes in the amygdala in response to stress and the underlying mechanism. We conducted several experiments to understand this mechanism. METHODS: In this study, we first established a rat model of chronic restraint stress (CRS) and observed the changes in behavior and neurons in the amygdala. Second, an integrated metabolomics and proteomics experiment was conducted to identify potential stress-related biomarkers. Finally, we validated two molecules of interest and detected four apoptosis-related proteins using Western blotting to further determine the related mechanisms. RESULTS: Our study revealed the presence of anxiety-like behaviors and pathological changes in amygdalar neurons in the rat model. In the multi-omics analysis, 19 potential molecules were identified. Western blotting confirmed consistent changes in the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 obtained in previous results. The levels of proteins in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway were increased in the CRS group. CONCLUSIONS: CRS causes anxiety-like behaviors that are potentially related to decreased levels of GABA in the amygdala. Moreover, CRS potentially alters the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 and results in circadian rhythm disorder and impairments in DNA repair and apoptosis in the amygdala through a mechanism mediated by the ATM pathway.",

Ceralasertib suppresses proliferating CD8+ T-cells on treatment which is rapidly reversed off-treatment. Ceralasertib causes up-regulation of type I interferon (IFNI) pathway in cancer patients and in tumor-bearing mice. IFNI is experimentally found to be a major mediator of antitumor activity of ceralasertib in combination with PD-L1 antibody. Improvement of T-cell function after ceralasertib treatment is linked to changes in myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. IFNI also promotes anti-proliferative effects of ceralasertib on tumor cells. Here, we report that broad immunomodulatory changes following intermittent ATR inhibition underpins the clinical therapeutic benefit and indicates its wider impact on antitumor immunity.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a high replication stress tumor, have poor prognoses and few therapeutic options. A phase 2 study showed antitumor activity with the addition of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitor berzosertib to topotecan. Objective: To investigate whether the addition of berzosertib to topotecan improves clinical outcomes for patients with relapsed SCLC. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2022, this open-label phase 2 randomized clinical trial recruited 60 patients with SCLC and relapse after 1 or more prior therapies from 16 US cancer centers. Patients previously treated with topotecan were not eligible. Interventions: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone (group 1), 1.25 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through 5, or with berzosertib (group 2), 210 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2 and 5, in 21-day cycles. Randomization was stratified by tumor sensitivity to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) in the overall population and among patients with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant tumors. The PFS and OS for each treatment group were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and OS between the 2 groups, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the treatment hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Results: Of 60 patients (median [range] age, 59 [34-79] years; 33 [55%] male) included in this study, 20 were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone and 40 to receive a combination of topotecan with berzosertib. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 21.3 (18.1-28.3) months, there was no difference in PFS between the 2 groups (median, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.2-5.1] months for group 1 vs 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-4.6] months for group 2; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.46-1.41]; P = .44). Overall survival was significantly longer with the combination therapy (5.4 [95% CI, 3.2-6.8] months vs 8.9 [95% CI, 4.8-11.4] months; HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.29-0.96], P = .03). Adverse event profiles were similar between the 2 groups (eg, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, 11 of 20 [55%] vs 20 of 40 [50%], and any grade nausea, 9 of 20 [45%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, treatment with berzosertib plus topotecan did not improve PFS compared with topotecan therapy alone among patients with relapsed SCLC. However, the combination treatment significantly improved OS. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03896503.",

The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of berzosertib across multiple studies and parts, estimate inter-individual variability, and identify covariates that could explain such variability. METHODS: A population PK analysis was performed using the combined dataset from two phase I clinical studies (NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34) in patients with advanced cancers receiving an intravenous infusion of berzosertib alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The analysis included data from 240 patients across 11 dose levels (18-480 mg/m2). Plasma concentration data were modeled with a non-linear mixed-effect approach and clinical covariates were evaluated. RESULTS: PK data were best described by a two-compartment linear model. For a typical patient, the estimated clearance (CL) and intercompartmental CL were 65 L/h and 295 L/h, respectively, with central and peripheral volumes estimated to be 118 L and 1030 L, respectively. Several intrinsic factors were found to influence berzosertib PK, but none were considered clinically meaningful due to a very limited effect. Model simulations indicated that concentrations of berzosertib exceeded p-Chk1 (proximal pharmacodynamic biomarker) IC50 at recommended phase II doses in combination with carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a clinically significant PK interaction between berzosertib and evaluated chemo-combinations. The covariate analysis did not highlight any need for dosing adjustments in the population studied to date. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34.",

                    "abstract": "The poor prognosis for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the dominant subtype of ovarian cancer, reflects its aggressive nature, late diagnosis, and the highest mortality rate among all gynaecologic cancers. Apart from late diagnosis, the main reason for the poor prognosis and its unsuccessful treatment is primarily the emergence of chemoresistance to carboplatin. Although there is a good response to primary treatment, the disease recurs in 80% of cases, at which point it is largely resistant to carboplatin. The introduction of novel targeted therapies in the second decade of the 21st century has begun to transform the treatment of HGSOC, although their impact on overall survival remains unsatisfactory. Targeting the specific pathways known to be abnormally activated in HGSOC is especially difficult due to the molecular diversity of its subtypes. Moreover, a range of molecular changes are associated with acquired chemoresistance, e.g., reversion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline alleles. In this review, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of approved targeted therapies, including bevacizumab, PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and treatments targeting cells with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene alterations, as well as antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, we explore promising new targets under investigation in ongoing clinical trials, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, Wee1 kinase inhibitors, and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors for platinum-resistant disease. Despite the development of new targeted therapies, carboplatin remains the fundamental medicine in HGSOC therapy. The correct choice of treatment strategy for better survival of patients with advanced HGSOC should therefore include a prediction of patients' risks of developing chemoresistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effective targeted therapy requires the selection of patients who are likely to derive clinical benefit while minimizing potential adverse effects, underscoring the essence of precision medicine.",

                    "abstract": "PARP inhibitor monotherapy (olaparib) was recently FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutant, homologous recombination (HR) repair-deficient pancreatic cancer. Most pancreatic cancers, however, are HR proficient and thus resistant to PARP inhibitor monotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that combined therapy with radiation and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (AZD6738) would extend the therapeutic indication of olaparib to HR-proficient pancreatic cancers. We show that olaparib combined with AZD6738 significantly reduced radiation survival relative to either agent alone, regardless of HR status. Whereas catalytic inhibition of PARP with low concentrations of olaparib radiosensitized HR-deficient models, maximal sensitization in HR-proficient models required concentrations of olaparib that induce formation of PARP1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated PARP1 deletion failed to recapitulate the effects of olaparib on radiosensitivity and negated the combinatorial efficacy of olaparib and AZD6738 on radiosensitization, suggesting that PARP1-DNA complexes, rather than PARP catalytic inhibition, were responsible for radiosensitization. Mechanistically, therapeutic concentrations of olaparib in combination with radiation and AZD6738 increased DNA double-strand breaks. DNA fiber combing revealed that high concentrations of olaparib did not stall replication forks but instead accelerated replication fork progression in association with an ATR-mediated replication stress response that was antagonized by AZD6738. Finally, in HR-proficient tumor xenografts, the combination of olaparib, radiation, and AZD6738 significantly delayed tumor growth compared with all other treatments. These findings suggest that PARP1-DNA complexes are required for the therapeutic activity of olaparib combined with radiation and ATR inhibitor in HR-proficient pancreatic cancer and support the clinical development of this combination for tumors intrinsically resistant to PARP inhibitors.",

To reduce the potential risk of oxidative stress-induced sperm DNA damage, addition of different epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) concentrations were performed to determine the optimum concentration which was beneficial for IVF outcome for both fresh and frozen-thawed sperm. Next, the mouse sperm model exhibiting oxidative stress-induced DNA damage by exogenously treating with H2O2 but overcoming the low fertilization rate of frozen-thawed sperm was used to investigate the effect of EGCG on the embryonic development and the potential EGCG-mediated effects on ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pSer-1981 in zygotes, the latter was known for leading to the activation of major kinases involved in the DNA repair pathway and the cell cycle checkpoint pathway. We found the fertilization and embryonic development of embryos inseminated with frozen-thawed sperm was impaired compared to fresh sperm. EGCG promoted the development of embryos inseminated with both types of sperm at optimum concentration. In embryos inseminated with the H2O2 sperm, fertilization, embryonic development, and the time at which the cleavage rate of one-cell embryos reached >=95% were not affected by EGCG treatment. However, the EGCG-treated group required less time to achieve 50% cleavage rate of one-cell embryos, and the EGCG-treated zygotes showed enhanced expression of ATM (pSer-1981) than the untreated group. EGCG at optimum concentrations may exert beneficial effects by modulating the ATM activation and moving up the time to enter into mitotic (M) phase.

                    "abstract": "OPINION STATEMENT: Metastatic (and locally advanced) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDA) represents a major challenge for the oncology community given the rising mortality burden from the disease and the preponderance of patients diagnosed with unresectable disease. Although systemic therapies have become more potent with the development of fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatments, the median overall survival for patients treated with either of these regimens remains just above 1 year. A significant need exists to build upon the effectiveness of first-line regimens, incorporate tolerable maintenance treatments, and add effective later-line options for patients with this disease. We believe every newly diagnosed mPDA patient should undergo next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing, preferably from tumor tissue, to assess for the presence of DNA damage repair (DDR) defects, microsatellite instability, and other possible actionable molecular alterations (such as neurotrophic tropomysin receptor kinase (NTRK) fusions, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification). Existing clinical data suggests that patients, whose tumors harbor DDR defects, benefit from treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Preclinically, inhibitors of other critical players in DDR such as ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and WEE1 have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in PDA cell lines and xenografts. How to move forward the preclinical promise of these newer DDR-targeting therapies into rational clinical trial combinations and sequence PARP inhibitors in relation to platinum chemotherapy remain areas of tremendous clinical research interest. We believe clinical trials should be considered early for mPDA patients, in all treatment lines, so that novel therapies may be added to the treatment armamentarium for patients with this disease. Beyond NGS testing from tumor tissue, we believe it is important to consider germline genetic testing for all patients diagnosed with PDA given recent data suggesting a much stronger hereditary component of the disease than previously understood, and the potential screening implications for family members.",

Several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) are in clinical development including berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970). Although clinical studies have examined plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans, little is known regarding dose/exposure relationships and tissue distribution. To understand these concepts, we extensively characterized the PK of berzosertib in mouse plasma and tissues. METHODS: A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method was utilized to quantitate berzosertib in plasma and tissues. Dose proportionality was assessed in female BALB/c mice following single IV doses (2, 6, 20 or 60 mg/kg). A more extensive PK study was conducted in tumor-bearing mice following a single IV dose of 20 mg/kg to evaluate distribution to tissues. PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA). A compartmental model was developed to describe the PK behavior of berzosertib. Plasma protein binding was determined in vitro. RESULTS: Increased doses of berzosertib were associated with less than proportional increases in early plasma concentrations and greater than proportional increase in tissue exposure, attributable to saturation of plasma protein binding. Berzosertib extensively distributed into bone marrow, tumor, thymus, and lymph nodes, however; brain and spinal cord exposure was less than plasma. CONCLUSION: The nonlinear PK of berzosertib displayed here can be attributed to saturation of plasma protein binding and occurred at concentrations close to those observed in clinical trials. Our results will help to understand preclinical pharmacodynamic and toxicity data and to inform optimal dosing and deployment of berzosertib.",

In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

                    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer, and is ranked the sixth most common neoplasm and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Photothermal therapy (PTT) for thermal ablation of local tumors has recently emerged as a therapeutic strategy. However, the relatively high temperature of over 50  C may lead to unexpected heat-related damage to tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Herein, we designed and synthesized ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor loaded hollow-structured CuS NPs with surface modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody (CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs are highly photo-stable, can release encapsulated drugs, and increase the temperature to an effective level in a near-infrared (NIR)-responsive manner. Moreover, CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs specifically target tumors and thereby significantly inhibit tumor growth on contribution to synergistic low-temperature PTT and chemotherapy. This system not only achieved low-temperature PTT but also resulted in reduced damage to normal tissues. Modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody enhanced target specificity and immune activation. The combination of PTT and ATM inhibitor showed synergistic effects and significantly attenuated the growth of the HCC via down regulation of heat shock protein (HSP). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs are a highly promising platform for targeted tumor ablation via hyperthermia-mediated tumor death with minimal damage to normal tissues at a low temperature. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We constructed ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor-loaded hollow-structured CuS NPs with surface modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody (CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs not only achieved low-temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) but also resulted in reduced damage to normal tissues and sufficient biocompatibility. The modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody enhanced targeted specificity, cell endocytosis, and immune activation. In addition, the combination of PTT and ATM inhibitor synergistically attenuated the growth of the HCC via downregulation of heat shock protein (HSP). This study provided proof-of-concept for the ATM inhibitor that mediated low-temperature PTT with a potential for future clinical applications.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy (RT) against head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) may lead to severe toxicity in 30-40% of patients. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, based on dosimetric data refined the normal tissue dose/volume tolerance guidelines. In parallel, the radiation-induced nucleoshuttling (RIANS) of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein (pATM) is a predictive approach of individual intrinsic radiosensitivity. Here, we combined NTCP with RADIODTECT , a blood assay derived from the RIANS model, to predict RT toxicity in HNSCC patients. METHODS: RADIODTECT  cutoff values (i.e. 57.8 ng/mL for grade>=2 toxicity and 46 ng/mL for grade>=3 toxicity) have been previously assessed. Validation was performed on a prospective cohort of 36 HNSCC patients treated with postoperative RT. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale and two criteria were considered: grade>=2 oral mucositis (OM2), grade>=3 mucositis (OM3) and grade>=2 dysphagia (DY2), grade>=3 dysphagia (DY3). pATM quantification was assessed in lymphocytes of HNSCC patients. The discrimination power of the pATM assay was evaluated through the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC). Two previously described NTCP models were considered, including the dose to the oral cavity and the mean dose to the parotid glands (OM2 and OM3) and the dose to the oral cavity, to the larynx and the volume of pharyngeal constrictor muscles (DY2 and DY3). RESULTS: Combining NTCP models with RADIODTECT  blood test improved the AUC-ROC. Considering the prediction of mucositis, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.80 was for OM2, and AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.78 for OM3. Considering the prediction of acute dysphagia, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.71 for DY2 and for DY3. CONCLUSIONS: Combining NTCP models with a radiosensitivity biomarker might significantly improve the prediction of toxicities for HNSCC patients.",

To address MHC-I downregulation, we conducted a high-throughput flow cytometry screen, identifying bleomycin (BLM) as a potent inducer of cell surface MHC-I expression. BLM-induced MHC-I augmentation renders tumor cells more susceptible to T cells in co-culture assays and enhances anti-tumor responses in an adoptive cellular transfer mouse model. Mechanistically, BLM remodels the tumor immune microenvironment, inducing MHC-I expression in an ATM/ATR-NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Furthermore, BLM improves T-cell-dependent immunotherapeutic approaches, including bispecific antibodies therapy, immune checkpoint therapy (ICT), and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) therapy. Importantly, low-dose BLM treatment in mouse models amplified the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy without detectable pulmonary toxicity.

This clinical conundrum poses three challenges for local drug delivery systems: stable and continuous delivery, good biocompatibility, and the ability to package new targeted drugs that can synergizing with other treatments.Here, we report a drug-laden hydrogel generated from pure DNA strands and highly programmable in adjusting its mesh size. Meanwhile, the DNA hydrogel could assist the micro-crystallization of a novel radiosensitizing drugs, ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor (Elimusertib), further facilitating its long-term release. When applied to the tumor site, the hydrogel system demonstrated significant antitumor activity, minimized systemic toxicity, and had a modulatory effect on the tumor-immune cell interface.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To increase the chances of finding efficacious anticancer drugs, improve development times and reduce costs, it is of interest to rank test compounds based on their potential for human use as early as possible in the drug development process. In this paper, we present a method for ranking radiosensitizers using preclinical data. METHODS: We used data from three xenograft mice studies to calibrate a model that accounts for radiation treatment combined with radiosensitizers. A nonlinear mixed effects approach was utilized where between-subject variability and inter-study variability were considered. Using the calibrated model, we ranked three different Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated inhibitors in terms of anticancer activity. The ranking was based on the Tumor Static Exposure (TSE) concept and primarily illustrated through TSE-curves. RESULTS: The model described data well and the predicted number of eradicated tumors was in good agreement with experimental data. The efficacy of the radiosensitizers was evaluated for the median individual and the 95% population percentile. Simulations predicted that a total dose of 220 Gy (5 radiation sessions a week for 6 weeks) was required for 95% of tumors to be eradicated when radiation was given alone. When radiation was combined with doses that achieved at least 8 [Formula: see text] of each radiosensitizer in mouse blood, it was predicted that the radiation dose could be decreased to 50, 65, and 100 Gy, respectively, while maintaining 95% eradication. CONCLUSIONS: A simulation-based method for calculating TSE-curves was developed, which provides more accurate predictions of tumor eradication than earlier, analytically derived, TSE-curves. The tool we present can potentially be used for radiosensitizer selection before proceeding to subsequent phases of the drug discovery and development process.",

                    "abstract": "Cancer-specific metabolic changes support the anabolic needs of the rapidly growing tumor, maintain a favorable redox balance, and help cells adapt to microenvironmental stresses like hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Radiation is extensively applied in a large number of cancer treatment protocols but despite its curative potential, radiation resistance and treatment failures pose a serious problem. Metabolic control of DNA integrity and genomic stability can occur through multiple processes, encompassing cell cycle regulation, nucleotide synthesis, epigenetic regulation of gene activity, and antioxidant defenses. Given the important role of metabolic pathways in oxidative damage responses, it is necessary to assess the potential for tumor-specific radiosensitization by novel metabolism-targeted therapies. Additionally, there are opportunities to identify molecular and functional biomarkers of vulnerabilities to combination treatments, which could then inform clinical decisions. Here, we present a curated list of metabolic pathways in the context of ionizing radiation responses. Glutamine metabolism influences DNA damage responses by mechanisms such as synthesis of nucleotides for DNA repair or of glutathione for ROS detoxification. Repurposed oxygen consumption inhibitors have shown promising radiosensitizing activity against murine model tumors and are now in clinical trials. Production of 2-hydroxy glutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase1/2 neomorphic oncogenic mutants interferes with the function of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes and modulates Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) signaling and glutathione pools. Radiation-induced oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids promotes ferroptotic cell loss and cooperates with immunotherapies to improve tumor control. In summary, there are opportunities to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy by exploiting cell-inherent vulnerabilities and dynamic microenvironmental components of the tumor.",

To reduce the potential risk of oxidative stress-induced sperm DNA damage, addition of different epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) concentrations were performed to determine the optimum concentration which was beneficial for IVF outcome for both fresh and frozen-thawed sperm. Next, the mouse sperm model exhibiting oxidative stress-induced DNA damage by exogenously treating with H2O2 but overcoming the low fertilization rate of frozen-thawed sperm was used to investigate the effect of EGCG on the embryonic development and the potential EGCG-mediated effects on ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pSer-1981 in zygotes, the latter was known for leading to the activation of major kinases involved in the DNA repair pathway and the cell cycle checkpoint pathway. We found the fertilization and embryonic development of embryos inseminated with frozen-thawed sperm was impaired compared to fresh sperm. EGCG promoted the development of embryos inseminated with both types of sperm at optimum concentration. In embryos inseminated with the H2O2 sperm, fertilization, embryonic development, and the time at which the cleavage rate of one-cell embryos reached >=95% were not affected by EGCG treatment. However, the EGCG-treated group required less time to achieve 50% cleavage rate of one-cell embryos, and the EGCG-treated zygotes showed enhanced expression of ATM (pSer-1981) than the untreated group. EGCG at optimum concentrations may exert beneficial effects by modulating the ATM activation and moving up the time to enter into mitotic (M) phase.

Poor response to treatment, excessive chemotherapy toxicities, and the need for avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation make the successful clinical management of patients with AT challenging for oncologists. We describe the favorable outcome of the LBCL with IRF4 rearrangement at stage III in a 7-year-old female patient diagnosed with AT. The patient was treated according to the B-HR arm of the INTER-B-NHL-COP 2010 protocol, including the administration of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, etc. She presented excessive treatment toxicities despite individually reduced doses of methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. However, in the MRI there was no significant reduction in pathologic lymph nodes after three immunochemotherapy courses. Therefore, a lymph node biopsy was taken. Its subsequent histopathological examination revealed tuberculosis-like changes, though tuberculosis suspicion was excluded.

We compared the results with those from an age-matched control group. Three of the A-T patients were analyzed separately (one after resection of a cerebral meningioma, one after radiation and chemotherapy due to leukemia, one after stem cell transplantation). Patient had significantly more moderate and severe side effects due to CSF puncture (vomiting, headache, need for anti-emetic drugs) compared with healthy controls. Total protein, albumin, and the AR increased with age indicating a disturbed blood barrier function in older children. There were no differences for cytokines in serum and CSF with the exception of IL-2, which was significantly higher in controls in serum. The AR is significantly altered in A-T patients, but low-grade inflammation is not detectable in serum and CSF.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The treatment of advanced metastatic CRC relies on classical chemotherapy combinations (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin or irinotecan). However, their use is limited by the emergence of resistance mechanisms, including to oxaliplatin. In this context, we recently showed that the combination of oxaliplatin and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein inhibition (VE-822) is synergistic and may have a potential therapeutic effect in metastatic CRC management. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the role of the VE-822+oxaliplatin (Vox) combination on the immune response and its potential synergy with an anti-programmed-cell Death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody. We used cell lines and organoids from metastatic CRC to investigate in vitro Vox efficacy and orthotopic syngeneic mouse models of metastatic CRC to assess the efficacy of Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody and identify the involved immune cells. RESULTS: The Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination completely cured tumor-bearing mice and protected them from a rechallenge. Vox was associated with a reduction of tumor-infiltrated neutrophils, CD206+ macrophages and regulatory T cells. Vox also induced a deep depletion of blood neutrophils. The increased bone marrow granulopoiesis failed to compensate for the Vox-mediated mature neutrophil depletion. Neutrophil depletion using a mouse recombinant anti-Ly6G antibody partially mimicked the Vox effect on the tumor microenvironment, but to a lower extent compared with the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination. Vox, but not neutrophil depletion, led to the emergence of an Ly6C+ PD-1+ CD8+ T-cell population in the blood and spleen of tumor-harboring mice. These cells were proliferating, and expressed IFN-gamma, CD62L, CXCR3 and Eomes. Moreover, the proportion of tumor antigen-specific T cells and of CD122+ BCL6+ T cells, which shared phenotypic characteristics with stem-like CD8+ T cells, was increased in treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our work strongly suggests that the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination might significantly improve survival in patients with metastatic and treatment-refractory CRC by acting both on cancer cells and CD8+ T cells.",

Although deficient DNA double-strand break repair is considered the main basis for the reactions, pretreatment identification of high-risk patients has been challenging. METHODS: To retrospectively determine the etiology of severe local reaction to RT in a 39-year-old woman with BC, we performed next-generation sequencing followed by further clinical and functional studies. RESULTS: We found a -4 intronic variant (c.2251-4A>G) in trans with a synonymous (c.3576G>A) variant affecting the ATM DNA-repair gene (NG_009830.1, NM_000051.3) which is linked to autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We verified abnormal transcripts resulting from both variants, next to a minor wild-type transcript leading to a residual ATM kinase activity and genomic instability. Follow-up examination of the patient revealed no classic sign of A-T but previously unnoticed head dystonia and mild dysarthria, a family history of BC and late-onset ataxia segregating with the variants. Additionally, her serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated similar to A-T patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the variable presentations of A-T and devastating impact of severe reactions to RT, we suggest a routine measurement of AFP in RT-candidate BC patients followed by next-generation sequencing with special attention to non-canonical splice site and synonymous variants in ATM.",

                    "abstract": "OPINION STATEMENT: Metastatic (and locally advanced) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDA) represents a major challenge for the oncology community given the rising mortality burden from the disease and the preponderance of patients diagnosed with unresectable disease. Although systemic therapies have become more potent with the development of fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatments, the median overall survival for patients treated with either of these regimens remains just above 1 year. A significant need exists to build upon the effectiveness of first-line regimens, incorporate tolerable maintenance treatments, and add effective later-line options for patients with this disease. We believe every newly diagnosed mPDA patient should undergo next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing, preferably from tumor tissue, to assess for the presence of DNA damage repair (DDR) defects, microsatellite instability, and other possible actionable molecular alterations (such as neurotrophic tropomysin receptor kinase (NTRK) fusions, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification). Existing clinical data suggests that patients, whose tumors harbor DDR defects, benefit from treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Preclinically, inhibitors of other critical players in DDR such as ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and WEE1 have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in PDA cell lines and xenografts. How to move forward the preclinical promise of these newer DDR-targeting therapies into rational clinical trial combinations and sequence PARP inhibitors in relation to platinum chemotherapy remain areas of tremendous clinical research interest. We believe clinical trials should be considered early for mPDA patients, in all treatment lines, so that novel therapies may be added to the treatment armamentarium for patients with this disease. Beyond NGS testing from tumor tissue, we believe it is important to consider germline genetic testing for all patients diagnosed with PDA given recent data suggesting a much stronger hereditary component of the disease than previously understood, and the potential screening implications for family members.",

Several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) are in clinical development including berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970). Although clinical studies have examined plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans, little is known regarding dose/exposure relationships and tissue distribution. To understand these concepts, we extensively characterized the PK of berzosertib in mouse plasma and tissues. METHODS: A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method was utilized to quantitate berzosertib in plasma and tissues. Dose proportionality was assessed in female BALB/c mice following single IV doses (2, 6, 20 or 60 mg/kg). A more extensive PK study was conducted in tumor-bearing mice following a single IV dose of 20 mg/kg to evaluate distribution to tissues. PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA). A compartmental model was developed to describe the PK behavior of berzosertib. Plasma protein binding was determined in vitro. RESULTS: Increased doses of berzosertib were associated with less than proportional increases in early plasma concentrations and greater than proportional increase in tissue exposure, attributable to saturation of plasma protein binding. Berzosertib extensively distributed into bone marrow, tumor, thymus, and lymph nodes, however; brain and spinal cord exposure was less than plasma. CONCLUSION: The nonlinear PK of berzosertib displayed here can be attributed to saturation of plasma protein binding and occurred at concentrations close to those observed in clinical trials. Our results will help to understand preclinical pharmacodynamic and toxicity data and to inform optimal dosing and deployment of berzosertib.",

However, experience in the transplantation strategy for A-T patients is still scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate whether different approaches of HSCT are feasible in regard to graft versus host response and sufficient concerning functional immune reconstitution. Atm-deficient mice were treated with a clinically relevant non-myeloablative host-conditioning regimen and transplanted with CD90.2-depleted, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing, and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-competent bone marrow donor cells in a syngeneic, haploidentical or allogeneic setting. Like syngeneic HSCT, haploidentical HSCT, but not allogeneic HSCT extended the lifespan of Atm-deficient mice through the reduction of thymic tumors and normalized T-cell numbers. Donor-derived splenocytes isolated from transplanted Atm-deficient mice filled the gap of cell loss in the naive T-cell population and raised CD4 cell functionality up to wild-type level. Interestingly, HSCT using heterozygous donor cells let to a significantly improved survival of Atm-deficient mice and increased CD4 cell numbers as well as CD4 cell functionality equivalent to HSCT using with wild-type donor cells. Our data provided evidence that haploidentical HSCT could be a feasible strategy for A-T, possibly even if the donor is heterozygous for ATM. However, this basic research cannot substitute any research in humans.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy (RT) against head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) may lead to severe toxicity in 30-40% of patients. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, based on dosimetric data refined the normal tissue dose/volume tolerance guidelines. In parallel, the radiation-induced nucleoshuttling (RIANS) of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein (pATM) is a predictive approach of individual intrinsic radiosensitivity. Here, we combined NTCP with RADIODTECT , a blood assay derived from the RIANS model, to predict RT toxicity in HNSCC patients. METHODS: RADIODTECT  cutoff values (i.e. 57.8 ng/mL for grade>=2 toxicity and 46 ng/mL for grade>=3 toxicity) have been previously assessed. Validation was performed on a prospective cohort of 36 HNSCC patients treated with postoperative RT. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale and two criteria were considered: grade>=2 oral mucositis (OM2), grade>=3 mucositis (OM3) and grade>=2 dysphagia (DY2), grade>=3 dysphagia (DY3). pATM quantification was assessed in lymphocytes of HNSCC patients. The discrimination power of the pATM assay was evaluated through the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC). Two previously described NTCP models were considered, including the dose to the oral cavity and the mean dose to the parotid glands (OM2 and OM3) and the dose to the oral cavity, to the larynx and the volume of pharyngeal constrictor muscles (DY2 and DY3). RESULTS: Combining NTCP models with RADIODTECT  blood test improved the AUC-ROC. Considering the prediction of mucositis, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.80 was for OM2, and AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.78 for OM3. Considering the prediction of acute dysphagia, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.71 for DY2 and for DY3. CONCLUSIONS: Combining NTCP models with a radiosensitivity biomarker might significantly improve the prediction of toxicities for HNSCC patients.",

Recent studies have shown that changes in the amygdala of subjects under stress are related to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, researchers have not clearly elucidated the changes in the amygdala in response to stress and the underlying mechanism. We conducted several experiments to understand this mechanism. METHODS: In this study, we first established a rat model of chronic restraint stress (CRS) and observed the changes in behavior and neurons in the amygdala. Second, an integrated metabolomics and proteomics experiment was conducted to identify potential stress-related biomarkers. Finally, we validated two molecules of interest and detected four apoptosis-related proteins using Western blotting to further determine the related mechanisms. RESULTS: Our study revealed the presence of anxiety-like behaviors and pathological changes in amygdalar neurons in the rat model. In the multi-omics analysis, 19 potential molecules were identified. Western blotting confirmed consistent changes in the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 obtained in previous results. The levels of proteins in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway were increased in the CRS group. CONCLUSIONS: CRS causes anxiety-like behaviors that are potentially related to decreased levels of GABA in the amygdala. Moreover, CRS potentially alters the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 and results in circadian rhythm disorder and impairments in DNA repair and apoptosis in the amygdala through a mechanism mediated by the ATM pathway.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy in the first-line and second-line treatment settings, a new patient population is emerging with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, who have previously received a PARP inhibitor in the maintenance setting and for whom no second maintenance standard of care exists. DUETTE (NCT04239014) will evaluate the combination of ceralasertib (a potent, selective inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) + olaparib, or olaparib monotherapy, compared with placebo, in this patient population of unmet need. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of ceralasertib + olaparib combination, and olaparib monotherapy, compared with placebo, as second maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: This study will test the hypothesis that ceralasertib + olaparib, or olaparib monotherapy, is tolerable, and effective at prolonging progression-free survival compared with placebo. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase II, multicenter study where patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either (Arm 1) ceralasertib + olaparib, (Arm 2) olaparib monotherapy, or (Arm 3) placebo. The olaparib and placebo arms will be double-blinded, whereas the ceralasertib + olaparib arm will be open label. Patients will be stratified according to BRCA status, and response to platinum-based chemotherapy. MAJOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible patients will have histologically diagnosed high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer, with platinum-sensitive relapse on, or after, completion of at least 6 months of any prior PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy (a minimum of 12 months is required if the patient received PARP inhibitor maintenance following first-line chemotherapy). If the prior PARP inhibitor used was olaparib then patients must have received treatment without significant toxicity or the need for a permanent dose reduction. Disease relapse in the second-line or third-line setting is allowed. Patients who have received secondary debulking surgery are potentially eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoint is progression-free survival determined by blinded independent central review according to RECIST 1.1, with sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival using investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1. SAMPLE SIZE: 192 patients. ESTIMATED DATES FOR COMPLETING ACCRUAL AND PRESENTING RESULTS: December 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04239014.",

Prenatal genetic counseling is crucial, especially in tribal societies with consanguineous unions. Ten families with confirmed inborn errors of immunity were studied, revealing diverse pregnancy decisions: An architect with autosomal dominant STAT-1 gain of function underwent prenatal diagnosis despite initial plans for preimplantation genetic diagnosis. In a consanguineous family, two children died from leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 because the father refused prenatal diagnosis. First cousins opted against terminating the second pregnancy, resulting in two children affected by Bruton disease. Another consanguineous couple, with two children afflicted by ataxia-telangiectasia, chose oocyte donation for their third child, ensuring a healthy birth. Recurrent pregnancy loss was observed in a mother subsequently diagnosed with ZAP70 deficiency. A mother with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome child opted for in vitro fertilization, leading to a healthy birth post-prenatal diagnosis. A misdiagnosis of anaplastic anemia occurred in a family with multiple instances of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. A leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 case led to parental dissolution due to the father's refusal to acknowledge the condition. In a non-consanguineous couple, the father's diagnosis of TACI deficiency influenced the mother's decision to discontinue pregnancy post-prenatal diagnosis. Genetic diagnosis alone cannot optimize prenatal care for immune dysregulation disorders. Various factors, including patient education, societal norms, ethics, and economics, impact pregnancy decisions. Clinical immunologists must integrate these elements into guidance strategies to enhance patient outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant malignancy with elusive mechanism of pathogenesis and dismal prognosis. Over the past decades, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the backbone treatment for SCLC. However, subsequent chemoresistance after initial effectiveness urges researchers to explore novel therapeutic targets of SCLC. Recent years have witnessed significant improvements in targeted therapy in SCLC. New molecular candidates such as Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related protein (ATR), WEE1, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) have shown promising therapeutic utility in SCLC. While immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has emerged as an indispensable treatment modality for SCLC, approaches to boost efficacy and reduce toxicity as well as selection of reliable biomarkers for ICI in SCLC have remained elusive and warrants our further investigation. Given the increasing importance of precision medicine in SCLC, optimal subtyping of SCLC using multi-omics have gradually applied into clinical practice, which may identify more drug targets and better tailor treatment strategies to each individual patient. The present review summarizes recent progress and future directions in SCLC. In addition to the emerging new therapeutics, we also focus on the establishment of predictive model for early detection of SCLC. More importantly, we also propose a multi-dimensional model in the prognosis of SCLC to ultimately attain the goal of accurate treatment of SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "PARP inhibitor monotherapy (olaparib) was recently FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutant, homologous recombination (HR) repair-deficient pancreatic cancer. Most pancreatic cancers, however, are HR proficient and thus resistant to PARP inhibitor monotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that combined therapy with radiation and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (AZD6738) would extend the therapeutic indication of olaparib to HR-proficient pancreatic cancers. We show that olaparib combined with AZD6738 significantly reduced radiation survival relative to either agent alone, regardless of HR status. Whereas catalytic inhibition of PARP with low concentrations of olaparib radiosensitized HR-deficient models, maximal sensitization in HR-proficient models required concentrations of olaparib that induce formation of PARP1-DNA complexes. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated PARP1 deletion failed to recapitulate the effects of olaparib on radiosensitivity and negated the combinatorial efficacy of olaparib and AZD6738 on radiosensitization, suggesting that PARP1-DNA complexes, rather than PARP catalytic inhibition, were responsible for radiosensitization. Mechanistically, therapeutic concentrations of olaparib in combination with radiation and AZD6738 increased DNA double-strand breaks. DNA fiber combing revealed that high concentrations of olaparib did not stall replication forks but instead accelerated replication fork progression in association with an ATR-mediated replication stress response that was antagonized by AZD6738. Finally, in HR-proficient tumor xenografts, the combination of olaparib, radiation, and AZD6738 significantly delayed tumor growth compared with all other treatments. These findings suggest that PARP1-DNA complexes are required for the therapeutic activity of olaparib combined with radiation and ATR inhibitor in HR-proficient pancreatic cancer and support the clinical development of this combination for tumors intrinsically resistant to PARP inhibitors.",

Although recent advancements in immunotherapy have enhanced the response rates of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of acquired resistance invariably leads to recurrence and metastasis. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to explore novel therapeutic targets and optimize existing treatment strategies. This article comprehensively reviews the currently available therapeutic modalities for SCLC. It delves into the immunologic prognostic implications by analyzing selected immune-related signatures. Moreover, it conducts an in-depth exploration of the molecular subtyping of SCLC and the associated molecular pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, the focus is on clinical interventions targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), elucidating its resistance mechanisms and demonstrating its notable antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, the study examines the mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), covering resistance issues and strategies for optimizing resistance management, with particular emphasis being placed on analyzing the prospects and clinical value of CAR T therapy in the context of SCLC. Moreover, the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3/checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors is discussed and underscores the advantages of combining these inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to combat chemoresistance and enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapies. Overall, this study investigates emerging strategies for targeted therapies and optimized combination regimens to overcome resistance in SCLC and highlights future strategies for new therapeutic technologies for SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by injury to the ocular surface due to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV-induced damage in the cells leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts that are repaired by the NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair) pathway. Mutations in the genes coding for NER proteins, as reported in XP patients, would lead to sub-optimal damage repair resulting in clinical signs varying from photo-keratitis to cancerous lesions on the ocular surface. Here, we aimed to provide evidence for the accumulation of DNA damage and activation of DNA repair pathway proteins in the corneal cells of patients with XP. Corneal buttons of patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty were stained to quantify DNA damage and the presence of activated DNA damage response proteins (DDR) using specific antibodies. Positive staining for pH2A.X and thymidine dimers confirmed the presence of DNA damage in the corneal cells. Positive cells were found in both control corneas and XP samples however, unlike normal tissues, positive cells were found in all cell layers of XP samples indicating that these cells were sensitive to very low levels of UV. pH2A.X-positive cells were significantly more in XP corneas(p<0.05) indicating the presence of double strand breaks in these tissues. A positive expression of phosphorylated-forms of DDR proteins was noted in XP corneas (unlike controls) such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated/Rad-3 related proteins (ATM/ATR), breast cancer-1 and checkpoint kinases-1 and -2. Nuclear localization of XPA was noted in XP samples which co-localized (calculated using Pearson's correlation) with pATM (0.9+-0.007) and pATR (0.6+-0.053). The increased presence of these in the nucleus confirms that unresolved DNA damage was accumulating in these cells thereby leading to prolonged activation of the damage response proteins. An increase in pp53 and TUNEL positive cells in the XP corneas indicated cell death likely driven by the p53 pathway. For comparison, cultured normal corneal epithelial cells were exposed to UV-radiation and stained for DDR proteins at 3, 6 and 24 hours after irradiation to quantify the time taken by cells with intact DDR pathway to repair damage. These cells, when exposed to UV showed nuclear translocation of DDR proteins at 3 and 6 hours which reduced significantly by 24 hours confirming that the damaged DNA was being actively repaired leading to cell survival. The persistent presence of the DDR proteins in XP corneas indicates that damage is being actively recognized and DNA replication is stalled, thereby causing accumulation of damaged DNA leading to cell death, which would explain the cancer incidence and cell loss reported in these patients.",

Poor response to treatment, excessive chemotherapy toxicities, and the need for avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation make the successful clinical management of patients with AT challenging for oncologists. We describe the favorable outcome of the LBCL with IRF4 rearrangement at stage III in a 7-year-old female patient diagnosed with AT. The patient was treated according to the B-HR arm of the INTER-B-NHL-COP 2010 protocol, including the administration of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, etc. She presented excessive treatment toxicities despite individually reduced doses of methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. However, in the MRI there was no significant reduction in pathologic lymph nodes after three immunochemotherapy courses. Therefore, a lymph node biopsy was taken. Its subsequent histopathological examination revealed tuberculosis-like changes, though tuberculosis suspicion was excluded. After two following immunochemotherapy courses, PET-CT confirmed complete remission. From March 2022 onwards, the patient has remained in remission under the care of the outpatient children's oncology clinic.",

We assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of berzosertib plus cisplatin. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced solid tumours refractory or resistant to standard of care therapies received ascending doses of cisplatin (day 1) and berzosertib (days 2 and 9) every 3 weeks (Q3W). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received berzosertib (90-210 mg/m2) and cisplatin (40-75 mg/m2) across seven dose levels. The most common grade >=3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (20.0%) and anaemia (16.7%). There were two dose-limiting toxicities: a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction and a grade 3 increase in alanine aminotransferase. Berzosertib 140 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) Q3W was determined as the recommended Phase 2 dose. Cisplatin had no apparent effect on berzosertib pharmacokinetics. Of the 31 patients, four achieved a partial response (two confirmed and two unconfirmed) despite having previously experienced disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus cisplatin is well tolerated and shows preliminary clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumours, warranting further evaluation in a Phase 2 setting.

                    "abstract": "Proton Bragg peak irradiation has a higher ionizing density than conventional photon irradiation or the entrance of the proton beam profile. Whether targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) could enhance vulnerability to the distinct pattern of damage induced by proton Bragg peak irradiation is currently unknown. Here, we performed genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of key DDR elements and evaluated DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and tumor control in cell lines and xenografts treated with the same physical dose across a radiotherapy linear energy transfer spectrum. Radiotherapy consisted of 6 MV photons and the entrance beam or Bragg peak of a 76.8 MeV spot scanning proton beam. More complex DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced by Bragg peak proton irradiation preferentially underwent resection and engaged homologous recombination (HR) machinery. Unexpectedly, the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor, AZD0156, but not an inhibitor of ATM and Rad3-related, rendered cells hypersensitive to more densely ionizing proton Bragg peak irradiation. ATM inhibition blocked resection and shunted more DSBs to processing by toxic ligation through nonhomologous end-joining, whereas loss of DNA ligation via XRCC4 or Lig4 knockdown rescued resection and abolished the enhanced Bragg peak cell killing. Proton Bragg peak monotherapy selectively sensitized cell lines and tumor xenografts with inherent HR defects, and the repair defect induced by ATM inhibitor coadministration showed enhanced efficacy in HR-proficient models. In summary, inherent defects in HR or administration of an ATM inhibitor in HR-proficient tumors selectively enhances the relative biological effectiveness of proton Bragg peak irradiation. SIGNIFICANCE: Coadministration of an ATM inhibitor rewires DNA repair machinery to render cancer cells uniquely hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by the proton Bragg peak, which is characterized by higher density ionization.See related commentary by Nickoloff, p. 3156.",

Ceralasertib (AZD6738) is an oral kinase inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein, which is a master regulator of DDR. We conducted a phase II trial of ceralasertib plus durvalumab in patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer (AGC) to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the combination. METHODS: This phase II, open-label, single-center, non-randomized study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ceralasertib in combination with durvalumab in patients with AGC. The study drug regimen was ceralasertib (240 mg two times a day) days 15-28 in a 28-day cycle in combination with durvalumab (1500 mg) at day 1 every 4 weeks. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (V.1.1). Exploratory biomarker analysis was performed using fresh tumor biopsies in all enrolled patients. RESULTS: Among 31 patients, the ORR, disease control rate, median progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were 22.6% (95% CI 9.6% to 41.1%), 58.1% (95% CI 39.1% to 75.5%), 3.0 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.9) months, and 6.7 (95% CI 3.8 to 9.6) months, respectively. Common adverse events were manageable with dose modification. A subgroup of patients with a loss of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) expression and/or high proportion of mutational signature attributable to homologous repair deficiency (sig. HRD) demonstrated a significantly longer PFS than those with intact ATM and low sig. HRD (5.60 vs 1.65 months; HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.045 to 0.39; long-rank p<0.001). During the study treatment, upregulation of the innate immune response by cytosolic DNA, activation of intratumoral lymphocytes, and expansion of circulating tumor-reactive CD8 +T cell clones were identified in responders. Enrichment of the tumor vasculature signature was associated with treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Ceralasertib plus durvalumab has promising antitumor activity, with durable responses in patients with refractory AGC. Thus, a biomarker-driven trial is required.

We developed a predictive taxonomy to assess the amenability of each individual to splice-switching ASO intervention; 9% and 6% of the individuals had variants that were 'probably' or 'possibly' amenable to ASO splice modulation, respectively. Most amenable variants were in deep intronic regions that are inaccessible to exon-targeted sequencing. We developed ASOs that successfully rescued mis-splicing and ATM cellular signalling in patient fibroblasts for two recurrent variants. In a pilot clinical study, one of these ASOs was used to treat a child who had been diagnosed with ataxia-telangiectasia soon after birth, and showed good tolerability without serious adverse events for three years. Our study provides a framework for the prospective identification of individuals with genetic diseases who might benefit from a therapeutic approach involving splice-switching ASOs.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein complex is an apical initiator of DNA damage response pathways. Several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) are in clinical development including berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970). Although clinical studies have examined plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans, little is known regarding dose/exposure relationships and tissue distribution. To understand these concepts, we extensively characterized the PK of berzosertib in mouse plasma and tissues. METHODS: A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method was utilized to quantitate berzosertib in plasma and tissues. Dose proportionality was assessed in female BALB/c mice following single IV doses (2, 6, 20 or 60 mg/kg). A more extensive PK study was conducted in tumor-bearing mice following a single IV dose of 20 mg/kg to evaluate distribution to tissues. PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA). A compartmental model was developed to describe the PK behavior of berzosertib. Plasma protein binding was determined in vitro. RESULTS: Increased doses of berzosertib were associated with less than proportional increases in early plasma concentrations and greater than proportional increase in tissue exposure, attributable to saturation of plasma protein binding. Berzosertib extensively distributed into bone marrow, tumor, thymus, and lymph nodes, however; brain and spinal cord exposure was less than plasma. CONCLUSION: The nonlinear PK of berzosertib displayed here can be attributed to saturation of plasma protein binding and occurred at concentrations close to those observed in clinical trials. Our results will help to understand preclinical pharmacodynamic and toxicity data and to inform optimal dosing and deployment of berzosertib.",

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant malignancy with elusive mechanism of pathogenesis and dismal prognosis. Over the past decades, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the backbone treatment for SCLC. However, subsequent chemoresistance after initial effectiveness urges researchers to explore novel therapeutic targets of SCLC. Recent years have witnessed significant improvements in targeted therapy in SCLC. New molecular candidates such as Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related protein (ATR), WEE1, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) have shown promising therapeutic utility in SCLC. While immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has emerged as an indispensable treatment modality for SCLC, approaches to boost efficacy and reduce toxicity as well as selection of reliable biomarkers for ICI in SCLC have remained elusive and warrants our further investigation. Given the increasing importance of precision medicine in SCLC, optimal subtyping of SCLC using multi-omics have gradually applied into clinical practice, which may identify more drug targets and better tailor treatment strategies to each individual patient. The present review summarizes recent progress and future directions in SCLC. In addition to the emerging new therapeutics, we also focus on the establishment of predictive model for early detection of SCLC. More importantly, we also propose a multi-dimensional model in the prognosis of SCLC to ultimately attain the goal of accurate treatment of SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Berzosertib (formerly M6620) is the first-in-class inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, a key component of the DNA damage response, and being developed in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cancers. The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of berzosertib across multiple studies and parts, estimate inter-individual variability, and identify covariates that could explain such variability. METHODS: A population PK analysis was performed using the combined dataset from two phase I clinical studies (NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34) in patients with advanced cancers receiving an intravenous infusion of berzosertib alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The analysis included data from 240 patients across 11 dose levels (18-480 mg/m2). Plasma concentration data were modeled with a non-linear mixed-effect approach and clinical covariates were evaluated. RESULTS: PK data were best described by a two-compartment linear model. For a typical patient, the estimated clearance (CL) and intercompartmental CL were 65 L/h and 295 L/h, respectively, with central and peripheral volumes estimated to be 118 L and 1030 L, respectively. Several intrinsic factors were found to influence berzosertib PK, but none were considered clinically meaningful due to a very limited effect. Model simulations indicated that concentrations of berzosertib exceeded p-Chk1 (proximal pharmacodynamic biomarker) IC50 at recommended phase II doses in combination with carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a clinically significant PK interaction between berzosertib and evaluated chemo-combinations. The covariate analysis did not highlight any need for dosing adjustments in the population studied to date. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34.",

                    "abstract": "The poor prognosis for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the dominant subtype of ovarian cancer, reflects its aggressive nature, late diagnosis, and the highest mortality rate among all gynaecologic cancers. Apart from late diagnosis, the main reason for the poor prognosis and its unsuccessful treatment is primarily the emergence of chemoresistance to carboplatin. Although there is a good response to primary treatment, the disease recurs in 80% of cases, at which point it is largely resistant to carboplatin. The introduction of novel targeted therapies in the second decade of the 21st century has begun to transform the treatment of HGSOC, although their impact on overall survival remains unsatisfactory. Targeting the specific pathways known to be abnormally activated in HGSOC is especially difficult due to the molecular diversity of its subtypes. Moreover, a range of molecular changes are associated with acquired chemoresistance, e.g., reversion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline alleles. In this review, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of approved targeted therapies, including bevacizumab, PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and treatments targeting cells with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene alterations, as well as antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, we explore promising new targets under investigation in ongoing clinical trials, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, Wee1 kinase inhibitors, and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors for platinum-resistant disease. Despite the development of new targeted therapies, carboplatin remains the fundamental medicine in HGSOC therapy. The correct choice of treatment strategy for better survival of patients with advanced HGSOC should therefore include a prediction of patients' risks of developing chemoresistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effective targeted therapy requires the selection of patients who are likely to derive clinical benefit while minimizing potential adverse effects, underscoring the essence of precision medicine.",

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant malignancy with elusive mechanism of pathogenesis and dismal prognosis. Over the past decades, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the backbone treatment for SCLC. However, subsequent chemoresistance after initial effectiveness urges researchers to explore novel therapeutic targets of SCLC. Recent years have witnessed significant improvements in targeted therapy in SCLC. New molecular candidates such as Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related protein (ATR), WEE1, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) have shown promising therapeutic utility in SCLC. While immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has emerged as an indispensable treatment modality for SCLC, approaches to boost efficacy and reduce toxicity as well as selection of reliable biomarkers for ICI in SCLC have remained elusive and warrants our further investigation. Given the increasing importance of precision medicine in SCLC, optimal subtyping of SCLC using multi-omics have gradually applied into clinical practice, which may identify more drug targets and better tailor treatment strategies to each individual patient. The present review summarizes recent progress and future directions in SCLC. In addition to the emerging new therapeutics, we also focus on the establishment of predictive model for early detection of SCLC. More importantly, we also propose a multi-dimensional model in the prognosis of SCLC to ultimately attain the goal of accurate treatment of SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by injury to the ocular surface due to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV-induced damage in the cells leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts that are repaired by the NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair) pathway. Mutations in the genes coding for NER proteins, as reported in XP patients, would lead to sub-optimal damage repair resulting in clinical signs varying from photo-keratitis to cancerous lesions on the ocular surface. Here, we aimed to provide evidence for the accumulation of DNA damage and activation of DNA repair pathway proteins in the corneal cells of patients with XP. Corneal buttons of patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty were stained to quantify DNA damage and the presence of activated DNA damage response proteins (DDR) using specific antibodies. Positive staining for pH2A.X and thymidine dimers confirmed the presence of DNA damage in the corneal cells. Positive cells were found in both control corneas and XP samples however, unlike normal tissues, positive cells were found in all cell layers of XP samples indicating that these cells were sensitive to very low levels of UV. pH2A.X-positive cells were significantly more in XP corneas(p<0.05) indicating the presence of double strand breaks in these tissues. A positive expression of phosphorylated-forms of DDR proteins was noted in XP corneas (unlike controls) such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated/Rad-3 related proteins (ATM/ATR), breast cancer-1 and checkpoint kinases-1 and -2. Nuclear localization of XPA was noted in XP samples which co-localized (calculated using Pearson's correlation) with pATM (0.9+-0.007) and pATR (0.6+-0.053). The increased presence of these in the nucleus confirms that unresolved DNA damage was accumulating in these cells thereby leading to prolonged activation of the damage response proteins. An increase in pp53 and TUNEL positive cells in the XP corneas indicated cell death likely driven by the p53 pathway. For comparison, cultured normal corneal epithelial cells were exposed to UV-radiation and stained for DDR proteins at 3, 6 and 24 hours after irradiation to quantify the time taken by cells with intact DDR pathway to repair damage. These cells, when exposed to UV showed nuclear translocation of DDR proteins at 3 and 6 hours which reduced significantly by 24 hours confirming that the damaged DNA was being actively repaired leading to cell survival. The persistent presence of the DDR proteins in XP corneas indicates that damage is being actively recognized and DNA replication is stalled, thereby causing accumulation of damaged DNA leading to cell death, which would explain the cancer incidence and cell loss reported in these patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To increase the chances of finding efficacious anticancer drugs, improve development times and reduce costs, it is of interest to rank test compounds based on their potential for human use as early as possible in the drug development process. In this paper, we present a method for ranking radiosensitizers using preclinical data. METHODS: We used data from three xenograft mice studies to calibrate a model that accounts for radiation treatment combined with radiosensitizers. A nonlinear mixed effects approach was utilized where between-subject variability and inter-study variability were considered. Using the calibrated model, we ranked three different Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated inhibitors in terms of anticancer activity. The ranking was based on the Tumor Static Exposure (TSE) concept and primarily illustrated through TSE-curves. RESULTS: The model described data well and the predicted number of eradicated tumors was in good agreement with experimental data. The efficacy of the radiosensitizers was evaluated for the median individual and the 95% population percentile. Simulations predicted that a total dose of 220 Gy (5 radiation sessions a week for 6 weeks) was required for 95% of tumors to be eradicated when radiation was given alone. When radiation was combined with doses that achieved at least 8 [Formula: see text] of each radiosensitizer in mouse blood, it was predicted that the radiation dose could be decreased to 50, 65, and 100 Gy, respectively, while maintaining 95% eradication. CONCLUSIONS: A simulation-based method for calculating TSE-curves was developed, which provides more accurate predictions of tumor eradication than earlier, analytically derived, TSE-curves. The tool we present can potentially be used for radiosensitizer selection before proceeding to subsequent phases of the drug discovery and development process.",

Poor response to treatment, excessive chemotherapy toxicities, and the need for avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation make the successful clinical management of patients with AT challenging for oncologists. We describe the favorable outcome of the LBCL with IRF4 rearrangement at stage III in a 7-year-old female patient diagnosed with AT. The patient was treated according to the B-HR arm of the INTER-B-NHL-COP 2010 protocol, including the administration of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, etc. She presented excessive treatment toxicities despite individually reduced doses of methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. However, in the MRI there was no significant reduction in pathologic lymph nodes after three immunochemotherapy courses. Therefore, a lymph node biopsy was taken. Its subsequent histopathological examination revealed tuberculosis-like changes, though tuberculosis suspicion was excluded. After two following immunochemotherapy courses, PET-CT confirmed complete remission. From March 2022 onwards, the patient has remained in remission under the care of the outpatient children's oncology clinic.",

                    "abstract": "With the advent of precision genomics, hereditary predisposition to hematopoietic neoplasms- collectively known as hereditary predisposition syndromes (HPS)-are being increasingly recognized in clinical practice. Familial clustering was first observed in patients with leukemia, which led to the identification of several germline variants, such as RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, DDX41, and ETV6, among others, now established as HPS, with tendency to develop myeloid neoplasms. However, evidence for hereditary predisposition is also apparent in lymphoid and plasma--cell neoplasms, with recent discoveries of germline variants in genes such as IKZF1, SH2B3, PAX5 (familial acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and KDM1A/LSD1 (familial multiple myeloma). Specific inherited bone marrow failure syndromes-such as GATA2 haploinsufficiency syndromes, short telomere syndromes, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, and familial thrombocytopenias-also have an increased predisposition to develop myeloid neoplasms, whereas inherited immune deficiency syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, and Bruton agammaglobulinemia, are associated with an increased risk for lymphoid neoplasms. Timely recognition of HPS is critical to ensure safe choice of donors and/or conditioning-regimen intensity for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and to enable direction of appropriate genomics-driven personalized therapies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of HPS and serve as a useful reference for clinicians to recognize relevant signs and symptoms among patients to enable timely screening and referrals to pursue germline assessment. In addition, we also discuss our institutional approach toward identification of HPS and offer a stepwise diagnostic and management algorithm.",

I examine the clinical implications of ATM alterations, including their impact on cancer predisposition, prognosis, and treatment response. The review highlights recent advances in ATM-targeted therapies, discussing ongoing clinical trials of ATM inhibitors and their potential in combination with other treatment modalities. I also address the challenges in developing effective biomarkers for ATM activity and patient selection strategies for personalized cancer therapy.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The treatment of advanced metastatic CRC relies on classical chemotherapy combinations (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin or irinotecan). However, their use is limited by the emergence of resistance mechanisms, including to oxaliplatin. In this context, we recently showed that the combination of oxaliplatin and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein inhibition (VE-822) is synergistic and may have a potential therapeutic effect in metastatic CRC management. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the role of the VE-822+oxaliplatin (Vox) combination on the immune response and its potential synergy with an anti-programmed-cell Death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody. We used cell lines and organoids from metastatic CRC to investigate in vitro Vox efficacy and orthotopic syngeneic mouse models of metastatic CRC to assess the efficacy of Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody and identify the involved immune cells. RESULTS: The Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination completely cured tumor-bearing mice and protected them from a rechallenge. Vox was associated with a reduction of tumor-infiltrated neutrophils, CD206+ macrophages and regulatory T cells. Vox also induced a deep depletion of blood neutrophils. The increased bone marrow granulopoiesis failed to compensate for the Vox-mediated mature neutrophil depletion. Neutrophil depletion using a mouse recombinant anti-Ly6G antibody partially mimicked the Vox effect on the tumor microenvironment, but to a lower extent compared with the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination. Vox, but not neutrophil depletion, led to the emergence of an Ly6C+ PD-1+ CD8+ T-cell population in the blood and spleen of tumor-harboring mice. These cells were proliferating, and expressed IFN-gamma, CD62L, CXCR3 and Eomes. Moreover, the proportion of tumor antigen-specific T cells and of CD122+ BCL6+ T cells, which shared phenotypic characteristics with stem-like CD8+ T cells, was increased in treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our work strongly suggests that the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination might significantly improve survival in patients with metastatic and treatment-refractory CRC by acting both on cancer cells and CD8+ T cells.",

We investigated chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells using primary T-cells from patients with A-T (ATM-/-), heterozygote donors (ATM+/-) and healthy donors. ATM-/- T-cells proliferate and can be successfully transduced with CARs, though functional impairment of ATM-/- CAR-T cells was observed. Retroviral transduction of the CAR in ATM-/- T-cells resulted in high rates of chromosomal lesions at CAR insertion sites, as confirmed by next-generation long-read sequencing. This work suggests that ATM is essential to preserve genome integrity of CAR-T cells during retroviral manufacturing, and its lack poses a risk of chromosomal translocations and potential leukemogenicity.",

We report the case of a woman who had AT in childhood and developed breast cancer in her 20s; the disease was successfully managed by the decision-making of multidisciplinary physicians professionals with ethics support. She was immunocompromised, ataxic, and mentally impaired. The patient's mother noticed a tumor in her right breast and subsequently brought her to our department. Although preoperative testing and surgical procedures were limited as AT is extremely radiosensitive, the patient was diagnosed with cT2N0M0 breast cancer and underwent right mastectomy and axillary lymph node sampling. The final diagnosis was pT2N0M0 pStage IIA mucinous carcinoma, and immunohistochemistry of the tumor specimen was estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and HER2-negative. Tamoxifen was administered as postoperative adjuvant therapy, and the patient has survived to date without recurrence.

Although deficient DNA double-strand break repair is considered the main basis for the reactions, pretreatment identification of high-risk patients has been challenging. METHODS: To retrospectively determine the etiology of severe local reaction to RT in a 39-year-old woman with BC, we performed next-generation sequencing followed by further clinical and functional studies. RESULTS: We found a -4 intronic variant (c.2251-4A>G) in trans with a synonymous (c.3576G>A) variant affecting the ATM DNA-repair gene (NG_009830.1, NM_000051.3) which is linked to autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We verified abnormal transcripts resulting from both variants, next to a minor wild-type transcript leading to a residual ATM kinase activity and genomic instability. Follow-up examination of the patient revealed no classic sign of A-T but previously unnoticed head dystonia and mild dysarthria, a family history of BC and late-onset ataxia segregating with the variants. Additionally, her serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated similar to A-T patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the variable presentations of A-T and devastating impact of severe reactions to RT, we suggest a routine measurement of AFP in RT-candidate BC patients followed by next-generation sequencing with special attention to non-canonical splice site and synonymous variants in ATM.",

We assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of berzosertib plus cisplatin. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced solid tumours refractory or resistant to standard of care therapies received ascending doses of cisplatin (day 1) and berzosertib (days 2 and 9) every 3 weeks (Q3W). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received berzosertib (90-210 mg/m2) and cisplatin (40-75 mg/m2) across seven dose levels. The most common grade >=3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (20.0%) and anaemia (16.7%). There were two dose-limiting toxicities: a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction and a grade 3 increase in alanine aminotransferase. Berzosertib 140 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) Q3W was determined as the recommended Phase 2 dose. Cisplatin had no apparent effect on berzosertib pharmacokinetics. Of the 31 patients, four achieved a partial response (two confirmed and two unconfirmed) despite having previously experienced disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus cisplatin is well tolerated and shows preliminary clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumours, warranting further evaluation in a Phase 2 setting.

                    "abstract": "The poor prognosis for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the dominant subtype of ovarian cancer, reflects its aggressive nature, late diagnosis, and the highest mortality rate among all gynaecologic cancers. Apart from late diagnosis, the main reason for the poor prognosis and its unsuccessful treatment is primarily the emergence of chemoresistance to carboplatin. Although there is a good response to primary treatment, the disease recurs in 80% of cases, at which point it is largely resistant to carboplatin. The introduction of novel targeted therapies in the second decade of the 21st century has begun to transform the treatment of HGSOC, although their impact on overall survival remains unsatisfactory. Targeting the specific pathways known to be abnormally activated in HGSOC is especially difficult due to the molecular diversity of its subtypes. Moreover, a range of molecular changes are associated with acquired chemoresistance, e.g., reversion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline alleles. In this review, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of approved targeted therapies, including bevacizumab, PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and treatments targeting cells with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene alterations, as well as antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, we explore promising new targets under investigation in ongoing clinical trials, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, Wee1 kinase inhibitors, and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors for platinum-resistant disease. Despite the development of new targeted therapies, carboplatin remains the fundamental medicine in HGSOC therapy. The correct choice of treatment strategy for better survival of patients with advanced HGSOC should therefore include a prediction of patients' risks of developing chemoresistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effective targeted therapy requires the selection of patients who are likely to derive clinical benefit while minimizing potential adverse effects, underscoring the essence of precision medicine.",

                    "abstract": "Because of the lack of specific molecular targeted therapies, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has high tumour recurrence and metastasis rates. It is urgent to develop novel chemotherapeutic strategies to improve patient survival. DNA damaging agents have been shown to sensitize cancer to genotoxic chemotherapies. We first found that 6-thioguanine (6-TG) can activate the NF-kB signalling pathway. Our results showed that NF-kB signalling was reduced when cells were treated with 6-TG/disulfiram (DSF)/Cu. DSF/Cu enhanced the 6-TG-mediated inhibition of proliferation. 6-TG/DSF/Cu inhibited cell cycle progression, causing cell cycle arrest in the S phase and G2/M phase. Moreover, the combined effect of 6-TG and DSF/Cu induced apoptosis, and either agent alone was able to induce apoptosis. The accumulation of gammaH2A indicated that DSF/Cu increased the DNA damage induced by 6-TG. Combined treatment with 6-TG and DSF/Cu synergistically reduced the levels of both phosphorylated and total ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related kinase (ATR), suggesting that DSF/Cu promoted 6-TG-induced DNA damage by suppressing ATR protein kinases, therefore enhancing cell apoptosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the combination of 6-TG and DSF/Cu exerted a significant synergistic antitumour effect on human TNBC in vitro and in vivo by enhancing DNA damage and disrupting DNA damage checkpoints. We propose that this combination therapy could be a novel strategy for the treatment of TNBC.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) demonstrates durable clinical benefits in a minority of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We aimed to identify the molecular features that determine the response and develop approaches to enhance the response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the effects of SET domain-containing protein 2 (SEDT2) loss on the DNA damage response pathway, the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the tumor immune microenvironment, and the response to Ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR) and checkpoint inhibition in RCC. RESULTS: ATR inhibition activated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, resulting in the concurrent expression of inflammatory cytokines and immune checkpoints. Among the common RCC genotypes, SETD2 loss is associated with preferential ATR activation and sensitizes cells to ATR inhibition. SETD2 knockdown promoted the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway in response to ATR inhibition. Treatment with the ATR inhibitor VE822 concurrently upregulated immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression in Setd2 knockdown Renca tumors, providing a rationale for ATR inhibition plus ICB combination therapy. Setd2 deficient Renca tumors demonstrated greater vulnerability to ICB monotherapy or combination therapy with VE822 than Setd2 proficient tumors. Moreover, SETD2 mutations were associated with a higher response rate and prolonged overall survival in ICB-treated RCC patients but not in non-ICB-treated RCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: SETD2 loss and ATR inhibition synergize to promote cGAS signaling and enhance immune cell infiltration, providing a mechanistic rationale for the combination of ATR and checkpoint inhibition in RCC patients with SETD2 mutations.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is one of the most common treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the insensitivity of some tumor cells to radiation is one of the major reasons for the poor efficacy of radiotherapy and the poor prognosis of patients, and exploring the underlying mechanisms behind radioresistance is the key to solving this clinical challenge. This study aimed to identify the molecules associated with radioresistance in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), identified thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13 (TRIP13) as the main target initially, and explored whether TRIP13 is related to radioresistance in LUAD and the specific mechanism, with the aim of providing theoretical basis and potential targets for the combination therapy of LUAD patients receiving radiotherapy in the clinic. METHODS: Three datasets, GSE18842, GSE19188 and GSE33532, were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and screened for differentially expressed genes ( log FC >1.5, P<0.05) in each of the three datasets using the R 4.1.3 software, and then Venn diagram was used to find out the differentially expressed genes common to the three datasets. The screened differential genes were then subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and module analysis with the help of STRING online tool and Cytoscape software, and survival prognosis analysis was performed for each gene with the help of Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, and the TRIP13 gene was identified as the main molecule for subsequent studies. Subsequently, the human LUAD cell line H292 was irradiated with multiple X-rays using a sub-lethal dose irradiation method to construct a radioresistant cell line, H292DR. The radioresistance of H292DR cells was verified using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and clone formation assay. The expression levels of TRIP13 in H292 and H292DR cells were measured by Western blot. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence the expression of TRIP13 in H292DR cells and Western blot assay was performed. The clone formation ability and migration ability of H292DR cells were observed after TRIP13 silencing, followed by the detection of changes in the expression levels of proteins closely related to homologous recombination, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein. RESULTS: Screening of multiple GEO datasets, validation of external datasets and survival analysis revealed that TRIP13 was highly expressed in LUAD and was associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients who had received radiation therapy. And the results of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of TRIP13 suggested that TRIP13 might be closely associated with LUAD radioresistance by promoting homologous recombination repair after radiation therapy. Experimentally, TRIP13 expression was found to be upregulated in H292DR, and silencing of TRIP13 was able to increase the sensitivity of H292DR cells to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: TRIP13 is associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients treated with radiation, possibly by promoting a homologous recombination repair pathway to mediate resistance of LUAD cells to radiation.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To increase the chances of finding efficacious anticancer drugs, improve development times and reduce costs, it is of interest to rank test compounds based on their potential for human use as early as possible in the drug development process. In this paper, we present a method for ranking radiosensitizers using preclinical data. METHODS: We used data from three xenograft mice studies to calibrate a model that accounts for radiation treatment combined with radiosensitizers. A nonlinear mixed effects approach was utilized where between-subject variability and inter-study variability were considered. Using the calibrated model, we ranked three different Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated inhibitors in terms of anticancer activity. The ranking was based on the Tumor Static Exposure (TSE) concept and primarily illustrated through TSE-curves. RESULTS: The model described data well and the predicted number of eradicated tumors was in good agreement with experimental data. The efficacy of the radiosensitizers was evaluated for the median individual and the 95% population percentile. Simulations predicted that a total dose of 220 Gy (5 radiation sessions a week for 6 weeks) was required for 95% of tumors to be eradicated when radiation was given alone. When radiation was combined with doses that achieved at least 8 [Formula: see text] of each radiosensitizer in mouse blood, it was predicted that the radiation dose could be decreased to 50, 65, and 100 Gy, respectively, while maintaining 95% eradication. CONCLUSIONS: A simulation-based method for calculating TSE-curves was developed, which provides more accurate predictions of tumor eradication than earlier, analytically derived, TSE-curves. The tool we present can potentially be used for radiosensitizer selection before proceeding to subsequent phases of the drug discovery and development process.",

Besides the classical ataxia-telangiectasia (classical A-T) phenotype, a variant phenotype (variant A-T) exists with partly overlapping but some distinctive disease characteristics. Here we present a case series of 6 patients with classical A-T and variant A-T, which illustrates the phenotypic variability of A-T that can present in childhood with prominent extrapyramidal features, with or without cerebellar ataxia. We report the clinical data, together with a detailed genotype description, immunological analyses, and related expression of the ATM protein. We show that the presence of some residual ATM kinase activity leads to the clinical phenotype variant A-T that differs from the classical A-T. Our data illustrate that the diagnosis of the variant form of A-T can be delayed and difficult, while early recognition of the variant form as well as the classical A-T is a prerequisite for providing a correct prognosis and appropriate rehabilitation and support, including the avoidance of diagnostic X-ray procedures, given the increased risk of malignancies and the higher risk for side effects of subsequent cancer treatment.",

AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the currently approved and most promising candidate pharmacotherapies in relation to the known disease mechanisms of the most prevalent autosomal recessive ataxias. Omaveloxolone is an Nrf2 activator that increases antioxidant defense and was recently approved for treatment of Friedreich ataxia. Its therapeutic effect is modest, and further research is needed to find synergistic treatments that would halt or reverse disease progression. Promising approaches include upregulation of frataxin expression by epigenetic mechanisms, direct protein replacement, and gene replacement therapy. For ataxia-telangiectasia, promising approaches include splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Rare recessive ataxias for which disease-modifying therapies exist are also reviewed, emphasizing recently approved therapies. Evidence supporting the use of riluzole and acetyl-leucine in recessive ataxias is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Advances in genetic therapies for other neurogenetic conditions have paved the way to implement feasible approaches with potential dramatic benefits. Particularly, as we develop effective treatments for these conditions, we may need to combine therapies, consider newborn testing for pre-symptomatic treatment, and optimize non-pharmacological approaches.",

Here we performed whole-genome sequencing analyses to characterize genetic variation in 235 individuals (from 209 families) with ataxia-telangiectasia, a severely debilitating and life-threatening recessive genetic disorder2,3, yielding a complete molecular diagnosis in almost all individuals. We developed a predictive taxonomy to assess the amenability of each individual to splice-switching ASO intervention; 9% and 6% of the individuals had variants that were 'probably' or 'possibly' amenable to ASO splice modulation, respectively. Most amenable variants were in deep intronic regions that are inaccessible to exon-targeted sequencing. We developed ASOs that successfully rescued mis-splicing and ATM cellular signalling in patient fibroblasts for two recurrent variants. In a pilot clinical study, one of these ASOs was used to treat a child who had been diagnosed with ataxia-telangiectasia soon after birth, and showed good tolerability without serious adverse events for three years. Our study provides a framework for the prospective identification of individuals with genetic diseases who might benefit from a therapeutic approach involving splice-switching ASOs.",

                    "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by injury to the ocular surface due to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV-induced damage in the cells leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts that are repaired by the NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair) pathway. Mutations in the genes coding for NER proteins, as reported in XP patients, would lead to sub-optimal damage repair resulting in clinical signs varying from photo-keratitis to cancerous lesions on the ocular surface. Here, we aimed to provide evidence for the accumulation of DNA damage and activation of DNA repair pathway proteins in the corneal cells of patients with XP. Corneal buttons of patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty were stained to quantify DNA damage and the presence of activated DNA damage response proteins (DDR) using specific antibodies. Positive staining for pH2A.X and thymidine dimers confirmed the presence of DNA damage in the corneal cells. Positive cells were found in both control corneas and XP samples however, unlike normal tissues, positive cells were found in all cell layers of XP samples indicating that these cells were sensitive to very low levels of UV. pH2A.X-positive cells were significantly more in XP corneas(p<0.05) indicating the presence of double strand breaks in these tissues. A positive expression of phosphorylated-forms of DDR proteins was noted in XP corneas (unlike controls) such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated/Rad-3 related proteins (ATM/ATR), breast cancer-1 and checkpoint kinases-1 and -2. Nuclear localization of XPA was noted in XP samples which co-localized (calculated using Pearson's correlation) with pATM (0.9+-0.007) and pATR (0.6+-0.053). The increased presence of these in the nucleus confirms that unresolved DNA damage was accumulating in these cells thereby leading to prolonged activation of the damage response proteins. An increase in pp53 and TUNEL positive cells in the XP corneas indicated cell death likely driven by the p53 pathway. For comparison, cultured normal corneal epithelial cells were exposed to UV-radiation and stained for DDR proteins at 3, 6 and 24 hours after irradiation to quantify the time taken by cells with intact DDR pathway to repair damage. These cells, when exposed to UV showed nuclear translocation of DDR proteins at 3 and 6 hours which reduced significantly by 24 hours confirming that the damaged DNA was being actively repaired leading to cell survival. The persistent presence of the DDR proteins in XP corneas indicates that damage is being actively recognized and DNA replication is stalled, thereby causing accumulation of damaged DNA leading to cell death, which would explain the cancer incidence and cell loss reported in these patients.",

I examine the clinical implications of ATM alterations, including their impact on cancer predisposition, prognosis, and treatment response. The review highlights recent advances in ATM-targeted therapies, discussing ongoing clinical trials of ATM inhibitors and their potential in combination with other treatment modalities. I also address the challenges in developing effective biomarkers for ATM activity and patient selection strategies for personalized cancer therapy.

                    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer remains the leading cause of mortality among all gynecologic malignancies owing to recurrence and ultimate development of chemotherapy resistance in the majority of patients. In the chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer preclinical model, we investigated whether AZD6738 (an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor) could synergize with belotecan (a camptothecin analog and topoisomerase I inhibitor). In vitro, both chemotherapy-resistant and chemotherapy-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines showed synergistic anti-proliferative activity with a combination treatment of belotecan and AZD6738. The combination also demonstrated synergistic tumor inhibition in mice with a chemotherapy-resistant cell line xenograft. Mechanistically, belotecan, a DNA-damaging agent, increased phospho-ATR (pATR) and phospho-Chk1 (pChk1) in consecutive order, indicating the activation of the DNA repair system. This consequently induced G2/M arrest in the cell cycle analysis. However, when AZD6738 was added to belotecan, pATR and pChk1 induced by belotecan alone were suppressed again. A cell cycle analysis in betotecan showed a sub-G1 increase as well as a G2/M decrease, representing the release of G2/M arrest and the induction of apoptosis. In ascites-derived primary cancer cells from both chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer patients, this combination was also synergistic, providing further support for our hypothesis. The combined administration of ATR inhibitor and belotecan proved to be synergistic in our preclinical model. This combination warrants further investigation in a clinical trial, with a particular aim of overcoming chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer.",

In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

Homologous recombination represents a precise, DNA-template-based mechanism available during the S and G2 cell cycle phase, whereas non-homologous end joining, which requires DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), allows for fast, cell cycle-independent but less accurate DNA repair. Here, we report the discovery of BAY-8400, a novel selective inhibitor of DNA-PK. Starting from a triazoloquinoxaline, which had been identified as a hit from a screen for ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors with inhibitory activity against ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK, lead optimization efforts focusing on potency and selectivity led to the discovery of BAY-8400. In in vitro studies, BAY-8400 showed synergistic activity of DNA-PK inhibition with DNA damage-inducing targeted alpha therapy. Combination of PSMA-targeted thorium-227 conjugate BAY 2315497 treatment of human prostate tumor-bearing mice with BAY-8400 oral treatment increased antitumor efficacy, as compared to PSMA-targeted thorium-227 conjugate monotherapy.",

We found that ATR inhibition enhanced RT response in HPV-negative and HPV-positive cell lines independent of HPV status. The radiosensitizing effect of AZD6738 was correlated with checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1)-mediated abrogation of G2/M-arrest. This resulted in the inhibition of RT-induced DNA repair and in an increase in the percentage of micronucleated cells. We validated the enhanced RT response in HPV-negative and HPV-positive xenograft models. These data demonstrate the potential use of ATR inhibition in combination with RT as a treatment option for both HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC patients.",

                    "abstract": "Lung cancer is amongst the most pervasive malignancies having high mortality rates. It is broadly grouped into non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The concept of personalized medicine has overshadowed the conventional chemotherapy given to all patients with lung cancer. The targeted therapy is given to a particular population having specific mutations to help in the better management of lung cancer. The targeting pathways for NSCLC include the epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, MET (Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor) oncogene, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). SCLC targeting pathway includes Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK 1) pathway, WEE1 pathway, Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)/Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3 (DLL-Immune checkpoint inhibitors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/ programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors and Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) blockade are also utilized in the management of lung cancer. Many of the targeted therapies are still under development and require clinical trials to establish their safety and efficacy. This review summarizes the mechanism of molecular targets and immune-mediated targets, recently approved drugs, and their clinical trials for lung cancer.",

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an intractable disease with rapid progression and high mortality, presenting a persistent obstacle impeding clinical management. Although recent advancements in immunotherapy have enhanced the response rates of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of acquired resistance invariably leads to recurrence and metastasis. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to explore novel therapeutic targets and optimize existing treatment strategies. This article comprehensively reviews the currently available therapeutic modalities for SCLC. It delves into the immunologic prognostic implications by analyzing selected immune-related signatures. Moreover, it conducts an in-depth exploration of the molecular subtyping of SCLC and the associated molecular pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, the focus is on clinical interventions targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), elucidating its resistance mechanisms and demonstrating its notable antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, the study examines the mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), covering resistance issues and strategies for optimizing resistance management, with particular emphasis being placed on analyzing the prospects and clinical value of CAR T therapy in the context of SCLC. Moreover, the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3/checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors is discussed and underscores the advantages of combining these inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to combat chemoresistance and enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapies. Overall, this study investigates emerging strategies for targeted therapies and optimized combination regimens to overcome resistance in SCLC and highlights future strategies for new therapeutic technologies for SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "Steroid hormone signaling induces vast gene expression programs which necessitate the local formation of transcription factories at regulatory regions and large-scale alterations of the genome architecture to allow communication among distantly related cis-acting regions. This involves major stress at the genomic DNA level. Transcriptionally active regions are generally instable and prone to breakage due to the torsional stress and local depletion of nucleosomes that make DNA more accessible to damaging agents. A dedicated DNA damage response (DDR) is therefore essential to maintain genome integrity at these exposed regions. The DDR is a complex network involving DNA damage sensor proteins, such as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, as central regulators. The tight interplay between the DDR and steroid hormone receptors has been unraveled recently. Several DNA repair factors interact with the androgen and estrogen receptors and support their transcriptional functions. Conversely, both receptors directly control the expression of agents involved in the DDR. Impaired DDR is also exploited by tumors to acquire advantageous mutations. Cancer cells often harbor germline or somatic alterations in DDR genes, and their association with disease outcome and treatment response led to intensive efforts towards identifying selective inhibitors targeting the major players in this process. The PARP-1 inhibitors are now approved for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer with specific genomic alterations. Additional DDR-targeting agents are being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or in combination with treatments eliciting DNA damage (e.g., radiation therapy, including targeted radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) or addressing targets involved in maintenance of genome integrity. Recent preclinical and clinical findings made in addressing DNA repair dysfunction in hormone-dependent and -independent prostate and breast tumors are presented. Importantly, the combination of anti-hormonal therapy with DDR inhibition or with radiation has the potential to enhance efficacy but still needs further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "Radiotherapy is one of the most common countermeasures for treating a wide range of tumors. However, the radioresistance of cancer cells is still a major limitation for radiotherapy applications. Efforts are continuously ongoing to explore sensitizing targets and develop radiosensitizers for improving the outcomes of radiotherapy. DNA double-strand breaks are the most lethal lesions induced by ionizing radiation and can trigger a series of cellular DNA damage responses (DDRs), including those helping cells recover from radiation injuries, such as the activation of DNA damage sensing and early transduction pathways, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. Obviously, these protective DDRs confer tumor radioresistance. Targeting DDR signaling pathways has become an attractive strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance, and some important advances and breakthroughs have already been achieved in recent years. On the basis of comprehensively reviewing the DDR signal pathways, we provide an update on the novel and promising druggable targets emerging from DDR pathways that can be exploited for radiosensitization. We further discuss recent advances identified from preclinical studies, current clinical trials, and clinical application of chemical inhibitors targeting key DDR proteins, including DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit), ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related), the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex, the PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) family, MDC1, Wee1, LIG4 (ligase IV), CDK1, BRCA1 (BRCA1 C terminal), CHK1, and HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1).

Although myoCAFs are associated with poor outcome in most solid tumors, the molecular mechanisms regulating myoCAF accumulation remain unclear, limiting the potential for therapeutic intervention. Here, we identify ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) as a central regulator of the myoCAF phenotype. Differentiating myofibroblasts in vitro and myoCAFs cultured ex vivo display activated ATM signaling, and targeting ATM genetically or pharmacologically could suppress and reverse differentiation. ATM activation was regulated by the reactive oxygen species-producing enzyme NOX4, both through DNA damage and increased oxidative stress. Targeting fibroblast ATM in vivo suppressed myoCAF-rich tumor growth, promoted intratumoral CD8 T-cell infiltration, and potentiated the response to anti-PD-1 blockade and antitumor vaccination. This work identifies a novel pathway regulating myoCAF differentiation and provides a rationale for using ATM inhibitors to overcome CAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: ATM signaling supports the differentiation of myoCAFs to suppress T-cell infiltration and antitumor immunity, supporting the potential clinical use of ATM inhibitors in combination with checkpoint inhibition in myoCAF-rich, immune-cold tumors.",

One promising avenue is targeting the shelterin protein complex, a safeguard for telomeres crucial in preventing DNA damage. The role of shelterin in modulating ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases, key players in the DNA damage response (DDR), establishes its significance in cancer cells. Disrupting these defence mechanisms of shelterins, especially in cancer cells, renders telomeres vulnerable, potentially leading to genomic instability and hindering cancer cell survival. In this review, we outline recent approaches exploring shelterins as potential anticancer targets, highlighting the prospect of developing selective molecules to exploit telomere vulnerabilities toward new innovative cancer treatments.",

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of ATM's structure, activation mechanisms, and various functions in cancer development, progression, and treatment. I discuss ATM's dual nature as both a tumor suppressor and potential promoter of cancer cell survival in certain contexts. The article explores the complex signaling pathways mediated by ATM, its interactions with other DNA repair mechanisms, and its influence on cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and metabolism. I examine the clinical implications of ATM alterations, including their impact on cancer predisposition, prognosis, and treatment response. The review highlights recent advances in ATM-targeted therapies, discussing ongoing clinical trials of ATM inhibitors and their potential in combination with other treatment modalities. I also address the challenges in developing effective biomarkers for ATM activity and patient selection strategies for personalized cancer therapy. Finally, I outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for refined biomarker development, optimized combination therapies, and strategies to overcome potential resistance mechanisms. This comprehensive overview underscores the critical importance of ATM in cancer biology and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target in precision oncology.",

                    "abstract": "Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) inactivation in ~50% of cancer cells confers broad chemoresistance. To identify therapeutic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms for overcoming chemoresistance, we performed an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen in SLFN11-WT and -knockout (KO) cells. We found that inactivation of Ataxia Telangiectasia- and Rad3-related (ATR), CHK1, BRCA2, and RPA1 overcome chemoresistance to camptothecin (CPT) in SLFN11-KO cells. Accordingly, we validate that clinical inhibitors of ATR (M4344 and M6620) and CHK1 (SRA737) resensitize SLFN11-KO cells to topotecan, indotecan, etoposide, cisplatin, and talazoparib. We uncover that ATR inhibition significantly increases mitotic defects along with increased CDT1 phosphorylation, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments in SLFN11-KO cells. We also reveal a chemoresistance mechanism by which CDT1 degradation is retarded, eventually inducing replication reactivation under DNA damage in SLFN11-KO cells. In contrast, in SLFN11-expressing cells, SLFN11 promotes the degradation of CDT1 in response to CPT by binding to DDB1 of CUL4CDT2 E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with replication forks. We show that the C terminus and ATPase domain of SLFN11 are required for DDB1 binding and CDT1 degradation. Furthermore, we identify a therapy-relevant ATPase mutant (E669K) of the SLFN11 gene in human TCGA and show that the mutant contributes to chemoresistance and retarded CDT1 degradation. Taken together, our study reveals new chemotherapeutic insights on how targeting the ATR pathway overcomes chemoresistance of SLFN11-deficient cancers. It also demonstrates that SLFN11 irreversibly arrests replication by degrading CDT1 through the DDB1-CUL4CDT2 ubiquitin ligase.",

ATM signaling pathways contain many downstream targets that regulate multiple important cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, oxidative sensing, and proliferation. Over the past few decades, associations between germline ATM pathogenic variants and cancer risk have been reported, particularly for breast and pancreatic cancers. In addition, given that ATM plays a critical role in repairing double-strand breaks, inhibiting other DNA repair pathways could be a synthetic lethal approach. Based on this rationale, several DNA damage response inhibitors are currently being tested in ATM-deficient cancers. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge related to the structure of the ATM gene, function of ATM kinase, clinical significance of ATM germline pathogenic variants in patients with hereditary cancers, and ongoing efforts to target ATM for the benefit of cancer patients.",

                    "abstract": "With the advent of precision genomics, hereditary predisposition to hematopoietic neoplasms- collectively known as hereditary predisposition syndromes (HPS)-are being increasingly recognized in clinical practice. Familial clustering was first observed in patients with leukemia, which led to the identification of several germline variants, such as RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, DDX41, and ETV6, among others, now established as HPS, with tendency to develop myeloid neoplasms. However, evidence for hereditary predisposition is also apparent in lymphoid and plasma--cell neoplasms, with recent discoveries of germline variants in genes such as IKZF1, SH2B3, PAX5 (familial acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and KDM1A/LSD1 (familial multiple myeloma). Specific inherited bone marrow failure syndromes-such as GATA2 haploinsufficiency syndromes, short telomere syndromes, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, and familial thrombocytopenias-also have an increased predisposition to develop myeloid neoplasms, whereas inherited immune deficiency syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, and Bruton agammaglobulinemia, are associated with an increased risk for lymphoid neoplasms. Timely recognition of HPS is critical to ensure safe choice of donors and/or conditioning-regimen intensity for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and to enable direction of appropriate genomics-driven personalized therapies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of HPS and serve as a useful reference for clinicians to recognize relevant signs and symptoms among patients to enable timely screening and referrals to pursue germline assessment. In addition, we also discuss our institutional approach toward identification of HPS and offer a stepwise diagnostic and management algorithm.",

We assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of berzosertib plus cisplatin. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced solid tumours refractory or resistant to standard of care therapies received ascending doses of cisplatin (day 1) and berzosertib (days 2 and 9) every 3 weeks (Q3W). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received berzosertib (90-210 mg/m2) and cisplatin (40-75 mg/m2) across seven dose levels. The most common grade >=3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (20.0%) and anaemia (16.7%). There were two dose-limiting toxicities: a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction and a grade 3 increase in alanine aminotransferase. Berzosertib 140 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) Q3W was determined as the recommended Phase 2 dose. Cisplatin had no apparent effect on berzosertib pharmacokinetics. Of the 31 patients, four achieved a partial response (two confirmed and two unconfirmed) despite having previously experienced disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus cisplatin is well tolerated and shows preliminary clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumours, warranting further evaluation in a Phase 2 setting.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether different approaches of HSCT are feasible in regard to graft versus host response and sufficient concerning functional immune reconstitution. Atm-deficient mice were treated with a clinically relevant non-myeloablative host-conditioning regimen and transplanted with CD90.2-depleted, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing, and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-competent bone marrow donor cells in a syngeneic, haploidentical or allogeneic setting. Like syngeneic HSCT, haploidentical HSCT, but not allogeneic HSCT extended the lifespan of Atm-deficient mice through the reduction of thymic tumors and normalized T-cell numbers. Donor-derived splenocytes isolated from transplanted Atm-deficient mice filled the gap of cell loss in the naive T-cell population and raised CD4 cell functionality up to wild-type level. Interestingly, HSCT using heterozygous donor cells let to a significantly improved survival of Atm-deficient mice and increased CD4 cell numbers as well as CD4 cell functionality equivalent to HSCT using with wild-type donor cells. Our data provided evidence that haploidentical HSCT could be a feasible strategy for A-T, possibly even if the donor is heterozygous for ATM.

A rat model of arsenic poisoning was established by feeding corn powder for 90 days, which was baked with high arsenic coal, then were treated with Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) for 45 days by gavage. The results showed that arsenic induced liver damage, increased hepatocyte apoptosis and elevated the expression level of Chk1 and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 in liver tissues, which were significantly attenuated by GBE. Additionally, to further demonstrate the potential apoptosis-associated mechanism, L-02 cells were pre-incubated with p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha), ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (CGK733) or GBE, then treated with sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) for 24 h. The results showed that GBE, PFTalpha or CGK733 significantly reduced arsenic-induced Chk1 expression and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2. In conclusion, Chk1-p53 pathway was involved in arsenic poisoning-induced hepatotoxicity, and inhibiting of Chk1-p53 pathway ameliorated hepatocyte apoptosis caused by coal-burning arsenic poisoning. The study provides a pivotal clue for understanding of the mechanism of arsenic poisoning-induced liver damage, and possible intervention strategies.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with solid tumors, enriched for melanoma, received ceralasertib in combination with a fixed dose of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on D1, D8, D15) in 28-day cycles. The dose of ceralasertib was escalated to reach an MTD in a rolling 6 design. The starting dose of ceralasertib was 40 mg QD. Fifty-seven patients (33 patients with melanoma who failed prior PD1/L1 treatment) were enrolled in 7 dose cohorts ranging from 40 mg QD to 240 mg BD plus weekly paclitaxel. RESULTS: The RP2D was established as ceralasertib 240 mg BD days 1-14 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, D8, D15 every 28 days. The most common toxicities were neutropenia (n = 39, 68%), anemia (n = 25, 44%), and thrombocytopenia (n = 21, 37%). In the full analysis set of 57 patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 22.6% (95% CI, 12.5-35.3). In 33 patients with melanoma, resistant to prior anti-PD1 therapy, the ORR was 33.3% (95% CI, 18.0-51.8).

In 33 patients with melanoma, resistant to prior anti-PD1 therapy, the ORR was 33.3% (95% CI, 18.0-51.8). In the melanoma subset, the mPFS was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.0-5.8), the median duration of response was 9.9 months (95% CI, 3.7-23.2), and the mOS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.7-11.9). CONCLUSIONS: Ceralasertib in combination with paclitaxel was well tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies and showed evidence of antitumor activity. Durable responses were observed in patients with advanced cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanoma resistant to anti-PD1/L1 treatment.See related commentary by Ashworth, p. 4667.",

Three had BRCA1 mutations (1 germline, 2 somatic). Adverse events possibly related to treatment were primarily grade (G) 1/2. G3 toxicities included nausea (14.3%), fatigue (7.1%), anorexia (7.1%), and anemia (7.1%). No objective responses occurred. Best response was stable disease in 9 patients and progressive disease in three. Five patients had a >= 20% to <30% reduction in disease burden, including 3 with BRCA1 mutations.

                    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant malignancy with elusive mechanism of pathogenesis and dismal prognosis. Over the past decades, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the backbone treatment for SCLC. However, subsequent chemoresistance after initial effectiveness urges researchers to explore novel therapeutic targets of SCLC. Recent years have witnessed significant improvements in targeted therapy in SCLC. New molecular candidates such as Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related protein (ATR), WEE1, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) have shown promising therapeutic utility in SCLC. While immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has emerged as an indispensable treatment modality for SCLC, approaches to boost efficacy and reduce toxicity as well as selection of reliable biomarkers for ICI in SCLC have remained elusive and warrants our further investigation. Given the increasing importance of precision medicine in SCLC, optimal subtyping of SCLC using multi-omics have gradually applied into clinical practice, which may identify more drug targets and better tailor treatment strategies to each individual patient. The present review summarizes recent progress and future directions in SCLC. In addition to the emerging new therapeutics, we also focus on the establishment of predictive model for early detection of SCLC. More importantly, we also propose a multi-dimensional model in the prognosis of SCLC to ultimately attain the goal of accurate treatment of SCLC.",

Photothermal therapy (PTT) for thermal ablation of local tumors has recently emerged as a therapeutic strategy. However, the relatively high temperature of over 50  C may lead to unexpected heat-related damage to tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Herein, we designed and synthesized ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor loaded hollow-structured CuS NPs with surface modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody (CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs are highly photo-stable, can release encapsulated drugs, and increase the temperature to an effective level in a near-infrared (NIR)-responsive manner. Moreover, CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs specifically target tumors and thereby significantly inhibit tumor growth on contribution to synergistic low-temperature PTT and chemotherapy. This system not only achieved low-temperature PTT but also resulted in reduced damage to normal tissues. Modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody enhanced target specificity and immune activation. The combination of PTT and ATM inhibitor showed synergistic effects and significantly attenuated the growth of the HCC via down regulation of heat shock protein (HSP). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs are a highly promising platform for targeted tumor ablation via hyperthermia-mediated tumor death with minimal damage to normal tissues at a low temperature. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We constructed ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor-loaded hollow-structured CuS NPs with surface modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody (CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs not only achieved low-temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) but also resulted in reduced damage to normal tissues and sufficient biocompatibility. The modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody enhanced targeted specificity, cell endocytosis, and immune activation. In addition, the combination of PTT and ATM inhibitor synergistically attenuated the growth of the HCC via downregulation of heat shock protein (HSP). This study provided proof-of-concept for the ATM inhibitor that mediated low-temperature PTT with a potential for future clinical applications.",

In response to DNA damage, DNA damage response (DDR) protein, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), plays a pivotal role in the modulation of regulatory regions responsible for inhibition of apoptosis, thereby neoplastic progression. METHODS: A new series of DPA (7a-t) were synthesized, characterized. Anti-proliferative studies to identify the lead compound were carried out by LDH and MTT assay. Apoptosis/DNA damage was measured through FACS, Annexin-v staining, TUNEL and Comet assay. Elucidation of molecular mechanism through immunoblot and further validation of the drug effect through in vivo approaches. RESULTS: Initial in vitro anti-proliferative screening of Compounds DPA (7a-t) against multiple cancer cell lines identified Compound DPA (7n) as a potent cytotoxic molecule with IC50 value of 4.3 muM. Down the line, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of Compound DPA (7n) inferred that it has apoptotic inducing potentiality. Further, evaluation of molecular mechanism inferred that Compound DPA (7n) effectively modulates ATM phosphorylation only, eventually altering downstream signalling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compound DPA (7n) emerged as a potent proapoptotic and anti-neoplastic agent by inhibiting ATM kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The conferring results ascertain that the drug could be developed as a new ATM kinase inhibitor with anti-cancer capacity.",

Here we show that modelling of intermittent ceralasertib treatment in mouse tumor models reveals CD8+ T-cell dependent antitumor activity, which is separate from the effects on tumor cells. Ceralasertib suppresses proliferating CD8+ T-cells on treatment which is rapidly reversed off-treatment. Ceralasertib causes up-regulation of type I interferon (IFNI) pathway in cancer patients and in tumor-bearing mice. IFNI is experimentally found to be a major mediator of antitumor activity of ceralasertib in combination with PD-L1 antibody. Improvement of T-cell function after ceralasertib treatment is linked to changes in myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. IFNI also promotes anti-proliferative effects of ceralasertib on tumor cells. Here, we report that broad immunomodulatory changes following intermittent ATR inhibition underpins the clinical therapeutic benefit and indicates its wider impact on antitumor immunity.",

AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the currently approved and most promising candidate pharmacotherapies in relation to the known disease mechanisms of the most prevalent autosomal recessive ataxias. Omaveloxolone is an Nrf2 activator that increases antioxidant defense and was recently approved for treatment of Friedreich ataxia. Its therapeutic effect is modest, and further research is needed to find synergistic treatments that would halt or reverse disease progression. Promising approaches include upregulation of frataxin expression by epigenetic mechanisms, direct protein replacement, and gene replacement therapy. For ataxia-telangiectasia, promising approaches include splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Rare recessive ataxias for which disease-modifying therapies exist are also reviewed, emphasizing recently approved therapies. Evidence supporting the use of riluzole and acetyl-leucine in recessive ataxias is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Advances in genetic therapies for other neurogenetic conditions have paved the way to implement feasible approaches with potential dramatic benefits. Particularly, as we develop effective treatments for these conditions, we may need to combine therapies, consider newborn testing for pre-symptomatic treatment, and optimize non-pharmacological approaches.",

It also examined exploratory predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 36) received a fixed dose of carboplatin (AUC5) with escalating doses of ceralasertib (20 mg twice daily to 60 mg once daily) in 21-day cycles. Sequential and concurrent combination dosing schedules were assessed. RESULTS: Two ceralasertib MTD dose schedules, 20 mg twice daily on days 4-13 and 40 mg once daily on days 1-2, were tolerated with carboplatin AUC5; the latter was declared the RP2D. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade >=3) were anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and neutropenia (25%). Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2; including one grade 4 platelet count decreased) and a combination of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 3 patients. Ceralasertib was quickly absorbed (tmax ~1 hour), with a terminal plasma half-life of 8-11 hours. Upregulation of pRAD50, indicative of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, was observed in tumor biopsies during ceralasertib treatment. Two patients with absent or low ATM or SLFN11 protein expression achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial responses. Eighteen of 34 (53%) response-evaluable patients had RECIST v1.1 stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D for ceralasertib plus carboplatin was established as ceralasertib 40 mg once daily on days 1-2 administered with carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks, with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies confirming pharmacodynamic modulation and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity observed.",

                    "abstract": "Elevated levels of replicative stress in gynecological cancers arising from uncontrolled oncogenic activation, loss of key tumor suppressors, and frequent defects in the DNA repair machinery are an intrinsic vulnerability for therapeutic exploitation. The presence of replication stress activates the DNA damage response and downstream checkpoint proteins including ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related kinase (ATR), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), and WEE1-like protein kinase (WEE1), which trigger cell cycle arrest while protecting and restoring stalled replication forks. Strategies that increase replicative stress while lowering cell cycle checkpoint thresholds may allow unrepaired DNA damage to be inappropriately carried forward in replicating cells, leading to mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Moreover, the identification of fork protection as a key mechanism of resistance to chemo- and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapy in ovarian cancer further increases the priority that should be accorded to the development of strategies targeting replicative stress. Small molecule inhibitors designed to target the DNA damage sensors, such as inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), ATR, CHK1 and WEE1, impair smooth cell cycle modulation and disrupt efficient DNA repair, or a combination of the above, have demonstrated interesting monotherapy and combinatorial activity, including the potential to reverse drug resistance and have entered developmental pipelines. Yet unresolved challenges lie in balancing the toxicity profile of these drugs in order to achieve a suitable therapeutic index while maintaining clinical efficacy, and selective biomarkers are urgently required. Here we describe the premise for targeting of replicative stress in gynecological cancers and discuss the clinical advancement of this strategy.",

However, the tumor often acquires radiation resistance, which is characterized by an increased DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that CD73, which generates extracellular adenosine from ATP, and A2B receptor, which is activated by adenosine, are involved in the gamma-radiation-induced DDR and the enhanced migration ability of human glioblastoma cell line A172. To investigate DDR, we evaluated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation and focus formation of histone H2A isoform gamma (gammaH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) in the nucleus of A172 cells after gamma-irradiation. Antagonists of A2B receptor and CD73, or knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA), suppressed gamma-radiation-induced DDR and promoted gamma-radiation-induced cell death, as well as suppressing gamma-radiation-induced cell migration and actin remodeling. These results suggest that activation of A2B receptor by extracellular adenosine generated via CD73 promotes gamma-radiation-induced DDR, leading to recovery from DNA damage, and also enhances cell migration and actin remodeling. The CD73-A2B receptor pathway may be a promising target for overcoming radiation resistance and the acquisition of malignant phenotypes during radiotherapy of glioblastoma.",

                    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system and is treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, the tumor often acquires radiation resistance, which is characterized by an increased DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that CD73, which generates extracellular adenosine from ATP, and A2B receptor, which is activated by adenosine, are involved in the gamma-radiation-induced DDR and the enhanced migration ability of human glioblastoma cell line A172. To investigate DDR, we evaluated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation and focus formation of histone H2A isoform gamma (gammaH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) in the nucleus of A172 cells after gamma-irradiation. Antagonists of A2B receptor and CD73, or knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA), suppressed gamma-radiation-induced DDR and promoted gamma-radiation-induced cell death, as well as suppressing gamma-radiation-induced cell migration and actin remodeling. These results suggest that activation of A2B receptor by extracellular adenosine generated via CD73 promotes gamma-radiation-induced DDR, leading to recovery from DNA damage, and also enhances cell migration and actin remodeling. The CD73-A2B receptor pathway may be a promising target for overcoming radiation resistance and the acquisition of malignant phenotypes during radiotherapy of glioblastoma.",

Chemotherapy continues to serve as the primary treatment modality, while immunotherapy is largely ineffective for the majority of CRC patients. Seminal discoveries have emphasized that modifying DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms confers both cell-autonomous and immune-related vulnerabilities across various cancers. In CRC, approximately 15% of tumours exhibit alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery, resulting in a high number of neoantigens and the activation of the type I interferon response. These factors, in conjunction with immune checkpoint blockades, collectively stimulate anticancer immunity. Furthermore, although less frequently, somatic alterations in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway are observed in CRC; these defects lead to genome instability and telomere alterations, supporting the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in HR-deficient CRC patients. Additionally, other DDR inhibitors, such as Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors, have shown some efficacy both in preclinical models and in the clinical setting, irrespective of MMR proficiency. The aim of this review is to elucidate how preexisting or induced vulnerabilities in DNA repair pathways represent an opportunity to increase tumour sensitivity to immune-based therapies in CRC.",

Although myoCAFs are associated with poor outcome in most solid tumors, the molecular mechanisms regulating myoCAF accumulation remain unclear, limiting the potential for therapeutic intervention. Here, we identify ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) as a central regulator of the myoCAF phenotype. Differentiating myofibroblasts in vitro and myoCAFs cultured ex vivo display activated ATM signaling, and targeting ATM genetically or pharmacologically could suppress and reverse differentiation. ATM activation was regulated by the reactive oxygen species-producing enzyme NOX4, both through DNA damage and increased oxidative stress. Targeting fibroblast ATM in vivo suppressed myoCAF-rich tumor growth, promoted intratumoral CD8 T-cell infiltration, and potentiated the response to anti-PD-1 blockade and antitumor vaccination. This work identifies a novel pathway regulating myoCAF differentiation and provides a rationale for using ATM inhibitors to overcome CAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: ATM signaling supports the differentiation of myoCAFs to suppress T-cell infiltration and antitumor immunity, supporting the potential clinical use of ATM inhibitors in combination with checkpoint inhibition in myoCAF-rich, immune-cold tumors.",

To identify therapeutic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms for overcoming chemoresistance, we performed an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen in SLFN11-WT and -knockout (KO) cells. We found that inactivation of Ataxia Telangiectasia- and Rad3-related (ATR), CHK1, BRCA2, and RPA1 overcome chemoresistance to camptothecin (CPT) in SLFN11-KO cells. Accordingly, we validate that clinical inhibitors of ATR (M4344 and M6620) and CHK1 (SRA737) resensitize SLFN11-KO cells to topotecan, indotecan, etoposide, cisplatin, and talazoparib. We uncover that ATR inhibition significantly increases mitotic defects along with increased CDT1 phosphorylation, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments in SLFN11-KO cells. We also reveal a chemoresistance mechanism by which CDT1 degradation is retarded, eventually inducing replication reactivation under DNA damage in SLFN11-KO cells. In contrast, in SLFN11-expressing cells, SLFN11 promotes the degradation of CDT1 in response to CPT by binding to DDB1 of CUL4CDT2 E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with replication forks. We show that the C terminus and ATPase domain of SLFN11 are required for DDB1 binding and CDT1 degradation. Furthermore, we identify a therapy-relevant ATPase mutant (E669K) of the SLFN11 gene in human TCGA and show that the mutant contributes to chemoresistance and retarded CDT1 degradation. Taken together, our study reveals new chemotherapeutic insights on how targeting the ATR pathway overcomes chemoresistance of SLFN11-deficient cancers. It also demonstrates that SLFN11 irreversibly arrests replication by degrading CDT1 through the DDB1-CUL4CDT2 ubiquitin ligase.",

Meanwhile, the DNA hydrogel could assist the micro-crystallization of a novel radiosensitizing drugs, ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor (Elimusertib), further facilitating its long-term release. When applied to the tumor site, the hydrogel system demonstrated significant antitumor activity, minimized systemic toxicity, and had a modulatory effect on the tumor-immune cell interface. Our drug-loaded DNA-hydrogel platform represents a novel modality for adjuvant therapy in patients with surgical residual tumor lesions and lymph node metastasis.

Chemotherapy continues to serve as the primary treatment modality, while immunotherapy is largely ineffective for the majority of CRC patients. Seminal discoveries have emphasized that modifying DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms confers both cell-autonomous and immune-related vulnerabilities across various cancers. In CRC, approximately 15% of tumours exhibit alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery, resulting in a high number of neoantigens and the activation of the type I interferon response. These factors, in conjunction with immune checkpoint blockades, collectively stimulate anticancer immunity. Furthermore, although less frequently, somatic alterations in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway are observed in CRC; these defects lead to genome instability and telomere alterations, supporting the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in HR-deficient CRC patients. Additionally, other DDR inhibitors, such as Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors, have shown some efficacy both in preclinical models and in the clinical setting, irrespective of MMR proficiency. The aim of this review is to elucidate how preexisting or induced vulnerabilities in DNA repair pathways represent an opportunity to increase tumour sensitivity to immune-based therapies in CRC.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking. Observations: This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) inactivation in ~50% of cancer cells confers broad chemoresistance. To identify therapeutic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms for overcoming chemoresistance, we performed an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen in SLFN11-WT and -knockout (KO) cells. We found that inactivation of Ataxia Telangiectasia- and Rad3-related (ATR), CHK1, BRCA2, and RPA1 overcome chemoresistance to camptothecin (CPT) in SLFN11-KO cells. Accordingly, we validate that clinical inhibitors of ATR (M4344 and M6620) and CHK1 (SRA737) resensitize SLFN11-KO cells to topotecan, indotecan, etoposide, cisplatin, and talazoparib. We uncover that ATR inhibition significantly increases mitotic defects along with increased CDT1 phosphorylation, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments in SLFN11-KO cells. We also reveal a chemoresistance mechanism by which CDT1 degradation is retarded, eventually inducing replication reactivation under DNA damage in SLFN11-KO cells. In contrast, in SLFN11-expressing cells, SLFN11 promotes the degradation of CDT1 in response to CPT by binding to DDB1 of CUL4CDT2 E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with replication forks. We show that the C terminus and ATPase domain of SLFN11 are required for DDB1 binding and CDT1 degradation. Furthermore, we identify a therapy-relevant ATPase mutant (E669K) of the SLFN11 gene in human TCGA and show that the mutant contributes to chemoresistance and retarded CDT1 degradation. Taken together, our study reveals new chemotherapeutic insights on how targeting the ATR pathway overcomes chemoresistance of SLFN11-deficient cancers. It also demonstrates that SLFN11 irreversibly arrests replication by degrading CDT1 through the DDB1-CUL4CDT2 ubiquitin ligase.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is limited by the development of drug resistance. Recent studies demonstrated the efficacy of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunotherapies in metastatic prostate cancer. The ataxia telangiectasia mutation (ATM) protein plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and function of mitosis. Here, we aimed to determine whether PD-1/PD-L1 signaling contributes to the resistance to DTX and to elucidate the mechanism underlying DTX-induced PD-L1 expression. METHODS: In this retrospective study, PD-L1 expression was analyzed in 33 tumor tissue samples from prostate cancer patients. Prostate cell lines were used to perform functional assays and examine underlying mechanisms in vitro. A fully mouse prostate cancer model and a humanized chimeric mouse bearing human prostate tumors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used for in vivo assays. RESULTS: We have shown that DTX, a chemotherapeutic drug which causing microtubule interference, could significantly induce the expression of PD-L1 in prostate cancer cells. This effect is blocked by the inhibition of ATM, suggesting that it plays an essential role in PD-L1 expression upregulated by DTX. Mechanistic studies have shown that ATM activity in cancer cells enhances the stability of the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), which leading to an increase in the NF-kappaB activity and PD-L1 expression. Using the mouse model, it was further demonstrated that a combination of ATM and NEMO inhibitors along with DTX augmented the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy, which are comparable to that of PD-L1 antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have revealed that a previously unrecognized ATM-NEMO signaling which induced by DTX is capable of suppressing tumor immunity by activating the expression of PD-L1, suggesting that the ATM-NEMO-NF-kappaB axis can be exploited to restore the immune balance and overcome cancer resistance triggered by DTX.Graphic Abstract: supplementary file 1.",

                    "abstract": "The poor prognosis for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the dominant subtype of ovarian cancer, reflects its aggressive nature, late diagnosis, and the highest mortality rate among all gynaecologic cancers. Apart from late diagnosis, the main reason for the poor prognosis and its unsuccessful treatment is primarily the emergence of chemoresistance to carboplatin. Although there is a good response to primary treatment, the disease recurs in 80% of cases, at which point it is largely resistant to carboplatin. The introduction of novel targeted therapies in the second decade of the 21st century has begun to transform the treatment of HGSOC, although their impact on overall survival remains unsatisfactory. Targeting the specific pathways known to be abnormally activated in HGSOC is especially difficult due to the molecular diversity of its subtypes. Moreover, a range of molecular changes are associated with acquired chemoresistance, e.g., reversion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline alleles. In this review, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of approved targeted therapies, including bevacizumab, PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and treatments targeting cells with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene alterations, as well as antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, we explore promising new targets under investigation in ongoing clinical trials, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, Wee1 kinase inhibitors, and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors for platinum-resistant disease. Despite the development of new targeted therapies, carboplatin remains the fundamental medicine in HGSOC therapy. The correct choice of treatment strategy for better survival of patients with advanced HGSOC should therefore include a prediction of patients' risks of developing chemoresistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effective targeted therapy requires the selection of patients who are likely to derive clinical benefit while minimizing potential adverse effects, underscoring the essence of precision medicine.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To increase the chances of finding efficacious anticancer drugs, improve development times and reduce costs, it is of interest to rank test compounds based on their potential for human use as early as possible in the drug development process. In this paper, we present a method for ranking radiosensitizers using preclinical data. METHODS: We used data from three xenograft mice studies to calibrate a model that accounts for radiation treatment combined with radiosensitizers. A nonlinear mixed effects approach was utilized where between-subject variability and inter-study variability were considered. Using the calibrated model, we ranked three different Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated inhibitors in terms of anticancer activity. The ranking was based on the Tumor Static Exposure (TSE) concept and primarily illustrated through TSE-curves. RESULTS: The model described data well and the predicted number of eradicated tumors was in good agreement with experimental data. The efficacy of the radiosensitizers was evaluated for the median individual and the 95% population percentile. Simulations predicted that a total dose of 220 Gy (5 radiation sessions a week for 6 weeks) was required for 95% of tumors to be eradicated when radiation was given alone. When radiation was combined with doses that achieved at least 8 [Formula: see text] of each radiosensitizer in mouse blood, it was predicted that the radiation dose could be decreased to 50, 65, and 100 Gy, respectively, while maintaining 95% eradication. CONCLUSIONS: A simulation-based method for calculating TSE-curves was developed, which provides more accurate predictions of tumor eradication than earlier, analytically derived, TSE-curves. The tool we present can potentially be used for radiosensitizer selection before proceeding to subsequent phases of the drug discovery and development process.",

                    "abstract": "Cancer-specific metabolic changes support the anabolic needs of the rapidly growing tumor, maintain a favorable redox balance, and help cells adapt to microenvironmental stresses like hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Radiation is extensively applied in a large number of cancer treatment protocols but despite its curative potential, radiation resistance and treatment failures pose a serious problem. Metabolic control of DNA integrity and genomic stability can occur through multiple processes, encompassing cell cycle regulation, nucleotide synthesis, epigenetic regulation of gene activity, and antioxidant defenses. Given the important role of metabolic pathways in oxidative damage responses, it is necessary to assess the potential for tumor-specific radiosensitization by novel metabolism-targeted therapies. Additionally, there are opportunities to identify molecular and functional biomarkers of vulnerabilities to combination treatments, which could then inform clinical decisions. Here, we present a curated list of metabolic pathways in the context of ionizing radiation responses. Glutamine metabolism influences DNA damage responses by mechanisms such as synthesis of nucleotides for DNA repair or of glutathione for ROS detoxification. Repurposed oxygen consumption inhibitors have shown promising radiosensitizing activity against murine model tumors and are now in clinical trials. Production of 2-hydroxy glutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase1/2 neomorphic oncogenic mutants interferes with the function of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes and modulates Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) signaling and glutathione pools. Radiation-induced oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids promotes ferroptotic cell loss and cooperates with immunotherapies to improve tumor control. In summary, there are opportunities to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy by exploiting cell-inherent vulnerabilities and dynamic microenvironmental components of the tumor.",

                    "abstract": "Elevated levels of replicative stress in gynecological cancers arising from uncontrolled oncogenic activation, loss of key tumor suppressors, and frequent defects in the DNA repair machinery are an intrinsic vulnerability for therapeutic exploitation. The presence of replication stress activates the DNA damage response and downstream checkpoint proteins including ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related kinase (ATR), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), and WEE1-like protein kinase (WEE1), which trigger cell cycle arrest while protecting and restoring stalled replication forks. Strategies that increase replicative stress while lowering cell cycle checkpoint thresholds may allow unrepaired DNA damage to be inappropriately carried forward in replicating cells, leading to mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Moreover, the identification of fork protection as a key mechanism of resistance to chemo- and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapy in ovarian cancer further increases the priority that should be accorded to the development of strategies targeting replicative stress. Small molecule inhibitors designed to target the DNA damage sensors, such as inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), ATR, CHK1 and WEE1, impair smooth cell cycle modulation and disrupt efficient DNA repair, or a combination of the above, have demonstrated interesting monotherapy and combinatorial activity, including the potential to reverse drug resistance and have entered developmental pipelines. Yet unresolved challenges lie in balancing the toxicity profile of these drugs in order to achieve a suitable therapeutic index while maintaining clinical efficacy, and selective biomarkers are urgently required. Here we describe the premise for targeting of replicative stress in gynecological cancers and discuss the clinical advancement of this strategy.",

                    "abstract": "Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) inactivation in ~50% of cancer cells confers broad chemoresistance. To identify therapeutic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms for overcoming chemoresistance, we performed an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen in SLFN11-WT and -knockout (KO) cells. We found that inactivation of Ataxia Telangiectasia- and Rad3-related (ATR), CHK1, BRCA2, and RPA1 overcome chemoresistance to camptothecin (CPT) in SLFN11-KO cells. Accordingly, we validate that clinical inhibitors of ATR (M4344 and M6620) and CHK1 (SRA737) resensitize SLFN11-KO cells to topotecan, indotecan, etoposide, cisplatin, and talazoparib. We uncover that ATR inhibition significantly increases mitotic defects along with increased CDT1 phosphorylation, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments in SLFN11-KO cells. We also reveal a chemoresistance mechanism by which CDT1 degradation is retarded, eventually inducing replication reactivation under DNA damage in SLFN11-KO cells. In contrast, in SLFN11-expressing cells, SLFN11 promotes the degradation of CDT1 in response to CPT by binding to DDB1 of CUL4CDT2 E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with replication forks. We show that the C terminus and ATPase domain of SLFN11 are required for DDB1 binding and CDT1 degradation. Furthermore, we identify a therapy-relevant ATPase mutant (E669K) of the SLFN11 gene in human TCGA and show that the mutant contributes to chemoresistance and retarded CDT1 degradation. Taken together, our study reveals new chemotherapeutic insights on how targeting the ATR pathway overcomes chemoresistance of SLFN11-deficient cancers. It also demonstrates that SLFN11 irreversibly arrests replication by degrading CDT1 through the DDB1-CUL4CDT2 ubiquitin ligase.",

                    "abstract": "The poor prognosis for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the dominant subtype of ovarian cancer, reflects its aggressive nature, late diagnosis, and the highest mortality rate among all gynaecologic cancers. Apart from late diagnosis, the main reason for the poor prognosis and its unsuccessful treatment is primarily the emergence of chemoresistance to carboplatin. Although there is a good response to primary treatment, the disease recurs in 80% of cases, at which point it is largely resistant to carboplatin. The introduction of novel targeted therapies in the second decade of the 21st century has begun to transform the treatment of HGSOC, although their impact on overall survival remains unsatisfactory. Targeting the specific pathways known to be abnormally activated in HGSOC is especially difficult due to the molecular diversity of its subtypes. Moreover, a range of molecular changes are associated with acquired chemoresistance, e.g., reversion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline alleles. In this review, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of approved targeted therapies, including bevacizumab, PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and treatments targeting cells with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene alterations, as well as antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, we explore promising new targets under investigation in ongoing clinical trials, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, Wee1 kinase inhibitors, and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors for platinum-resistant disease. Despite the development of new targeted therapies, carboplatin remains the fundamental medicine in HGSOC therapy. The correct choice of treatment strategy for better survival of patients with advanced HGSOC should therefore include a prediction of patients' risks of developing chemoresistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effective targeted therapy requires the selection of patients who are likely to derive clinical benefit while minimizing potential adverse effects, underscoring the essence of precision medicine.",

Accumulating evidence provides insight into the function of autophagy in maintenance and survival of CSCs. Here, we studied the impact of a mitochondriotropic triphenylphosphonium-functionalized dendrimeric nanocarrier on cultured breast cancer cell lines, grown either as adherent cells or as mammospheres that mimic a stem-like phenotype. The nanocarrier manifested a substantial cytotoxicity both alone as well as after encapsulation of chloroquine, a well-known autophagy inhibitor. The cytotoxic effects of the nanocarrier could be ascribed to interference with mitochondrial function. Importantly, mammospheres were selectively sensitive to encapsulated chloroquine and this depends on the expression of the gene encoding ATM kinase. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is an enzyme that functions as an essential signaling mediator that enables growth of cancer stem cells through the regulation of autophagy. We noted that this ATM-dependent sensitivity of mammospheres to encapsulated chloroquine was independent of the status of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Our study suggests that breast cancer stem cells, as they are modeled by mammospheres, are sensitive to encapsulated chloroquine, depending on the expression of the ATM kinase, which is thereby characterized as a potential biomarker for sensitivity to this type of treatment.",

Abnormal apoptosis is closely related to liver-related diseases, and p53 is one of the important hallmark proteins in apoptosis progression. This study was to investigate whether arsenic poisoning-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and the underlying role of p53 signaling pathway. A rat model of arsenic poisoning was established by feeding corn powder for 90 days, which was baked with high arsenic coal, then were treated with Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) for 45 days by gavage. The results showed that arsenic induced liver damage, increased hepatocyte apoptosis and elevated the expression level of Chk1 and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 in liver tissues, which were significantly attenuated by GBE. Additionally, to further demonstrate the potential apoptosis-associated mechanism, L-02 cells were pre-incubated with p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha), ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (CGK733) or GBE, then treated with sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) for 24 h. The results showed that GBE, PFTalpha or CGK733 significantly reduced arsenic-induced Chk1 expression and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2. In conclusion, Chk1-p53 pathway was involved in arsenic poisoning-induced hepatotoxicity, and inhibiting of Chk1-p53 pathway ameliorated hepatocyte apoptosis caused by coal-burning arsenic poisoning. The study provides a pivotal clue for understanding of the mechanism of arsenic poisoning-induced liver damage, and possible intervention strategies.",

Accumulating evidence provides insight into the function of autophagy in maintenance and survival of CSCs. Here, we studied the impact of a mitochondriotropic triphenylphosphonium-functionalized dendrimeric nanocarrier on cultured breast cancer cell lines, grown either as adherent cells or as mammospheres that mimic a stem-like phenotype. The nanocarrier manifested a substantial cytotoxicity both alone as well as after encapsulation of chloroquine, a well-known autophagy inhibitor. The cytotoxic effects of the nanocarrier could be ascribed to interference with mitochondrial function. Importantly, mammospheres were selectively sensitive to encapsulated chloroquine and this depends on the expression of the gene encoding ATM kinase. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is an enzyme that functions as an essential signaling mediator that enables growth of cancer stem cells through the regulation of autophagy. We noted that this ATM-dependent sensitivity of mammospheres to encapsulated chloroquine was independent of the status of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Our study suggests that breast cancer stem cells, as they are modeled by mammospheres, are sensitive to encapsulated chloroquine, depending on the expression of the ATM kinase, which is thereby characterized as a potential biomarker for sensitivity to this type of treatment.",

UV-induced damage in the cells leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts that are repaired by the NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair) pathway. Mutations in the genes coding for NER proteins, as reported in XP patients, would lead to sub-optimal damage repair resulting in clinical signs varying from photo-keratitis to cancerous lesions on the ocular surface. Here, we aimed to provide evidence for the accumulation of DNA damage and activation of DNA repair pathway proteins in the corneal cells of patients with XP. Corneal buttons of patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty were stained to quantify DNA damage and the presence of activated DNA damage response proteins (DDR) using specific antibodies. Positive staining for pH2A.X and thymidine dimers confirmed the presence of DNA damage in the corneal cells. Positive cells were found in both control corneas and XP samples however, unlike normal tissues, positive cells were found in all cell layers of XP samples indicating that these cells were sensitive to very low levels of UV. pH2A.X-positive cells were significantly more in XP corneas(p<0.05) indicating the presence of double strand breaks in these tissues. A positive expression of phosphorylated-forms of DDR proteins was noted in XP corneas (unlike controls) such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated/Rad-3 related proteins (ATM/ATR), breast cancer-1 and checkpoint kinases-1 and -2. Nuclear localization of XPA was noted in XP samples which co-localized (calculated using Pearson's correlation) with pATM (0.9+-0.007) and pATR (0.6+-0.053). The increased presence of these in the nucleus confirms that unresolved DNA damage was accumulating in these cells thereby leading to prolonged activation of the damage response proteins. An increase in pp53 and TUNEL positive cells in the XP corneas indicated cell death likely driven by the p53 pathway. For comparison, cultured normal corneal epithelial cells were exposed to UV-radiation and stained for DDR proteins at 3, 6 and 24 hours after irradiation to quantify the time taken by cells with intact DDR pathway to repair damage. These cells, when exposed to UV showed nuclear translocation of DDR proteins at 3 and 6 hours which reduced significantly by 24 hours confirming that the damaged DNA was being actively repaired leading to cell survival. The persistent presence of the DDR proteins in XP corneas indicates that damage is being actively recognized and DNA replication is stalled, thereby causing accumulation of damaged DNA leading to cell death, which would explain the cancer incidence and cell loss reported in these patients.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Overwhelming stress potentially results in the occurrence of many mental diseases. The amygdala is one region in the brain targeted by stress. Recent studies have shown that changes in the amygdala of subjects under stress are related to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, researchers have not clearly elucidated the changes in the amygdala in response to stress and the underlying mechanism. We conducted several experiments to understand this mechanism. METHODS: In this study, we first established a rat model of chronic restraint stress (CRS) and observed the changes in behavior and neurons in the amygdala. Second, an integrated metabolomics and proteomics experiment was conducted to identify potential stress-related biomarkers. Finally, we validated two molecules of interest and detected four apoptosis-related proteins using Western blotting to further determine the related mechanisms. RESULTS: Our study revealed the presence of anxiety-like behaviors and pathological changes in amygdalar neurons in the rat model. In the multi-omics analysis, 19 potential molecules were identified. Western blotting confirmed consistent changes in the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 obtained in previous results. The levels of proteins in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway were increased in the CRS group. CONCLUSIONS: CRS causes anxiety-like behaviors that are potentially related to decreased levels of GABA in the amygdala. Moreover, CRS potentially alters the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 and results in circadian rhythm disorder and impairments in DNA repair and apoptosis in the amygdala through a mechanism mediated by the ATM pathway.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The treatment of advanced metastatic CRC relies on classical chemotherapy combinations (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin or irinotecan). However, their use is limited by the emergence of resistance mechanisms, including to oxaliplatin. In this context, we recently showed that the combination of oxaliplatin and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein inhibition (VE-822) is synergistic and may have a potential therapeutic effect in metastatic CRC management. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the role of the VE-822+oxaliplatin (Vox) combination on the immune response and its potential synergy with an anti-programmed-cell Death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody. We used cell lines and organoids from metastatic CRC to investigate in vitro Vox efficacy and orthotopic syngeneic mouse models of metastatic CRC to assess the efficacy of Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody and identify the involved immune cells. RESULTS: The Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination completely cured tumor-bearing mice and protected them from a rechallenge. Vox was associated with a reduction of tumor-infiltrated neutrophils, CD206+ macrophages and regulatory T cells. Vox also induced a deep depletion of blood neutrophils. The increased bone marrow granulopoiesis failed to compensate for the Vox-mediated mature neutrophil depletion. Neutrophil depletion using a mouse recombinant anti-Ly6G antibody partially mimicked the Vox effect on the tumor microenvironment, but to a lower extent compared with the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination. Vox, but not neutrophil depletion, led to the emergence of an Ly6C+ PD-1+ CD8+ T-cell population in the blood and spleen of tumor-harboring mice. These cells were proliferating, and expressed IFN-gamma, CD62L, CXCR3 and Eomes. Moreover, the proportion of tumor antigen-specific T cells and of CD122+ BCL6+ T cells, which shared phenotypic characteristics with stem-like CD8+ T cells, was increased in treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our work strongly suggests that the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination might significantly improve survival in patients with metastatic and treatment-refractory CRC by acting both on cancer cells and CD8+ T cells.",

Vox, but not neutrophil depletion, led to the emergence of an Ly6C+ PD-1+ CD8+ T-cell population in the blood and spleen of tumor-harboring mice. These cells were proliferating, and expressed IFN-gamma, CD62L, CXCR3 and Eomes. Moreover, the proportion of tumor antigen-specific T cells and of CD122+ BCL6+ T cells, which shared phenotypic characteristics with stem-like CD8+ T cells, was increased in treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our work strongly suggests that the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination might significantly improve survival in patients with metastatic and treatment-refractory CRC by acting both on cancer cells and CD8+ T cells.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The treatment of advanced metastatic CRC relies on classical chemotherapy combinations (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin or irinotecan). However, their use is limited by the emergence of resistance mechanisms, including to oxaliplatin. In this context, we recently showed that the combination of oxaliplatin and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein inhibition (VE-822) is synergistic and may have a potential therapeutic effect in metastatic CRC management. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the role of the VE-822+oxaliplatin (Vox) combination on the immune response and its potential synergy with an anti-programmed-cell Death receptor-1 (PD-1) antibody. We used cell lines and organoids from metastatic CRC to investigate in vitro Vox efficacy and orthotopic syngeneic mouse models of metastatic CRC to assess the efficacy of Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody and identify the involved immune cells. RESULTS: The Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination completely cured tumor-bearing mice and protected them from a rechallenge. Vox was associated with a reduction of tumor-infiltrated neutrophils, CD206+ macrophages and regulatory T cells. Vox also induced a deep depletion of blood neutrophils. The increased bone marrow granulopoiesis failed to compensate for the Vox-mediated mature neutrophil depletion. Neutrophil depletion using a mouse recombinant anti-Ly6G antibody partially mimicked the Vox effect on the tumor microenvironment, but to a lower extent compared with the Vox+anti-PD-1 antibody combination.

Recent studies have shown that changes in the amygdala of subjects under stress are related to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, researchers have not clearly elucidated the changes in the amygdala in response to stress and the underlying mechanism. We conducted several experiments to understand this mechanism. METHODS: In this study, we first established a rat model of chronic restraint stress (CRS) and observed the changes in behavior and neurons in the amygdala. Second, an integrated metabolomics and proteomics experiment was conducted to identify potential stress-related biomarkers. Finally, we validated two molecules of interest and detected four apoptosis-related proteins using Western blotting to further determine the related mechanisms. RESULTS: Our study revealed the presence of anxiety-like behaviors and pathological changes in amygdalar neurons in the rat model. In the multi-omics analysis, 19 potential molecules were identified. Western blotting confirmed consistent changes in the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 obtained in previous results. The levels of proteins in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway were increased in the CRS group. CONCLUSIONS: CRS causes anxiety-like behaviors that are potentially related to decreased levels of GABA in the amygdala. Moreover, CRS potentially alters the levels of Cry1 and Brcc36 and results in circadian rhythm disorder and impairments in DNA repair and apoptosis in the amygdala through a mechanism mediated by the ATM pathway.",

Here we performed whole-genome sequencing analyses to characterize genetic variation in 235 individuals (from 209 families) with ataxia-telangiectasia, a severely debilitating and life-threatening recessive genetic disorder2,3, yielding a complete molecular diagnosis in almost all individuals. We developed a predictive taxonomy to assess the amenability of each individual to splice-switching ASO intervention; 9% and 6% of the individuals had variants that were 'probably' or 'possibly' amenable to ASO splice modulation, respectively. Most amenable variants were in deep intronic regions that are inaccessible to exon-targeted sequencing. We developed ASOs that successfully rescued mis-splicing and ATM cellular signalling in patient fibroblasts for two recurrent variants. In a pilot clinical study, one of these ASOs was used to treat a child who had been diagnosed with ataxia-telangiectasia soon after birth, and showed good tolerability without serious adverse events for three years. Our study provides a framework for the prospective identification of individuals with genetic diseases who might benefit from a therapeutic approach involving splice-switching ASOs.",

Here, we examined the impact of high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon-ion irradiation on the expression of PD-L1 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. We found that the upregulation of PD-L1 expression after high LET carbon-ion irradiation was greater than that induced by X-rays at the same physical and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) dose, and that the upregulation of PD-L1 induced by high LET carbon-ion irradiation was predominantly dependent on ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase activity. Moreover, we showed that the downstream signaling, e.g. STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression, was upregulated to a greater extent after high LET carbon-ion irradiation than X-rays, and that IRF1 upregulation was also ATR dependent. Finally, to visualize PD-L1 molecules on the cell surface in 3D, we applied immunofluorescence-based super-resolution imaging. The three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) analyses revealed substantial increases in the number of presented PD-L1 molecules on the cell surface after high LET carbon-ion irradiation compared with X-ray irradiation.",

However, the tumor often acquires radiation resistance, which is characterized by an increased DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that CD73, which generates extracellular adenosine from ATP, and A2B receptor, which is activated by adenosine, are involved in the gamma-radiation-induced DDR and the enhanced migration ability of human glioblastoma cell line A172. To investigate DDR, we evaluated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation and focus formation of histone H2A isoform gamma (gammaH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) in the nucleus of A172 cells after gamma-irradiation. Antagonists of A2B receptor and CD73, or knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA), suppressed gamma-radiation-induced DDR and promoted gamma-radiation-induced cell death, as well as suppressing gamma-radiation-induced cell migration and actin remodeling. These results suggest that activation of A2B receptor by extracellular adenosine generated via CD73 promotes gamma-radiation-induced DDR, leading to recovery from DNA damage, and also enhances cell migration and actin remodeling. The CD73-A2B receptor pathway may be a promising target for overcoming radiation resistance and the acquisition of malignant phenotypes during radiotherapy of glioblastoma.",

                    "abstract": "Steroid hormone signaling induces vast gene expression programs which necessitate the local formation of transcription factories at regulatory regions and large-scale alterations of the genome architecture to allow communication among distantly related cis-acting regions. This involves major stress at the genomic DNA level. Transcriptionally active regions are generally instable and prone to breakage due to the torsional stress and local depletion of nucleosomes that make DNA more accessible to damaging agents. A dedicated DNA damage response (DDR) is therefore essential to maintain genome integrity at these exposed regions. The DDR is a complex network involving DNA damage sensor proteins, such as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, as central regulators. The tight interplay between the DDR and steroid hormone receptors has been unraveled recently. Several DNA repair factors interact with the androgen and estrogen receptors and support their transcriptional functions. Conversely, both receptors directly control the expression of agents involved in the DDR. Impaired DDR is also exploited by tumors to acquire advantageous mutations. Cancer cells often harbor germline or somatic alterations in DDR genes, and their association with disease outcome and treatment response led to intensive efforts towards identifying selective inhibitors targeting the major players in this process. The PARP-1 inhibitors are now approved for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer with specific genomic alterations. Additional DDR-targeting agents are being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or in combination with treatments eliciting DNA damage (e.g., radiation therapy, including targeted radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) or addressing targets involved in maintenance of genome integrity. Recent preclinical and clinical findings made in addressing DNA repair dysfunction in hormone-dependent and -independent prostate and breast tumors are presented. Importantly, the combination of anti-hormonal therapy with DDR inhibition or with radiation has the potential to enhance efficacy but still needs further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "Proton Bragg peak irradiation has a higher ionizing density than conventional photon irradiation or the entrance of the proton beam profile. Whether targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) could enhance vulnerability to the distinct pattern of damage induced by proton Bragg peak irradiation is currently unknown. Here, we performed genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of key DDR elements and evaluated DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and tumor control in cell lines and xenografts treated with the same physical dose across a radiotherapy linear energy transfer spectrum. Radiotherapy consisted of 6 MV photons and the entrance beam or Bragg peak of a 76.8 MeV spot scanning proton beam. More complex DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced by Bragg peak proton irradiation preferentially underwent resection and engaged homologous recombination (HR) machinery. Unexpectedly, the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor, AZD0156, but not an inhibitor of ATM and Rad3-related, rendered cells hypersensitive to more densely ionizing proton Bragg peak irradiation. ATM inhibition blocked resection and shunted more DSBs to processing by toxic ligation through nonhomologous end-joining, whereas loss of DNA ligation via XRCC4 or Lig4 knockdown rescued resection and abolished the enhanced Bragg peak cell killing. Proton Bragg peak monotherapy selectively sensitized cell lines and tumor xenografts with inherent HR defects, and the repair defect induced by ATM inhibitor coadministration showed enhanced efficacy in HR-proficient models. In summary, inherent defects in HR or administration of an ATM inhibitor in HR-proficient tumors selectively enhances the relative biological effectiveness of proton Bragg peak irradiation. SIGNIFICANCE: Coadministration of an ATM inhibitor rewires DNA repair machinery to render cancer cells uniquely hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by the proton Bragg peak, which is characterized by higher density ionization.See related commentary by Nickoloff, p. 3156.",

This trial assessed the safety, preliminary efficacy, and tolerance of berzosertib in oesophageal cancer (A1 cohort) with RT and advanced solid tumours (A2 cohort) with cisplatin and capecitabine. METHODS: Single-arm, open-label dose-escalation (Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method) trial with 16 patients in A1 and 18 in A2. A1 tested six dose levels of berzosertib with RT (35 Gy over 15 fractions in 3 weeks). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in A1. Eight grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in five patients, with rash being the most common. The highest dose (240 mg/m2) was determined as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for A1. Seven DLTs in two patients in A2. The RP2D of berzosertib was 140 mg/m2 once weekly. The most common grade >=3 treatment-related AEs were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib combined with RT is feasible and well tolerated in oesophageal cancer patients at high palliative doses. Berzosertib with cisplatin and capecitabine was well tolerated in advanced cancer. Further investigation is warranted in a phase 2 setting.

The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, based on dosimetric data refined the normal tissue dose/volume tolerance guidelines. In parallel, the radiation-induced nucleoshuttling (RIANS) of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein (pATM) is a predictive approach of individual intrinsic radiosensitivity. Here, we combined NTCP with RADIODTECT , a blood assay derived from the RIANS model, to predict RT toxicity in HNSCC patients. METHODS: RADIODTECT  cutoff values (i.e. 57.8 ng/mL for grade>=2 toxicity and 46 ng/mL for grade>=3 toxicity) have been previously assessed. Validation was performed on a prospective cohort of 36 HNSCC patients treated with postoperative RT. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale and two criteria were considered: grade>=2 oral mucositis (OM2), grade>=3 mucositis (OM3) and grade>=2 dysphagia (DY2), grade>=3 dysphagia (DY3). pATM quantification was assessed in lymphocytes of HNSCC patients. The discrimination power of the pATM assay was evaluated through the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC). Two previously described NTCP models were considered, including the dose to the oral cavity and the mean dose to the parotid glands (OM2 and OM3) and the dose to the oral cavity, to the larynx and the volume of pharyngeal constrictor muscles (DY2 and DY3). RESULTS: Combining NTCP models with RADIODTECT  blood test improved the AUC-ROC. Considering the prediction of mucositis, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.80 was for OM2, and AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.78 for OM3. Considering the prediction of acute dysphagia, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.71 for DY2 and for DY3. CONCLUSIONS: Combining NTCP models with a radiosensitivity biomarker might significantly improve the prediction of toxicities for HNSCC patients.",

We investigated whether combining RT with an ataxia-telangiectasia mutated inhibitor promoted these effects and amplified tumor immunity. METHODS: Mice-bearing syngeneic flank tumors (MOC2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or B78 melanoma) were treated with tumor-directed RT and oral administration of AZD0156. Specific immune cell depletion, type 1 interferon receptor 1 knock-out mice (IFNAR1-KO), and STING-deficient tumor cells were used to investigate tumor-immune crosstalk following RT and AZD0156 treatment. RESULTS: Combining RT and AZD0156 reduced tumor growth compared with RT or AZD0156 alone in mice bearing MOC2 or B78 tumors. Low-dose AZD0156 (1-100 nM) alone did not affect tumor cell proliferation but suppressed tumor cell clonogenicity in combination with RT. Low-dose AZD0156 with RT synergistically increased IFN-beta, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells. In contrast to wild-type mice, IFNAR1-KO mice showed reduced CD8+T cell tumor infiltration and poor survival following RT+AZD0156 treatment. CD8+T cell depletion reduced antitumor response during RT+AZD0156 treatment. STING-deficient MOC2 (MOC2-STING+/-) or B78 (B78-STING-/-) tumors eliminated the effects of RT+AZD0156 on the expression of IFN-beta, MHC-I, and PD-L1, and reduced CD8+T cell infiltration and migration. Additional anti-PD-L1 therapy promoted antitumor response by elevation of tumor-MHC-I and lymphocyte activation. CONCLUSIONS: Combined radiation and AZD0156 increase STING-dependent antitumor response.

                    "abstract": "Cancer-specific metabolic changes support the anabolic needs of the rapidly growing tumor, maintain a favorable redox balance, and help cells adapt to microenvironmental stresses like hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Radiation is extensively applied in a large number of cancer treatment protocols but despite its curative potential, radiation resistance and treatment failures pose a serious problem. Metabolic control of DNA integrity and genomic stability can occur through multiple processes, encompassing cell cycle regulation, nucleotide synthesis, epigenetic regulation of gene activity, and antioxidant defenses. Given the important role of metabolic pathways in oxidative damage responses, it is necessary to assess the potential for tumor-specific radiosensitization by novel metabolism-targeted therapies. Additionally, there are opportunities to identify molecular and functional biomarkers of vulnerabilities to combination treatments, which could then inform clinical decisions. Here, we present a curated list of metabolic pathways in the context of ionizing radiation responses. Glutamine metabolism influences DNA damage responses by mechanisms such as synthesis of nucleotides for DNA repair or of glutathione for ROS detoxification. Repurposed oxygen consumption inhibitors have shown promising radiosensitizing activity against murine model tumors and are now in clinical trials. Production of 2-hydroxy glutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase1/2 neomorphic oncogenic mutants interferes with the function of alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes and modulates Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) signaling and glutathione pools. Radiation-induced oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids promotes ferroptotic cell loss and cooperates with immunotherapies to improve tumor control. In summary, there are opportunities to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy by exploiting cell-inherent vulnerabilities and dynamic microenvironmental components of the tumor.",

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a core component of the DNA repair system. Although the ATM gene has a significant mutation rate in many human cancers, including colorectal, prostate, lung, and breast, it remains understudied compared with other DDR-involved molecules such as PARP and ATR. Here, we found that either gene knockout or drug intervention, ATM inhibition activated the cGAS/STING pathway and augmented MHC class I in CRC cells, and these effects could be amplified by radiation. Furthermore, we found that MHC class I upregulation induced by ATM inhibition is dependent on the activation of the NFkappaB/IRF1/NLRC5 pathway and independent of STING. Animal experiments have shown increasing infiltration and cytotoxic function of T cells and better survival in ATM-deficient tumors. This work indicated that ATM nonsense mutation predicted the clinical benefits of radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade for patients with CRC. It also provides a molecular mechanism rationale for ATM-targeted agents for patients with CRC.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy (RT) against head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) may lead to severe toxicity in 30-40% of patients. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, based on dosimetric data refined the normal tissue dose/volume tolerance guidelines. In parallel, the radiation-induced nucleoshuttling (RIANS) of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein (pATM) is a predictive approach of individual intrinsic radiosensitivity. Here, we combined NTCP with RADIODTECT , a blood assay derived from the RIANS model, to predict RT toxicity in HNSCC patients. METHODS: RADIODTECT  cutoff values (i.e. 57.8 ng/mL for grade>=2 toxicity and 46 ng/mL for grade>=3 toxicity) have been previously assessed. Validation was performed on a prospective cohort of 36 HNSCC patients treated with postoperative RT. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale and two criteria were considered: grade>=2 oral mucositis (OM2), grade>=3 mucositis (OM3) and grade>=2 dysphagia (DY2), grade>=3 dysphagia (DY3). pATM quantification was assessed in lymphocytes of HNSCC patients. The discrimination power of the pATM assay was evaluated through the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC). Two previously described NTCP models were considered, including the dose to the oral cavity and the mean dose to the parotid glands (OM2 and OM3) and the dose to the oral cavity, to the larynx and the volume of pharyngeal constrictor muscles (DY2 and DY3). RESULTS: Combining NTCP models with RADIODTECT  blood test improved the AUC-ROC. Considering the prediction of mucositis, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.80 was for OM2, and AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.78 for OM3. Considering the prediction of acute dysphagia, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.71 for DY2 and for DY3. CONCLUSIONS: Combining NTCP models with a radiosensitivity biomarker might significantly improve the prediction of toxicities for HNSCC patients.",

Germline ATM-deficiencies underlie ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), a disease manifested by radio-sensitivity, immunodeficiency and predisposition to lymphoid malignancies. A-T patients diagnosed with malignancies have poor tolerance to chemotherapy or radiation. We investigated chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells using primary T-cells from patients with A-T (ATM-/-), heterozygote donors (ATM+/-) and healthy donors. ATM-/- T-cells proliferate and can be successfully transduced with CARs, though functional impairment of ATM-/- CAR-T cells was observed. Retroviral transduction of the CAR in ATM-/- T-cells resulted in high rates of chromosomal lesions at CAR insertion sites, as confirmed by next-generation long-read sequencing. This work suggests that ATM is essential to preserve genome integrity of CAR-T cells during retroviral manufacturing, and its lack poses a risk of chromosomal translocations and potential leukemogenicity.",

Treatment of malignancies in BS patients with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is believed to be associated with increased toxicity, but clinical and laboratory data are lacking. We collected clinical data of two Dutch BS patients with solid tumors. Both were treated with radiotherapy before the diagnosis BS was made and tolerated this treatment well. In addition, we collected fibroblasts from BS patients to perform in vitro clonogenic survival assays to determine radiosensitivity. BS fibroblasts showed less radiosensitivity than the severely radiosensitive Artemis fibroblasts. Moreover, studies of double strand break kinetics by counting 53BP1 foci after irradiation showed similar patterns compared to healthy controls.

However, the tumor often acquires radiation resistance, which is characterized by an increased DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that CD73, which generates extracellular adenosine from ATP, and A2B receptor, which is activated by adenosine, are involved in the gamma-radiation-induced DDR and the enhanced migration ability of human glioblastoma cell line A172. To investigate DDR, we evaluated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation and focus formation of histone H2A isoform gamma (gammaH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) in the nucleus of A172 cells after gamma-irradiation. Antagonists of A2B receptor and CD73, or knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA), suppressed gamma-radiation-induced DDR and promoted gamma-radiation-induced cell death, as well as suppressing gamma-radiation-induced cell migration and actin remodeling. These results suggest that activation of A2B receptor by extracellular adenosine generated via CD73 promotes gamma-radiation-induced DDR, leading to recovery from DNA damage, and also enhances cell migration and actin remodeling. The CD73-A2B receptor pathway may be a promising target for overcoming radiation resistance and the acquisition of malignant phenotypes during radiotherapy of glioblastoma.",

However, the insensitivity of some tumor cells to radiation is one of the major reasons for the poor efficacy of radiotherapy and the poor prognosis of patients, and exploring the underlying mechanisms behind radioresistance is the key to solving this clinical challenge. This study aimed to identify the molecules associated with radioresistance in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), identified thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13 (TRIP13) as the main target initially, and explored whether TRIP13 is related to radioresistance in LUAD and the specific mechanism, with the aim of providing theoretical basis and potential targets for the combination therapy of LUAD patients receiving radiotherapy in the clinic. METHODS: Three datasets, GSE18842, GSE19188 and GSE33532, were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and screened for differentially expressed genes ( log FC >1.5, P<0.05) in each of the three datasets using the R 4.1.3 software, and then Venn diagram was used to find out the differentially expressed genes common to the three datasets. The screened differential genes were then subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and module analysis with the help of STRING online tool and Cytoscape software, and survival prognosis analysis was performed for each gene with the help of Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, and the TRIP13 gene was identified as the main molecule for subsequent studies. Subsequently, the human LUAD cell line H292 was irradiated with multiple X-rays using a sub-lethal dose irradiation method to construct a radioresistant cell line, H292DR. The radioresistance of H292DR cells was verified using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and clone formation assay. The expression levels of TRIP13 in H292 and H292DR cells were measured by Western blot. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence the expression of TRIP13 in H292DR cells and Western blot assay was performed. The clone formation ability and migration ability of H292DR cells were observed after TRIP13 silencing, followed by the detection of changes in the expression levels of proteins closely related to homologous recombination, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein. RESULTS: Screening of multiple GEO datasets, validation of external datasets and survival analysis revealed that TRIP13 was highly expressed in LUAD and was associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients who had received radiation therapy. And the results of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of TRIP13 suggested that TRIP13 might be closely associated with LUAD radioresistance by promoting homologous recombination repair after radiation therapy. Experimentally, TRIP13 expression was found to be upregulated in H292DR, and silencing of TRIP13 was able to increase the sensitivity of H292DR cells to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: TRIP13 is associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients treated with radiation, possibly by promoting a homologous recombination repair pathway to mediate resistance of LUAD cells to radiation.",

AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the currently approved and most promising candidate pharmacotherapies in relation to the known disease mechanisms of the most prevalent autosomal recessive ataxias. Omaveloxolone is an Nrf2 activator that increases antioxidant defense and was recently approved for treatment of Friedreich ataxia. Its therapeutic effect is modest, and further research is needed to find synergistic treatments that would halt or reverse disease progression. Promising approaches include upregulation of frataxin expression by epigenetic mechanisms, direct protein replacement, and gene replacement therapy. For ataxia-telangiectasia, promising approaches include splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Rare recessive ataxias for which disease-modifying therapies exist are also reviewed, emphasizing recently approved therapies. Evidence supporting the use of riluzole and acetyl-leucine in recessive ataxias is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Advances in genetic therapies for other neurogenetic conditions have paved the way to implement feasible approaches with potential dramatic benefits. Particularly, as we develop effective treatments for these conditions, we may need to combine therapies, consider newborn testing for pre-symptomatic treatment, and optimize non-pharmacological approaches.",

However, experience in the transplantation strategy for A-T patients is still scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate whether different approaches of HSCT are feasible in regard to graft versus host response and sufficient concerning functional immune reconstitution. Atm-deficient mice were treated with a clinically relevant non-myeloablative host-conditioning regimen and transplanted with CD90.2-depleted, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing, and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-competent bone marrow donor cells in a syngeneic, haploidentical or allogeneic setting. Like syngeneic HSCT, haploidentical HSCT, but not allogeneic HSCT extended the lifespan of Atm-deficient mice through the reduction of thymic tumors and normalized T-cell numbers. Donor-derived splenocytes isolated from transplanted Atm-deficient mice filled the gap of cell loss in the naive T-cell population and raised CD4 cell functionality up to wild-type level. Interestingly, HSCT using heterozygous donor cells let to a significantly improved survival of Atm-deficient mice and increased CD4 cell numbers as well as CD4 cell functionality equivalent to HSCT using with wild-type donor cells.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Advances in germline genetic testing have led to a surge in identification of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) variant carriers among breast cancer patients, raising numerous questions regarding use of breast radiation therapy (RT) in this population. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed identified articles assessing association(s) between the germline ATM variant status and the risk of toxicity after breast RT. An expert panel of breast radiation oncologists, genetic counselors, and basic scientists convened to review the association between ATM variants and radiation-induced toxicity or secondary malignancy risk and to determine any impact on breast RT recommendations. RESULTS: Carriers of pathogenic variants in ATM have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk for developing breast cancer. ATM variants do not consistently increase risks of toxicities after RT, except possibly among patients with the single nucleotide variant c5557G>A (rs1801516), in whom a small increased risk for the development of both acute and late radiation effects has been identified. In most breast cancer patients with ATM variants, the excess 5-year absolute risk of developing a secondary contralateral breast cancer (CBC) after radiation is extremely low. The exception is in women younger than 45 years old with deleterious rare ATM missense variants, who may be at higher risk for developing a radiation-induced CBC over time. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiation is safe for most breast cancer patients who harbor ATM variants. The possible exceptions are patients with the variant c5557G>A (rs1801516) and patients younger than 45 years old with certain rare deleterious ATM variants, who may be at higher risk for developing CBC. These latter patients should be counseled regarding this potential risk, and every effort should be made to minimize the contralateral breast dose. However, the inconsistency of published data limits precise recommendations, magnifying the need for further prospective studies and the development of a centralized database cataloging RT outcomes and genetic status.",

Poor response to treatment, excessive chemotherapy toxicities, and the need for avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation make the successful clinical management of patients with AT challenging for oncologists. We describe the favorable outcome of the LBCL with IRF4 rearrangement at stage III in a 7-year-old female patient diagnosed with AT. The patient was treated according to the B-HR arm of the INTER-B-NHL-COP 2010 protocol, including the administration of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, etc. She presented excessive treatment toxicities despite individually reduced doses of methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. However, in the MRI there was no significant reduction in pathologic lymph nodes after three immunochemotherapy courses. Therefore, a lymph node biopsy was taken. Its subsequent histopathological examination revealed tuberculosis-like changes, though tuberculosis suspicion was excluded. After two following immunochemotherapy courses, PET-CT confirmed complete remission. From March 2022 onwards, the patient has remained in remission under the care of the outpatient children's oncology clinic.",

This clinical conundrum poses three challenges for local drug delivery systems: stable and continuous delivery, good biocompatibility, and the ability to package new targeted drugs that can synergizing with other treatments.Here, we report a drug-laden hydrogel generated from pure DNA strands and highly programmable in adjusting its mesh size. Meanwhile, the DNA hydrogel could assist the micro-crystallization of a novel radiosensitizing drugs, ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor (Elimusertib), further facilitating its long-term release. When applied to the tumor site, the hydrogel system demonstrated significant antitumor activity, minimized systemic toxicity, and had a modulatory effect on the tumor-immune cell interface.

                    "abstract": "Steroid hormone signaling induces vast gene expression programs which necessitate the local formation of transcription factories at regulatory regions and large-scale alterations of the genome architecture to allow communication among distantly related cis-acting regions. This involves major stress at the genomic DNA level. Transcriptionally active regions are generally instable and prone to breakage due to the torsional stress and local depletion of nucleosomes that make DNA more accessible to damaging agents. A dedicated DNA damage response (DDR) is therefore essential to maintain genome integrity at these exposed regions. The DDR is a complex network involving DNA damage sensor proteins, such as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, as central regulators. The tight interplay between the DDR and steroid hormone receptors has been unraveled recently. Several DNA repair factors interact with the androgen and estrogen receptors and support their transcriptional functions. Conversely, both receptors directly control the expression of agents involved in the DDR. Impaired DDR is also exploited by tumors to acquire advantageous mutations. Cancer cells often harbor germline or somatic alterations in DDR genes, and their association with disease outcome and treatment response led to intensive efforts towards identifying selective inhibitors targeting the major players in this process. The PARP-1 inhibitors are now approved for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer with specific genomic alterations. Additional DDR-targeting agents are being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or in combination with treatments eliciting DNA damage (e.g., radiation therapy, including targeted radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) or addressing targets involved in maintenance of genome integrity. Recent preclinical and clinical findings made in addressing DNA repair dysfunction in hormone-dependent and -independent prostate and breast tumors are presented. Importantly, the combination of anti-hormonal therapy with DDR inhibition or with radiation has the potential to enhance efficacy but still needs further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "OPINION STATEMENT: Metastatic (and locally advanced) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDA) represents a major challenge for the oncology community given the rising mortality burden from the disease and the preponderance of patients diagnosed with unresectable disease. Although systemic therapies have become more potent with the development of fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatments, the median overall survival for patients treated with either of these regimens remains just above 1 year. A significant need exists to build upon the effectiveness of first-line regimens, incorporate tolerable maintenance treatments, and add effective later-line options for patients with this disease. We believe every newly diagnosed mPDA patient should undergo next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing, preferably from tumor tissue, to assess for the presence of DNA damage repair (DDR) defects, microsatellite instability, and other possible actionable molecular alterations (such as neurotrophic tropomysin receptor kinase (NTRK) fusions, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification). Existing clinical data suggests that patients, whose tumors harbor DDR defects, benefit from treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Preclinically, inhibitors of other critical players in DDR such as ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and WEE1 have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in PDA cell lines and xenografts. How to move forward the preclinical promise of these newer DDR-targeting therapies into rational clinical trial combinations and sequence PARP inhibitors in relation to platinum chemotherapy remain areas of tremendous clinical research interest. We believe clinical trials should be considered early for mPDA patients, in all treatment lines, so that novel therapies may be added to the treatment armamentarium for patients with this disease. Beyond NGS testing from tumor tissue, we believe it is important to consider germline genetic testing for all patients diagnosed with PDA given recent data suggesting a much stronger hereditary component of the disease than previously understood, and the potential screening implications for family members.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking. Observations: This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.",

Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a key regulator of DNA damage response and an emerging therapeutic target; however, the association between the expression of ATM and the prognosis in advanced BTC is unknown. We aimed to identify the relationship between ATM expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and survival outcomes in patients with advanced BTC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 113 patients with advanced BTC who received first-line gemcitabine and platinum. RESULTS: The tumor location was intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH-CCC) in 43 patients, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCC) in 49, and gallbladder (GB) cancer in 21 patients. Fifty-four patients (47.8%) exhibited loss of ATM protein expression. The overall response rate (ORR) of ATM loss and intact ATM was 13.3% and 19.6%, respectively. In a subgroup analysis, EH-CCC patients with ATM loss tended to have improved PFS after platinum-based chemotherapy compared to those with intact ATM (7.9 vs. 6.2 months, respectively; p=0.050). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that ATM loss could be a prognostic marker after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced EH-CCC.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking. Observations: This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.",

                    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer, and is ranked the sixth most common neoplasm and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Photothermal therapy (PTT) for thermal ablation of local tumors has recently emerged as a therapeutic strategy. However, the relatively high temperature of over 50  C may lead to unexpected heat-related damage to tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Herein, we designed and synthesized ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor loaded hollow-structured CuS NPs with surface modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody (CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs are highly photo-stable, can release encapsulated drugs, and increase the temperature to an effective level in a near-infrared (NIR)-responsive manner. Moreover, CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs specifically target tumors and thereby significantly inhibit tumor growth on contribution to synergistic low-temperature PTT and chemotherapy. This system not only achieved low-temperature PTT but also resulted in reduced damage to normal tissues. Modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody enhanced target specificity and immune activation. The combination of PTT and ATM inhibitor showed synergistic effects and significantly attenuated the growth of the HCC via down regulation of heat shock protein (HSP). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs are a highly promising platform for targeted tumor ablation via hyperthermia-mediated tumor death with minimal damage to normal tissues at a low temperature. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We constructed ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor-loaded hollow-structured CuS NPs with surface modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody (CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs). CuS-ATMi@TGF-beta NPs not only achieved low-temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) but also resulted in reduced damage to normal tissues and sufficient biocompatibility. The modification with anti-TGF-beta antibody enhanced targeted specificity, cell endocytosis, and immune activation. In addition, the combination of PTT and ATM inhibitor synergistically attenuated the growth of the HCC via downregulation of heat shock protein (HSP). This study provided proof-of-concept for the ATM inhibitor that mediated low-temperature PTT with a potential for future clinical applications.",

CAPRI (NCT03462342) is an investigator-initiated study of olaparib plus ceralasertib in recurrent HGSOC. Herein, we present results from the platinum-resistant cohort. METHODS: A Simon 2-stage design was utilized. Platinum-resistant HGSOC patients received ceralasertib 160 mg orally daily, days 1-7 and olaparib 300 mg orally twice daily, days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle until toxicity or progression. Primary endpoints were toxicity and efficacy including objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST. Secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The null hypothesis (<=5% ORR) would be rejected if there were >= 1 responses in 12 patients. RESULTS: Fourteen PARPi-naive patients were evaluable for toxicity; 12 were evaluable for response. Three had BRCA1 mutations (1 germline, 2 somatic). Adverse events possibly related to treatment were primarily grade (G) 1/2. G3 toxicities included nausea (14.3%), fatigue (7.1%), anorexia (7.1%), and anemia (7.1%). No objective responses occurred. Best response was stable disease in 9 patients and progressive disease in three. Five patients had a >= 20% to <30% reduction in disease burden, including 3 with BRCA1 mutations.

                    "abstract": "Bloom Syndrome (BS) is a genetic DNA repair disorder, caused by mutations in the BLM gene. The clinical phenotype includes growth retardation, immunodeficiency and a strong predisposition to different types of malignancies. Treatment of malignancies in BS patients with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is believed to be associated with increased toxicity, but clinical and laboratory data are lacking. We collected clinical data of two Dutch BS patients with solid tumors. Both were treated with radiotherapy before the diagnosis BS was made and tolerated this treatment well. In addition, we collected fibroblasts from BS patients to perform in vitro clonogenic survival assays to determine radiosensitivity. BS fibroblasts showed less radiosensitivity than the severely radiosensitive Artemis fibroblasts. Moreover, studies of double strand break kinetics by counting 53BP1 foci after irradiation showed similar patterns compared to healthy controls. In combination, the clinical cases and laboratory experiments are valuable information in the discussion whether radiotherapy is absolutely contraindicated in BS, which is the Case in other DNA repair syndromes like Ataxia Telangiectasia and Artemis.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is limited by the development of drug resistance. Recent studies demonstrated the efficacy of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunotherapies in metastatic prostate cancer. The ataxia telangiectasia mutation (ATM) protein plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and function of mitosis. Here, we aimed to determine whether PD-1/PD-L1 signaling contributes to the resistance to DTX and to elucidate the mechanism underlying DTX-induced PD-L1 expression. METHODS: In this retrospective study, PD-L1 expression was analyzed in 33 tumor tissue samples from prostate cancer patients. Prostate cell lines were used to perform functional assays and examine underlying mechanisms in vitro. A fully mouse prostate cancer model and a humanized chimeric mouse bearing human prostate tumors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used for in vivo assays. RESULTS: We have shown that DTX, a chemotherapeutic drug which causing microtubule interference, could significantly induce the expression of PD-L1 in prostate cancer cells. This effect is blocked by the inhibition of ATM, suggesting that it plays an essential role in PD-L1 expression upregulated by DTX. Mechanistic studies have shown that ATM activity in cancer cells enhances the stability of the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), which leading to an increase in the NF-kappaB activity and PD-L1 expression. Using the mouse model, it was further demonstrated that a combination of ATM and NEMO inhibitors along with DTX augmented the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy, which are comparable to that of PD-L1 antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have revealed that a previously unrecognized ATM-NEMO signaling which induced by DTX is capable of suppressing tumor immunity by activating the expression of PD-L1, suggesting that the ATM-NEMO-NF-kappaB axis can be exploited to restore the immune balance and overcome cancer resistance triggered by DTX.Graphic Abstract: supplementary file 1.",

                    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system and is treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, the tumor often acquires radiation resistance, which is characterized by an increased DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that CD73, which generates extracellular adenosine from ATP, and A2B receptor, which is activated by adenosine, are involved in the gamma-radiation-induced DDR and the enhanced migration ability of human glioblastoma cell line A172. To investigate DDR, we evaluated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation and focus formation of histone H2A isoform gamma (gammaH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) in the nucleus of A172 cells after gamma-irradiation. Antagonists of A2B receptor and CD73, or knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA), suppressed gamma-radiation-induced DDR and promoted gamma-radiation-induced cell death, as well as suppressing gamma-radiation-induced cell migration and actin remodeling. These results suggest that activation of A2B receptor by extracellular adenosine generated via CD73 promotes gamma-radiation-induced DDR, leading to recovery from DNA damage, and also enhances cell migration and actin remodeling. The CD73-A2B receptor pathway may be a promising target for overcoming radiation resistance and the acquisition of malignant phenotypes during radiotherapy of glioblastoma.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Platinum-resistant, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has limited treatment options. Preclinical data suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitors (ATRi) are synergistic. CAPRI (NCT03462342) is an investigator-initiated study of olaparib plus ceralasertib in recurrent HGSOC. Herein, we present results from the platinum-resistant cohort. METHODS: A Simon 2-stage design was utilized. Platinum-resistant HGSOC patients received ceralasertib 160 mg orally daily, days 1-7 and olaparib 300 mg orally twice daily, days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle until toxicity or progression. Primary endpoints were toxicity and efficacy including objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST. Secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The null hypothesis (<=5% ORR) would be rejected if there were >= 1 responses in 12 patients. RESULTS: Fourteen PARPi-naive patients were evaluable for toxicity; 12 were evaluable for response. Three had BRCA1 mutations (1 germline, 2 somatic). Adverse events possibly related to treatment were primarily grade (G) 1/2. G3 toxicities included nausea (14.3%), fatigue (7.1%), anorexia (7.1%), and anemia (7.1%). No objective responses occurred. Best response was stable disease in 9 patients and progressive disease in three. Five patients had a >= 20% to <30% reduction in disease burden, including 3 with BRCA1 mutations. Three of 11 patients (27%; 2 with BRCA1 mutations) evaluable by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria had >50% CA-125 decline, including 2 with CA-125 normalization. Median PFS was 4.2 months overall (90% CI:3.5-8.2) and 8.2 months (3.6 months-not determined) for patients with BRCA1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib plus ceralasertib is well-tolerated. No objective responses occurred, though a signal of activity was seen particularly in disease associated with BRCA1. Further evaluation of this combination should include alternate dosing strategies in genomically-selected populations.",

However, experience in the transplantation strategy for A-T patients is still scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate whether different approaches of HSCT are feasible in regard to graft versus host response and sufficient concerning functional immune reconstitution. Atm-deficient mice were treated with a clinically relevant non-myeloablative host-conditioning regimen and transplanted with CD90.2-depleted, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing, and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-competent bone marrow donor cells in a syngeneic, haploidentical or allogeneic setting. Like syngeneic HSCT, haploidentical HSCT, but not allogeneic HSCT extended the lifespan of Atm-deficient mice through the reduction of thymic tumors and normalized T-cell numbers. Donor-derived splenocytes isolated from transplanted Atm-deficient mice filled the gap of cell loss in the naive T-cell population and raised CD4 cell functionality up to wild-type level. Interestingly, HSCT using heterozygous donor cells let to a significantly improved survival of Atm-deficient mice and increased CD4 cell numbers as well as CD4 cell functionality equivalent to HSCT using with wild-type donor cells. Our data provided evidence that haploidentical HSCT could be a feasible strategy for A-T, possibly even if the donor is heterozygous for ATM. However, this basic research cannot substitute any research in humans.",

Since allogenic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation improved disease outcome, gene therapy based on autologous HSCs is an alternative promising concept. However, due to the large cDNA of ATM (9.2 kb), efficient packaging of retroviral particles and sufficient transduction of HSCs remains challenging.We generated lentiviral, gammaretroviral and foamy viral vectors with a GFP.F2A.Atm fusion or a GFP transgene and systematically compared transduction efficiencies. Vector titers dropped with increasing transgene size, but despite their described limited packaging capacity, we were able to produce lentiviral and gammaretroviral particles. The reduction in titers could not be explained by impaired packaging of the viral genomes, but the main differences occurred after transduction. Finally, after transduction of Atm-deficient (ATM-KO) murine fibroblasts with the lentiviral vector expressing Atm, we could show the expression of ATM protein which phosphorylated its downstream substrates (pKap1 and p-p53).",

Impaired function of this kinase leads to a multisystemic disorder including immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar degeneration, radiation sensitivity, dilated blood vessels, premature aging and a predisposition to cancer. Since allogenic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation improved disease outcome, gene therapy based on autologous HSCs is an alternative promising concept. However, due to the large cDNA of ATM (9.2 kb), efficient packaging of retroviral particles and sufficient transduction of HSCs remains challenging.We generated lentiviral, gammaretroviral and foamy viral vectors with a GFP.F2A.Atm fusion or a GFP transgene and systematically compared transduction efficiencies. Vector titers dropped with increasing transgene size, but despite their described limited packaging capacity, we were able to produce lentiviral and gammaretroviral particles. The reduction in titers could not be explained by impaired packaging of the viral genomes, but the main differences occurred after transduction. Finally, after transduction of Atm-deficient (ATM-KO) murine fibroblasts with the lentiviral vector expressing Atm, we could show the expression of ATM protein which phosphorylated its downstream substrates (pKap1 and p-p53).",

We evaluated humoral and cellular responses to COVID-19 vaccines in Brazilian patients with IEI and healthy controls. Methods: Fifty-five patients with IEI (13-61 years) and 60 controls (13-71 years) received inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVac), non-replicating virus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca) or monovalent mRNA (Original strain of BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) and bivalent mRNA (Original/Omicron BA.1, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines and were sampled five times. Diagnoses included common variable immunodeficiency (n=25), specific antibody deficiency (n=9), ataxia-telangiectasia (n=5), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (n=4), PIK3CD-related disorders (n=4), hyper-IgM syndrome (n=4), combined immunodeficiency (n=3), and STAT1 gain-of-function (n=1). Humoral immunity was assessed via multiplex microarray for Spike, Nucleocapsid, RBD-Wuhan, RBD-Delta, RBD-BA.1, RBD-BA.2 and RBD-BA.5 neutralizing antibodies. T-cell responses to Spike and Nucleocapsid were assessed using ELISpot. Results: Patients with IEI exhibited significantly lower levels of Nucleocapsid and RBD-neutralizing antibodies (p < 0.05). Notable differences in RBD-BA.2 (p = 0.008) and IgG-Nucleocapsid (p = 0.010) levels emerged over time. T-cell responses to Spike were stronger in patients with IEI post-booster (405 vs. 149 spot-forming cells/million PBMC; p = 0.002). Both groups showed enhanced Nucleocapsid-specific cellular responses over time (p = 0.017). COVID-19 hospitalization rates among patients with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis dropped from 33.3% to zero after the first booster dose. Conclusions: While humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were weaker in patients with IEI, their cellular immunity was similar to controls. Boosters enhanced both humoral and cellular responses. After completion of the vaccination protocol, none of the patients with IEI were hospitalized with COVID-19.

Diagnoses included common variable immunodeficiency (n=25), specific antibody deficiency (n=9), ataxia-telangiectasia (n=5), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (n=4), PIK3CD-related disorders (n=4), hyper-IgM syndrome (n=4), combined immunodeficiency (n=3), and STAT1 gain-of-function (n=1). Humoral immunity was assessed via multiplex microarray for Spike, Nucleocapsid, RBD-Wuhan, RBD-Delta, RBD-BA.1, RBD-BA.2 and RBD-BA.5 neutralizing antibodies. T-cell responses to Spike and Nucleocapsid were assessed using ELISpot. Results: Patients with IEI exhibited significantly lower levels of Nucleocapsid and RBD-neutralizing antibodies (p < 0.05). Notable differences in RBD-BA.2 (p = 0.008) and IgG-Nucleocapsid (p = 0.010) levels emerged over time. T-cell responses to Spike were stronger in patients with IEI post-booster (405 vs. 149 spot-forming cells/million PBMC; p = 0.002). Both groups showed enhanced Nucleocapsid-specific cellular responses over time (p = 0.017). COVID-19 hospitalization rates among patients with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis dropped from 33.3% to zero after the first booster dose. Conclusions: While humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were weaker in patients with IEI, their cellular immunity was similar to controls. Boosters enhanced both humoral and cellular responses. After completion of the vaccination protocol, none of the patients with IEI were hospitalized with COVID-19. Robust T-cell responses may play a critical role in protecting patients with IEI from severe COVID-19 and mortality.",

The article explores the complex signaling pathways mediated by ATM, its interactions with other DNA repair mechanisms, and its influence on cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and metabolism. I examine the clinical implications of ATM alterations, including their impact on cancer predisposition, prognosis, and treatment response. The review highlights recent advances in ATM-targeted therapies, discussing ongoing clinical trials of ATM inhibitors and their potential in combination with other treatment modalities. I also address the challenges in developing effective biomarkers for ATM activity and patient selection strategies for personalized cancer therapy. Finally, I outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for refined biomarker development, optimized combination therapies, and strategies to overcome potential resistance mechanisms. This comprehensive overview underscores the critical importance of ATM in cancer biology and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target in precision oncology.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) elicits DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in tumor cytotoxicity and a type I interferon (IFN) response via stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation. We investigated whether combining RT with an ataxia-telangiectasia mutated inhibitor promoted these effects and amplified tumor immunity. METHODS: Mice-bearing syngeneic flank tumors (MOC2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or B78 melanoma) were treated with tumor-directed RT and oral administration of AZD0156. Specific immune cell depletion, type 1 interferon receptor 1 knock-out mice (IFNAR1-KO), and STING-deficient tumor cells were used to investigate tumor-immune crosstalk following RT and AZD0156 treatment. RESULTS: Combining RT and AZD0156 reduced tumor growth compared with RT or AZD0156 alone in mice bearing MOC2 or B78 tumors. Low-dose AZD0156 (1-100 nM) alone did not affect tumor cell proliferation but suppressed tumor cell clonogenicity in combination with RT. Low-dose AZD0156 with RT synergistically increased IFN-beta, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells. In contrast to wild-type mice, IFNAR1-KO mice showed reduced CD8+T cell tumor infiltration and poor survival following RT+AZD0156 treatment. CD8+T cell depletion reduced antitumor response during RT+AZD0156 treatment. STING-deficient MOC2 (MOC2-STING+/-) or B78 (B78-STING-/-) tumors eliminated the effects of RT+AZD0156 on the expression of IFN-beta, MHC-I, and PD-L1, and reduced CD8+T cell infiltration and migration. Additional anti-PD-L1 therapy promoted antitumor response by elevation of tumor-MHC-I and lymphocyte activation. CONCLUSIONS: Combined radiation and AZD0156 increase STING-dependent antitumor response. Tumor-derived cell-autonomous IFN-beta amplification drives both MHC-I and PD-L1 induction at the tumor cell surface, which is required by anti-PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor immune response following RT and AZD0156 combination therapy.",

Although recent advancements in immunotherapy have enhanced the response rates of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of acquired resistance invariably leads to recurrence and metastasis. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to explore novel therapeutic targets and optimize existing treatment strategies. This article comprehensively reviews the currently available therapeutic modalities for SCLC. It delves into the immunologic prognostic implications by analyzing selected immune-related signatures. Moreover, it conducts an in-depth exploration of the molecular subtyping of SCLC and the associated molecular pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, the focus is on clinical interventions targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), elucidating its resistance mechanisms and demonstrating its notable antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, the study examines the mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), covering resistance issues and strategies for optimizing resistance management, with particular emphasis being placed on analyzing the prospects and clinical value of CAR T therapy in the context of SCLC. Moreover, the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3/checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors is discussed and underscores the advantages of combining these inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to combat chemoresistance and enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapies. Overall, this study investigates emerging strategies for targeted therapies and optimized combination regimens to overcome resistance in SCLC and highlights future strategies for new therapeutic technologies for SCLC.",

ATR inhibitor was administered combined with ablative radiotherapy to assess its radiosensitizing effect on lung cancer cells. Treatment response and survival were evaluated in vivo using A549 xenograft flank tumor and synchronous LLC lung and flank tumor mouse models. Mice received ablative radiotherapy (12 Gy/d for 2 d), ATR inhibitor, and ICI. The tumor microenvironment was assessed in irradiated flank and non-irradiated lung tumors. Programmed death-ligand 1 expression was upregulated after irradiation. ATR inhibition attenuated this upregulation. ATR inhibitor pretreatment decreased cell survival after irradiation by inhibiting DNA double-strand break repair, inducing mitotic cell death, and altering cell cycle progression. ATR inhibition enhanced radiation-induced damage-associated molecular patterns determined by high mobility group box 1 quantification and activated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Combined ATR inhibition and ablative radiotherapy inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in mice. Adding ICI therapy further enhanced local antitumor effects, reducing the metastatic lung tumor burden and remodeling the tumor microenvironment through immunogenic cell death induction and enhanced immune cell infiltration. Triple therapy increased immune cell infiltration in distant non-irradiated lung tumors and stimulated the generation of protective T-cell immunity in splenocytes. Safety analysis showed minimal toxicity. ATR inhibition enhanced the efficacy of ablative radiotherapy and immunotherapy in lung cancer.

We evaluate ZL-2201, an orally bioavailable, highly potent, and selective pharmacologic inhibitor of DNA-PK activity, for the treatment of human cancerous malignancies. ZL-2201 demonstrated greater selectivity for DNA-PK and effectively inhibited DNA-PK autophosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Initial data suggested a potential correlation between ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) deficiency and ZL-2201 sensitivity. More so, ZL-2201 showed strong synergy with topoisomerase II inhibitors independent of ATM status in vitro. In vivo oral administration of ZL-2201 demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activity in the NCI-H1703 xenograft model and significantly enhanced the activity of approved DNA-damaging agents in A549 and FaDu models. From a phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry screen, we identified and validated that ZL-2201 and PRKDC siRNA decreased Ser108 phosphorylation of MCM2, a key DNA replication factor. Collectively, we have characterized a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor with promising monotherapy and combinatory therapeutic potential with approved DNA-damaging agents. More importantly, we identified phospho-MCM2 (Ser108) as a potential proximal biomarker of DNA-PK inhibition that warrants further preclinical and clinical evaluation. Significance: ZL-2201, a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor, can target tumor models in combination with DNA DSB-inducing agents such as radiation or doxorubicin, with potential to improve recurrent therapies in the clinic.",

Therefore, we applied D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as an emulsifier and natural edible peanut oil to form a steady oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsion loaded with AST (denoted as TAP-nanoemulsion). TAP-nanoemulsions were stable without the droplet coalescence against thermal treatments (30-90 C), pH value changes (over a range of 2.0-8.0), and ionic strength adjustments (at NaCl concentrations of 100-500 mM) measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). AST within TAP-nanoemulsion was released up to 80% in a simulated intestinal enzymatic fluid in vitro, and the overall recovery rate was fairly consistent in the Caco-2 cellular model. In order to further evaluate in vivo melanoma inhibitory experiments, we injected the fluorescent-stained B16F10 cells into female C57BL/6 mouse tail veins and treated TAP-nanoemulsion in an oral gavage. qRT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that TAP-nanoemulsion triggered effectively the apoptosis pathway, including enhancements of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), and p21WAF1/CIP1 (p21) and decreases of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2); cyclins D, D1, and E; mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK); extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK); nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB); and matrix metallopeptidase-1 and metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-1 and MMP-9) in both gene and protein expressions. In conclusion, this study suggests that TAP-nanoemulsion with the oral treatment has a positive chemotherapy effect in melanoma with lung metastases in vivo. As far as we know, this is the first time to demonstrate that an antioxidant in nanoparticle administration cures lung metastatic melanoma.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) elicits DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in tumor cytotoxicity and a type I interferon (IFN) response via stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation. We investigated whether combining RT with an ataxia-telangiectasia mutated inhibitor promoted these effects and amplified tumor immunity. METHODS: Mice-bearing syngeneic flank tumors (MOC2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or B78 melanoma) were treated with tumor-directed RT and oral administration of AZD0156. Specific immune cell depletion, type 1 interferon receptor 1 knock-out mice (IFNAR1-KO), and STING-deficient tumor cells were used to investigate tumor-immune crosstalk following RT and AZD0156 treatment. RESULTS: Combining RT and AZD0156 reduced tumor growth compared with RT or AZD0156 alone in mice bearing MOC2 or B78 tumors. Low-dose AZD0156 (1-100 nM) alone did not affect tumor cell proliferation but suppressed tumor cell clonogenicity in combination with RT. Low-dose AZD0156 with RT synergistically increased IFN-beta, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells. In contrast to wild-type mice, IFNAR1-KO mice showed reduced CD8+T cell tumor infiltration and poor survival following RT+AZD0156 treatment. CD8+T cell depletion reduced antitumor response during RT+AZD0156 treatment. STING-deficient MOC2 (MOC2-STING+/-) or B78 (B78-STING-/-) tumors eliminated the effects of RT+AZD0156 on the expression of IFN-beta, MHC-I, and PD-L1, and reduced CD8+T cell infiltration and migration. Additional anti-PD-L1 therapy promoted antitumor response by elevation of tumor-MHC-I and lymphocyte activation. CONCLUSIONS: Combined radiation and AZD0156 increase STING-dependent antitumor response. Tumor-derived cell-autonomous IFN-beta amplification drives both MHC-I and PD-L1 induction at the tumor cell surface, which is required by anti-PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor immune response following RT and AZD0156 combination therapy.",

Several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) are in clinical development including berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970). Although clinical studies have examined plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans, little is known regarding dose/exposure relationships and tissue distribution. To understand these concepts, we extensively characterized the PK of berzosertib in mouse plasma and tissues. METHODS: A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method was utilized to quantitate berzosertib in plasma and tissues. Dose proportionality was assessed in female BALB/c mice following single IV doses (2, 6, 20 or 60 mg/kg). A more extensive PK study was conducted in tumor-bearing mice following a single IV dose of 20 mg/kg to evaluate distribution to tissues. PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA). A compartmental model was developed to describe the PK behavior of berzosertib. Plasma protein binding was determined in vitro. RESULTS: Increased doses of berzosertib were associated with less than proportional increases in early plasma concentrations and greater than proportional increase in tissue exposure, attributable to saturation of plasma protein binding. Berzosertib extensively distributed into bone marrow, tumor, thymus, and lymph nodes, however; brain and spinal cord exposure was less than plasma. CONCLUSION: The nonlinear PK of berzosertib displayed here can be attributed to saturation of plasma protein binding and occurred at concentrations close to those observed in clinical trials. Our results will help to understand preclinical pharmacodynamic and toxicity data and to inform optimal dosing and deployment of berzosertib.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a high replication stress tumor, have poor prognoses and few therapeutic options. A phase 2 study showed antitumor activity with the addition of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitor berzosertib to topotecan. Objective: To investigate whether the addition of berzosertib to topotecan improves clinical outcomes for patients with relapsed SCLC. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2022, this open-label phase 2 randomized clinical trial recruited 60 patients with SCLC and relapse after 1 or more prior therapies from 16 US cancer centers. Patients previously treated with topotecan were not eligible. Interventions: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone (group 1), 1.25 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through 5, or with berzosertib (group 2), 210 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2 and 5, in 21-day cycles. Randomization was stratified by tumor sensitivity to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) in the overall population and among patients with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant tumors. The PFS and OS for each treatment group were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and OS between the 2 groups, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the treatment hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Results: Of 60 patients (median [range] age, 59 [34-79] years; 33 [55%] male) included in this study, 20 were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone and 40 to receive a combination of topotecan with berzosertib. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 21.3 (18.1-28.3) months, there was no difference in PFS between the 2 groups (median, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.2-5.1] months for group 1 vs 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-4.6] months for group 2; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.46-1.41]; P = .44). Overall survival was significantly longer with the combination therapy (5.4 [95% CI, 3.2-6.8] months vs 8.9 [95% CI, 4.8-11.4] months; HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.29-0.96], P = .03). Adverse event profiles were similar between the 2 groups (eg, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, 11 of 20 [55%] vs 20 of 40 [50%], and any grade nausea, 9 of 20 [45%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, treatment with berzosertib plus topotecan did not improve PFS compared with topotecan therapy alone among patients with relapsed SCLC. However, the combination treatment significantly improved OS. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03896503.",
