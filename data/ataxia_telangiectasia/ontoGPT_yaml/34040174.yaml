input_text: 'Phase 1 study of the ATR inhibitor berzosertib in combination with cisplatin
  in patients with advanced solid tumours. BACKGROUND: Berzosertib (formerly M6620,
  VX-970) is a highly potent and selective, first-in-class ataxia telangiectasia-mutated
  and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR) inhibitor. We assessed the safety, tolerability,
  pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of berzosertib plus cisplatin. METHODS:
  Adult patients with advanced solid tumours refractory or resistant to standard of
  care therapies received ascending doses of cisplatin (day 1) and berzosertib (days
  2 and 9) every 3 weeks (Q3W). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received berzosertib
  (90-210 mg/m2) and cisplatin (40-75 mg/m2) across seven dose levels. The most common
  grade >=3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (20.0%) and anaemia
  (16.7%). There were two dose-limiting toxicities: a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction
  and a grade 3 increase in alanine aminotransferase. Berzosertib 140 mg/m2 (days
  2 and 9) and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) Q3W was determined as the recommended Phase
  2 dose. Cisplatin had no apparent effect on berzosertib pharmacokinetics. Of the
  31 patients, four achieved a partial response (two confirmed and two unconfirmed)
  despite having previously experienced disease progression following platinum-based
  chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus cisplatin is well tolerated and shows
  preliminary clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumours, warranting
  further evaluation in a Phase 2 setting. CLINICAL TRIALS IDENTIFIER: NCT02157792.'
