input_text: 'Enhanced T-cell immunity and lower humoral responses following 5-dose
  SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with inborn errors of immunity compared with
  healthy controls. Objective: Patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) are at
  higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluated humoral and cellular responses
  to COVID-19 vaccines in Brazilian patients with IEI and healthy controls. Methods:
  Fifty-five patients with IEI (13-61 years) and 60 controls (13-71 years) received
  inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVac), non-replicating virus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19,
  AstraZeneca) or monovalent mRNA (Original strain of BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) and
  bivalent mRNA (Original/Omicron BA.1, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines and were sampled
  five times. Diagnoses included common variable immunodeficiency (n=25), specific
  antibody deficiency (n=9), ataxia-telangiectasia (n=5), X-linked agammaglobulinemia
  (n=4), PIK3CD-related disorders (n=4), hyper-IgM syndrome (n=4), combined immunodeficiency
  (n=3), and STAT1 gain-of-function (n=1). Humoral immunity was assessed via multiplex
  microarray for Spike, Nucleocapsid, RBD-Wuhan, RBD-Delta, RBD-BA.1, RBD-BA.2 and
  RBD-BA.5 neutralizing antibodies. T-cell responses to Spike and Nucleocapsid were
  assessed using ELISpot. Results: Patients with IEI exhibited significantly lower
  levels of Nucleocapsid and RBD-neutralizing antibodies (p < 0.05). Notable differences
  in RBD-BA.2 (p = 0.008) and IgG-Nucleocapsid (p = 0.010) levels emerged over time.
  T-cell responses to Spike were stronger in patients with IEI post-booster (405 vs.
  149 spot-forming cells/million PBMC; p = 0.002). Both groups showed enhanced Nucleocapsid-specific
  cellular responses over time (p = 0.017). COVID-19 hospitalization rates among patients
  with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis dropped from 33.3% to zero after the first booster
  dose. Conclusions: While humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were weaker in
  patients with IEI, their cellular immunity was similar to controls. Boosters enhanced
  both humoral and cellular responses. After completion of the vaccination protocol,
  none of the patients with IEI were hospitalized with COVID-19. Robust T-cell responses
  may play a critical role in protecting patients with IEI from severe COVID-19 and
  mortality.'
