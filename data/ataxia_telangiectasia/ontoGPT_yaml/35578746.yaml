input_text: 'Predicting acute severe toxicity for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
  by combining dosimetry with a radiosensitivity biomarker: a pilot study. OBJECTIVE:
  Radiotherapy (RT) against head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) may lead
  to severe toxicity in 30-40% of patients. The normal tissue complication probability
  (NTCP) models, based on dosimetric data refined the normal tissue dose/volume tolerance
  guidelines. In parallel, the radiation-induced nucleoshuttling (RIANS) of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia
  Mutated protein (pATM) is a predictive approach of individual intrinsic radiosensitivity.
  Here, we combined NTCP with RADIODTECT , a blood assay derived from the RIANS model,
  to predict RT toxicity in HNSCC patients. METHODS: RADIODTECT  cutoff values (i.e.
  57.8 ng/mL for grade>=2 toxicity and 46 ng/mL for grade>=3 toxicity) have been previously
  assessed. Validation was performed on a prospective cohort of 36 HNSCC patients
  treated with postoperative RT. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria
  for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale and two criteria were considered: grade>=2 oral
  mucositis (OM2), grade>=3 mucositis (OM3) and grade>=2 dysphagia (DY2), grade>=3
  dysphagia (DY3). pATM quantification was assessed in lymphocytes of HNSCC patients.
  The discrimination power of the pATM assay was evaluated through the Area Under
  the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC). Two previously described
  NTCP models were considered, including the dose to the oral cavity and the mean
  dose to the parotid glands (OM2 and OM3) and the dose to the oral cavity, to the
  larynx and the volume of pharyngeal constrictor muscles (DY2 and DY3). RESULTS:
  Combining NTCP models with RADIODTECT  blood test improved the AUC-ROC. Considering
  the prediction of mucositis, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.80 was for OM2, and AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT
  =0.78 for OM3. Considering the prediction of acute dysphagia, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT
  =0.71 for DY2 and for DY3. CONCLUSIONS: Combining NTCP models with a radiosensitivity
  biomarker might significantly improve the prediction of toxicities for HNSCC patients.'
