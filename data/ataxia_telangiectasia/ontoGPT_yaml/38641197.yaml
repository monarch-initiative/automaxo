input_text: Evidence for persistent UV-induced DNA damage and altered DNA damage response
  in xeroderma pigmentosa patient corneas. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic
  disorder characterized by injury to the ocular surface due to exposure to ultraviolet
  (UV) radiation. UV-induced damage in the cells leads to the formation of cyclobutane
  pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts that are repaired
  by the NER (Nucleotide Excision Repair) pathway. Mutations in the genes coding for
  NER proteins, as reported in XP patients, would lead to sub-optimal damage repair
  resulting in clinical signs varying from photo-keratitis to cancerous lesions on
  the ocular surface. Here, we aimed to provide evidence for the accumulation of DNA
  damage and activation of DNA repair pathway proteins in the corneal cells of patients
  with XP. Corneal buttons of patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty were
  stained to quantify DNA damage and the presence of activated DNA damage response
  proteins (DDR) using specific antibodies. Positive staining for pH2A.X and thymidine
  dimers confirmed the presence of DNA damage in the corneal cells. Positive cells
  were found in both control corneas and XP samples however, unlike normal tissues,
  positive cells were found in all cell layers of XP samples indicating that these
  cells were sensitive to very low levels of UV. pH2A.X-positive cells were significantly
  more in XP corneas(p<0.05) indicating the presence of double strand breaks in these
  tissues. A positive expression of phosphorylated-forms of DDR proteins was noted
  in XP corneas (unlike controls) such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated/Rad-3 related
  proteins (ATM/ATR), breast cancer-1 and checkpoint kinases-1 and -2. Nuclear localization
  of XPA was noted in XP samples which co-localized (calculated using Pearson's correlation)
  with pATM (0.9+-0.007) and pATR (0.6+-0.053). The increased presence of these in
  the nucleus confirms that unresolved DNA damage was accumulating in these cells
  thereby leading to prolonged activation of the damage response proteins. An increase
  in pp53 and TUNEL positive cells in the XP corneas indicated cell death likely driven
  by the p53 pathway. For comparison, cultured normal corneal epithelial cells were
  exposed to UV-radiation and stained for DDR proteins at 3, 6 and 24 hours after
  irradiation to quantify the time taken by cells with intact DDR pathway to repair
  damage. These cells, when exposed to UV showed nuclear translocation of DDR proteins
  at 3 and 6 hours which reduced significantly by 24 hours confirming that the damaged
  DNA was being actively repaired leading to cell survival. The persistent presence
  of the DDR proteins in XP corneas indicates that damage is being actively recognized
  and DNA replication is stalled, thereby causing accumulation of damaged DNA leading
  to cell death, which would explain the cancer incidence and cell loss reported in
  these patients.
