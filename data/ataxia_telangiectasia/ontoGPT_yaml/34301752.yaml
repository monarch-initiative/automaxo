input_text: 'Ceralasertib (AZD6738), an Oral ATR Kinase Inhibitor, in Combination
  with Carboplatin in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors: A Phase I Study. PURPOSE:
  This study reports the safety, tolerability, MTD, recommended phase II dose (RP2D),
  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of ceralasertib
  combined with carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. It also examined
  exploratory predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible
  patients (n = 36) received a fixed dose of carboplatin (AUC5) with escalating doses
  of ceralasertib (20 mg twice daily to 60 mg once daily) in 21-day cycles. Sequential
  and concurrent combination dosing schedules were assessed. RESULTS: Two ceralasertib
  MTD dose schedules, 20 mg twice daily on days 4-13 and 40 mg once daily on days
  1-2, were tolerated with carboplatin AUC5; the latter was declared the RP2D. The
  most common treatment-emergent adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
  Events grade >=3) were anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and neutropenia (25%).
  Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2; including one grade
  4 platelet count decreased) and a combination of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade
  3 neutropenia occurred in 3 patients. Ceralasertib was quickly absorbed (tmax ~1
  hour), with a terminal plasma half-life of 8-11 hours. Upregulation of pRAD50, indicative
  of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, was observed in tumor biopsies
  during ceralasertib treatment. Two patients with absent or low ATM or SLFN11 protein
  expression achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial responses. Eighteen of 34 (53%)
  response-evaluable patients had RECIST v1.1 stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D
  for ceralasertib plus carboplatin was established as ceralasertib 40 mg once daily
  on days 1-2 administered with carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks, with pharmacokinetic
  and pharmacodynamic studies confirming pharmacodynamic modulation and preliminary
  evidence of antitumor activity observed.'
