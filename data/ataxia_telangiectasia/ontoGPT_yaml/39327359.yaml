input_text: 'The Latest Developments for the Treatment of Ataxia Telangiectasia: A
  Narrative Review. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Louis-Bar syndrome, is a rare neurodegenerative
  disorder caused by autosomal recessive biallelic mutations within the ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) gene. Currently, there are no curative therapies available for this
  disorder. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in treatment methods
  including 1- Acetyl-DL-leucine, 2- Bone Marrow Transplantation, 3- Gene Therapy,
  4- Dexamethasone, and finally 5- Red Blood Cells (RBCs) as a carrier for dexamethasone
  (encapsulation of dexamethasone sodium phosphate into autologous erythrocytes, known
  as EryDex). Most of the treatments under investigation are in the early stages,
  except for the EryDex System. It appears that the EryDex system and N-Acetyl-DL-Leucine
  may hold promise as potential treatment options.'
