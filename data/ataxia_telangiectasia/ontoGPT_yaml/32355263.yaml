input_text: DNA damage response signaling pathways and targets for radiotherapy sensitization
  in cancer. Radiotherapy is one of the most common countermeasures for treating a
  wide range of tumors. However, the radioresistance of cancer cells is still a major
  limitation for radiotherapy applications. Efforts are continuously ongoing to explore
  sensitizing targets and develop radiosensitizers for improving the outcomes of radiotherapy.
  DNA double-strand breaks are the most lethal lesions induced by ionizing radiation
  and can trigger a series of cellular DNA damage responses (DDRs), including those
  helping cells recover from radiation injuries, such as the activation of DNA damage
  sensing and early transduction pathways, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. Obviously,
  these protective DDRs confer tumor radioresistance. Targeting DDR signaling pathways
  has become an attractive strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance, and some
  important advances and breakthroughs have already been achieved in recent years.
  On the basis of comprehensively reviewing the DDR signal pathways, we provide an
  update on the novel and promising druggable targets emerging from DDR pathways that
  can be exploited for radiosensitization. We further discuss recent advances identified
  from preclinical studies, current clinical trials, and clinical application of chemical
  inhibitors targeting key DDR proteins, including DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein
  kinase, catalytic subunit), ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related),
  the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) complex, the PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) family,
  MDC1, Wee1, LIG4 (ligase IV), CDK1, BRCA1 (BRCA1 C terminal), CHK1, and HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1). Challenges for ionizing radiation-induced signal transduction and targeted
  therapy are also discussed based on recent achievements in the biological field
  of radiotherapy.
