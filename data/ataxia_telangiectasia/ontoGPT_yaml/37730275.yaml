input_text: 'ATM inhibition augments type I interferon response and antitumor T-cell
  immunity when combined with radiation therapy in murine tumor models. BACKGROUND:
  Radiation therapy (RT) elicits DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in tumor cytotoxicity
  and a type I interferon (IFN) response via stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
  activation. We investigated whether combining RT with an ataxia-telangiectasia mutated
  inhibitor promoted these effects and amplified tumor immunity. METHODS: Mice-bearing
  syngeneic flank tumors (MOC2 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or B78 melanoma)
  were treated with tumor-directed RT and oral administration of AZD0156. Specific
  immune cell depletion, type 1 interferon receptor 1 knock-out mice (IFNAR1-KO),
  and STING-deficient tumor cells were used to investigate tumor-immune crosstalk
  following RT and AZD0156 treatment. RESULTS: Combining RT and AZD0156 reduced tumor
  growth compared with RT or AZD0156 alone in mice bearing MOC2 or B78 tumors. Low-dose
  AZD0156 (1-100 nM) alone did not affect tumor cell proliferation but suppressed
  tumor cell clonogenicity in combination with RT. Low-dose AZD0156 with RT synergistically
  increased IFN-beta, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I, and programmed death-ligand
  1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells. In contrast to wild-type mice, IFNAR1-KO mice
  showed reduced CD8+T cell tumor infiltration and poor survival following RT+AZD0156
  treatment. CD8+T cell depletion reduced antitumor response during RT+AZD0156 treatment.
  STING-deficient MOC2 (MOC2-STING+/-) or B78 (B78-STING-/-) tumors eliminated the
  effects of RT+AZD0156 on the expression of IFN-beta, MHC-I, and PD-L1, and reduced
  CD8+T cell infiltration and migration. Additional anti-PD-L1 therapy promoted antitumor
  response by elevation of tumor-MHC-I and lymphocyte activation. CONCLUSIONS: Combined
  radiation and AZD0156 increase STING-dependent antitumor response. Tumor-derived
  cell-autonomous IFN-beta amplification drives both MHC-I and PD-L1 induction at
  the tumor cell surface, which is required by anti-PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor
  immune response following RT and AZD0156 combination therapy.'
