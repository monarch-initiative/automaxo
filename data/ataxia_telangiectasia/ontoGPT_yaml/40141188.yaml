input_text: "Precision Medicine in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer: Targeted Therapies
  and the Challenge of Chemoresistance. The poor prognosis for high-grade serous ovarian
  cancer (HGSOC), the dominant subtype of ovarian cancer, reflects its aggressive
  nature, late diagnosis, and the highest mortality rate among all gynaecologic cancers.
  Apart from late diagnosis, the main reason for the poor prognosis and its unsuccessful
  treatment is primarily the emergence of chemoresistance to carboplatin. Although
  there is a good response to primary treatment, the disease recurs in 80% of cases,
  at which point it is largely resistant to carboplatin. The introduction of novel
  targeted therapies in the second decade of the 21st century has begun to transform
  the treatment of HGSOC, although their impact on overall survival remains unsatisfactory.
  Targeting the specific pathways known to be abnormally activated in HGSOC is especially
  difficult due to the molecular diversity of its subtypes. Moreover, a range of molecular
  changes are associated with acquired chemoresistance, e.g., reversion of BRCA1 and
  BRCA2 germline alleles. In this review, we examine the advantages and disadvantages
  of approved targeted therapies, including bevacizumab, PARP inhibitors (PARPis),
  and treatments targeting cells with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK),
  B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET)
  gene alterations, as well as antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, we explore
  promising new targets under investigation in ongoing clinical trials, such as immune
  checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)
  inhibitors, Wee1 kinase inhibitors, and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein
  (ATR) inhibitors for platinum-resistant disease. Despite the development of new
  targeted therapies, carboplatin remains the fundamental medicine in HGSOC therapy.
  The correct choice of treatment strategy for better survival of patients with advanced
  HGSOC should therefore include a prediction of patients' risks of developing chemoresistance
  to platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effective targeted therapy requires the
  selection of patients who are likely to derive clinical benefit while minimizing
  potential adverse effects, underscoring the essence of precision medicine."
