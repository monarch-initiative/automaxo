input_text: 'ATR inhibition potentiates FOLFIRINOX cytotoxic effect in models of pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma by remodelling the tumour microenvironment. BACKGROUND: In
  pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the dense stroma rich in cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) and the immunosuppressive microenvironment confer resistance
  to treatments. To overcome such resistance, we tested the combination of FOLFIRINOX
  (DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy drugs) with VE-822 (an ataxia-telangiectasia and
  RAD3-related inhibitor that targets DNA damage repair). METHODS: PDAC spheroid models
  and organoids were used to assess the combination effects. Tumour growth and the
  immune and fibrotic microenvironment were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, single-cell
  analysis and spatial proteomics in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and orthotopic
  immunocompetent KPC mouse models. RESULTS: The FOLFIRINOX and VE-822 combination
  had a strong synergistic effect in several PDAC cell lines, whatever their BRCA1,
  BRCA2 and ATM mutation status and resistance to standard chemotherapy agents. This
  was associated with high DNA damage and inhibition of DNA repair signalling pathways,
  leading to increased apoptosis. In immunocompetent and PDX mouse models of PDAC,
  the combination inhibited tumour growth more effectively than FOLFIRINOX alone.
  This was associated with tumour microenvironment remodelling, particularly decreased
  proportion of fibroblast activated protein-positive CAFs and increased anti-tumorigenic
  immune cell infiltration and interaction. CONCLUSION: The FOLFIRINOX and VE-822
  combination is a promising strategy to improve FOLFIRINOX efficacy and overcome
  drug resistance in PDAC.'
