input_text: 'Berzosertib Plus Topotecan vs Topotecan Alone in Patients With Relapsed
  Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Patients with relapsed
  small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a high replication stress tumor, have poor prognoses
  and few therapeutic options. A phase 2 study showed antitumor activity with the
  addition of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitor berzosertib
  to topotecan. Objective: To investigate whether the addition of berzosertib to topotecan
  improves clinical outcomes for patients with relapsed SCLC. Design, Setting, and
  Participants: Between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2022, this open-label phase
  2 randomized clinical trial recruited 60 patients with SCLC and relapse after 1
  or more prior therapies from 16 US cancer centers. Patients previously treated with
  topotecan were not eligible. Interventions: Eligible patients were randomly assigned
  to receive topotecan alone (group 1), 1.25 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through
  5, or with berzosertib (group 2), 210 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2 and 5, in 21-day
  cycles. Randomization was stratified by tumor sensitivity to first-line platinum-based
  chemotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was progression-free
  survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included
  overall survival (OS) in the overall population and among patients with platinum-sensitive
  or platinum-resistant tumors. The PFS and OS for each treatment group were estimated
  using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and OS
  between the 2 groups, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate
  the treatment hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Results:
  Of 60 patients (median [range] age, 59 [34-79] years; 33 [55%] male) included in
  this study, 20 were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone and 40 to receive
  a combination of topotecan with berzosertib. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 21.3
  (18.1-28.3) months, there was no difference in PFS between the 2 groups (median,
  3.0 [95% CI, 1.2-5.1] months for group 1 vs 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-4.6] months for group
  2; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.46-1.41]; P = .44). Overall survival was significantly longer
  with the combination therapy (5.4 [95% CI, 3.2-6.8] months vs 8.9 [95% CI, 4.8-11.4]
  months; HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.29-0.96], P = .03). Adverse event profiles were similar
  between the 2 groups (eg, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, 11 of 20 [55%] vs 20 of
  40 [50%], and any grade nausea, 9 of 20 [45%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]). Conclusions and
  Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, treatment with berzosertib plus topotecan
  did not improve PFS compared with topotecan therapy alone among patients with relapsed
  SCLC. However, the combination treatment significantly improved OS. Trial Registration:
  ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03896503.'
