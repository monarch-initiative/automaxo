input_text: Targeting DNA Damage Response in Prostate and Breast Cancer. Steroid hormone
  signaling induces vast gene expression programs which necessitate the local formation
  of transcription factories at regulatory regions and large-scale alterations of
  the genome architecture to allow communication among distantly related cis-acting
  regions. This involves major stress at the genomic DNA level. Transcriptionally
  active regions are generally instable and prone to breakage due to the torsional
  stress and local depletion of nucleosomes that make DNA more accessible to damaging
  agents. A dedicated DNA damage response (DDR) is therefore essential to maintain
  genome integrity at these exposed regions. The DDR is a complex network involving
  DNA damage sensor proteins, such as the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1),
  the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated
  (ATM) kinase and the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, as central regulators. The
  tight interplay between the DDR and steroid hormone receptors has been unraveled
  recently. Several DNA repair factors interact with the androgen and estrogen receptors
  and support their transcriptional functions. Conversely, both receptors directly
  control the expression of agents involved in the DDR. Impaired DDR is also exploited
  by tumors to acquire advantageous mutations. Cancer cells often harbor germline
  or somatic alterations in DDR genes, and their association with disease outcome
  and treatment response led to intensive efforts towards identifying selective inhibitors
  targeting the major players in this process. The PARP-1 inhibitors are now approved
  for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer with specific genomic alterations. Additional
  DDR-targeting agents are being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents
  or in combination with treatments eliciting DNA damage (e.g., radiation therapy,
  including targeted radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) or addressing targets involved
  in maintenance of genome integrity. Recent preclinical and clinical findings made
  in addressing DNA repair dysfunction in hormone-dependent and -independent prostate
  and breast tumors are presented. Importantly, the combination of anti-hormonal therapy
  with DDR inhibition or with radiation has the potential to enhance efficacy but
  still needs further investigation.
