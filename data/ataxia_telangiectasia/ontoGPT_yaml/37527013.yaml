input_text: 'SETD2 loss and ATR inhibition synergize to promote cGAS signaling and
  immunotherapy response in renal cell carcinoma. PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint blockade
  (ICB) demonstrates durable clinical benefits in a minority of patients with renal
  cell carcinoma (RCC). We aimed to identify the molecular features that determine
  the response and develop approaches to enhance the response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
  We investigated the effects of SET domain-containing protein 2 (SEDT2) loss on the
  DNA damage response pathway, the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, the tumor immune
  microenvironment, and the response to Ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 related (ATR)
  and checkpoint inhibition in RCC. RESULTS: ATR inhibition activated the cyclic GMP-AMP
  synthase (cGAS)-Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent cytosolic DNA-sensing
  pathway, resulting in the concurrent expression of inflammatory cytokines and immune
  checkpoints. Among the common RCC genotypes, SETD2 loss is associated with preferential
  ATR activation and sensitizes cells to ATR inhibition. SETD2 knockdown promoted
  the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway in response to ATR inhibition. Treatment with
  the ATR inhibitor VE822 concurrently upregulated immune cell infiltration and immune
  checkpoint expression in Setd2 knockdown Renca tumors, providing a rationale for
  ATR inhibition plus ICB combination therapy. Setd2 deficient Renca tumors demonstrated
  greater vulnerability to ICB monotherapy or combination therapy with VE822 than
  Setd2 proficient tumors. Moreover, SETD2 mutations were associated with a higher
  response rate and prolonged overall survival in ICB-treated RCC patients but not
  in non-ICB-treated RCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: SETD2 loss and ATR inhibition synergize
  to promote cGAS signaling and enhance immune cell infiltration, providing a mechanistic
  rationale for the combination of ATR and checkpoint inhibition in RCC patients with
  SETD2 mutations.'
