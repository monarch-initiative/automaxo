input_text: 'Ceralasertib-Mediated ATR Inhibition Combined With Olaparib in Advanced
  Cancers Harboring DNA Damage Response and Repair Alterations (Olaparib Combinations).
  Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as promising therapy
  in cancers with homologous recombination repair deficiency. However, efficacy is
  limited by both intrinsic and acquired resistance. The Olaparib Combinations basket
  trial explored olaparib alone and in combination with other homologous recombination-directed
  targeted therapies. Here, we report the results of the arm in which olaparib was
  combined with the orally bioavailable ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related inhibitor
  ceralasertib in patients with relapsed or refractory cancers harboring DNA damage
  response and repair alterations, including patients with BRCA-mutated PARP inhibitor-resistant
  high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Germline and somatic
  mutations had to be deleterious by COSMIC or ClinVar for eligibility. Olaparib was
  administered at 300 mg twice daily and ceralasertib at 160 mg daily on days 1-7
  in 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicities. Primary end points
  were confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) rates and clinical
  benefit rate (CBR; CR + PR + stable disease [SD] at 16 weeks). RESULTS: Twenty-five
  patients were enrolled, with median four prior therapies. Five patients required
  dose reductions for myelosuppression. Overall response rate was 8.3% and CBR was
  62.5% among the entire cohort. Two of five patients with tumor harboring ATM mutation
  achieved CR or SD ongoing at 24+ months, respectively (CBR 40%). Of seven patients
  with PARP inhibitor-resistant HGSOC, one achieved PR (-90%) and five had SD ranging
  16-72 weeks (CBR 86%). CONCLUSION: Olaparib with ceralasertib demonstrated preliminary
  activity in ATM-mutated tumors and in PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOC.
  These data warrant additional studies to further confirm activity in these settings.'
