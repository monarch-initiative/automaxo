input_text: The ATR inhibitor ceralasertib potentiates cancer checkpoint immunotherapy
  by regulating the tumor microenvironment. The Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related
  (ATR) inhibitor ceralasertib in combination with the PD-L1 antibody durvalumab demonstrated
  encouraging clinical benefit in melanoma and lung cancer patients who progressed
  on immunotherapy. Here we show that modelling of intermittent ceralasertib treatment
  in mouse tumor models reveals CD8+ T-cell dependent antitumor activity, which is
  separate from the effects on tumor cells. Ceralasertib suppresses proliferating
  CD8+ T-cells on treatment which is rapidly reversed off-treatment. Ceralasertib
  causes up-regulation of type I interferon (IFNI) pathway in cancer patients and
  in tumor-bearing mice. IFNI is experimentally found to be a major mediator of antitumor
  activity of ceralasertib in combination with PD-L1 antibody. Improvement of T-cell
  function after ceralasertib treatment is linked to changes in myeloid cells in the
  tumor microenvironment. IFNI also promotes anti-proliferative effects of ceralasertib
  on tumor cells. Here, we report that broad immunomodulatory changes following intermittent
  ATR inhibition underpins the clinical therapeutic benefit and indicates its wider
  impact on antitumor immunity.
