input_text: 'ATM Expression as a Prognostic Marker in Patients With Advanced Biliary
  Tract Cancer Treated With First-line Gemcitabine and Platinum Chemotherapy. BACKGROUND/AIM:
  Biliary tract cancer (BTC) has a poor prognosis due to its highly invasive and metastatic
  potential. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a key regulator of DNA damage
  response and an emerging therapeutic target; however, the association between the
  expression of ATM and the prognosis in advanced BTC is unknown. We aimed to identify
  the relationship between ATM expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and
  survival outcomes in patients with advanced BTC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed
  113 patients with advanced BTC who received first-line gemcitabine and platinum.
  RESULTS: The tumor location was intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH-CCC) in 43 patients,
  extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCC) in 49, and gallbladder (GB) cancer in 21
  patients. Fifty-four patients (47.8%) exhibited loss of ATM protein expression.
  The overall response rate (ORR) of ATM loss and intact ATM was 13.3% and 19.6%,
  respectively. In a subgroup analysis, EH-CCC patients with ATM loss tended to have
  improved PFS after platinum-based chemotherapy compared to those with intact ATM
  (7.9 vs. 6.2 months, respectively; p=0.050). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that ATM
  loss could be a prognostic marker after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients
  with advanced EH-CCC.'
