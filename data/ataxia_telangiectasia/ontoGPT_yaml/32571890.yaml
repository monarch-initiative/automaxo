input_text: Exploiting replicative stress in gynecological cancers as a therapeutic
  strategy. Elevated levels of replicative stress in gynecological cancers arising
  from uncontrolled oncogenic activation, loss of key tumor suppressors, and frequent
  defects in the DNA repair machinery are an intrinsic vulnerability for therapeutic
  exploitation. The presence of replication stress activates the DNA damage response
  and downstream checkpoint proteins including ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related
  kinase (ATR), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), and WEE1-like protein kinase (WEE1), which
  trigger cell cycle arrest while protecting and restoring stalled replication forks.
  Strategies that increase replicative stress while lowering cell cycle checkpoint
  thresholds may allow unrepaired DNA damage to be inappropriately carried forward
  in replicating cells, leading to mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Moreover, the
  identification of fork protection as a key mechanism of resistance to chemo- and
  poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapy in ovarian cancer further increases
  the priority that should be accorded to the development of strategies targeting
  replicative stress. Small molecule inhibitors designed to target the DNA damage
  sensors, such as inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), ATR, CHK1 and
  WEE1, impair smooth cell cycle modulation and disrupt efficient DNA repair, or a
  combination of the above, have demonstrated interesting monotherapy and combinatorial
  activity, including the potential to reverse drug resistance and have entered developmental
  pipelines. Yet unresolved challenges lie in balancing the toxicity profile of these
  drugs in order to achieve a suitable therapeutic index while maintaining clinical
  efficacy, and selective biomarkers are urgently required. Here we describe the premise
  for targeting of replicative stress in gynecological cancers and discuss the clinical
  advancement of this strategy.
