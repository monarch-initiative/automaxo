input_text: Anesthetic Chalenges And Managment In Patient With Ataxia- Telangiectasia.
  Louis-Bar Syndrome is a synonym for a very rare complex neurodegenerative disorder
  ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). This is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that
  encompasses abnormalities in the cerebellum, multisystem degeneration, immunodeficiency,
  increased risk for malignancy and consecutive respiratory insufficiency. Most of
  the patients are radiosensitive and any exposing to ionization may lead to progression
  of the disease. Potential risks from anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and postoperative
  complications in these patients have been insufficiently discussed in the literature.
  We present a successful anesthetic and respiratory management with one-lung ventilation
  in a patient with Louis-Bar Syndrome who underwent video assisted thoracoscopy (VATS)
  for recurrent pleural effusion.
