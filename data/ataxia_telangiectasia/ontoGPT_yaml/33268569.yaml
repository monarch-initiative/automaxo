input_text: Combinatorial Efficacy of Olaparib with Radiation and ATR Inhibitor Requires
  PARP1 Protein in Homologous Recombination-Proficient Pancreatic Cancer. PARP inhibitor
  monotherapy (olaparib) was recently FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutant,
  homologous recombination (HR) repair-deficient pancreatic cancer. Most pancreatic
  cancers, however, are HR proficient and thus resistant to PARP inhibitor monotherapy.
  We tested the hypothesis that combined therapy with radiation and ataxia telangiectasia
  and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (AZD6738) would extend the therapeutic indication
  of olaparib to HR-proficient pancreatic cancers. We show that olaparib combined
  with AZD6738 significantly reduced radiation survival relative to either agent alone,
  regardless of HR status. Whereas catalytic inhibition of PARP with low concentrations
  of olaparib radiosensitized HR-deficient models, maximal sensitization in HR-proficient
  models required concentrations of olaparib that induce formation of PARP1-DNA complexes.
  Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated PARP1 deletion failed to recapitulate the effects
  of olaparib on radiosensitivity and negated the combinatorial efficacy of olaparib
  and AZD6738 on radiosensitization, suggesting that PARP1-DNA complexes, rather than
  PARP catalytic inhibition, were responsible for radiosensitization. Mechanistically,
  therapeutic concentrations of olaparib in combination with radiation and AZD6738
  increased DNA double-strand breaks. DNA fiber combing revealed that high concentrations
  of olaparib did not stall replication forks but instead accelerated replication
  fork progression in association with an ATR-mediated replication stress response
  that was antagonized by AZD6738. Finally, in HR-proficient tumor xenografts, the
  combination of olaparib, radiation, and AZD6738 significantly delayed tumor growth
  compared with all other treatments. These findings suggest that PARP1-DNA complexes
  are required for the therapeutic activity of olaparib combined with radiation and
  ATR inhibitor in HR-proficient pancreatic cancer and support the clinical development
  of this combination for tumors intrinsically resistant to PARP inhibitors.
