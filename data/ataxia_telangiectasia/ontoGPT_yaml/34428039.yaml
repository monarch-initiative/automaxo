input_text: 'BAY-8400: A Novel Potent and Selective DNA-PK Inhibitor which Shows Synergistic
  Efficacy in Combination with Targeted Alpha Therapies. Eukaryotes have evolved two
  major pathways to repair potentially lethal DNA double-strand breaks. Homologous
  recombination represents a precise, DNA-template-based mechanism available during
  the S and G2 cell cycle phase, whereas non-homologous end joining, which requires
  DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), allows for fast, cell cycle-independent but
  less accurate DNA repair. Here, we report the discovery of BAY-8400, a novel selective
  inhibitor of DNA-PK. Starting from a triazoloquinoxaline, which had been identified
  as a hit from a screen for ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)
  inhibitors with inhibitory activity against ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK, lead optimization
  efforts focusing on potency and selectivity led to the discovery of BAY-8400. In
  in vitro studies, BAY-8400 showed synergistic activity of DNA-PK inhibition with
  DNA damage-inducing targeted alpha therapy. Combination of PSMA-targeted thorium-227
  conjugate BAY 2315497 treatment of human prostate tumor-bearing mice with BAY-8400
  oral treatment increased antitumor efficacy, as compared to PSMA-targeted thorium-227
  conjugate monotherapy.'
