input_text: Combination of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibition with
  ablative radiotherapy remodels the tumor microenvironment and enhances immunotherapy
  response in lung cancer. We investigated the combined effects of ataxia telangiectasia
  and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibition, ablative radiotherapy, and immune checkpoint
  inhibitor (ICI) therapy against lung cancer. ATR inhibitor was administered combined
  with ablative radiotherapy to assess its radiosensitizing effect on lung cancer
  cells. Treatment response and survival were evaluated in vivo using A549 xenograft
  flank tumor and synchronous LLC lung and flank tumor mouse models. Mice received
  ablative radiotherapy (12 Gy/d for 2 d), ATR inhibitor, and ICI. The tumor microenvironment
  was assessed in irradiated flank and non-irradiated lung tumors. Programmed death-ligand
  1 expression was upregulated after irradiation. ATR inhibition attenuated this upregulation.
  ATR inhibitor pretreatment decreased cell survival after irradiation by inhibiting
  DNA double-strand break repair, inducing mitotic cell death, and altering cell cycle
  progression. ATR inhibition enhanced radiation-induced damage-associated molecular
  patterns determined by high mobility group box 1 quantification and activated the
  cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Combined ATR inhibition
  and ablative radiotherapy inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in mice.
  Adding ICI therapy further enhanced local antitumor effects, reducing the metastatic
  lung tumor burden and remodeling the tumor microenvironment through immunogenic
  cell death induction and enhanced immune cell infiltration. Triple therapy increased
  immune cell infiltration in distant non-irradiated lung tumors and stimulated the
  generation of protective T-cell immunity in splenocytes. Safety analysis showed
  minimal toxicity. ATR inhibition enhanced the efficacy of ablative radiotherapy
  and immunotherapy in lung cancer. These findings underscore the importance of combination
  therapies for enhancing systemic antitumor immune responses and outcomes.
