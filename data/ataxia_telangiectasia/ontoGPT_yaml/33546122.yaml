input_text: Effect of ATR Inhibition in RT Response of HPV-Negative and HPV-Positive
  Head and Neck Cancers. Radiotherapy (RT) has a central role in head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment. Targeted therapies modulating DNA damage response
  (DDR) and more specific cell cycle checkpoints can improve the radiotherapeutic
  response. Here, we assessed the influence of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related
  (ATR) inhibition with the ATR inhibitor AZD6738 on RT response in both human papillomavirus
  (HPV)-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC. We found that ATR inhibition enhanced RT
  response in HPV-negative and HPV-positive cell lines independent of HPV status.
  The radiosensitizing effect of AZD6738 was correlated with checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1)-mediated
  abrogation of G2/M-arrest. This resulted in the inhibition of RT-induced DNA repair
  and in an increase in the percentage of micronucleated cells. We validated the enhanced
  RT response in HPV-negative and HPV-positive xenograft models. These data demonstrate
  the potential use of ATR inhibition in combination with RT as a treatment option
  for both HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC patients.
