input_text: 'Effectiveness of Physical Therapy on Ataxia-Telangiectasia: A Case Report.
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This case report investigated the benefits of a 12-week
  physical therapy program for a child with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT). CASE DESCRIPTION:
  A 9-year-old girl with a diagnosis of AT participated. The physical therapy program
  consisted of balance and strength exercise and Wii Fit Balance-based video games
  training with a pediatric physical therapist for 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The motor
  performance, Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM), Pediatric Berg Balance Scale
  (PBBS), Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS), participation as measured by the
  Life Habits Questionnaire (LIFE-H), and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory
  (PedsQL). OUTCOMES: Positive changes were observed in the TCMS, PBBS, GMFM, and
  motor performance, participation, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Notable improvements
  were observed in both body structure and function, and activities and participation
  level. WHAT THIS ADDS TO EVIDENCE: This case report is the first to support the
  effectiveness of physical therapy in a child with AT.'
