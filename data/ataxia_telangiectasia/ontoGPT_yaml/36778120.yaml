input_text: Galectin-9 blockade synergizes with ATM inhibition to induce potent anti-tumor
  immunity. Although current cancer immunotherapies that target PD-1/PD-L1 immune
  checkpoint to reinvigorate exhausted T cells have achieved impressive clinical outcomes,
  only a small proportion of patients respond. New therapeutic targets are therefore
  needed to be identified to further unleash the anti-tumor potential of T cells and
  benefit more patients. Galectin-9 (Gal-9), initially identified as a ligand for
  TIM-3 to induce T cell death, acts as an immunosuppressive regulator in the tumor
  microenvironment (TME) but its potential as a therapeutic target remains largely
  elusive. Here we show that antibody neutralization of Gal-9, in combination with
  inhibition of Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a kinase essential for DNA damage
  response (DDR), is a promising modality for cancer immunotherapy. Genetic depletion
  of ATM in tumors markedly potentiated anti-Gal-9 therapy in a syngeneic mouse model.
  Mechanistically, ATM inhibition greatly upregulated Gal-9 expression and secretion
  in a variety of human and murine tumor cells via the cGAS-STING-interferon beta
  (IFNbeta) innate immune pathway. Combination of Gal-9 inhibition with AZD1390, a
  selective ATM inhibitor currently evaluated in clinical trials, significantly suppressed
  tumor growth and prolonged survival in multiple syngeneic mouse models, including
  the poorly-immunogenic LLC lung tumors that do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade,
  concomitant with increased T cell infiltration. These results reveal Gal-9 induction
  via STING/IFNbeta signaling as an important mechanism mediating tumor immune escape
  that could be targeted for cancer immunotherapies, and unveil a novel anti-Gal-9-based
  combination strategy for cancer immunotherapies in a wide variety of malignancies,
  including those resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.
