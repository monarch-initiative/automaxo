input_text: Role of inhibiting Chk1-p53 pathway in hepatotoxicity caused by chronic
  arsenic exposure from coal-burning. Arsenic is a naturally occurring environmental
  toxicant, chronic exposure to arsenic can cause multiorgan damage, except for typical
  skin lesions, liver damage is the main problem for health concern in population
  with arsenic poisoning. Abnormal apoptosis is closely related to liver-related diseases,
  and p53 is one of the important hallmark proteins in apoptosis progression. This
  study was to investigate whether arsenic poisoning-induced hepatocyte apoptosis
  and the underlying role of p53 signaling pathway. A rat model of arsenic poisoning
  was established by feeding corn powder for 90 days, which was baked with high arsenic
  coal, then were treated with Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) for 45 days by gavage.
  The results showed that arsenic induced liver damage, increased hepatocyte apoptosis
  and elevated the expression level of Chk1 and the ratios of p-p53/p53 and Bax/Bcl-2
  in liver tissues, which were significantly attenuated by GBE. Additionally, to further
  demonstrate the potential apoptosis-associated mechanism, L-02 cells were pre-incubated
  with p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha (PFTalpha), ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/ataxia
  telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitor (CGK733) or GBE, then treated
  with sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) for 24 h. The results showed that GBE, PFTalpha or
  CGK733 significantly reduced arsenic-induced Chk1 expression and the ratios of p-p53/p53
  and Bax/Bcl-2. In conclusion, Chk1-p53 pathway was involved in arsenic poisoning-induced
  hepatotoxicity, and inhibiting of Chk1-p53 pathway ameliorated hepatocyte apoptosis
  caused by coal-burning arsenic poisoning. The study provides a pivotal clue for
  understanding of the mechanism of arsenic poisoning-induced liver damage, and possible
  intervention strategies.
