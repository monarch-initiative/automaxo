input_text: 'Phase 1 study of the ATR inhibitor berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970)
  combined with gemcitabine +- cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours.
  BACKGROUND: Berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970) is a highly potent and selective,
  first-in-class inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase
  (ATR). We assessed multiple ascending doses of berzosertib + gemcitabine +- cisplatin
  in patients with resistant/refractory advanced solid tumours. METHODS: We evaluated
  the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of intravenous
  berzosertib + gemcitabine +- cisplatin using a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design.
  The starting doses were berzosertib 18 mg/m2, gemcitabine 875 mg/m2 and cisplatin
  60 mg/m2. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients received berzosertib + gemcitabine and eight
  received berzosertib + gemcitabine + cisplatin. Four patients receiving berzosertib
  + gemcitabine had a total of seven dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and three receiving
  berzosertib + gemcitabine + cisplatin had a total of three DLTs. Berzosertib 210
  mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) + gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8) Q3W was established
  as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); no RP2D was determined for berzosertib +
  gemcitabine + cisplatin. Neither gemcitabine nor cisplatin affected berzosertib
  PK. Most patients in both arms achieved a best response of either partial response
  or stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib + gemcitabine was well tolerated in
  patients with advanced solid tumours and showed preliminary efficacy signs. CLINICAL
  TRIAL IDENTIFIER: NCT02157792.'
