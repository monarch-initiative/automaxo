input_text: A framework for individualized splice-switching oligonucleotide therapy.
  Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) could be used to treat a subset
  of individuals with genetic diseases1, but the systematic identification of such
  individuals remains a challenge. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing analyses
  to characterize genetic variation in 235 individuals (from 209 families) with ataxia-telangiectasia,
  a severely debilitating and life-threatening recessive genetic disorder2,3, yielding
  a complete molecular diagnosis in almost all individuals. We developed a predictive
  taxonomy to assess the amenability of each individual to splice-switching ASO intervention;
  9% and 6% of the individuals had variants that were 'probably' or 'possibly' amenable
  to ASO splice modulation, respectively. Most amenable variants were in deep intronic
  regions that are inaccessible to exon-targeted sequencing. We developed ASOs that
  successfully rescued mis-splicing and ATM cellular signalling in patient fibroblasts
  for two recurrent variants. In a pilot clinical study, one of these ASOs was used
  to treat a child who had been diagnosed with ataxia-telangiectasia soon after birth,
  and showed good tolerability without serious adverse events for three years. Our
  study provides a framework for the prospective identification of individuals with
  genetic diseases who might benefit from a therapeutic approach involving splice-switching
  ASOs.
