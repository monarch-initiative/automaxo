input_text: 'Molecular and Radiological Features of Microsatellite Stable Colorectal
  Cancer Cases With Dramatic Responses to Immunotherapy. BACKGROUND/AIM: The majority
  of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, which are microsatellite stable (MSS) and do not
  harbor mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability, are resistant to immunotherapy.
  Identification of patients with exceptional responses in MSS CRC and predictive
  biomarkers is an unmet need that needs to be addressed. CASE REPORT: We report three
  cases of MSS CRC with durable clinical benefit from immunotherapy with anti-PD-1
  checkpoint inhibitors. Two cases bear a POLE P286R mutation, which has been associated
  with lack of immunotherapy response in MSS CRC. Two cases bear alterations in Ataxia-Telangiectasia
  Mutated (ATM) which may contribute to observed responses, including interaction
  with a co-administered intratumoral stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway
  agonist in one patient. CONCLUSION: Novel DNA damage repair alterations, including
  mutations in ATM, can provide insight into additional mechanisms by which genomic
  alterations can sensitize MSS CRC to diverse immunotherapies.'
