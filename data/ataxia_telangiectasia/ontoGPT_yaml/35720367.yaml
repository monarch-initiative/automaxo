input_text: 'Case Report: Rubella Virus-Induced Cutaneous Granulomas in Two Pediatric
  Patients With DNA Double Strand Breakage Repair Disorders - Outcome After Hematopoietic
  Stem Cell Transplantation. We report two patients with DNA repair disorders (Artemis
  deficiency, Ataxia telangiectasia) with destructive skin granulomas, presumably
  triggered by live-attenuated rubella vaccinations. Both patients showed reduced
  naive T cells. Rapid resolution of skin lesions was observed following hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation. However, the patient with AT died due to complications
  of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease 6 month after HSCT. Dried blood spots obtained
  after birth were available from this patient and showed absent T-cell receptor excision
  circles (TRECs). Therefore, newborn screening may help to prevent patients with
  moderate T-cell deficiency from receiving live-attenuated rubella vaccine potentially
  causing granulomas.'
