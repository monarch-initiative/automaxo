input_text: 'DNA repair-dependent immunogenic liabilities in colorectal cancer: opportunities
  from errors. Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the major causes of cancer death
  worldwide. Chemotherapy continues to serve as the primary treatment modality, while
  immunotherapy is largely ineffective for the majority of CRC patients. Seminal discoveries
  have emphasized that modifying DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms confers both
  cell-autonomous and immune-related vulnerabilities across various cancers. In CRC,
  approximately 15% of tumours exhibit alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery,
  resulting in a high number of neoantigens and the activation of the type I interferon
  response. These factors, in conjunction with immune checkpoint blockades, collectively
  stimulate anticancer immunity. Furthermore, although less frequently, somatic alterations
  in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway are observed in CRC; these defects
  lead to genome instability and telomere alterations, supporting the use of poly
  (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in HR-deficient CRC patients. Additionally,
  other DDR inhibitors, such as Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)
  inhibitors, have shown some efficacy both in preclinical models and in the clinical
  setting, irrespective of MMR proficiency. The aim of this review is to elucidate
  how preexisting or induced vulnerabilities in DNA repair pathways represent an opportunity
  to increase tumour sensitivity to immune-based therapies in CRC.'
