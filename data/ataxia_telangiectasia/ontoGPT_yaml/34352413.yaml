input_text: 'Considerations for radiotherapy in Bloom Syndrome: A case series. Bloom
  Syndrome (BS) is a genetic DNA repair disorder, caused by mutations in the BLM gene.
  The clinical phenotype includes growth retardation, immunodeficiency and a strong
  predisposition to different types of malignancies. Treatment of malignancies in
  BS patients with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is believed to be associated with
  increased toxicity, but clinical and laboratory data are lacking. We collected clinical
  data of two Dutch BS patients with solid tumors. Both were treated with radiotherapy
  before the diagnosis BS was made and tolerated this treatment well. In addition,
  we collected fibroblasts from BS patients to perform in vitro clonogenic survival
  assays to determine radiosensitivity. BS fibroblasts showed less radiosensitivity
  than the severely radiosensitive Artemis fibroblasts. Moreover, studies of double
  strand break kinetics by counting 53BP1 foci after irradiation showed similar patterns
  compared to healthy controls. In combination, the clinical cases and laboratory
  experiments are valuable information in the discussion whether radiotherapy is absolutely
  contraindicated in BS, which is the Case in other DNA repair syndromes like Ataxia
  Telangiectasia and Artemis.'
