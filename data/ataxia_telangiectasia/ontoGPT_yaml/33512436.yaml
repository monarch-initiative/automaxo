input_text: Venetoclax and dexamethasone synergize with inotuzumab ozogamicin-induced
  DNA damage signaling in B-lineage ALL. Adult patients with relapsed B-cell precursor
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) have a dismal prognosis. To improve pharmacotherapy,
  we analyzed induction of apoptosis by venetoclax and inotuzumab ozogamicin in terms
  of cytotoxicity and mode of action. Flow cytometry-based analyses of mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated activation
  demonstrate rapid induction of MOMP by venetoclax and DNA damage signaling by inotuzumab
  ozogamicin, respectively. In primary ALL samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
  models, venetoclax and inotuzumab ozogamicin cooperated and synergized in combination
  with dexamethasone in vitro in all tested samples of ALL. In murine PDX models,
  inotuzumab ozogamicin, but not venetoclax, induced complete remission in a dose-dependent
  manner but constantly failed to achieve relapse-free survival. In contrast, combination
  therapy with venetoclax, dexamethasone, and inotuzumab ozogamicin induced long-term
  leukemia-free survival and treatment-free survival in all 3 ALL-PDX models tested.
  These data demonstrate synergistic and highly efficient pharmacotherapy in preclinical
  models that qualify for evaluation in clinical trials.
