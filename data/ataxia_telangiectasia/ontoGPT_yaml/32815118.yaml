input_text: Altered Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in Children with Ataxia Telangiectasia.
  Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a devastating multi-system disorder characterized
  by progressive cerebellar ataxia and immunodeficiency. The neurological decline
  may be caused by multiple factors of which ongoing inflammation and oxidative stress
  may play a dominant role. The objective of the present investigation was to determine
  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins and possible low-grade inflammation and its relation
  to age and neurological deterioration. In the present study, we investigated 15
  patients with A-T from 2 to 16 years. Our investigation included blood and CSF tests,
  clinical neurological examination, A-T score, and MRI findings. The albumin ratio
  (AR) was analyzed to determine the blood-brain-barrier function. In addition, inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were
  measured by the multiplex cytometric bead array. We compared the results with those
  from an age-matched control group. Three of the A-T patients were analyzed separately
  (one after resection of a cerebral meningioma, one after radiation and chemotherapy
  due to leukemia, one after stem cell transplantation). Patient had significantly
  more moderate and severe side effects due to CSF puncture (vomiting, headache, need
  for anti-emetic drugs) compared with healthy controls. Total protein, albumin, and
  the AR increased with age indicating a disturbed blood barrier function in older
  children. There were no differences for cytokines in serum and CSF with the exception
  of IL-2, which was significantly higher in controls in serum. The AR is significantly
  altered in A-T patients, but low-grade inflammation is not detectable in serum and
  CSF.
