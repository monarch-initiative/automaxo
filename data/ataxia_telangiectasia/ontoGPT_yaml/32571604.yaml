input_text: 'Hereditary Predisposition to Hematopoietic Neoplasms: When Bloodline
  Matters for Blood Cancers. With the advent of precision genomics, hereditary predisposition
  to hematopoietic neoplasms- collectively known as hereditary predisposition syndromes
  (HPS)-are being increasingly recognized in clinical practice. Familial clustering
  was first observed in patients with leukemia, which led to the identification of
  several germline variants, such as RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, DDX41, and ETV6,
  among others, now established as HPS, with tendency to develop myeloid neoplasms.
  However, evidence for hereditary predisposition is also apparent in lymphoid and
  plasma--cell neoplasms, with recent discoveries of germline variants in genes such
  as IKZF1, SH2B3, PAX5 (familial acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and KDM1A/LSD1 (familial
  multiple myeloma). Specific inherited bone marrow failure syndromes-such as GATA2
  haploinsufficiency syndromes, short telomere syndromes, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome,
  Diamond-Blackfan anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, and familial thrombocytopenias-also
  have an increased predisposition to develop myeloid neoplasms, whereas inherited
  immune deficiency syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, Wiskott
  Aldrich syndrome, and Bruton agammaglobulinemia, are associated with an increased
  risk for lymphoid neoplasms. Timely recognition of HPS is critical to ensure safe
  choice of donors and/or conditioning-regimen intensity for allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem-cell transplantation and to enable direction of appropriate genomics-driven
  personalized therapies. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive
  overview of HPS and serve as a useful reference for clinicians to recognize relevant
  signs and symptoms among patients to enable timely screening and referrals to pursue
  germline assessment. In addition, we also discuss our institutional approach toward
  identification of HPS and offer a stepwise diagnostic and management algorithm.'
