input_text: Pharmacological induction of MHC-I expression in tumor cells revitalizes
  T cell anti-tumor immunity. Antigen presentation by Major Histocompatibility Complex
  Class I (MHC-I) is crucial for T-cell-mediated killing, and aberrant surface MHC-I
  expression is tightly associated with immune evasion. To address MHC-I downregulation,
  we conducted a high-throughput flow cytometry screen, identifying bleomycin (BLM)
  as a potent inducer of cell surface MHC-I expression. BLM-induced MHC-I augmentation
  renders tumor cells more susceptible to T cells in co-culture assays and enhances
  anti-tumor responses in an adoptive cellular transfer mouse model. Mechanistically,
  BLM remodels the tumor immune microenvironment, inducing MHC-I expression in an
  ATM/ATR-NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Furthermore, BLM improves T-cell-dependent immunotherapeutic
  approaches, including bispecific antibodies therapy, immune checkpoint therapy (ICT),
  and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) therapy. Importantly, low-dose
  BLM treatment in mouse models amplified the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapy without
  detectable pulmonary toxicity. In summary, our findings repurpose BLM as a potential
  inducer of MHC-I, enhancing its expression to improve the efficacy of T-cell-based
  immunotherapy.
