input_text: Targeting breast cancer stem-like cells using chloroquine encapsulated
  by a triphenylphosphonium-functionalized hyperbranched polymer. Cancer stem cells
  (CSCs) have garnered increasing attention over the past decade, as they are believed
  to play a crucial role in tumor progression and drug resistance. Accumulating evidence
  provides insight into the function of autophagy in maintenance and survival of CSCs.
  Here, we studied the impact of a mitochondriotropic triphenylphosphonium-functionalized
  dendrimeric nanocarrier on cultured breast cancer cell lines, grown either as adherent
  cells or as mammospheres that mimic a stem-like phenotype. The nanocarrier manifested
  a substantial cytotoxicity both alone as well as after encapsulation of chloroquine,
  a well-known autophagy inhibitor. The cytotoxic effects of the nanocarrier could
  be ascribed to interference with mitochondrial function. Importantly, mammospheres
  were selectively sensitive to encapsulated chloroquine and this depends on the expression
  of the gene encoding ATM kinase. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is an
  enzyme that functions as an essential signaling mediator that enables growth of
  cancer stem cells through the regulation of autophagy. We noted that this ATM-dependent
  sensitivity of mammospheres to encapsulated chloroquine was independent of the status
  of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Our study suggests that breast cancer stem cells,
  as they are modeled by mammospheres, are sensitive to encapsulated chloroquine,
  depending on the expression of the ATM kinase, which is thereby characterized as
  a potential biomarker for sensitivity to this type of treatment.
