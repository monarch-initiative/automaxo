input_text: 'ATM Variants in Breast Cancer: Implications for Breast Radiation Therapy
  Treatment Recommendations. PURPOSE: Advances in germline genetic testing have led
  to a surge in identification of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) variant carriers
  among breast cancer patients, raising numerous questions regarding use of breast
  radiation therapy (RT) in this population. METHODS: A literature search using PubMed
  identified articles assessing association(s) between the germline ATM variant status
  and the risk of toxicity after breast RT. An expert panel of breast radiation oncologists,
  genetic counselors, and basic scientists convened to review the association between
  ATM variants and radiation-induced toxicity or secondary malignancy risk and to
  determine any impact on breast RT recommendations. RESULTS: Carriers of pathogenic
  variants in ATM have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk for developing breast cancer.
  ATM variants do not consistently increase risks of toxicities after RT, except possibly
  among patients with the single nucleotide variant c5557G>A (rs1801516), in whom
  a small increased risk for the development of both acute and late radiation effects
  has been identified. In most breast cancer patients with ATM variants, the excess
  5-year absolute risk of developing a secondary contralateral breast cancer (CBC)
  after radiation is extremely low. The exception is in women younger than 45 years
  old with deleterious rare ATM missense variants, who may be at higher risk for developing
  a radiation-induced CBC over time. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiation is safe for most
  breast cancer patients who harbor ATM variants. The possible exceptions are patients
  with the variant c5557G>A (rs1801516) and patients younger than 45 years old with
  certain rare deleterious ATM variants, who may be at higher risk for developing
  CBC. These latter patients should be counseled regarding this potential risk, and
  every effort should be made to minimize the contralateral breast dose. However,
  the inconsistency of published data limits precise recommendations, magnifying the
  need for further prospective studies and the development of a centralized database
  cataloging RT outcomes and genetic status.'
