33402502	ATM Expression as a Prognostic Marker in Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer Treated With First-line Gemcitabine and Platinum Chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) has a poor prognosis due to its highly invasive and metastatic potential. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a key regulator of DNA damage response and an emerging therapeutic target; however, the association between the expression of ATM and the prognosis in advanced BTC is unknown. We aimed to identify the relationship between ATM expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and survival outcomes in patients with advanced BTC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 113 patients with advanced BTC who received first-line gemcitabine and platinum. RESULTS: The tumor location was intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH-CCC) in 43 patients, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCC) in 49, and gallbladder (GB) cancer in 21 patients. Fifty-four patients (47.8%) exhibited loss of ATM protein expression. The overall response rate (ORR) of ATM loss and intact ATM was 13.3% and 19.6%, respectively. In a subgroup analysis, EH-CCC patients with ATM loss tended to have improved PFS after platinum-based chemotherapy compared to those with intact ATM (7.9 vs. 6.2 months, respectively; p=0.050). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that ATM loss could be a prognostic marker after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced EH-CCC.
39327359	The Latest Developments for the Treatment of Ataxia Telangiectasia: A Narrative Review.	Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Louis-Bar syndrome, is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by autosomal recessive biallelic mutations within the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. Currently, there are no curative therapies available for this disorder. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in treatment methods including 1- Acetyl-DL-leucine, 2- Bone Marrow Transplantation, 3- Gene Therapy, 4- Dexamethasone, and finally 5- Red Blood Cells (RBCs) as a carrier for dexamethasone (encapsulation of dexamethasone sodium phosphate into autologous erythrocytes, known as EryDex). Most of the treatments under investigation are in the early stages, except for the EryDex System. It appears that the EryDex system and N-Acetyl-DL-Leucine may hold promise as potential treatment options.
38109457	Anesthetic Chalenges And Managment In Patient With Ataxia- Telangiectasia.	Louis-Bar Syndrome is a synonym for a very rare complex neurodegenerative disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). This is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that encompasses abnormalities in the cerebellum, multisystem degeneration, immunodeficiency, increased risk for malignancy and consecutive respiratory insufficiency. Most of the patients are radiosensitive and any exposing to ionization may lead to progression of the disease. Potential risks from anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and postoperative complications in these patients have been insufficiently discussed in the literature. We present a successful anesthetic and respiratory management with one-lung ventilation in a patient with Louis-Bar Syndrome who underwent video assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) for recurrent pleural effusion.
32815118	Altered Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in Children with Ataxia Telangiectasia.	Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a devastating multi-system disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and immunodeficiency. The neurological decline may be caused by multiple factors of which ongoing inflammation and oxidative stress may play a dominant role. The objective of the present investigation was to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins and possible low-grade inflammation and its relation to age and neurological deterioration. In the present study, we investigated 15 patients with A-T from 2 to 16 years. Our investigation included blood and CSF tests, clinical neurological examination, A-T score, and MRI findings. The albumin ratio (AR) was analyzed to determine the blood-brain-barrier function. In addition, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were measured by the multiplex cytometric bead array. We compared the results with those from an age-matched control group. Three of the A-T patients were analyzed separately (one after resection of a cerebral meningioma, one after radiation and chemotherapy due to leukemia, one after stem cell transplantation). Patient had significantly more moderate and severe side effects due to CSF puncture (vomiting, headache, need for anti-emetic drugs) compared with healthy controls. Total protein, albumin, and the AR increased with age indicating a disturbed blood barrier function in older children. There were no differences for cytokines in serum and CSF with the exception of IL-2, which was significantly higher in controls in serum. The AR is significantly altered in A-T patients, but low-grade inflammation is not detectable in serum and CSF.
34040175	Phase 1 study of the ATR inhibitor berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970) combined with gemcitabine +- cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours.	BACKGROUND: Berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970) is a highly potent and selective, first-in-class inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR). We assessed multiple ascending doses of berzosertib + gemcitabine +- cisplatin in patients with resistant/refractory advanced solid tumours. METHODS: We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of intravenous berzosertib + gemcitabine +- cisplatin using a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. The starting doses were berzosertib 18 mg/m2, gemcitabine 875 mg/m2 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients received berzosertib + gemcitabine and eight received berzosertib + gemcitabine + cisplatin. Four patients receiving berzosertib + gemcitabine had a total of seven dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and three receiving berzosertib + gemcitabine + cisplatin had a total of three DLTs. Berzosertib 210 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) + gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8) Q3W was established as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D); no RP2D was determined for berzosertib + gemcitabine + cisplatin. Neither gemcitabine nor cisplatin affected berzosertib PK. Most patients in both arms achieved a best response of either partial response or stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib + gemcitabine was well tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumours and showed preliminary efficacy signs. CLINICAL TRIAL IDENTIFIER: NCT02157792.
34301752	Ceralasertib (AZD6738), an Oral ATR Kinase Inhibitor, in Combination with Carboplatin in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors: A Phase I Study.	PURPOSE: This study reports the safety, tolerability, MTD, recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of ceralasertib combined with carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. It also examined exploratory predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 36) received a fixed dose of carboplatin (AUC5) with escalating doses of ceralasertib (20 mg twice daily to 60 mg once daily) in 21-day cycles. Sequential and concurrent combination dosing schedules were assessed. RESULTS: Two ceralasertib MTD dose schedules, 20 mg twice daily on days 4-13 and 40 mg once daily on days 1-2, were tolerated with carboplatin AUC5; the latter was declared the RP2D. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade >=3) were anemia (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and neutropenia (25%). Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 2; including one grade 4 platelet count decreased) and a combination of grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 3 patients. Ceralasertib was quickly absorbed (tmax ~1 hour), with a terminal plasma half-life of 8-11 hours. Upregulation of pRAD50, indicative of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, was observed in tumor biopsies during ceralasertib treatment. Two patients with absent or low ATM or SLFN11 protein expression achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial responses. Eighteen of 34 (53%) response-evaluable patients had RECIST v1.1 stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D for ceralasertib plus carboplatin was established as ceralasertib 40 mg once daily on days 1-2 administered with carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks, with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies confirming pharmacodynamic modulation and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity observed.
35720367	Case Report: Rubella Virus-Induced Cutaneous Granulomas in Two Pediatric Patients With DNA Double Strand Breakage Repair Disorders - Outcome After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.	We report two patients with DNA repair disorders (Artemis deficiency, Ataxia telangiectasia) with destructive skin granulomas, presumably triggered by live-attenuated rubella vaccinations. Both patients showed reduced naive T cells. Rapid resolution of skin lesions was observed following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, the patient with AT died due to complications of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease 6 month after HSCT. Dried blood spots obtained after birth were available from this patient and showed absent T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). Therefore, newborn screening may help to prevent patients with moderate T-cell deficiency from receiving live-attenuated rubella vaccine potentially causing granulomas.
34040174	Phase 1 study of the ATR inhibitor berzosertib in combination with cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours.	BACKGROUND: Berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970) is a highly potent and selective, first-in-class ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR) inhibitor. We assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of berzosertib plus cisplatin. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced solid tumours refractory or resistant to standard of care therapies received ascending doses of cisplatin (day 1) and berzosertib (days 2 and 9) every 3 weeks (Q3W). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients received berzosertib (90-210 mg/m2) and cisplatin (40-75 mg/m2) across seven dose levels. The most common grade >=3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (20.0%) and anaemia (16.7%). There were two dose-limiting toxicities: a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction and a grade 3 increase in alanine aminotransferase. Berzosertib 140 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) Q3W was determined as the recommended Phase 2 dose. Cisplatin had no apparent effect on berzosertib pharmacokinetics. Of the 31 patients, four achieved a partial response (two confirmed and two unconfirmed) despite having previously experienced disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus cisplatin is well tolerated and shows preliminary clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumours, warranting further evaluation in a Phase 2 setting. CLINICAL TRIALS IDENTIFIER: NCT02157792.
33121919	Pathologic Complete Response in Patient With ATM Mutation After Neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI Plus Panitumumab Therapy for Locally Advanced Colon Cancer: A Case Report.	
37438524	A framework for individualized splice-switching oligonucleotide therapy.	Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) could be used to treat a subset of individuals with genetic diseases1, but the systematic identification of such individuals remains a challenge. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing analyses to characterize genetic variation in 235 individuals (from 209 families) with ataxia-telangiectasia, a severely debilitating and life-threatening recessive genetic disorder2,3, yielding a complete molecular diagnosis in almost all individuals. We developed a predictive taxonomy to assess the amenability of each individual to splice-switching ASO intervention; 9% and 6% of the individuals had variants that were 'probably' or 'possibly' amenable to ASO splice modulation, respectively. Most amenable variants were in deep intronic regions that are inaccessible to exon-targeted sequencing. We developed ASOs that successfully rescued mis-splicing and ATM cellular signalling in patient fibroblasts for two recurrent variants. In a pilot clinical study, one of these ASOs was used to treat a child who had been diagnosed with ataxia-telangiectasia soon after birth, and showed good tolerability without serious adverse events for three years. Our study provides a framework for the prospective identification of individuals with genetic diseases who might benefit from a therapeutic approach involving splice-switching ASOs.
34107524	Effectiveness of Physical Therapy on Ataxia-Telangiectasia: A Case Report.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This case report investigated the benefits of a 12-week physical therapy program for a child with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 9-year-old girl with a diagnosis of AT participated. The physical therapy program consisted of balance and strength exercise and Wii Fit Balance-based video games training with a pediatric physical therapist for 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The motor performance, Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM), Pediatric Berg Balance Scale (PBBS), Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS), participation as measured by the Life Habits Questionnaire (LIFE-H), and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). OUTCOMES: Positive changes were observed in the TCMS, PBBS, GMFM, and motor performance, participation, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Notable improvements were observed in both body structure and function, and activities and participation level. WHAT THIS ADDS TO EVIDENCE: This case report is the first to support the effectiveness of physical therapy in a child with AT.
35578746	Predicting acute severe toxicity for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas by combining dosimetry with a radiosensitivity biomarker: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy (RT) against head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) may lead to severe toxicity in 30-40% of patients. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, based on dosimetric data refined the normal tissue dose/volume tolerance guidelines. In parallel, the radiation-induced nucleoshuttling (RIANS) of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein (pATM) is a predictive approach of individual intrinsic radiosensitivity. Here, we combined NTCP with RADIODTECT , a blood assay derived from the RIANS model, to predict RT toxicity in HNSCC patients. METHODS: RADIODTECT  cutoff values (i.e. 57.8 ng/mL for grade>=2 toxicity and 46 ng/mL for grade>=3 toxicity) have been previously assessed. Validation was performed on a prospective cohort of 36 HNSCC patients treated with postoperative RT. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale and two criteria were considered: grade>=2 oral mucositis (OM2), grade>=3 mucositis (OM3) and grade>=2 dysphagia (DY2), grade>=3 dysphagia (DY3). pATM quantification was assessed in lymphocytes of HNSCC patients. The discrimination power of the pATM assay was evaluated through the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC). Two previously described NTCP models were considered, including the dose to the oral cavity and the mean dose to the parotid glands (OM2 and OM3) and the dose to the oral cavity, to the larynx and the volume of pharyngeal constrictor muscles (DY2 and DY3). RESULTS: Combining NTCP models with RADIODTECT  blood test improved the AUC-ROC. Considering the prediction of mucositis, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.80 was for OM2, and AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.78 for OM3. Considering the prediction of acute dysphagia, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT =0.71 for DY2 and for DY3. CONCLUSIONS: Combining NTCP models with a radiosensitivity biomarker might significantly improve the prediction of toxicities for HNSCC patients.
34083289	Molecular and Radiological Features of Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer Cases With Dramatic Responses to Immunotherapy.	BACKGROUND/AIM: The majority of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, which are microsatellite stable (MSS) and do not harbor mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability, are resistant to immunotherapy. Identification of patients with exceptional responses in MSS CRC and predictive biomarkers is an unmet need that needs to be addressed. CASE REPORT: We report three cases of MSS CRC with durable clinical benefit from immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. Two cases bear a POLE P286R mutation, which has been associated with lack of immunotherapy response in MSS CRC. Two cases bear alterations in Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) which may contribute to observed responses, including interaction with a co-administered intratumoral stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway agonist in one patient. CONCLUSION: Novel DNA damage repair alterations, including mutations in ATM, can provide insight into additional mechanisms by which genomic alterations can sensitize MSS CRC to diverse immunotherapies.
34352413	Considerations for radiotherapy in Bloom Syndrome: A case series.	Bloom Syndrome (BS) is a genetic DNA repair disorder, caused by mutations in the BLM gene. The clinical phenotype includes growth retardation, immunodeficiency and a strong predisposition to different types of malignancies. Treatment of malignancies in BS patients with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is believed to be associated with increased toxicity, but clinical and laboratory data are lacking. We collected clinical data of two Dutch BS patients with solid tumors. Both were treated with radiotherapy before the diagnosis BS was made and tolerated this treatment well. In addition, we collected fibroblasts from BS patients to perform in vitro clonogenic survival assays to determine radiosensitivity. BS fibroblasts showed less radiosensitivity than the severely radiosensitive Artemis fibroblasts. Moreover, studies of double strand break kinetics by counting 53BP1 foci after irradiation showed similar patterns compared to healthy controls. In combination, the clinical cases and laboratory experiments are valuable information in the discussion whether radiotherapy is absolutely contraindicated in BS, which is the Case in other DNA repair syndromes like Ataxia Telangiectasia and Artemis.
33848475	A rational targeted therapy for platinum-resistant small-cell lung cancer.	Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is initially sensitive to platinum doublet chemotherapy, providing dramatic clinical benefit. Unfortunately, most SCLCs relapse and become resistant to further therapy. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Thomas et al. show that some platinum-resistant SCLCs benefit from combination therapy with topotecan plus the ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and rad3-related) inhibitor berzosertib.
40114918	Enhanced T-cell immunity and lower humoral responses following 5-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with inborn errors of immunity compared with healthy controls.	Objective: Patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) are at higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluated humoral and cellular responses to COVID-19 vaccines in Brazilian patients with IEI and healthy controls. Methods: Fifty-five patients with IEI (13-61 years) and 60 controls (13-71 years) received inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVac), non-replicating virus-vectored (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AstraZeneca) or monovalent mRNA (Original strain of BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech) and bivalent mRNA (Original/Omicron BA.1, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines and were sampled five times. Diagnoses included common variable immunodeficiency (n=25), specific antibody deficiency (n=9), ataxia-telangiectasia (n=5), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (n=4), PIK3CD-related disorders (n=4), hyper-IgM syndrome (n=4), combined immunodeficiency (n=3), and STAT1 gain-of-function (n=1). Humoral immunity was assessed via multiplex microarray for Spike, Nucleocapsid, RBD-Wuhan, RBD-Delta, RBD-BA.1, RBD-BA.2 and RBD-BA.5 neutralizing antibodies. T-cell responses to Spike and Nucleocapsid were assessed using ELISpot. Results: Patients with IEI exhibited significantly lower levels of Nucleocapsid and RBD-neutralizing antibodies (p < 0.05). Notable differences in RBD-BA.2 (p = 0.008) and IgG-Nucleocapsid (p = 0.010) levels emerged over time. T-cell responses to Spike were stronger in patients with IEI post-booster (405 vs. 149 spot-forming cells/million PBMC; p = 0.002). Both groups showed enhanced Nucleocapsid-specific cellular responses over time (p = 0.017). COVID-19 hospitalization rates among patients with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis dropped from 33.3% to zero after the first booster dose. Conclusions: While humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were weaker in patients with IEI, their cellular immunity was similar to controls. Boosters enhanced both humoral and cellular responses. After completion of the vaccination protocol, none of the patients with IEI were hospitalized with COVID-19. Robust T-cell responses may play a critical role in protecting patients with IEI from severe COVID-19 and mortality.
34527850	Ceralasertib-Mediated ATR Inhibition Combined With Olaparib in Advanced Cancers Harboring DNA Damage Response and Repair Alterations (Olaparib Combinations).	Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as promising therapy in cancers with homologous recombination repair deficiency. However, efficacy is limited by both intrinsic and acquired resistance. The Olaparib Combinations basket trial explored olaparib alone and in combination with other homologous recombination-directed targeted therapies. Here, we report the results of the arm in which olaparib was combined with the orally bioavailable ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related inhibitor ceralasertib in patients with relapsed or refractory cancers harboring DNA damage response and repair alterations, including patients with BRCA-mutated PARP inhibitor-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Germline and somatic mutations had to be deleterious by COSMIC or ClinVar for eligibility. Olaparib was administered at 300 mg twice daily and ceralasertib at 160 mg daily on days 1-7 in 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicities. Primary end points were confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) rates and clinical benefit rate (CBR; CR + PR + stable disease [SD] at 16 weeks). RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, with median four prior therapies. Five patients required dose reductions for myelosuppression. Overall response rate was 8.3% and CBR was 62.5% among the entire cohort. Two of five patients with tumor harboring ATM mutation achieved CR or SD ongoing at 24+ months, respectively (CBR 40%). Of seven patients with PARP inhibitor-resistant HGSOC, one achieved PR (-90%) and five had SD ranging 16-72 weeks (CBR 86%). CONCLUSION: Olaparib with ceralasertib demonstrated preliminary activity in ATM-mutated tumors and in PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOC. These data warrant additional studies to further confirm activity in these settings.
33975862	Phase I Study of Ceralasertib (AZD6738), a Novel DNA Damage Repair Agent, in Combination with Weekly Paclitaxel in Refractory Cancer.	PURPOSE: Ceralasertib is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with solid tumors, enriched for melanoma, received ceralasertib in combination with a fixed dose of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on D1, D8, D15) in 28-day cycles. The dose of ceralasertib was escalated to reach an MTD in a rolling 6 design. The starting dose of ceralasertib was 40 mg QD. Fifty-seven patients (33 patients with melanoma who failed prior PD1/L1 treatment) were enrolled in 7 dose cohorts ranging from 40 mg QD to 240 mg BD plus weekly paclitaxel. RESULTS: The RP2D was established as ceralasertib 240 mg BD days 1-14 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, D8, D15 every 28 days. The most common toxicities were neutropenia (n = 39, 68%), anemia (n = 25, 44%), and thrombocytopenia (n = 21, 37%). In the full analysis set of 57 patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 22.6% (95% CI, 12.5-35.3). In 33 patients with melanoma, resistant to prior anti-PD1 therapy, the ORR was 33.3% (95% CI, 18.0-51.8). In the melanoma subset, the mPFS was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.0-5.8), the median duration of response was 9.9 months (95% CI, 3.7-23.2), and the mOS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.7-11.9). CONCLUSIONS: Ceralasertib in combination with paclitaxel was well tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies and showed evidence of antitumor activity. Durable responses were observed in patients with advanced cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanoma resistant to anti-PD1/L1 treatment.See related commentary by Ashworth, p. 4667.
37824137	Berzosertib Plus Topotecan vs Topotecan Alone in Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	Importance: Patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a high replication stress tumor, have poor prognoses and few therapeutic options. A phase 2 study showed antitumor activity with the addition of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitor berzosertib to topotecan. Objective: To investigate whether the addition of berzosertib to topotecan improves clinical outcomes for patients with relapsed SCLC. Design, Setting, and Participants: Between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2022, this open-label phase 2 randomized clinical trial recruited 60 patients with SCLC and relapse after 1 or more prior therapies from 16 US cancer centers. Patients previously treated with topotecan were not eligible. Interventions: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone (group 1), 1.25 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through 5, or with berzosertib (group 2), 210 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2 and 5, in 21-day cycles. Randomization was stratified by tumor sensitivity to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) in the overall population and among patients with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant tumors. The PFS and OS for each treatment group were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and OS between the 2 groups, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the treatment hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Results: Of 60 patients (median [range] age, 59 [34-79] years; 33 [55%] male) included in this study, 20 were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone and 40 to receive a combination of topotecan with berzosertib. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 21.3 (18.1-28.3) months, there was no difference in PFS between the 2 groups (median, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.2-5.1] months for group 1 vs 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-4.6] months for group 2; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.46-1.41]; P = .44). Overall survival was significantly longer with the combination therapy (5.4 [95% CI, 3.2-6.8] months vs 8.9 [95% CI, 4.8-11.4] months; HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.29-0.96], P = .03). Adverse event profiles were similar between the 2 groups (eg, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, 11 of 20 [55%] vs 20 of 40 [50%], and any grade nausea, 9 of 20 [45%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, treatment with berzosertib plus topotecan did not improve PFS compared with topotecan therapy alone among patients with relapsed SCLC. However, the combination treatment significantly improved OS. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03896503.
33370001	The Development of Chylothorax in a Child With T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma and Ataxia Telangiectasia During Induction Therapy.	Chylothorax is an unusual complication of childhood cancer. It causes to additional morbidity and mortality during management. It should be kept in mind that chylothorax may occur due to mass shrinkage during treatment in patients with mediastinal mass and ductus thoracicus invasion at the initial diagnosis and necessary measures should be taken. This case was presented because of the rarity in pediatric oncology practice.
35154108	Childhood-Onset Movement Disorders Can Mask a Primary Immunodeficiency: 6 Cases of Classical Ataxia-Telangiectasia and Variant Forms.	Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a neurodegenerative and primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID) characterized by cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, progressive respiratory failure, and an increased risk of malignancies. It demands specialized care tailored to the individual patient's needs. Besides the classical ataxia-telangiectasia (classical A-T) phenotype, a variant phenotype (variant A-T) exists with partly overlapping but some distinctive disease characteristics. Here we present a case series of 6 patients with classical A-T and variant A-T, which illustrates the phenotypic variability of A-T that can present in childhood with prominent extrapyramidal features, with or without cerebellar ataxia. We report the clinical data, together with a detailed genotype description, immunological analyses, and related expression of the ATM protein. We show that the presence of some residual ATM kinase activity leads to the clinical phenotype variant A-T that differs from the classical A-T. Our data illustrate that the diagnosis of the variant form of A-T can be delayed and difficult, while early recognition of the variant form as well as the classical A-T is a prerequisite for providing a correct prognosis and appropriate rehabilitation and support, including the avoidance of diagnostic X-ray procedures, given the increased risk of malignancies and the higher risk for side effects of subsequent cancer treatment.
37635070	Ataxia Telangiectasia in a Patient with Breast Cancer: A Case Report.	Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the pathological variants of the ATM gene. Owing to i ts r arity a nd n ature, complications of AT, such a s malignant tumors, a re often difficult to manage with standard imaging studies and treatments, and there are no established management strategies. We report the case of a woman who had AT in childhood and developed breast cancer in her 20s; the disease was successfully managed by the decision-making of multidisciplinary physicians professionals with ethics support. She was immunocompromised, ataxic, and mentally impaired. The patient's mother noticed a tumor in her right breast and subsequently brought her to our department. Although preoperative testing and surgical procedures were limited as AT is extremely radiosensitive, the patient was diagnosed with cT2N0M0 breast cancer and underwent right mastectomy and axillary lymph node sampling. The final diagnosis was pT2N0M0 pStage IIA mucinous carcinoma, and immunohistochemistry of the tumor specimen was estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and HER2-negative. Tamoxifen was administered as postoperative adjuvant therapy, and the patient has survived to date without recurrence. Here, we report our experience with breast cancer treatment for AT, along with a review of the literature.
36674612	Successful Treatment of Large B-Cell Lymphoma in a Child with Compound Heterozygous Mutation in the ATM Gene.	Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a multisystemic neurodegenerative inborn error of immunity (IEI) characterized by DNA repair defect, chromosomal instability, and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Impaired DNA double-strand break repair determines a high risk of developing hematological malignancies, especially lymphoproliferative diseases. Poor response to treatment, excessive chemotherapy toxicities, and the need for avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation make the successful clinical management of patients with AT challenging for oncologists. We describe the favorable outcome of the LBCL with IRF4 rearrangement at stage III in a 7-year-old female patient diagnosed with AT. The patient was treated according to the B-HR arm of the INTER-B-NHL-COP 2010 protocol, including the administration of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, etc. She presented excessive treatment toxicities despite individually reduced doses of methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. However, in the MRI there was no significant reduction in pathologic lymph nodes after three immunochemotherapy courses. Therefore, a lymph node biopsy was taken. Its subsequent histopathological examination revealed tuberculosis-like changes, though tuberculosis suspicion was excluded. After two following immunochemotherapy courses, PET-CT confirmed complete remission. From March 2022 onwards, the patient has remained in remission under the care of the outpatient children's oncology clinic.
32748564	Severe reaction to radiotherapy provoked by hypomorphic germline mutations in ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene).	BACKGROUND: A minority of breast cancer (BC) patients suffer from severe reaction to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). Although deficient DNA double-strand break repair is considered the main basis for the reactions, pretreatment identification of high-risk patients has been challenging. METHODS: To retrospectively determine the etiology of severe local reaction to RT in a 39-year-old woman with BC, we performed next-generation sequencing followed by further clinical and functional studies. RESULTS: We found a -4 intronic variant (c.2251-4A>G) in trans with a synonymous (c.3576G>A) variant affecting the ATM DNA-repair gene (NG_009830.1, NM_000051.3) which is linked to autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We verified abnormal transcripts resulting from both variants, next to a minor wild-type transcript leading to a residual ATM kinase activity and genomic instability. Follow-up examination of the patient revealed no classic sign of A-T but previously unnoticed head dystonia and mild dysarthria, a family history of BC and late-onset ataxia segregating with the variants. Additionally, her serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was elevated similar to A-T patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the variable presentations of A-T and devastating impact of severe reactions to RT, we suggest a routine measurement of AFP in RT-candidate BC patients followed by next-generation sequencing with special attention to non-canonical splice site and synonymous variants in ATM.
40141188	Precision Medicine in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer: Targeted Therapies and the Challenge of Chemoresistance.	The poor prognosis for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the dominant subtype of ovarian cancer, reflects its aggressive nature, late diagnosis, and the highest mortality rate among all gynaecologic cancers. Apart from late diagnosis, the main reason for the poor prognosis and its unsuccessful treatment is primarily the emergence of chemoresistance to carboplatin. Although there is a good response to primary treatment, the disease recurs in 80% of cases, at which point it is largely resistant to carboplatin. The introduction of novel targeted therapies in the second decade of the 21st century has begun to transform the treatment of HGSOC, although their impact on overall survival remains unsatisfactory. Targeting the specific pathways known to be abnormally activated in HGSOC is especially difficult due to the molecular diversity of its subtypes. Moreover, a range of molecular changes are associated with acquired chemoresistance, e.g., reversion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline alleles. In this review, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of approved targeted therapies, including bevacizumab, PARP inhibitors (PARPis), and treatments targeting cells with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (BRAF), and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene alterations, as well as antibody-drug conjugates. Additionally, we explore promising new targets under investigation in ongoing clinical trials, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, Wee1 kinase inhibitors, and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors for platinum-resistant disease. Despite the development of new targeted therapies, carboplatin remains the fundamental medicine in HGSOC therapy. The correct choice of treatment strategy for better survival of patients with advanced HGSOC should therefore include a prediction of patients' risks of developing chemoresistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Moreover, effective targeted therapy requires the selection of patients who are likely to derive clinical benefit while minimizing potential adverse effects, underscoring the essence of precision medicine.
38129525	CHARIOT: a phase I study of berzosertib with chemoradiotherapy in oesophageal and other solid cancers using time to event continual reassessment method.	BACKGROUND: Berzosertib (M6620) is a highly potent (IC50  =  19 nM) and selective, first-in-class ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR) inhibitor. This trial assessed the safety, preliminary efficacy, and tolerance of berzosertib in oesophageal cancer (A1 cohort) with RT and advanced solid tumours (A2 cohort) with cisplatin and capecitabine. METHODS: Single-arm, open-label dose-escalation (Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method) trial with 16 patients in A1 and 18 in A2. A1 tested six dose levels of berzosertib with RT (35 Gy over 15 fractions in 3 weeks). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in A1. Eight grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in five patients, with rash being the most common. The highest dose (240 mg/m2) was determined as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for A1. Seven DLTs in two patients in A2. The RP2D of berzosertib was 140 mg/m2 once weekly. The most common grade >=3 treatment-related AEs were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib combined with RT is feasible and well tolerated in oesophageal cancer patients at high palliative doses. Berzosertib with cisplatin and capecitabine was well tolerated in advanced cancer. Further investigation is warranted in a phase 2 setting.

37071269	A review of recent advances in the novel therapeutic targets and immunotherapy for lung cancer.	Lung cancer is amongst the most pervasive malignancies having high mortality rates. It is broadly grouped into non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The concept of personalized medicine has overshadowed the conventional chemotherapy given to all patients with lung cancer. The targeted therapy is given to a particular population having specific mutations to help in the better management of lung cancer. The targeting pathways for NSCLC include the epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, MET (Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor) oncogene, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). SCLC targeting pathway includes Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK 1) pathway, WEE1 pathway, Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)/Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3 (DLL-Immune checkpoint inhibitors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/ programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors and Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) blockade are also utilized in the management of lung cancer. Many of the targeted therapies are still under development and require clinical trials to establish their safety and efficacy. This review summarizes the mechanism of molecular targets and immune-mediated targets, recently approved drugs, and their clinical trials for lung cancer.
35382675	Effectiveness of Person-Environment-Occupation Model on a Pediatric Neurodegenerative Disease: A Case Report of a Child with Ataxia-Telangiectasia.	Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. Ataxia-telangiectasia is a devastating disease that negatively affects the participation of patients in daily occupations and consequently has adverse impacts on the quality of life of them and their families. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an occupational therapy intervention based on the Person-Environment-Occupation Model (PEO) on a 9-year old boy with ataxia-telangiectasia. Following a ten-session intervention, the client experienced significant improvement in occupational performance as well as participation in daily occupations as measured by Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI), respectively.
38980086	The importance of synthetic pharmacotherapy for recessive cerebellar ataxias.	INTRODUCTION: The last decade has witnessed major breakthroughs in identifying novel genetic causes of hereditary ataxias, deepening our understanding of disease mechanisms, and developing therapies for these debilitating disorders. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the currently approved and most promising candidate pharmacotherapies in relation to the known disease mechanisms of the most prevalent autosomal recessive ataxias. Omaveloxolone is an Nrf2 activator that increases antioxidant defense and was recently approved for treatment of Friedreich ataxia. Its therapeutic effect is modest, and further research is needed to find synergistic treatments that would halt or reverse disease progression. Promising approaches include upregulation of frataxin expression by epigenetic mechanisms, direct protein replacement, and gene replacement therapy. For ataxia-telangiectasia, promising approaches include splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Rare recessive ataxias for which disease-modifying therapies exist are also reviewed, emphasizing recently approved therapies. Evidence supporting the use of riluzole and acetyl-leucine in recessive ataxias is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Advances in genetic therapies for other neurogenetic conditions have paved the way to implement feasible approaches with potential dramatic benefits. Particularly, as we develop effective treatments for these conditions, we may need to combine therapies, consider newborn testing for pre-symptomatic treatment, and optimize non-pharmacological approaches.
34620496	Combination ATR and PARP Inhibitor (CAPRI): A phase 2 study of ceralasertib plus olaparib in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.	OBJECTIVE: Platinum-resistant, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has limited treatment options. Preclinical data suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitors (ATRi) are synergistic. CAPRI (NCT03462342) is an investigator-initiated study of olaparib plus ceralasertib in recurrent HGSOC. Herein, we present results from the platinum-resistant cohort. METHODS: A Simon 2-stage design was utilized. Platinum-resistant HGSOC patients received ceralasertib 160 mg orally daily, days 1-7 and olaparib 300 mg orally twice daily, days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle until toxicity or progression. Primary endpoints were toxicity and efficacy including objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST. Secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The null hypothesis (<=5% ORR) would be rejected if there were >= 1 responses in 12 patients. RESULTS: Fourteen PARPi-naive patients were evaluable for toxicity; 12 were evaluable for response. Three had BRCA1 mutations (1 germline, 2 somatic). Adverse events possibly related to treatment were primarily grade (G) 1/2. G3 toxicities included nausea (14.3%), fatigue (7.1%), anorexia (7.1%), and anemia (7.1%). No objective responses occurred. Best response was stable disease in 9 patients and progressive disease in three. Five patients had a >= 20% to <30% reduction in disease burden, including 3 with BRCA1 mutations. Three of 11 patients (27%; 2 with BRCA1 mutations) evaluable by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria had >50% CA-125 decline, including 2 with CA-125 normalization. Median PFS was 4.2 months overall (90% CI:3.5-8.2) and 8.2 months (3.6 months-not determined) for patients with BRCA1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib plus ceralasertib is well-tolerated. No objective responses occurred, though a signal of activity was seen particularly in disease associated with BRCA1. Further evaluation of this combination should include alternate dosing strategies in genomically-selected populations.
35790315	Phase II study of ceralasertib (AZD6738) in combination with durvalumab in patients with advanced gastric cancer.	BACKGROUND: Targeting the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways is an attractive strategy for boosting cancer immunotherapy. Ceralasertib (AZD6738) is an oral kinase inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein, which is a master regulator of DDR. We conducted a phase II trial of ceralasertib plus durvalumab in patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer (AGC) to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the combination. METHODS: This phase II, open-label, single-center, non-randomized study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ceralasertib in combination with durvalumab in patients with AGC. The study drug regimen was ceralasertib (240 mg two times a day) days 15-28 in a 28-day cycle in combination with durvalumab (1500 mg) at day 1 every 4 weeks. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (V.1.1). Exploratory biomarker analysis was performed using fresh tumor biopsies in all enrolled patients. RESULTS: Among 31 patients, the ORR, disease control rate, median progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were 22.6% (95% CI 9.6% to 41.1%), 58.1% (95% CI 39.1% to 75.5%), 3.0 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.9) months, and 6.7 (95% CI 3.8 to 9.6) months, respectively. Common adverse events were manageable with dose modification. A subgroup of patients with a loss of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) expression and/or high proportion of mutational signature attributable to homologous repair deficiency (sig. HRD) demonstrated a significantly longer PFS than those with intact ATM and low sig. HRD (5.60 vs 1.65 months; HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.045 to 0.39; long-rank p<0.001). During the study treatment, upregulation of the innate immune response by cytosolic DNA, activation of intratumoral lymphocytes, and expansion of circulating tumor-reactive CD8 +T cell clones were identified in responders. Enrichment of the tumor vasculature signature was associated with treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Ceralasertib plus durvalumab has promising antitumor activity, with durable responses in patients with refractory AGC. Thus, a biomarker-driven trial is required. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03780608.
34894455	A phase 1b study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of berzosertib in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.	OBJECTIVES: Berzosertib (formerly M6620, VX-970) is an intravenous, highly potent and selective, first-in-class ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinase inhibitor. We assessed the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of berzosertib plus gemcitabine in an expansion cohort of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The association of efficacy with TP53 status and other tumor markers was also explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with advanced histologically confirmed NSCLC received berzosertib 210 mg/m2 (days 2 and 9) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (days 1 and 8) at the recommended phase 2 dose established in the dose escalation part of the study. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients received at least one dose of study treatment. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue (55.3%), anemia (52.6%), and nausea (39.5%). Gemcitabine had no apparent effect on the PK of berzosertib. The objective response rate (ORR) was 10.5% (4/38, 90% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-22.5%). In the exploratory analysis, the ORR was 30.0% (3/10, 90% CI: 9.0-61.0%) in patients with high loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and 11.0% (1/9, 90% CI: 1.0-43.0%) in patients with low LOH. The ORR was 33.0% (2/6, 90% CI: 6.0-73.0%) in patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), 12.5% (2/16, 90% CI: 2.0-34.0%) in patients with intermediate TMB, and 0% (0/3, 90% CI: 0.0-53.6%) in patients with low TMB. CONCLUSIONS: Berzosertib plus gemcitabine was well tolerated in patients with advanced, pre-treated NSCLC. Based on the observed clinical efficacy, future clinical trials should involve genomically selected patients.
32397775	In Ataxia-Telangiectasia, Oral Betamethasone Administration Ameliorates Lymphocytes Functionality through Modulation of the IL-7/IL-7Ralpha Axis Paralleling the Neurological Behavior: A Comparative Report of Two Cases.	Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by cerebellar neurodegeneration and immunodeficiency. Recent studies suggest that very low glucocorticoids (GCs) doses may help improve A-T neurological phenotype in some patients. Interestingly, in GCs studies an unexpected improvement of lymphocytes proliferation in some A-T patients has been observed. GCs are able to upregulate IL-7 Ralpha expression and rescue it from the recycling. In this study, we compared several immunological functions, including PBMC proliferative responses, cell activation events and IL-7/IL-7 Ralpha axis functionality, with the neurological behavior during an in-vivo GCs treatment between the most Responder patient to GC and the Non-Responder at all. During in-vivo GC treatment, we observed an increase of lymphocyte proliferation upon stimulation with PHA or IL-7 only in the Responder. This finding paralleled the increase in the surface expression of IL-7 R and up-regulation of the CD69 T-cell activation marker. Internalization and recycling of IL-7 R occurred properly only in the Responder. Microarray analysis revealed a remarkable difference in the DE-genes levels among Responder and Non-Responder, mostly concerning miRNAs and Multiple Complex families. Our findings suggest that the improvement of lymphocyte functionality, which correlates to the neurological behavior, is mediated through an effect of GCs on the IL-7/IL-7 Ralpha axis.
32878963	DUETTE: a phase II randomized, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a second maintenance treatment in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer, who have previously received poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor maintenance treatment.	BACKGROUND: With the success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy in the first-line and second-line treatment settings, a new patient population is emerging with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, who have previously received a PARP inhibitor in the maintenance setting and for whom no second maintenance standard of care exists. DUETTE (NCT04239014) will evaluate the combination of ceralasertib (a potent, selective inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) + olaparib, or olaparib monotherapy, compared with placebo, in this patient population of unmet need. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of ceralasertib + olaparib combination, and olaparib monotherapy, compared with placebo, as second maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: This study will test the hypothesis that ceralasertib + olaparib, or olaparib monotherapy, is tolerable, and effective at prolonging progression-free survival compared with placebo. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase II, multicenter study where patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either (Arm 1) ceralasertib + olaparib, (Arm 2) olaparib monotherapy, or (Arm 3) placebo. The olaparib and placebo arms will be double-blinded, whereas the ceralasertib + olaparib arm will be open label. Patients will be stratified according to BRCA status, and response to platinum-based chemotherapy. MAJOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible patients will have histologically diagnosed high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer, with platinum-sensitive relapse on, or after, completion of at least 6 months of any prior PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy (a minimum of 12 months is required if the patient received PARP inhibitor maintenance following first-line chemotherapy). If the prior PARP inhibitor used was olaparib then patients must have received treatment without significant toxicity or the need for a permanent dose reduction. Disease relapse in the second-line or third-line setting is allowed. Patients who have received secondary debulking surgery are potentially eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoint is progression-free survival determined by blinded independent central review according to RECIST 1.1, with sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival using investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1. SAMPLE SIZE: 192 patients. ESTIMATED DATES FOR COMPLETING ACCRUAL AND PRESENTING RESULTS: December 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04239014.
33145616	Population pharmacokinetics of ATR inhibitor berzosertib in phase I studies for different cancer types.	PURPOSE: Berzosertib (formerly M6620) is the first-in-class inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, a key component of the DNA damage response, and being developed in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cancers. The objectives of this analysis were to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of berzosertib across multiple studies and parts, estimate inter-individual variability, and identify covariates that could explain such variability. METHODS: A population PK analysis was performed using the combined dataset from two phase I clinical studies (NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34) in patients with advanced cancers receiving an intravenous infusion of berzosertib alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The analysis included data from 240 patients across 11 dose levels (18-480 mg/m2). Plasma concentration data were modeled with a non-linear mixed-effect approach and clinical covariates were evaluated. RESULTS: PK data were best described by a two-compartment linear model. For a typical patient, the estimated clearance (CL) and intercompartmental CL were 65 L/h and 295 L/h, respectively, with central and peripheral volumes estimated to be 118 L and 1030 L, respectively. Several intrinsic factors were found to influence berzosertib PK, but none were considered clinically meaningful due to a very limited effect. Model simulations indicated that concentrations of berzosertib exceeded p-Chk1 (proximal pharmacodynamic biomarker) IC50 at recommended phase II doses in combination with carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a clinically significant PK interaction between berzosertib and evaluated chemo-combinations. The covariate analysis did not highlight any need for dosing adjustments in the population studied to date. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: NCT02157792, EudraCT 2013-005100-34.
36520421	Emerging Strategies for the Treatment of Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Review.	Importance: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease that is characterized by rapid growth and the early development of metastases. Patients typically respond to initial chemotherapy but quickly experience relapse, resulting in a poor long-term outcome. Therapeutic innovations that substantially improve survival have historically been limited, and reliable, predictive biomarkers are lacking. Observations: This review examines the biologic characteristics of SCLC, the current treatment landscape, and ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets. Ongoing research has advanced the understanding of molecular categories and the immunologic microenvironment of SCLC, which in turn has helped improve disease classification and staging. Recently, immunotherapy-based regimens have become available for the management of SCLC, with 2 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of extensive-stage disease. For second-line treatment, a novel alkylating agent, lurbinectedin, which inhibits oncogenic transcription, has been approved for use in patients with metastatic SCLC. Furthermore, a wide variety of therapies and innovative combination regimens are being continuously evaluated. Potential therapeutic strategies, including aurora kinase A inhibitors, polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitors, delta-like protein 3 agents, antiganglioside agents, CD47 inhibitors, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1a inhibitors, are also being examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapeutic optimization of SCLC remains a challenge, but recent trial results and drug approvals are encouraging. Advances in research have revealed critical information regarding biologic characteristics of the disease, which may lead to the identification of vulnerabilities and the development of new therapies. Further research focused on identifying biomarkers and evaluating innovative therapies will be paramount to improving treatment outcomes for patients with SCLC.
33843495	T cell ALL in a child with Ataxia telangiectasia; diagnosis and management challenges.	Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare childhood autosomal recessive neurodegenerative chromosomalin stability disorder. It is characterized by high risk of hematological malignancies with T-cell phenotype being the most common, which can present first before the diagnosis of A-T made. The chromosomalin stability in A-T increases the toxicity to radio-chemotherapeutic agents, creating the treatment modification challenges and the deviation from the optimal management protocols. In this case report, we present a 14-month-old boy diagnosed as T cell -ALL. Based on his early presentation, family history of childhood lymphoma, and high AFP, inherited predisposition was suspected, and genetic testing confirms A-T. This report represents the crucial part of clinical suspicion of A-T in similar cases as well as highlighting the importance of an early A-T diagnosis that prevents toxic death due to the extensive regimen of radio- chemotherapeutic agents. The report summarizes the toxicity and modification challenges during management with literature review for the chemotherapy modification experience in such cases.
32601814	Targeting DNA Damage Repair Pathways in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.	OPINION STATEMENT: Metastatic (and locally advanced) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDA) represents a major challenge for the oncology community given the rising mortality burden from the disease and the preponderance of patients diagnosed with unresectable disease. Although systemic therapies have become more potent with the development of fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatments, the median overall survival for patients treated with either of these regimens remains just above 1 year. A significant need exists to build upon the effectiveness of first-line regimens, incorporate tolerable maintenance treatments, and add effective later-line options for patients with this disease. We believe every newly diagnosed mPDA patient should undergo next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing, preferably from tumor tissue, to assess for the presence of DNA damage repair (DDR) defects, microsatellite instability, and other possible actionable molecular alterations (such as neurotrophic tropomysin receptor kinase (NTRK) fusions, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification). Existing clinical data suggests that patients, whose tumors harbor DDR defects, benefit from treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Preclinically, inhibitors of other critical players in DDR such as ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and WEE1 have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in PDA cell lines and xenografts. How to move forward the preclinical promise of these newer DDR-targeting therapies into rational clinical trial combinations and sequence PARP inhibitors in relation to platinum chemotherapy remain areas of tremendous clinical research interest. We believe clinical trials should be considered early for mPDA patients, in all treatment lines, so that novel therapies may be added to the treatment armamentarium for patients with this disease. Beyond NGS testing from tumor tissue, we believe it is important to consider germline genetic testing for all patients diagnosed with PDA given recent data suggesting a much stronger hereditary component of the disease than previously understood, and the potential screening implications for family members.
37452395	Orchestrating smart therapeutics to achieve optimal treatment in small cell lung cancer: recent progress and future directions.	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant malignancy with elusive mechanism of pathogenesis and dismal prognosis. Over the past decades, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the backbone treatment for SCLC. However, subsequent chemoresistance after initial effectiveness urges researchers to explore novel therapeutic targets of SCLC. Recent years have witnessed significant improvements in targeted therapy in SCLC. New molecular candidates such as Ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related protein (ATR), WEE1, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) have shown promising therapeutic utility in SCLC. While immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has emerged as an indispensable treatment modality for SCLC, approaches to boost efficacy and reduce toxicity as well as selection of reliable biomarkers for ICI in SCLC have remained elusive and warrants our further investigation. Given the increasing importance of precision medicine in SCLC, optimal subtyping of SCLC using multi-omics have gradually applied into clinical practice, which may identify more drug targets and better tailor treatment strategies to each individual patient. The present review summarizes recent progress and future directions in SCLC. In addition to the emerging new therapeutics, we also focus on the establishment of predictive model for early detection of SCLC. More importantly, we also propose a multi-dimensional model in the prognosis of SCLC to ultimately attain the goal of accurate treatment of SCLC.
34436521	Effect of Cisplatin and Gemcitabine With or Without Berzosertib in Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.	IMPORTANCE: Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of single-stranded DNA repair by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 (ATR) may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and other chemotherapeutic agents. Cisplatin with gemcitabine remains the standard up-front therapy for treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of the selective ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, could augment the activity of cisplatin with gemcitabine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, 87 patients across 23 centers in the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network were randomized to receive either cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (control arm) or cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib (experimental arm). Key eligibility criteria included confirmed metastatic urothelial cancer, no prior cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease, 12 months or more since perioperative therapy, and eligibility for cisplatin receipt based on standard criteria. The study was conducted from January 27, 2017, to December 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival. The analysis was on all patients who started therapy. RESULTS: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib. Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men. Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08). Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68). Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm. Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination. Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.

38047767	Programmable Dna Hydrogel Assisting Microcrystal Formulations for Sustained Locoregional Drug Delivery in Surgical Residual Tumor Lesions And Lymph Node Metastasis.	Surgical residual tumor lesions (R1 resection of surgical procedures (e.g., liver cancer infiltrating the diaphragm, surgical residual breast cancer, postoperative residual ovarian cancer) or boundary residual after ablation) and lymph node metastasis that cannot be surgically resected (retroperitoneal lymph nodes) significantly affect postoperative survival of tumor patients. This clinical conundrum poses three challenges for local drug delivery systems: stable and continuous delivery, good biocompatibility, and the ability to package new targeted drugs that can synergizing with other treatments.Here, we report a drug-laden hydrogel generated from pure DNA strands and highly programmable in adjusting its mesh size. Meanwhile, the DNA hydrogel could assist the micro-crystallization of a novel radiosensitizing drugs, ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitor (Elimusertib), further facilitating its long-term release. When applied to the tumor site, the hydrogel system demonstrated significant antitumor activity, minimized systemic toxicity, and had a modulatory effect on the tumor-immune cell interface. Our drug-loaded DNA-hydrogel platform represents a novel modality for adjuvant therapy in patients with surgical residual tumor lesions and lymph node metastasis.

39897044	Advancement Opportunities and Endeavor of Innovative Targeted Therapies for Small Cell Lung Cancer.	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an intractable disease with rapid progression and high mortality, presenting a persistent obstacle impeding clinical management. Although recent advancements in immunotherapy have enhanced the response rates of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, the emergence of acquired resistance invariably leads to recurrence and metastasis. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to explore novel therapeutic targets and optimize existing treatment strategies. This article comprehensively reviews the currently available therapeutic modalities for SCLC. It delves into the immunologic prognostic implications by analyzing selected immune-related signatures. Moreover, it conducts an in-depth exploration of the molecular subtyping of SCLC and the associated molecular pathways to identify potential therapeutic targets. Specifically, the focus is on clinical interventions targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), elucidating its resistance mechanisms and demonstrating its notable antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, the study examines the mechanisms of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), covering resistance issues and strategies for optimizing resistance management, with particular emphasis being placed on analyzing the prospects and clinical value of CAR T therapy in the context of SCLC. Moreover, the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3/checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors is discussed and underscores the advantages of combining these inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to combat chemoresistance and enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapies. Overall, this study investigates emerging strategies for targeted therapies and optimized combination regimens to overcome resistance in SCLC and highlights future strategies for new therapeutic technologies for SCLC.
