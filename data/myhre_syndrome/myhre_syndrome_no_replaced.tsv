24580733	Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome (MS) is a developmental disorder characterized by typical facial dysmorphism, thickened skin, joint limitation and muscular pseudohypertrophy. Other features include brachydactyly, short stature, intellectual deficiency with behavioral problems and deafness. We identified SMAD4 as the gene responsible for MS. The identification of SMAD4 mutations in Laryngotracheal stenosis, Arthropathy, Prognathism and Short stature (LAPS) cases supports that LAPS and MS are a unique entity. The long-term follow up of patients shows that these conditions are progressive with life threatening complications. All mutations are de novo and changing in the majority of cases Ile500, located in the MH2 domain involved in transcriptional activation. We further showed an impairment of the transcriptional regulation via TGFbeta target genes in patient fibroblasts. Finally, the absence of SMAD4 mutations in three MS cases may support genetic heterogeneity. 
33630210	Lack of resemblance between Myhre syndrome and other "segmental progeroid" syndromes warrants restraint in applying this classification. 
35025139	Expanded cardiovascular phenotype of Myhre syndrome includes tetralogy of Fallot suggesting a role for SMAD4 in human neural crest defects. Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) can be associated with a wide range of extracardiac anomalies, with an underlying etiology identified in approximately 10% of cases. Individuals affected with Myhre syndrome due to recurrent SMAD4 mutations frequently have cardiovascular anomalies, including congenital heart defects. In addition to two patients in the literature with ToF, we describe five additional individuals with Myhre syndrome and classic ToF, ToF with pulmonary atresia and multiple aorto-pulmonary collaterals, and ToF with absent pulmonary valve. Aorta hypoplasia was documented in one patient and suspected in another two. In half of these individuals, postoperative cardiac dysfunction was thought to be more severe than classic postoperative ToF repair. There may be an increase in right ventricular pressure, and right ventricular dysfunction due to free pulmonic regurgitation. Noncardiac developmental abnormalities in our series and the literature, including corectopia, heterochromia iridis, and congenital miosis suggest an underlying defect of neural crest cell migration in Myhre syndrome. We advise clinicians that Myhre syndrome should be considered in the genetic evaluation of a child with ToF, short stature, unusual facial features, and developmental delay, as these children may be at risk for increased postoperative morbidity. Additional research is needed to investigate the hypothesis that postoperative hemodynamics in these patients may be consistent with restrictive myocardial physiology.

35869926	An additional patient with SMAD4-Juvenile Polyposis-Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and connective tissue abnormalities: SMAD4 loss-of-function and gain-of-function pathogenic variants result in contrasting phenotypes. Loss-of-function pathogenic variants in somatic and germline cells in SMAD4 may cause cancer and juvenile polyposis-Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (SMAD4-JP-HHT), respectively. In a similar manner, gain-of-function somatic and germline pathogenic variants in SMAD4 can cause various forms of cancer as well as Myhre syndrome. The different SMAD4 molecular mechanisms result in contrasting clinical phenotypes demonstrated by SMAD4-JP-HHT and Myhre syndrome. We report an additional patient with SMAD4-JP-HHT and aortopathy, and expand the phenotype to include severe valvulopathy, cutaneous, ophthalmologic, and musculoskeletal features consistent with an inherited disorder of connective tissue. We compared this 70-year-old man with SMAD4-JP-HHT to 18 additional literature cases, and also compared patients with SMAD4-JP-HHT to those with Myhre syndrome. In contrast to aorta dilation, hypermobility, and loose skin in SMAD4-JP-HHT, Myhre syndrome has aorta hypoplasia, stiff joints, and firm skin representing an intriguing phenotypic contrast, which can be attributed to different molecular mechanisms involving SMAD4. We remind clinicians about the possibility of significant cardiac valvulopathy and aortopathy, as well as connective tissue disease in SMAD4-JP-HHT. Additional patients and longer follow-up will help determine if more intensive surveillance improves care amongst these patients.
24398790	SMAD4 mutations causing Myhre syndrome result in disorganization of extracellular matrix improved by losartan. Myhre syndrome (MS, MIM 139210) is a connective tissue disorder that presents with short stature, short hands and feet, facial dysmorphic features, muscle hypertrophy, thickened skin, and deafness. Recurrent missense mutations in SMAD4 encoding for a transducer mediating transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling are responsible for MS. We found that MS fibroblasts showed increased SMAD4 protein levels, impaired matrix deposition, and altered expression of genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases and related inhibitors. Increased TGF-beta signaling and progression of aortic root dilation in Marfan syndrome can be prevented by the antihypertensive drug losartan, a TGF-beta antagonists and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blocker. Herein, we showed that losartan normalizes metalloproteinase and related inhibitor transcript levels and corrects the extracellular matrix deposition defect in fibroblasts from MS patients. The results of this study may pave the way toward therapeutic applications of losartan in MS. 
34143683	Multilevel Airway Stenosis Being Bypassed by a Customized Tracheostomy Tube in an Infant with Myhre Syndrome. Background: Myhre syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the SMAD4 gene. Although recognizing Myhre syndrome in early childhood is challenging, it is important to manage airway stenosis in patients with Myhre syndrome. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 2-month-old boy who initially presented with severe multilevel airway stenosis, dysmorphic face, and multiple abnormalities. Lung fibrosis and mild aortic valve stenosis were additionally observed on follow-up examinations. A heterozygous missense variant, c.1499T>C (p.Ile500Thr), in SMAD4 was identified through exome sequencing. Tracheostomy was performed, and the patient has maintained stable respiration through a customized tracheostomy tube with a home ventilator. Conclusions: Patients who have dysmorphic face, airway stenosis, and cardiovascular anomalies that do not fit the diagnosis of common syndromes should be evaluated for rare diseases, including Myhre syndrome. Since respiratory complications can be life threatening, early diagnosis and suitable intervention are necessary.

12843331	Myhre syndrome: new reports, review, and differential diagnosis. 
22683461	Retinal involvement in two unrelated patients with Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome is a very rare condition described thirty years ago and related to mutations in the SMAD4 gene. It has been reported in 19 patients, including 13 males and 6 females before the recent finding of heterozygous mutations in the SMAD4 gene in 19 patients. It is characterized by mental retardation, short stature, muscle hypertrophy, limitation of joints movements, deafness, skeletal anomalies, and facial dysmorphism. Ophthalmological involvement includes hypermetropia and congenital cataract. We report here the new finding of retinal involvement including retinitis pigmentosa and maculopathy in two unrelated patients with Myhre syndrome. The patient with retinitis pigmentosa carried the p.I500T mutation in SMAD4, but no mutation was found in the patient with the maculopathy.
30968316	Autism Spectrum Disorder and Psychiatric Comorbidity in a Patient with Myhre Syndrome. Myhre syndrome (MS) is a connective tissue disorder with multisystem involvement with or without intellectual disability. In most cases SMAD4 mutations are reported. To date, 55 individuals have been molecularly confirmed. Autism has been proposed among associate clinical features of MS but no standardized diagnosis was available in previous cases. We report a case of a 25-year-old man with a pathogenic heterozygous SMAD4 missense mutation affecting residue Arg496 (SMAD4:p.Arg496Cys). Clinical findings are consistent with MS, commorbid with affective disorder and High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder confirmed by a standardized assessment procedure. The thorough clinical assessment of cases with syndromes such as MS can extend our knowledge on both the phenotypic characteristics of the syndrome and the genetic basis of autism.
22791552	From tall to short: the role of TGFbeta signaling in growth and its disorders. The acromelic dysplasia group is characterized by short stature, short hands and feet, stiff joint, and "muscular" build. Four disorders can now be ascribed to this group, namely Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), geleophysic dysplasia (GD), acromicric dysplasia (AD), and Myhre syndrome (MS). Although closely similar, they can be distinguished by subtle clinical features and their pattern inheritance. WMS is characterized by the presence of dislocation of microspherophakia and has autosomal dominant or recessive mode of inheritance. GD is the more severe one, with a progressive cardiac valvular thickening, tracheal stenosis, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, often leading to an early death. AD has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, distinct facial and skeleton features (a hoarse voice and internal notch of the femoral head). Finally, MS is sporadic, characterized by prognathism, deafness, developmental delay, thickened calvarium, and large vertebrae with short and large pedicles. We first identified mutations in Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) in the dominant form of WMS and then mutations in A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase domain with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats 10 (ADAMTS10) in the recessive form of WMS. The function of ADAMTS10 is unknown but these findings support a direct interaction between ADAMTS10 and FBN1. We then identified mutations in ADAMTSL2 in the recessive form of GD and a hotspot of mutations in FBN1 in the dominant form of GD and in AD (exon 41-42, encoding TGFbeta binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5) of FBN1). The function of ADAMTSL2 is unknown. Using a yeast double hybrid screen, we identified latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) binding protein 1 as a partner of ADAMTSL2. We found an increased level of active TGFbeta in the fibroblast medium from patients with FBN1 or ADAMTSL2 mutations and an enhanced phosphorylated SMAD2 level, allowing us to conclude at an enhanced TGFbeta signaling in GD and AD. Finally, a direct interaction between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 was demonstrated suggesting a dysregulation of FBN1/ADAMTSL2 interrelationship as the underlying mechanism of the short stature phenotypes. Using exome sequencing in MS probands, we identified de novo SMAD4 missense mutations, all involving isoleucine residue at position 500, in the MH2 domain. In MS fibroblasts, we found decreased ubiquitination level of SMAD4 and increased level of SMAD4 supporting a stabilization of SMAD4 protein. Functional SMAD4 is required for canonical signal transduction through the oligomerization with phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8. We therefore studied the nuclear localization of mutant SMAD complexes and found that the complexes translocate to the nucleus. We finally observed a decreased expression of downstream TGFbeta target genes supporting impaired TGFbeta driven transcriptional control in MS. Our findings support a direct link between the short stature phenotypes and the TGFbeta signaling. However, the finding of enhanced TGFbeta signaling in Marfan phenotypes supports the existence of yet unknown mechanisms regulating TGFbeta action.

31654632	The first two Chinese Myhre syndrome patients with the recurrent SMAD4 pathogenic variants: Functional consequences and clinical diversity. Myhre syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant multi-organ disorder characterized by growth retardation, skeletal anomalies, muscular hypertrophy, joint stiffness, facial dysmorphism, deafness, cardiovascular disease, and abnormal sexual development. Here we described the first two Chinese Myhre syndrome patients diagnosed by whole-exome sequencing. They both had de novo c.1498A > G (p.Ile500Val) variant in SMAD4 and presented with key characteristics of Myhre syndrome but also revealed uncommon features (polydactyly in the girl and precocious puberty in the boy). We performed functional analysis on four previously reported SMAD4 pathogenic variants in Myhre syndrome patients using dual-luciferase assay. Our results revealed that the pathogenic variants resulted in a variable degree of increased transcription activity of target genes that contain the minimal SMAD binding elements in their promoter regions. The boy responded to the recombinant human growth hormone treatment with improved height but also led to hyperinsulinemia and advanced bone age. Because of his precocious puberty, we subsequently combined the recombinant human growth hormone and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist treatments, which resulted in overall improved height. We reviewed the sexual features of reported Myhre syndrome cases and discussed the possible mechanism of SMAD4 variants in Myhre syndrome that lead to the abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
24424121	Myhre and LAPS syndromes: clinical and molecular review of 32 patients. Myhre syndrome is characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, facial features, pseudomuscular hypertrophy, joint limitation and hearing loss. We identified SMAD4 mutations as the cause of Myhre syndrome. SMAD4 mutations have also been identified in laryngotracheal stenosis, arthropathy, prognathism and short stature syndrome (LAPS). This study aimed to review the features of Myhre and LAPS patients to define the clinical spectrum of SMAD4 mutations. We included 17 females and 15 males ranging in age from 8 to 48 years. Thirty were diagnosed with Myhre syndrome and two with LAPS. SMAD4 coding sequence was analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Clinical and radiological features were collected from a questionnaire completed by the referring physicians. All patients displayed a typical facial gestalt, thickened skin, joint limitation and muscular pseudohypertrophy. Growth retardation was common (68.7%) and was variable in severity (from -5.5 to -2 SD), as was mild-to-moderate intellectual deficiency (87.5%) with additional behavioral problems in 56.2% of the patients. Significant health concerns like obesity, arterial hypertension, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, laryngotracheal stenosis, pericarditis and early death occurred in four. Twenty-nine patients had a de novo heterozygous SMAD4 mutation, including both patients with LAPS. In 27 cases mutation affected Ile500 and in two cases Arg496. The three patients without SMAD4 mutations had typical findings of Myhre syndrome. Myhre-LAPS syndrome is a clinically homogenous condition with life threatening complications in the course of the disease. Our identification of SMAD4 mutations in 29/32 cases confirms that SMAD4 is the major gene responsible for Myhre syndrome. 
22158539	Mutations at a single codon in Mad homology 2 domain of SMAD4 cause Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome (MIM 139210) is a developmental disorder characterized by short stature, short hands and feet, facial dysmorphism, muscular hypertrophy, deafness and cognitive delay. Using exome sequencing of individuals with Myhre syndrome, we identified SMAD4 as a candidate gene that contributes to this syndrome on the basis of its pivotal role in the bone morphogenetic pathway (BMP) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. We identified three distinct heterozygous missense SMAD4 mutations affecting the codon for Ile500 in 11 individuals with Myhre syndrome. All three mutations are located in the region of SMAD4 encoding the Mad homology 2 (MH2) domain near the site of monoubiquitination at Lys519, and we found a defect in SMAD4 ubiquitination in fibroblasts from affected individuals. We also observed decreased expression of downstream TGF-beta target genes, supporting the idea of impaired TGF-beta-mediated transcriptional control in individuals with Myhre syndrome.
22711472	First case of a Japanese girl with Myhre syndrome due to a heterozygous SMAD4 mutation. This article reports the first case of a Japanese girl with molecularly confirmed Myhre syndrome (MS). The patient was 9 years old at her first visit, and she had been diagnosed with unknown skeletal dysplasia. Her phenotype fulfilled the clinical and radiological criteria for MS, such as typical facies with prognathism, hearing impairment, short stature, square body shape, and limited joint mobility. The thick calvarium and thick skin were clues to the clinical diagnosis of MS. A heterozygous mutation in the mothers-against-DPP homolog 4 (SMAD4) gene has been reported to cause MS. We sequenced SMAD4 using standard PCR-based technique and identified a recurrent mutation (p.Ile500 Thr). She attained menarche before 11 years of age; however, she developed oligomenorrhea after a few years of 40-day cycles, necessitating hormone replacement therapy. The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) tests suggested abnormalities related to hypothalamo-hypophyseal malfunction. Previous reports on MS described early menarche in girls and early or delayed puberty and cryptorchidism in boys. Therefore, we recommend performing an endocrinological evaluation of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis in patients with MS to clarify whether hormonal abnormalities are associated with the syndrome.

27562837	Natural history and life-threatening complications in Myhre syndrome and review of the literature. UNLABELLED: Myhre syndrome (OMIM 139210) is a rare developmental disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by a narrow spectrum of missense mutations in the SMAD4 gene. The condition features characteristic face, short stature, skeletal anomalies, muscle pseudohypertrophy, restricted joint mobility, stiff and thick skin, and variable intellectual disability. While most of the clinical features manifest during childhood, the diagnosis may be challenging during the first years of life. We report on the evolution of the clinical features of Myhre syndrome during childhood in a subject with molecularly confirmed diagnosis. The clinical records of 48 affected patients were retrospectively analysed to identify any early clinical signs characterizing this disorder and to better delineate its natural history. We also note that pericarditis and laryngotracheal involvement represent important life-threatening complications of Myhre syndrome that justify the recommendation for cardiological and ENT follow-up for these patients. CONCLUSION: Short length/stature, short palpebral fissures, and brachydactyly with hyperconvex nails represent signs/features that might lead to the correct diagnosis in the first years of life and direct to the proper molecular analysis. We underline the clinical relevance of pericarditis and laryngotracheal stenosis as life-threatening complications of this disorder and the need for careful monitoring, in relation to their severity. WHAT IS KNOWN:   The clinical and radiological signs of the disease in children older than 7-8 years.   Pericarditis, sometimes occurring with constrictive pericardium requiring pericardiectomy, has been reported as a recurrent feature but has not been adequately stressed in previous literature. What is New:   Short length/stature, short palpebral fissures, brachydactyly with hyperconvex nails represent clinical signs that might lead to diagnosis in the first years of life.   Review of the literature showed that pericarditis and laryngotracheal complications represent major recurrent issues in patients with Myhre syndrome.
33369056	A pilot clinical trial with losartan in Myhre syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Myhre syndrome (MS) is an ultra-rare disorder due to pathogenic variants in the SMAD4 gene that encodes a protein regulating the TGF-beta pathway and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Main clinical features of MS include thickening of skin and joint stiffness. Previous studies showed that losartan improved ECM deposition in MS fibroblasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four molecularly confirmed MS subjects (mean age 23.8 +- 17 years) were evaluated for: (a) skin thickness by Rodnan score, (b) joint range of motion (ROM) by goniometry, and (c) speckle-tracking echocardiogram. Following baseline evaluations, three MS individuals received losartan for 12 months and pre-defined endpoints were monitored after 6 and 12 months of treatment. RESULTS: At baseline, Rodnan scores were increased, joint ROM was reduced, and speckle-tracking echocardiogram revealed reduced myocardial strain. In three MS subjects, improvements in skin thickness, joint ROM and to a lesser extent of myocardial strain, were observed after 6 and 12 months of losartan treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although further long-term controlled clinical trials with a larger number of affected individuals are needed, the present study suggests that losartan might improve skin, joint and heart abnormalities of MS.
27302097	Gain-of-function mutations in SMAD4 cause a distinctive repertoire of cardiovascular phenotypes in patients with Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome is a rare, distinctive syndrome due to specific gain-of-function mutations in SMAD4. The characteristic phenotype includes short stature, dysmorphic facial features, hearing loss, laryngotracheal anomalies, arthropathy, radiographic defects, intellectual disability, and a more recently appreciated spectrum of cardiovascular defects with a striking fibroproliferative response to surgical intervention. We report four newly described patients with typical features of Myhre syndrome who had (i) a mildly narrow descending aorta and restrictive cardiomyopathy; (ii) recurrent pericardial and pleural effusions; (iii) a large persistent ductus arteriosus with juxtaductal aortic coarctation; and (iv) restrictive pericardial disease requiring pericardiectomy. Additional information is provided about a fifth previously reported patient with fatal pericardial disease. A literature review of the cardiovascular features of Myhre syndrome was performed on 54 total patients, all with a SMAD4 mutation. Seventy percent had a cardiovascular abnormality including congenital heart defects (63%), pericardial disease (17%), restrictive cardiomyopathy (9%), and systemic hypertension (15%). Pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy are associated with high mortality (three patients each among 10 deaths); one patient with restrictive cardiomyopathy also had epicarditis. Cardiomyopathy and pericardial abnormalities distinguish Myhre syndrome from other disorders caused by mutations in the TGF-beta signaling cascade (Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, or Shprintzen-Goldberg syndromes). We hypothesize that the expanded spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities relates to the ability of the SMAD4 protein to integrate diverse signaling pathways, including canonical TGF-beta, BMP, and Activin signaling. The co-occurrence of congenital and acquired phenotypes demonstrates that the gene product of SMAD4 is required for both developmental and postnatal cardiovascular homeostasis.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
18388781	The fifth female patient with Myhre syndrome: further delineation. We report the fifth female patient with Myhre syndrome (MS) and review the literature. She is a 13-year-old Mexican girl whose phenotype fulfills all the clinical and radiological criteria reported in MS such as typical facies, short stature, limited joint mobility, and short hands and feet. The physical habitus of MS is described and a square body shape is clearly distinguished in all cases. As the typical muscular build is present mainly in male patients, the MS muscular appearance may be hormonally influenced.
24442880	Leri's pleonosteosis, a congenital rheumatic disease, results from microduplication at 8q22.1 encompassing GDF6 and SDC2 and provides insight into systemic sclerosis pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: Leri's pleonosteosis (LP) is an autosomal dominant rheumatic condition characterised by flexion contractures of the interphalangeal joints, limited motion of multiple joints, and short broad metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges. Scleroderma-like skin thickening can be seen in some individuals with LP. We undertook a study to characterise the phenotype of LP and identify its genetic basis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping in two families with LP defined microduplications of chromosome 8q22.1 as the cause of this condition. Expression analysis of dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals showed overexpression of two genes, GDF6 and SDC2, within the duplicated region, leading to dysregulation of genes that encode proteins of the extracellular matrix and downstream players in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pathway. Western blot analysis revealed markedly decreased inhibitory SMAD6 levels in patients with LP. Furthermore, in a cohort of 330 systemic sclerosis cases, we show that the minor allele of a missense SDC2 variant, p.Ser71Thr, could confer protection against disease (p<1x10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: Our work identifies the genetic cause of LP in these two families, demonstrates the phenotypic range of the condition, implicates dysregulation of extracellular matrix homoeostasis genes in its pathogenesis, and highlights the link between TGF-beta/SMAD signalling, growth/differentiation factor 6 and syndecan-2. We propose that LP is an additional member of the growing 'TGF-beta-pathies' group of musculoskeletal disorders, which includes Myhre syndrome, acromicric dysplasia, geleophysic dysplasias, Weill-Marchesani syndromes and stiff skin syndrome. Identification of a systemic sclerosis-protective SDC2 variant lays the foundation for exploration of the role of syndecan-2 in systemic sclerosis in the future.
3152479	Understanding Proteus syndrome, unmasking the elephant man, and stemming elephant fever. Four patients with Proteus syndrome are reported; 3 of the 4 died of unusual causes. Current findings of the syndrome are reviewed, and the present state of its delineation is assessed with emphasis on what is known about natural history. Differential diagnosis includes neurofibromatosis, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, Maffucci syndrome, epidermal nevus syndrome, and the combination of Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, Riley-Smith syndrome, and Ruvalcaba-Myhre syndrome, now thought to constitute a single disorder. Conditions that may possibly overlap with Proteus syndrome--encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis and Thanos syndrome--receive special attention. Various suggested diagnoses for the elephant man's disorder are evaluated, and it is concluded that he suffered from Proteus syndrome, not neurofibromatosis. Finally, the psychosocial significance of elephant fever (EF) is discussed, and a plea is made for taking the EF out of NF.

Myhre syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by short stature, distinctive facial dysmorphisms, generalized muscle hypertrophy, skeletal abnormalities, decreased joint motility, developmental delay, deafness and cardiac defects. Myhre syndrome and the allelic laryngeal stenosis, arthropathy, prognathism and short stature syndrome are caused by a missense mutation of SMAD4, resulting in altered expression of transforming growth factor beta and bone morphogenic protein, affecting cell growth and differentiation. Here, we report on the case of a 7-year-old girl showing symptoms of Myhre syndrome and with a known SMAD4 mutation presenting with the novel symptom of severe constipation.

37529930	Prenatal diagnosis of Myhre syndrome with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SMAD4 gene presented with thick nuchal translucency and cardiac abnormalities. Prenatal testing was performed in a 39-year-old Chinese pregnant woman referred for increased nuchal translucency measuring 5.7 mm. Non-invasive prenatal testing and SNP array study on amniotic fluid samples were normal. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was initiated further as the fetus had pericardial effusion of 1.2 mm, thickened myocardium over the right ventricular lateral wall and aberrant right subclavian artery. A detailed fetal echocardiogram also revealed persistent left superior vena cava and dilated coronary sinus at 20 weeks. From whole exome sequencing of the trio, a de novo heterozygous variant NM_005359.5(SMAD4): c.1499T>C (p.Ile500Thr) was detected. This pathogenic variant has been reported in the postnatal case cohort of Myhre syndrome. This condition is characterized by facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, hearing loss, skeletal abnormalities and potential life threatening respiratory or cardiovascular manifestations. Termination of pregnancy was performed at 23 weeks. Small chins, pre-axial polydactyly, brachydactyly and clinodactyly were noted in the abortus. Ultrasound findings of increased nuchal translucency, thickened myocardium and pericardial effusion prompted further genetic evaluation for the prenatal diagnosis of Myhre syndrome by whole exome sequencing.
31837202	Gain-of-function pathogenic variants in SMAD4 are associated with neoplasia in Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome is an increasingly diagnosed rare syndrome that is caused by one of two specific heterozygous gain-of-function pathogenic variants in SMAD4. The phenotype includes short stature, characteristic facial appearance, hearing loss, laryngotracheal stenosis, arthritis, skeletal abnormalities, learning and social challenges, distinctive cardiovascular defects, and a striking fibroproliferative response in the ear canals, airways, and serosal cavities (peritoneum, pleura, pericardium). Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is usually prompted by the characteristic appearance with developmental delay and autistic-like behavior using targeted gene sequencing or by whole exome sequencing. We describe six patients (two not previously reported) with molecularly confirmed Myhre syndrome and neoplasia. Loss-of-function pathogenic variants in SMAD4 cause juvenile polyposis syndrome and we hypothesize that the gain-of-function pathogenic variants observed in Myhre syndrome may contribute to neoplasia in the patients reported herein. The frequency of neoplasia (9.8%, 6/61) in this series (two new, four reported patients) and endometrial cancer (8.8%, 3/34, mean age 40 years) in patients with Myhre syndrome, raises the possibility of cancer susceptibility in these patients. We alert clinicians to the possibility of detecting this syndrome when cancer screening panels are used. We propose that patients with Myhre syndrome are more susceptible to neoplasia, encourage increased awareness, and suggest enhanced clinical monitoring.
21816239	Clinical features and respiratory complications in Myhre syndrome. We describe the clinical characteristics of 4 singleton cases, 3 males and 1 female, with Myhre Syndrome (OMIM 139210), who were born to non-consanguineous parents. Three cases had no family history of similarly affected individuals but 1 male's mother had short stature, some facial features suggestive of Myhre syndrome and evidence of skewed X-chromosome inactivation in her blood DNA. Short stature, deafness, learning difficulties, skeletal anomalies and facial dysmorphisms were evident in all cases. Arthralgia and stiff joints with limited movement were also present. The facial appearance, thickened skin, a 'muscular' habitus are memorable features. The female patient was least affected: this patient and one affected male displayed streaky skin with areas of patchy thickening, suggestive of genetic mosaicism. One patient developed sleep apnoea, a restrictive ventilatory defect and died following a choking episode. Another affected male developed recurrent, progressive, proximal, tracheal stenosis requiring partial tracheal resection, laser treatment and eventually tracheotomy. Review of Myhre syndrome patients in the literature and syndromes in the differential diagnosis, suggests heterogeneity in Myhre syndrome and clinical overlap with Laryngotracheal stenosis, Arthropathy, Prognathism and Short stature syndrome.
11568925	Case of Myhre syndrome with autism and peculiar skin histological findings. Myhre syndrome (MS) (MIM 139210) is a rare disorder characterized by short stature, mental retardation, muscular build, blepharophimosis, and decreased joint mobility. We report on a 14-year-old boy with clinical findings consistent with a diagnosis of Myhre syndrome, associated with autism and peculiar skin histological findings.
34433528	Benefit of cochlear implantation in a patient with Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome is a rare disorder characterised by short stature, skeletal anomalies, facial dysmorphism and hearing loss (HL), resulting from heterozygous mutations of the SMAD4 gene. We describe the benefits of cochlear implant (CI) in a patient with sensorineural HL carrying a mutation (NM_005359.6: c.1498A>G; p.lle500Val) within the SMAD4 gene, detected by whole-exome sequencing. The CI was inserted through the round window despite otospongiotic abnormalities. Pure-tone audiometry improved up to 20 dBHL. Speech perception in noise (Simplified Noise Reduction - SNR +10) increased from 0% pre implantation with hearing aids to 50% post implantation. The postoperative setting of the electrical stimulation limits yielded an asymmetric map, with lower levels for central electrodes and higher levels for lateral ones. Action potential could not be evoked via medial electrodes, suggesting a cochlear nerve dysfunction. Outcomes related to quality of life and cognitive impairment improved. CI was shown to be an effective auditory rehabilitation strategy.
36120950	Review of the Pathologic Characteristics in Myhre Syndrome: Gain-of-Function Pathogenic Variants in SMAD4 cause a Multisystem Fibroproliferative Response. Background: Myhre syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in SMAD4, is characterized by compact body habitus with short stature, distinctive craniofacial appearance, stiff skin, cardiovascular abnormalities (valve stenosis, coarctation, hypoplasia, or stenosis of aorta), effusions of potential spaces (pericardium, pleura, peritoneum), restricted movement of the joints (including thorax), and hearing loss. Lung and airway disease has been reported, but not always well-defined, to include interstitial lung disease, large airway obstruction, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Excessive fibroproliferation of tissues especially following trauma or surgical instrumentation has been recognized, although these may also present spontaneously. Method: We report the pathologic features of 1 new patient with progressive choanal stenosis, and 22 literature cases, including the expanded history of 5 patients (3 who died). Results: Examination of patient tissues documents cellular fibroproliferation and deposition of excessive extracellular matrix explaining some of the observed clinical features of Myhre syndrome. Conclusion: Excessive fibrosis is noted in multiple tissues, especially heart, lung, and upper and lower airways. Our research provides the first systematic review to provide a knowledge base of gross and pathologic findings in Myhre syndrome.

35907855	Natural history of Myhre syndrome. BACKGROUND: Myhre syndrome (MS) is a rare genetic disease characterized by skeletal disorders, facial features and joint limitation, caused by a gain of function mutation in SMAD4 gene. The natural history of MS remains incompletely understood. METHODS: We recruited in a longitudinal retrospective study patients with molecular confirmed MS from the French reference center for rare skeletal dysplasia. We described natural history by chaining data from medical reports, clinical data warehouse, medical imaging and photographies. RESULTS: We included 12 patients. The median age was 22 years old (y/o). Intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation were consistently reported. In preschool age, neurodevelopment disorders were reported in 80% of children. Specifics facial and skeletal features, thickened skin and joint limitation occured mainly in school age children. The adolescence was marked by the occurrence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and vascular stenosis. We reported for the first time recurrent strokes from the age of 26 y/o, caused by a moyamoya syndrome in one patient. Two patients died at late adolescence and in their 20 s respectively from PAH crises and mesenteric ischemia. CONCLUSION: Myhre syndrome is a progressive disease with severe multisystemic impairement and life-threathning complication requiring multidisciplinary monitoring.
15057124	Second female case of Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by low birthweight, short stature, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism (blepharophimosis, midfacial hypoplasia, prognathism), heart anomalies, muscle hypertrophy, decreased joint mobility and deafness. To date 11 male cases and only one female case have been reported. This paper describes the second female case and compares the clinical and radiological findings between female and male patients.
22243968	A restricted spectrum of mutations in the SMAD4 tumor-suppressor gene underlies Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by reduced growth, generalized muscular hypertrophy, facial dysmorphism, deafness, cognitive deficits, joint stiffness, and skeletal anomalies. Here, by performing exome sequencing of a single affected individual and coupling the results to a hypothesis-driven filtering strategy, we establish that heterozygous mutations in SMAD4, which encodes for a transducer mediating transforming growth factor beta and bone morphogenetic protein signaling branches, underlie this rare Mendelian trait. Two recurrent de novo SMAD4 mutations were identified in eight unrelated subjects. Both mutations were missense changes altering Ile500 within the evolutionary conserved MAD homology 2 domain, a well known mutational hot spot in malignancies. Structural analyses suggest that the substituted residues are likely to perturb the binding properties of the mutant protein to signaling partners. Although SMAD4 has been established as a tumor suppressor gene somatically mutated in pancreatic, gastrointestinal, and skin cancers, and germline loss-of-function lesions and deletions of this gene have been documented to cause disorders that predispose individuals to gastrointestinal cancer and vascular dysplasias, the present report identifies a previously unrecognized class of mutations in the gene with profound impact on development and growth.
24715504	Novel SMAD4 mutation causing Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome (MYHRS, OMIM 139210) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental and growth delay, athletic muscular built, variable cognitive deficits, skeletal anomalies, stiffness of joints, distinctive facial gestalt and deafness. Recently, SMAD4 (OMIM 600993) was identified by exome sequencing as the disease gene mutated in MYHRS. Previously only three missense mutations affecting Ile500 (p.Ile500Thr, p.Ile500Val, and p.Ile500Met) have been described in 22 unrelated subjects with MYHRS or a clinically related phenotype. Here we report on a 15-year-old boy with typical MYHRS and a novel heterozygous SMAD4 missense mutation affecting residue Arg496. This finding provides further information about the distinctive SMAD4 mutation spectrum in MYHRS. In silico structural analyses exploring the impact of the Arg-to-Cys change at codon 496 suggested that conformational changes promoted by replacement of Arg496 impact the stability of the SMAD heterotrimer and/or proper SMAD4 ubiquitination.

26420300	Myhre syndrome: Clinical features and restrictive cardiopulmonary complications. Myhre syndrome, a connective tissue disorder characterized by deafness, restricted joint movement, compact body habitus, and distinctive craniofacial and skeletal features, is caused by heterozygous mutations in SMAD4. Cardiac manifestations reported to date have included patent ductus arteriosus, septal defects, aortic coarctation and pericarditis. We present five previously unreported patients with Myhre syndrome. Despite varied clinical phenotypes all had significant cardiac and/or pulmonary pathology and abnormal wound healing. Included herein is the first report of cardiac transplantation in patients with Myhre syndrome. A progressive and markedly abnormal fibroproliferative response to surgical intervention is a newly delineated complication that occurred in all patients and contributes to our understanding of the natural history of this disorder. We recommend routine cardiopulmonary surveillance for patients with Myhre syndrome. Surgical intervention should be approached with extreme caution and with as little invasion as possible as the propensity to develop fibrosis/scar tissue is dramatic and can cause significant morbidity and mortality.
32917212	A case of Myhre syndrome mimicking juvenile scleroderma. BACKGROUND: Myhre syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by gain of function mutations in the SMAD Family Member 4 (SMAD4) gene, resulting in progressive, proliferative skin and organ fibrosis. Skin thickening and joint contractures are often the main presenting features of the disease and may be mistaken for juvenile scleroderma. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 13 year-old female presenting with widespread skin thickening and joint contractures from infancy. She was diagnosed with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, and treatment with corticosteroids and subcutaneous methotrexate recommended. There was however disease progression prompting genetic testing. This identified a rare heterozygous pathogenic variant c.1499 T > C (p.Ile500Thr) in the SMAD4 gene, suggesting a diagnosis of Myhre syndrome. Securing a molecular diagnosis in this case allowed the cessation of immunosuppression, thus reducing the burden of unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment, and allowing genetic counselling. CONCLUSION: Myhre Syndrome is a rare genetic mimic of scleroderma that should be considered alongside several other monogenic diseases presenting with pathological fibrosis from early in life. We highlight this case to provide an overview of these genetic mimics of scleroderma, and highlight the molecular pathways that can lead to pathological fibrosis. This may provide clues to the pathogenesis of sporadic juvenile scleroderma, and could suggest novel therapeutic targets.
12116212	Probable identity of Goltz syndrome and Van Allen-Myhre syndrome: evidence from phenotypic evolution. We describe a girl who was diagnosed with split foot-split hand anomaly prenatally, in whom at birth the diagnosis of Van Allen-Myhre syndrome was made, and who at 8 months of age was recognized to have Goltz syndrome. Based on the evolution of clinical features in this infant, we suggest that our case, as well as that reported by Van Allen and Myhre, is an example of unusually severe Goltz syndrome.

29230941	A child with Myhre syndrome presenting with corectopia and tetralogy of Fallot. Myhre syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by a narrow spectrum of missense mutations in the SMAD4 gene. Typical features of this disorder are distinctive facial appearance, deafness, intellectual disability, cardiovascular abnormalities, short stature, short hands and feet, compact build, joint stiffness, and skeletal anomalies. The clinical features generally appear during childhood and become more evident in older patients. Therefore, the diagnosis of this syndrome in the first years of life is challenging. We report a 2-year-old girl diagnosed with Myhre syndrome by whole exome sequencing (WES) that revealed the recurrent p.Ile500Val mutation in the SMAD4 gene. Our patient presented with growth deficiency, dysmorphic features, tetralogy of Fallot, and corectopia (also known as ectopia pupillae). The girl we described is the youngest patient with Myhre syndrome. Moreover, corectopia and tetralogy of Fallot have not been previously reported in this disorder.
33428109	SMAD4 mutations and cross-talk between TGF-beta/IFNgamma signaling accelerate rates of DNA damage and cellular senescence, resulting in a segmental progeroid syndrome-the Myhre syndrome. SMAD4 encodes a member of the SMAD family of proteins involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Potentially heritable, autosomal dominant, gain-of-function heterozygous variants of SMAD4 cause a rare developmental disorder, the Myhre syndrome, which is associated with a wide range of developmental and post-developmental phenotypes that we now characterize as a novel segmental progeroid syndrome. Whole-exome sequencing of a patient referred to our International Registry of Werner Syndrome revealed a heterozygous p.Arg496Cys variant of the SMAD4 gene. To investigate the role of SMAD4 mutations in accelerated senescence, we generated cellular models overexpressing either wild-type SMAD4 or mutant SMAD4-R496C in normal skin fibroblasts. We found that cells expressing the SMAD4-R496C mutant exhibited decreased proliferation and elevated expression of cellular senescence and inflammatory markers, including IL-6, IFNgamma, and a TGF-beta target gene, PAI-1. Here we show that transient exposure to TGF-beta, an inflammatory cytokine, followed by chronic IFNgamma stimulation, accelerated rates of senescence that were associated with increased DNA damage foci and SMAD4 expression. TGF-beta, IFNgamma, or combinations of both were not sufficient to reduce proliferation rates of fibroblasts. In contrast, TGF-beta alone was able to induce preadipocyte senescence via induction of the mTOR protein. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin mitigated TGF-beta-induced expression of p21, p16, and DNA damage foci and improved replicative potential of preadipocytes, supporting the cell-specific response to this cytokine. These findings collectively suggest that persistent DNA damage and cross-talk between TGF-beta/IFNgamma pathways contribute to a series of molecular events leading to cellular senescence and a segmental progeroid syndrome.
23610053	Recurrent pericarditis in Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal short stature, brachydactyly, facial dysmorphism (short palpebral fissures, maxillary hypoplasia, prognathism and short philtrum), thick skin, muscular-appearing body build, decreased joint mobility, mixed hearing loss, and cleft lip and palate. Other clinical features include skeletal dysplasia, developmental delay with intellectual disability and/or behavioral disturbance, cardiac defects, cryptorchidism, and bone anomalies. The disease is caused by recently identified SMAD4 mutations. Here we describe a 7-year-old boy with a molecularly proven Myhre syndrome who presented life-threatening recurrent pericarditis and systemic inflammatory symptoms that required treatment with steroid and recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.
25252769	Myhre syndrome: a rare craniofacial disorder. AIMS: Myhre syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by abnormal growth of the skeleton, muscles, and joints. The relationship of this syndrome to craniofacial growth and development is unknown. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first Japanese case ever studied. METHODOLOGY: At 10 years and 7 months of age, the patient was referred to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry in the authors' hospital, complaining of a dental problem. RESULTS: The craniofacial region exhibited a long lower face, high and narrowed palate with submucous cleft palate, maxillary constriction, prognathism, open bite, and crowding of the dental arch. Some of these morphological disorders could be affected by the functional manifestations of muscular hypertrophy of the cheek region, muscle tenseness, or the low position of the tongue. General disorders of muscular hypertrophy, thickened bones, and limited joint mobility are consistent with craniofacial findings of muscle tension in the cheek region, thickened calvarium, and limitation of temporomandibular joint movement. The submucous cleft palate and crown deformation of the mandibular central incisor may be affected by dysfunctions of SMAD4 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Craniofacial growth and development is affected by the general characteristics of Myhre syndrome, and could be important in its diagnosis.
16278892	Myhre syndrome in a female with previously undescribed symptoms: further delineation of the phenotype. Myhre syndrome is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by nonprogressive stiffness of the large joints, short stature with a peculiar build, and a distinctive facial phenotype. Developmental delay is common. Three female patients have so far been described. Here, we report on a 16-year-old female with Myhre syndrome. She has vertebral defects, hypertrophic scar formation, and a stiff skin in addition to the features that have previously been reported in association with Myhre syndrome.
8261650	The Myhre syndrome: report of two cases. Two unrelated patients, aged 19 and 6 years, were studied and diagnosed as having Myhre syndrome (MS). This review, together with three previous cases, permits further delineation of MS. The main features are: short stature, mental retardation, blepharophimosis, muscular hypertrophy, decreased joint mobility, thick calvarium, broad ribs, hypoplastic iliac wings and short tubular bones. Advanced paternal age at the propositi's birth suggests an autosomal dominant mutation as the cause of MS.
31595668	Myhre syndrome: A first familial recurrence and broadening of the phenotypic spectrum. Myhre syndrome is a rare multisystem connective tissue disorder, characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphology, variable intellectual disability, skeletal abnormalities, arthropathy, cardiopathy, laryngotracheal anomalies, and stiff skin. So far, all molecularly confirmed cases harbored a de novo heterozygous gain-of-function mutation in SMAD4, encoding the SMAD4 transducer protein required for both transforming growth factor-beta and bone morphogenic proteins signaling. We report on four novel patients (one female proband and her two affected children, and one male proband) with Myhre syndrome harboring the recurrent c.1486C>T (p.Arg496Cys) mutation in SMAD4. The female proband presented with a congenital heart defect, vertebral anomalies, and facial dysmorphic features. She developed severe tracheal stenosis requiring a total laryngectomy. With assisted reproductive treatment, she gave birth to two affected children. The second proband presented with visual impairment following lensectomy in childhood, short stature, brachydactyly, stiff skin, and decreased peripheral sensitivity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the dermis shows irregular elastin cores with globular deposits and almost absent surrounding microfibrils and suggests age-related increased collagen deposition. We report on the first familial case of Myhre syndrome and illustrate the variable clinical spectrum of the disorder. Despite the primarily fibrotic nature of the disease, TEM analysis mainly indicates elastic fiber anomalies.
