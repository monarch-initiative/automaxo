input_text: 'Prenatal diagnosis of Myhre syndrome with a heterozygous pathogenic variant
  in SMAD4 gene presented with thick nuchal translucency and cardiac abnormalities.
  Prenatal testing was performed in a 39-year-old Chinese pregnant woman referred
  for increased nuchal translucency measuring 5.7 mm. Non-invasive prenatal testing
  and SNP array study on amniotic fluid samples were normal. Whole exome sequencing
  (WES) was initiated further as the fetus had pericardial effusion of 1.2 mm, thickened
  myocardium over the right ventricular lateral wall and aberrant right subclavian
  artery. A detailed fetal echocardiogram also revealed persistent left superior vena
  cava and dilated coronary sinus at 20 weeks. From whole exome sequencing of the
  trio, a de novo heterozygous variant NM_005359.5(SMAD4): c.1499T>C (p.Ile500Thr)
  was detected. This pathogenic variant has been reported in the postnatal case cohort
  of Myhre syndrome. This condition is characterized by facial dysmorphism, intellectual
  disability, hearing loss, skeletal abnormalities and potential life threatening
  respiratory or cardiovascular manifestations. Termination of pregnancy was performed
  at 23 weeks. Small chins, pre-axial polydactyly, brachydactyly and clinodactyly
  were noted in the abortus. Ultrasound findings of increased nuchal translucency,
  thickened myocardium and pericardial effusion prompted further genetic evaluation
  for the prenatal diagnosis of Myhre syndrome by whole exome sequencing.'
