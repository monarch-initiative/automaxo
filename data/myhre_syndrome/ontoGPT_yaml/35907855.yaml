input_text: 'Natural history of Myhre syndrome. BACKGROUND: Myhre syndrome (MS) is
  a rare genetic disease characterized by skeletal disorders, facial features and
  joint limitation, caused by a gain of function mutation in SMAD4 gene. The natural
  history of MS remains incompletely understood. METHODS: We recruited in a longitudinal
  retrospective study patients with molecular confirmed MS from the French reference
  center for rare skeletal dysplasia. We described natural history by chaining data
  from medical reports, clinical data warehouse, medical imaging and photographies.
  RESULTS: We included 12 patients. The median age was 22 years old (y/o). Intrauterine
  and postnatal growth retardation were consistently reported. In preschool age, neurodevelopment
  disorders were reported in 80% of children. Specifics facial and skeletal features,
  thickened skin and joint limitation occured mainly in school age children. The adolescence
  was marked by the occurrence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and vascular
  stenosis. We reported for the first time recurrent strokes from the age of 26 y/o,
  caused by a moyamoya syndrome in one patient. Two patients died at late adolescence
  and in their 20 s respectively from PAH crises and mesenteric ischemia. CONCLUSION:
  Myhre syndrome is a progressive disease with severe multisystemic impairement and
  life-threathning complication requiring multidisciplinary monitoring.'
