input_text: 'Myhre syndrome. Myhre syndrome (MS) is a developmental disorder characterized
  by typical facial dysmorphism, thickened skin, joint limitation and muscular pseudohypertrophy.
  Other features include brachydactyly, short stature, intellectual deficiency with
  behavioral problems and deafness. We identified SMAD4 as the gene responsible for
  MS. The identification of SMAD4 mutations in Laryngotracheal stenosis, Arthropathy,
  Prognathism and Short stature (LAPS) cases supports that LAPS and MS are a unique
  entity. The long-term follow up of patients shows that these conditions are progressive
  with life threatening complications. All mutations are de novo and changing in the
  majority of cases Ile500, located in the MH2 domain involved in transcriptional
  activation. We further showed an impairment of the transcriptional regulation via
  TGFbeta target genes in patient fibroblasts. Finally, the absence of SMAD4 mutations
  in three MS cases may support genetic heterogeneity. '
