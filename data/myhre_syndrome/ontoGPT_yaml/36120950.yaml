  Pathogenic Variants in SMAD4 cause a Multisystem Fibroproliferative Response. Background:
  Myhre syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in SMAD4, is characterized by compact
  body habitus with short stature, distinctive craniofacial appearance, stiff skin,
  cardiovascular abnormalities (valve stenosis, coarctation, hypoplasia, or stenosis
  of aorta), effusions of potential spaces (pericardium, pleura, peritoneum), restricted
  movement of the joints (including thorax), and hearing loss. Lung and airway disease
  has been reported, but not always well-defined, to include interstitial lung disease,
  large airway obstruction, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Excessive fibroproliferation
  of tissues especially following trauma or surgical instrumentation has been recognized,
  although these may also present spontaneously. Method: We report the pathologic
  features of 1 new patient with progressive choanal stenosis, and 22 literature cases,
  including the expanded history of 5 patients (3 who died). Results: Examination
  of patient tissues documents cellular fibroproliferation and deposition of excessive
  extracellular matrix explaining some of the observed clinical features of Myhre
  syndrome. Conclusion: Excessive fibrosis is noted in multiple tissues, especially
  heart, lung, and upper and lower airways. Our research provides the first systematic
  review to provide a knowledge base of gross and pathologic findings in Myhre syndrome.'
