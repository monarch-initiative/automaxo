input_text: Expanded cardiovascular phenotype of Myhre syndrome includes tetralogy
  of Fallot suggesting a role for SMAD4 in human neural crest defects. Tetralogy of
  Fallot (ToF) can be associated with a wide range of extracardiac anomalies, with
  an underlying etiology identified in approximately 10% of cases. Individuals affected
  with Myhre syndrome due to recurrent SMAD4 mutations frequently have cardiovascular
  anomalies, including congenital heart defects. In addition to two patients in the
  literature with ToF, we describe five additional individuals with Myhre syndrome
  and classic ToF, ToF with pulmonary atresia and multiple aorto-pulmonary collaterals,
  and ToF with absent pulmonary valve. Aorta hypoplasia was documented in one patient
  and suspected in another two. In half of these individuals, postoperative cardiac
  dysfunction was thought to be more severe than classic postoperative ToF repair.
  There may be an increase in right ventricular pressure, and right ventricular dysfunction
  due to free pulmonic regurgitation. Noncardiac developmental abnormalities in our
  series and the literature, including corectopia, heterochromia iridis, and congenital
  miosis suggest an underlying defect of neural crest cell migration in Myhre syndrome.
  We advise clinicians that Myhre syndrome should be considered in the genetic evaluation
  of a child with ToF, short stature, unusual facial features, and developmental delay,
  as these children may be at risk for increased postoperative morbidity. Additional
  research is needed to investigate the hypothesis that postoperative hemodynamics
  in these patients may be consistent with restrictive myocardial physiology.
