BACKGROUND: Myhre syndrome (MS) is a rare genetic disease characterized by skeletal disorders, facial features and joint limitation, caused by a gain of function mutation in SMAD4 gene. The natural history of MS remains incompletely understood. METHODS: We recruited in a longitudinal retrospective study patients with molecular confirmed MS from the French reference center for rare skeletal dysplasia. We described natural history by chaining data from medical reports, clinical data warehouse, medical imaging and photographies. RESULTS: We included 12 patients. The median age was 22 years old (y/o). Intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation were consistently reported. In preschool age, neurodevelopment disorders were reported in 80% of children. Specifics facial and skeletal features, thickened skin and joint limitation occured mainly in school age children. The adolescence was marked by the occurrence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and vascular stenosis.

Prenatal testing was performed in a 39-year-old Chinese pregnant woman referred for increased nuchal translucency measuring 5.7 mm. Non-invasive prenatal testing and SNP array study on amniotic fluid samples were normal. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was initiated further as the fetus had pericardial effusion of 1.2 mm, thickened myocardium over the right ventricular lateral wall and aberrant right subclavian artery. A detailed fetal echocardiogram also revealed persistent left superior vena cava and dilated coronary sinus at 20 weeks. From whole exome sequencing of the trio, a de novo heterozygous variant NM_005359.5(SMAD4): c.1499T>C (p.Ile500Thr) was detected. This pathogenic variant has been reported in the postnatal case cohort of Myhre syndrome. This condition is characterized by facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, hearing loss, skeletal abnormalities and potential life threatening respiratory or cardiovascular manifestations. Termination of pregnancy was performed at 23 weeks. Small chins, pre-axial polydactyly, brachydactyly and clinodactyly were noted in the abortus. Ultrasound findings of increased nuchal translucency, thickened myocardium and pericardial effusion prompted further genetic evaluation for the prenatal diagnosis of Myhre syndrome by whole exome sequencing.",

Prenatal testing was performed in a 39-year-old Chinese pregnant woman referred for increased nuchal translucency measuring 5.7 mm. Non-invasive prenatal testing and SNP array study on amniotic fluid samples were normal. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was initiated further as the fetus had pericardial effusion of 1.2 mm, thickened myocardium over the right ventricular lateral wall and aberrant right subclavian artery. A detailed fetal echocardiogram also revealed persistent left superior vena cava and dilated coronary sinus at 20 weeks. From whole exome sequencing of the trio, a de novo heterozygous variant NM_005359.5(SMAD4): c.1499T>C (p.Ile500Thr) was detected. This pathogenic variant has been reported in the postnatal case cohort of Myhre syndrome. This condition is characterized by facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, hearing loss, skeletal abnormalities and potential life threatening respiratory or cardiovascular manifestations. Termination of pregnancy was performed at 23 weeks. Small chins, pre-axial polydactyly, brachydactyly and clinodactyly were noted in the abortus. Ultrasound findings of increased nuchal translucency, thickened myocardium and pericardial effusion prompted further genetic evaluation for the prenatal diagnosis of Myhre syndrome by whole exome sequencing.",
