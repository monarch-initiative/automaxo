input_text: Music-Based Intervention Ameliorates Mecp2-Loss-Mediated Sociability Repression
  in Mice through the Prefrontal Cortex FNDC5/BDNF Pathway. Patients with Rett syndrome
  (RTT) show severe difficulties with communication, social withdrawl, and learning.
  Music-based interventions improve social interaction, communication skills, eye
  contact, and physical skills and reduce seizure frequency in patients with RTT.
  This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which music-based interventions
  compromise sociability impairments in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice as an experimental
  RTT model. Male mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice and wild-type mice (24 days old) were randomly
  divided into control, noise, and music-based intervention groups. Mice were exposed
  to music or noise for 6 h/day for 3 consecutive weeks. Behavioral patterns, including
  anxiety, spontaneous exploration, and sociability, were characterized using open-field
  and three-chamber tests. BDNF, TrkB receptor motif, and FNDC5 expression in the
  prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, basal ganglia, and amygdala were probed using
  RT-PCR or immunoblotting. mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice showed less locomotion in an open
  field than wild-type mice. The social novelty rather than the sociability of these
  animals increased following a music-based intervention, suggesting that music influenced
  the mecp2-deletion-induced social interaction repression rather than motor deficit.
  Mechanically, the loss of BDNF signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal
  regions, but not in the basal ganglia and amygdala, was compromised following the
  music-based intervention in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice, whereas TrkB signaling was not
  significantly changed in either region. FNDC5 expression in the prefrontal cortex
  region in mecp2&nbsp;null/y mice also increased following the music-based intervention.
  Collective evidence reveals that music-based interventions improve mecp2-loss-induced
  social dysfunction. BDNF and FNDC5 signaling in the prefrontal cortex region mediates
  the music-based-intervention promotion of social interactions. This study gives
  new insight into the mechanisms underlying the improvement of social behaviors in
  mice suffering from experimental Rett syndrome following a music-based intervention.
