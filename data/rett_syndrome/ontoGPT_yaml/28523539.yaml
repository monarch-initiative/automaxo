input_text: 'The Role of Noncoding RNAs in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: The Case
  of Rett Syndrome. Current technologies have demonstrated that only a small fraction
  of our genes encode for protein products. The vast majority of the human transcriptome
  corresponds to noncoding RNA (ncRNA) of different size, localization, and expression
  profile. Despite the fact that a biological function remains yet to be determined
  for most ncRNAs, growing evidence points to their crucial regulatory roles at all
  stages in gene expression regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional
  control, so that proper cell homeostasis seems to depend largely on a variety of
  ncRNA-mediated regulatory networks. This is particularly relevant in the human brain,
  which displays the richest repertoire of ncRNA species, and where several different
  ncRNA molecules are known to be involved in crucial steps for brain development
  and maturation. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
  loss of function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding for methyl-CpG-binding
  protein 2 (MeCP2). MECP2 deficiency impacts globally on gene expression programs,
  mainly through its role as a transcriptional repressor, and growing data also points
  to an important dysregulation of the noncoding transcriptome in the disease. Here,
  we review the current knowledge on ncRNA alterations in Rett and explore links with
  other pathologies that might indicate the potential use of particular noncoding
  transcripts as therapeutical targets, tools, or disease biomarkers.'
