input_text: Whole brain delivery of an instability-prone Mecp2 transgene improves
  behavioral and molecular pathological defects in mouse models of Rett syndrome.
  Rett syndrome is an incurable neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in
  the gene encoding for methyl-CpG binding-protein 2 (MeCP2). Gene therapy for this
  disease presents inherent hurdles since MECP2 is expressed throughout the brain
  and its duplication leads to severe neurological conditions as well. Herein, we
  use the AAV-PHP.eB to deliver an instability-prone Mecp2 (iMecp2) transgene cassette
  which, increasing RNA destabilization and inefficient protein translation of the
  viral Mecp2 transgene, limits supraphysiological Mecp2 protein levels. Intravenous
  injections of the PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus in symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice significantly
  improved locomotor activity, lifespan and gene expression normalization. Remarkably,
  PHP.eB-iMecp2 administration was well tolerated in female Mecp2 mutant or in wild-type
  animals. In contrast, we observed a strong immune response to the transgene in treated
  male Mecp2 mutant mice that was overcome by immunosuppression. Overall, PHP.eB-mediated
  delivery of iMecp2 provided widespread and efficient gene transfer maintaining physiological
  Mecp2 protein levels in the brain.
