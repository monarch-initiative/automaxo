input_text: 'Probing a neural unreliability account of auditory sensory processing
  atypicalities in Rett Syndrome. BACKGROUND: In the search for objective tools to
  quantify neural function in Rett Syndrome (RTT), which are crucial in the evaluation
  of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, recordings of sensory-perceptual functioning
  using event-related potential (ERP) approaches have emerged as potentially powerful
  tools. Considerable work points to highly anomalous auditory evoked potentials (AEPs)
  in RTT. However, an assumption of the typical signal-averaging method used to derive
  these measures is "stationarity" of the underlying responses - i.e. neural responses
  to each input are highly stereotyped. An alternate possibility is that responses
  to repeated stimuli are highly variable in RTT. If so, this will significantly impact
  the validity of assumptions about underlying neural dysfunction, and likely lead
  to overestimation of underlying neuropathology. To assess this possibility, analyses
  at the single-trial level assessing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), inter-trial variability
  (ITV) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) are necessary. METHODS: AEPs were recorded
  to simple 100 Hz tones from 18 RTT and 27 age-matched controls (Ages: 6-22 years).
  We applied standard AEP averaging, as well as measures of neuronal reliability at
  the single-trial level (i.e. SNR, ITV, ITPC). To separate signal-carrying components
  from non-neural noise sources, we also applied a denoising source separation (DSS)
  algorithm and then repeated the reliability measures. RESULTS: Substantially increased
  ITV, lower SNRs, and reduced ITPC were observed in auditory responses of RTT participants,
  supporting a "neural unreliability" account. Application of the DSS technique made
  it clear that non-neural noise sources contribute to overestimation of the extent
  of processing deficits in RTT. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced,
  so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer
  detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates
  in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully
  evident. CONCLUSIONS: To accurately represent the degree of neural dysfunction in
  RTT using the ERP technique, a consideration of response reliability at the single-trial
  level is highly advised. Non-neural sources of noise lead to overestimation of the
  degree of pathological processing in RTT, and denoising source separation techniques
  during signal processing substantially ameliorate this issue.'
