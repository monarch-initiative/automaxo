input_text: Engineered microRNA-based regulatory element permits safe high-dose miniMECP2
  gene therapy in Rett mice. MECP2 gene transfer has been shown to extend the survival
  of Mecp2-/y knockout mice modelling Rett syndrome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental
  disorder. However, controlling deleterious overexpression of MECP2 remains the critical
  unmet obstacle towards a safe and effective gene therapy approach for Rett syndrome.
  A recently developed truncated miniMECP2 gene has also been shown to be therapeutic
  after AAV9-mediated gene transfer in knockout neonates. We show that AAV9/miniMECP2
  has a similar dose-dependent toxicity profile to that of a published second-generation
  AAV9/MECP2 vector after treatment in adolescent mice. To overcome that toxicity,
  we developed a risk-driven viral genome design strategy rooted in high-throughput
  profiling and genome mining to rationally develop a compact, synthetic microRNA
  target panel (miR-responsive auto-regulatory element, 'miRARE') to minimize the
  possibility of miniMECP2 transgene overexpression in the context of Rett syndrome
  gene therapy. The goal of miRARE is to have a built-in inhibitory element responsive
  to MECP2 overexpression. The data provided herein show that insertion of miRARE
  into the miniMECP2 gene expression cassette greatly improved the safety of miniMECP2
  gene transfer without compromising efficacy. Importantly, this built-in regulation
  system does not require any additional exogenous drug application, and no miRNAs
  are expressed from the transgene cassette. Although broad applications of miRARE
  have yet to be determined, the design of miRARE suggests a potential use in gene
  therapy approaches for other dose-sensitive genes.
