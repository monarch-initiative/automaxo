input_text: 'Therapeutic effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on patients
  with spastic cerebral palsy and Rett syndrome: clinical and ultrasonographic findings.
  BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for
  improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because
  late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate
  the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed
  with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1
  mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were
  assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the
  Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function
  Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic
  radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients
  with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients
  with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM
  (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P
  < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores
  (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under
  ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius
  medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased
  shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly
  course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and
  Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the
  gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement
  of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients
  with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the
  MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology
  differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult. Trial registration
