input_text: 'Characterization of the Pharmacokinetics and Mass Balance of a Single
  Oral Dose of Trofinetide in Healthy Male Subjects. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide
  is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental
  disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion
  profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose
  trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics
  of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide,
  and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose
  administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and
  fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of
  trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid
  chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity
  was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation
  counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal
  samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions.
  Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were
  assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity
  were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles
  of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed
  into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6
  h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h).
  The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack
  of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8%
  of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and
  fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168
  h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood
  and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to
  12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity
  excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in
  0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In
  blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <=
  2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and
  fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of
  dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were
  not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes
  in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram
  results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide
  undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged
  in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.'
