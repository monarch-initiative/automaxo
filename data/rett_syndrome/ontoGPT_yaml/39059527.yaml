input_text: A comprehensive review on the current status of CRISPR based clinical
  trials for rare diseases. A considerable fraction of population in the world suffers
  from rare diseases. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)
  and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating
  the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema,
  duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases.
  CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and
  sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological
  diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas
  (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector
  and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics
  of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc.
  For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery
  in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have
  been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence
  of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy
  for beta-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression
  of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will
  decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward
  in further stages of human clinical trials. This review focuses on CRISPR/Cas based
  therapies which are at various stages of clinical trials for treatment of rare diseases
  and the constraints and ethical issues associated with them.
