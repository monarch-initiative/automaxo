input_text: "Adolescents with Rett syndrome at critical care pathway junctures: Examining
  clinicians' decision to initiate invasive long-term ventilation. BACKGROUND: The
  initiation of invasive long-term ventilation (I-LTV) for an adolescent with Rett
  Syndrome (RTT) involves many serious bioethical considerations. In moving towards
  a more inclusive model of patient participation, transparency surrounding the main
  influencing factors around this decision is important. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify
  the main drivers influencing a clinician's decision to support initiation of I-LTV
  for an adolescent with RTT. METHOD: We used an anonymous online vignette-based factorial
  survey. The survey was distributed internationally through eight professional multi-disciplinary
  organisations to reach clinicians working in paediatrics. RESULTS: We analysed 504
  RTT vignettes completed by 246 clinicians using mixed effect regression modelling.
  The main three significant influencing factors identified were: parental agreement
  with the decision to support initiation, the family's support network, and proximity
  to a tertiary care centre. Additional comments from participants focused on family
  support, and the importance of on-going communication with the family. CONCLUSION:
  As the rights of those with disabilities improve and participation of adolescents
  in decision-making becomes more established, effective communications with the family
  around goals of care and particular sensitivity and reflective practice around methods
  of consensus building will likely contribute to a positive decision-making process
  at this difficult time."
