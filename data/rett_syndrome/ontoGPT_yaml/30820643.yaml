input_text: 'Treating Rett syndrome: from mouse models to human therapies. Rare diseases
  are very difficult to study mechanistically and to develop therapies for because
  of the scarcity of patients. Here, the rare neuro-metabolic disorder Rett syndrome
  (RTT) is discussed as a prototype for precision medicine, demonstrating how mouse
  models have led to an understanding of the development of symptoms. RTT is caused
  by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Mecp2-mutant
  mice are being used in preclinical studies that target the MECP2 gene directly,
  or its downstream pathways. Importantly, this work may improve the health of RTT
  patients. Clinical presentation may vary widely among individuals based on their
  mutation, but also because of the degree of X chromosome inactivation and the presence
  of modifier genes. Because it is a complex disorder involving many organ systems,
  it is likely that recovery of RTT patients will involve a combination of treatments.
  Precision medicine is warranted to provide the best efficacy to individually treat
  RTT patients.'
