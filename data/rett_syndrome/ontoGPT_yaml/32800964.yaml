input_text: 'Vagus nerve stimulation paired with tones restores auditory processing
  in a rat model of Rett syndrome. BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is a rare neurological
  disorder associated with a mutation in the X-linked gene MECP2. This disorder mainly
  affects females, who typically have seemingly normal early development followed
  by a regression of acquired skills. The rodent Mecp2 model exhibits many of the
  classic neural abnormalities and behavioral deficits observed in individuals with
  Rett syndrome. Similar to individuals with Rett syndrome, both auditory discrimination
  ability and auditory cortical responses are impaired in heterozygous Mecp2 rats.
  The development of therapies that can enhance plasticity in auditory networks and
  improve auditory processing has the potential to impact the lives of individuals
  with Rett syndrome. Evidence suggests that precisely timed vagus nerve stimulation
  (VNS) paired with sound presentation can drive robust neuroplasticity in auditory
  networks and enhance the benefits of auditory therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
  study was to investigate the ability of VNS paired with tones to restore auditory
  processing in Mecp2 transgenic rats. METHODS: Seventeen female heterozygous Mecp2
  rats and 8 female wild-type (WT) littermates were used in this study. The rats were
  exposed to multiple tone frequencies paired with VNS 300 times per day for 20 days.
  Auditory cortex responses were then examined following VNS-tone pairing therapy
  or no therapy. RESULTS: Our results indicate that Mecp2 mutation alters auditory
  cortex responses to sounds compared to WT controls. VNS-tone pairing in Mecp2 rats
  improves the cortical response strength to both tones and speech sounds compared
  to untreated Mecp2 rats. Additionally, VNS-tone pairing increased the information
  contained in the neural response that can be used to discriminate between different
  consonant sounds. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that VNS-sound pairing may
  represent a strategy to enhance auditory function in individuals with Rett syndrome.'
