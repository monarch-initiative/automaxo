input_text: "Functioning, participation, and quality of life in children with intellectual
  disability: an observational study. AIMS: To investigate associations between functioning,
  community participation, and quality of life (QoL) and identify whether participation
  mediates the effects of functioning on QoL. METHOD: The caregivers of 435 children
  (211 females, 224 males; mean age 12y; SD 3y 11mo; age range 5-18y) with intellectual
  disability and autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, or Rett
  syndrome reported on their child's functioning (dependence for managing personal
  needs, mobility, communication, eye contact when speaking), frequency of participation,
  and QoL. Linear regression and mediation analyses were used to evaluate the relationships
  between child functioning, participation, and QoL. RESULTS: Children with greater
  dependency for managing personal needs and limited eye contact when speaking experienced
  poorer QoL. Less impaired functioning was associated with more frequent participation,
  which, in turn, was associated with a 3-point gain in QoL for each additional point
  in frequency of participation (coefficient=2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.56-3.78).
  The effect of impaired functioning on QoL was partially mediated by participation
  in children with greater dependency in managing personal needs and those with mildly
  impaired communication. INTERPRETATION: Greater levels of impairments with poorer
  functioning, notably a high level of dependence, were associated with poorer QoL.
  Poorer QoL can be partly explained by less frequent community participation."
