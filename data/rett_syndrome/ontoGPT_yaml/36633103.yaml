input_text: 'Molecular mechanisms in chloroquine-exposed muscle cells elucidated by
  combined proteomic and microscopic studies. OBJECTIVES: Chloroquine (CQ) is an antimalarial
  drug with a growing number of applications as recently demonstrated in attempts
  to treat Covid-19. For decades, it has been well known that skeletal and cardiac
  muscle cells might display vulnerability against CQ exposure resulting in the clinical
  manifestation of a CQ-induced myopathy. In line with the known effect of CQ on inhibition
  of the lysosomal function and thus cellular protein clearance, the build-up of autophagic
  vacuoles along with protein aggregates is a histological hallmark of the disease.
  Given that protein targets of the perturbed proteostasis are still not fully discovered,
  we applied different proteomic and immunological-based studies to improve the current
  understanding of the biochemical nature of CQ-myopathy. METHODS: To gain a comprehensive
  understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this acquired myopathy and to define
  proteins targets as well as pathophysiological processes beyond impaired proteolysis,
  utilising CQ-treated C2C12 cells and muscle biopsies derived from CQ-myopathy patients,
  we performed different proteomic approaches and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering
  (CARS) microscopy, in addition to immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Our combined
  studies confirmed an impact of CQ-exposure on proper protein processing/folding
  and clearance, highlighted changes in the interactome of p62, a known aggregation
  marker and hereby identified the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 as being affected.
  Moreover, our approach revealed-among others-a vulnerability of the extracellular
  matrix, cytoskeleton and lipid homeostasis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CQ
  exposure (secondarily) impacts biological processes beyond lysosomal function and
  linked a variety of proteins with known roles in the manifestation of other neuromuscular
  diseases.'
