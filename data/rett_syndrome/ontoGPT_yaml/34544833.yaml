input_text: CDKL5 Deficiency Augments Inhibitory Input into the Dentate Gyrus That
  Can Be Reversed by Deep Brain Stimulation. Cognitive impairment is a core feature
  of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency, a neurodevelopmental disorder
  characterized by early epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic
  behaviors. Although loss of CDKL5 affects a number of molecular pathways, very little
  has been discovered about the physiological effects of these changes on the neural
  circuitry. We therefore studied synaptic plasticity and local circuit activity in
  the dentate gyrus of both Cdkl5-/y and Cdkl5+/- mutant mice. We found that CDKL5
  haploinsufficiency in both male and female mice impairs hippocampus-dependent learning
  and memory in multiple tasks. In vivo, loss of CDKL5 reduced LTP of the perforant
  path to the dentate gyrus and augmented feedforward inhibition in this pathway;
  ex vivo experiments confirmed that excitatory/inhibitory input into the dentate
  gyrus is skewed toward inhibition. Injecting the GABAergic antagonist gabazine into
  the dentate improved contextual fear memory in Cdkl5-/y mice. Finally, chronic forniceal
  deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity,
  and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice. These results indicate that
  CDKL5 is important for maintaining proper dentate excitatory/inhibitory balance,
  with consequences for hippocampal memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cognitive impairment
  is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder.
  Although CDKL5 deficiency has been found to affect a number of molecular pathways,
  little is known about its physiological effects on the neural circuitry. We find
  that CDKL5 loss reduces hippocampal synaptic plasticity and augments feedforward
  inhibition in the perforant path to the dentate gyrus in vivo in Cdkl5 mutant mice.
  Chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored
  synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in Cdkl5+/- mice, as it
  had previously done with Rett syndrome mice, suggesting that such stimulation may
  be useful for other neurodevelopmental disorders.
