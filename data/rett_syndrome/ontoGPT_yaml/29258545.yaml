input_text: 'Dendrimer-mediated delivery of N-acetyl cysteine to microglia in a mouse
  model of Rett syndrome. BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive developmental
  disorder that is progressive and has no effective cure. Immune dysregulation, oxidative
  stress, and excess glutamate in the brain mediated by glial dysfunction have been
  implicated in the pathogenesis and worsening of symptoms of RTT. In this study,
  we investigated a new nanotherapeutic approach to target glia for attenuation of
  brain inflammation/injury both in vitro and in vivo using a Mecp2-null mouse model
  of Rett syndrome. METHODS: To determine whether inflammation and immune dysregulation
  were potential targets for dendrimer-based therapeutics in RTT, we assessed the
  immune response of primary glial cells from Mecp2-null and wild-type (WT) mice to
  LPS. Using dendrimers that intrinsically target activated microglia and astrocytes,
  we studied N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and dendrimer-conjugated N-acetyl cysteine (D-NAC)
  effects on inflammatory cytokines by PCR and multiplex assay in WT vs Mecp2-null
  glia. Since the cysteine-glutamate antiporter (Xc-) is upregulated in Mecp2-null
  glia when compared to WT, the role of Xc- in the uptake of NAC and L-cysteine into
  the cell was compared to that of D-NAC using BV2 cells in vitro. We then assessed
  the ability of D-NAC given systemically twice weekly to Mecp2-null mice to improve
  behavioral phenotype and lifespan. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the mixed glia
  derived from Mecp2-null mice have an exaggerated inflammatory and oxidative stress
  response to LPS stimulation when compared to WT glia. Expression of Xc- was significantly
  upregulated in the Mecp2-null glia when compared to WT and was further increased
  in the presence of LPS stimulation. Unlike NAC, D-NAC bypasses the Xc- for cell
  uptake, increasing intracellular GSH levels while preventing extracellular glutamate
  release and excitotoxicity. Systemically administered dendrimers were localized
  in microglia in Mecp2-null mice, but not in age-matched WT littermates. Treatment
  with D-NAC significantly improved behavioral outcomes in Mecp2-null mice, but not
  survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delivery of drugs using dendrimer
  nanodevices offers a potential strategy for targeting glia and modulating oxidative
  stress and immune responses in RTT.'
