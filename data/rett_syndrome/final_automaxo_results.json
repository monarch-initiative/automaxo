                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Girls and women with Rett Syndrome (RTT) have low levels of daily physical activity and high levels of sedentary time. Reducing sedentary time and enhancing \"uptime\" activities, such as standing and walking, could be an important focus for interventions to address long-term health and quality of life in RTT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and health-related effects of an individualized 12-week uptime participation (U-PART) intervention in girls and women with RTT. DESIGN: The study used a single-group pretest-posttest design with 4 assessments (2 baseline, postintervention, and follow-up). METHODS: A participation-based intervention employing a whole-day approach was used. During a 12-week intervention period, individualized programs focused on participation in enjoyable uptime activities in home, school/day center, and community settings. Feasibility was assessed with a study-specific questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were sedentary time and daily step count. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skills, walking capacity, quality of life, and goal attainment scaling. RESULTS: Fourteen girls and women who were 5 to 48 years old and had RTT participated. The U-PART intervention was perceived as feasible by caregivers. Similar scores were observed at baseline assessments in all outcomes. Positive effects with small to medium effect sizes (0.27-0.54) were seen in sedentary time (- 4%), daily step count (+ 689 steps/d), walking capacity (+ 18.8 m), quality of life (+ 2.75 points), and goal attainment scaling after the intervention. Positive effects were maintained in sedentary time (- 3.2%) and walking capacity (+ 12.1 m) at short-term follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of a control group. However, participants acted as their own control, and the stable baseline period partially mitigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: The U-PART intervention was found to be feasible and effective in the short term in girls and women with RTT.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: To synthesize existing evidence on the effectiveness of speech-language teleinterventions delivered via videoconferencing to users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021. Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability. INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method of providing AAC intervention services.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

It was hypothesized that patients that were undergoing ATR training would have better improvement in nearly all the motor and cognitive scale scoring activities that were administered, thus showing reduced disability. A total of 20 young girls and women with a diagnosis of RTT, ranging from age 4 to 31 years old (Median: 12.50; IQR: 9.50-17.25) underwent a pre-test, treatment post-test 1, treatment, and post-test 2 procedure. The treatment consisted of either ATR or BTR, lasting 10 weeks with three sessions a week of about an hour. The results showed that the group with advanced telerehabilitation improved their performance better than the control group only in some neuropsychological measurements.

The severity of many individuals' impairment limits the effectiveness of traditional assessment. However, clinician and parent reports of adaptive functioning may provide insight into these patients' abilities. This review aims to synthesize the current literature assessing adaptive functioning in Rett syndrome and evaluate existing measurement tools in this population. A search was conducted on PubMed using the search term \"Rett syndrome.\" Studies that quantitatively assessed adaptive functioning outcomes in Rett syndrome with published and normed questionnaire measures were included. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Overall results indicate that the population of people with Rett syndrome is highly impaired, both in overall adaptive functioning as well as in specific subdomains (e.g., mobility, activities of daily living). Atypical Rett syndrome groups performed better on measures of adaptive functioning relative to patients with classic Rett syndrome. Our findings identified measurement weaknesses, as many of the studies found floor effects and therefore were unable to capture meaningful variability in outcomes. Individuals with Rett syndrome are highly reliant on caregivers due to disrupted adaptive functioning abilities. Optimizing measurement of adaptive skills in Rett syndrome will facilitate the quantification of meaningful change in skills and the identification of efficacious interventions aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

It was hypothesized that patients that were undergoing ATR training would have better improvement in nearly all the motor and cognitive scale scoring activities that were administered, thus showing reduced disability. A total of 20 young girls and women with a diagnosis of RTT, ranging from age 4 to 31 years old (Median: 12.50; IQR: 9.50-17.25) underwent a pre-test, treatment post-test 1, treatment, and post-test 2 procedure. The treatment consisted of either ATR or BTR, lasting 10 weeks with three sessions a week of about an hour. The results showed that the group with advanced telerehabilitation improved their performance better than the control group only in some neuropsychological measurements.

The study also evaluated the potential effect of evening dosing on trofinetide bioavailability and characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of trofinetide in urine. METHODS: A 60 mL oral solution of trofinetide (12 g) was administered in three dosing periods: morning fasted (A; reference), morning fed (B), and evening fasted (C). Healthy adult subjects (18-45 years) were randomized to sequence ABC (n = 19) or BAC (n = 22). Blood and urine samples were collected at scheduled timepoints for trofinetide pharmacokinetic analysis. Bioequivalence was confirmed if 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratio between B/A or C/A fell within 80-125% equivalence limits for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) in whole blood. RESULTS: Bioequivalence criteria were met for all conditions (i.e., morning fed vs. morning fasted and evening fasted vs. morning fasted) except Cmax in the fed versus fasted condition, which was just below the bioequivalence limit (75.49%), suggesting a negligible food effect and lack of diurnal variation on bioavailability. Trofinetide was primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Trofinetide was well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: This study supports dosing of trofinetide without regard to food.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: To synthesize existing evidence on the effectiveness of speech-language teleinterventions delivered via videoconferencing to users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021. Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability. INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method of providing AAC intervention services.",

Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 1-9. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2. The disease is characterized by early neurological regression following a normal initial development. The diagnosis is a clinical one, based on major and minor diagnostic criteria. This study, in a group of patients from a single tertiary center, aimed to evaluate the efficiency of clinical diagnosis and to see if there was a diagnostic delay. A second aim was to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations, based on Pineda scores. In this study, sixteen patients with a median age of 6.5 years (2.5-22 years) were included, following molecular confirmation of clinical diagnosis. The median age at the onset of symptoms and the median age at clinical diagnosis was 1.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively, the difference being statistically significant. Considering the Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria, initially regulated in 2002 and revised in 2010, seven and two patients in our group, respectively, did not meet the main criteria. Pineda scores among mutation groups were statistically not different. To conclude, the present study revealed presence of a diagnostic delay. The challenge may be that the patients do not exhibit full-blown clinical picture initially. No genotype-phenotype correlations were detected in clinical severity, as measured by Pineda scores. Moreover, the diagnostic criteria revised in 2010 are more comprehensive as compared to the 2002 criteria; however, further revision may increase diagnostic sensitivity.",

                    "abstract": "The reversal of the Rett syndrome disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

AIMS: the aim was to examine the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in three girls with RTT with chronic language impairments. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: we proposed an integrated intervention: tDCS and cognitive empowerment applied to language in order to enhance speech production (new functional sounds and new words). Because maximal gains usually are achieved when tDCS is coupled with behavioral training, we applied tDCS stimulation on Broca's area together with linguistic training. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: the results indicated a general enhancement in language abilities (an increase in the number of vowel/consonant sounds and words and the production and comprehension through discrimination), motor coordination (functional movements), and neurophysiological parameters (an increase in the frequency and power of alpha, beta and theta bands). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: we assume that tDCS stimulation combined with the cognitive empowerment applied to language can significantly influence a chronic impairment even in genetic syndromes. Our results provide data that support the role of tDCS in fostering brain plasticity and in particular in empowering speech production and comprehension in girls with RTT.",

Children with these conditions face an unknown lifespan as well as unstable and uncomfortable symptoms. Clinicians and other healthcare professionals are challenged by a lack of evidence for symptom management for these conditions. AIMS: In this scoping review, we systematically identified and mapped the existing literature on symptom management for children with Q3 conditions. We focused on the most common and distressing symptoms, namely alertness, behavioural problems, bowel incontinence, breathing difficulties, constipation, feeding difficulties, sleep disturbance, temperature regulation, tone and motor problems and urinary incontinence. For children with complex health conditions, good symptom management is pertinent to ensure the highest possible quality of life. METHODS: Scoping review. Electronic database searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL and a comprehensive grey literature search. RESULTS: We included 292 studies in our final synthesis. The most commonly reported conditions in the studies were Rett syndrome (n=69), followed by Cornelia de Lange syndrome (n=25) and tuberous sclerosis (n=16). Tone and motor problems were the most commonly investigated symptom (n=141), followed by behavioural problems (n=82) and sleep disturbance (n=62). CONCLUSION: The evidence for symptom management in Q3 conditions is concentrated around a few conditions, and these studies may not be applicable to other conditions. The evidence is dispersed in the literature and difficult to access, which further challenges healthcare providers. More research needs to be done in these conditions to provide high-quality evidence for the care of these children.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

METHODS: Among all ventilated patients at our Center from January 2012 to December 2022, we retrospectively included children with a cAHI >= 1 events/h on baseline poly(somno)graphic study. Additional parameters assessed included the underlying disease, type of ventilation (non-invasive vs. invasive), age at ventilation onset, ventilation mode, and transcutaneous capnometry parameters. To assess the effectiveness of ventilation on central apneas, we compared the cAHI at baseline and on ventilation. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for central apnea (cAHI > 1 events/h). Diagnoses included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 15 (22.4%); Ondine syndrome, 14 (20.9%); polymalformative syndrome, 10 (14.9%); Prader-Willi syndrome, 8 (11.9%); brain tumor, 6 (9.0%); Down syndrome, 4 (6.0%); ROHHAD syndrome, 2 (3.0%); other infrequent pathologies were, Arnold-Chiari II, primary central apnea, epilepsy, lisosomal diseases, hydrocephalus, myopathy, obesity, Rett Syndrome. Pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) was the most common mode used (45 out 67 patients, 67.2%), followed by pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (15 out 67 patients, 22.4%) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (7 out 67 patients, 10.4%). Statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in cAHI was observed in patients with polymalformative syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3.1 vs. 0.1, p = < 0.01), and Prader-Willi syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.03), while there was no significant improvementn in children with brain tumor (6.2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Central apneas are present in children with various underlying pathologies. Ventilatory strategies tailored to the specific diagnosis and severity of central apneas yield significant improvements in cAHI. PSV was the preferred ventilation mode in this study and there was notable effectiveness across different diagnostic categories. PCV was employed in most severe cases. CPAP was exclusively used in patients with predominantly obstructive sleep apneas.",

The increasing prevalence of GWs in children has renewed the interest in therapeutic management which still presents a unique challenge, being influenced by many variables including size, quantity, and location of warts, as well as the presence of comorbidities. Conventional photodynamic therapy (C-PDT) has already shown encouraging results in the treatment of viral warts in adult patients, but its use is still not standardized in the pediatric population. On this topic, we report our experience with C-PDT in a difficult-to-treat area like the perianal region in a 12-year-old girl affected by Rett syndrome, an X-linked dominant neurological disorder, with a 10-month history of florid genital condylomatosis. After the third session of C-PDT, complete clearance of the lesions was achieved. Our case is paradigmatic of the potentiality of PDT to treat difficult lesions in difficult patients. Despite being expensive and time-consuming, this procedure has been demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated. Lastly, the therapy is also well accepted by parents, due to its minimal invasiveness and the few side effects, compared to the other therapeutic options.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome, but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

Most time was spent in sleeping, daily care, medical health care and travel/transportation. Little time remained for receptive activities, daytime rest, physical, social/creative, communication, school/daily work and domestic chore activities, especially for the young adults. Most time was spent with staff, thereafter with families and the least time was spent with friends. The most reported response was \"interested\", and \"opposed\" was the least reported.Conclusions: Daily and medical health care activities were time consuming.

Children with these conditions face an unknown lifespan as well as unstable and uncomfortable symptoms. Clinicians and other healthcare professionals are challenged by a lack of evidence for symptom management for these conditions. AIMS: In this scoping review, we systematically identified and mapped the existing literature on symptom management for children with Q3 conditions. We focused on the most common and distressing symptoms, namely alertness, behavioural problems, bowel incontinence, breathing difficulties, constipation, feeding difficulties, sleep disturbance, temperature regulation, tone and motor problems and urinary incontinence. For children with complex health conditions, good symptom management is pertinent to ensure the highest possible quality of life. METHODS: Scoping review. Electronic database searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL and a comprehensive grey literature search. RESULTS: We included 292 studies in our final synthesis. The most commonly reported conditions in the studies were Rett syndrome (n=69), followed by Cornelia de Lange syndrome (n=25) and tuberous sclerosis (n=16). Tone and motor problems were the most commonly investigated symptom (n=141), followed by behavioural problems (n=82) and sleep disturbance (n=62). CONCLUSION: The evidence for symptom management in Q3 conditions is concentrated around a few conditions, and these studies may not be applicable to other conditions. The evidence is dispersed in the literature and difficult to access, which further challenges healthcare providers. More research needs to be done in these conditions to provide high-quality evidence for the care of these children.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological syndrome that affects mostly females. The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome. This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: In this study, the effect of a remotely supervised, home-based, family-centered individualized rehabilitation program of motor activities for individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.Implications for rehabilitationA remote supervised motor activity program carried out by the primary caregiver supports motor functioning in RTT.Therapists should consider family members' motivation to carry out the activities and integrate them into the family's daily routine.The program should be flexible to adapt to any sudden change in medical and environmental conditions, functional ability, and family members' motivational levels.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is reportedly effective for improving spasticity and motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Because late-stage Rett syndrome has a similar presentation, this study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on these two diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with spastic CP and Rett syndrome received 1500 impulses of ESWT at 4 Hz and 0.1 mJ/mm2, on their spastic legsonce weekly for a total of 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed before and 4 and 12 weeks after ESWT. Clinical assessments included the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), and Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (GMFM-88). Ultrasonographic assessments included muscle thickness, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and strain elastography. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with CP and six with Rett syndrome were enrolled in this study. After ESWT, patients with CP showed significant clinical improvement in the MAS (P = 0.011), ankle PROM (P = 0.002), walking/running/jumping function (P = 0.003), and total function (P < 0.001) of the GMFM-88. The patients with Rett syndrome showed improved MAS scores (P = 0.061) and significantly improved total gross motor function (P = 0.030). Under ARFI, patients with CP demonstrated decreased shear wave speed in the gastrocnemius medial head (P = 0.038). Conversely, patients with Rett syndrome show increased shear-wave speeds after ESWT. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that a weekly course of low-dose ESWT for 12 weeks is beneficial for children with both CP and Rett syndrome, with the clinical effects of reducing spasticity and improving the gross motor function of the lower limbs. The ARFI sonoelastography reveals improvement of muscle stiffness in patients with CP after ESWT, but deteriorated in patients with Rett syndrome. The diverse therapeutic response to ESWT may be caused by the MECP2 mutation in Rett syndrome, having a continuous impact and driving the pathophysiology differently as compared to CP, which is secondary to a static insult.

METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021. Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability. INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method of providing AAC intervention services.",

STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome, but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance, and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We highlight novel and emerging therapies in the treatment of childhood-onset movement disorders. We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

Though some NDDs are caused by acquired insults (i.e., toxic or infectious encephalopathy) or may be cryptogenic, many NDDs are caused by variants in a single gene or groups of genes that disrupt neuronal development or function. In this review, we will focus on those NDDs with a genetic etiology. The exact mechanism, timing, and progression of the molecular pathology are seldom well known; however, the abnormalities in development typically manifest in similar patterns such as delays or regression in motor function, social skills, and language or cognitive abilities. Severity of impairment can vary widely. At present, only symptomatic treatments are available to manage seizures and behavioral problems commonly seen in NDDs. In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of research into gene therapy using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Using AAVs as vectors to replace the non- or dysfunctional gene in vivo is a relatively simple model which has created an unprecedented opportunity for the future of NDD treatment. Advances in this field are of paramount importance as NDDs lead to a massive lifelong burden of disease on the affected individuals and families. In this article, we review the unique advantages and challenges of AAV gene therapies. We then look at potential applications of gene therapy for 3 of the more common NDDs (Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome), as well as 2 less common NDDs (SLC13A5 deficiency disorder and SLC6A1-related disorder). We will review the available natural history of each disease and current state of preclinical studies including a discussion on the application of AAV gene therapies for each disease.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of RTT patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT.High-density electroencephalography was successfully recorded in 18 females with RTT and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven RTT and three TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900, and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the RTT group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while RTT patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Rett syndrome. This study investigated respiratory morbidity and relationships with age, mutation type, feeding, and walking status. METHOD: Families registered with the InterRett database (n=399) provided data on the health of their child with Rett syndrome (age 2-57y). Hospital admissions because of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over a 5-year exposure period were investigated by age, mutation type, enteral feeding, and walking status. RESULTS: A hospital admission for LRTI over the previous 5 years was reported for slightly more than one-fifth (21.4%) of individuals. Age and mutation groups did not seem to influence hospital admissions for LRTI but there was nearly twice the risk of an admission with enteral feeding (adjusted relative risk 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.65). Compared with independent walking, being unable to walk was associated with a sixfold increased risk (adjusted relative risk 6.73, 95% CI 3.42-13.25), with assisted walking associated with an intermediate risk. INTERPRETATION: Beyond the influence of mutation type, walking seems to have protective effects on respiratory health. Further studies of exercise physiology in Rett syndrome and how this can be influenced by increasing activity levels are indicated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Rett syndrome is associated with increased vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Enteral feeding is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for LRTI. Assisted walking mitigates the risk of hospital admission for LRTI for those unable to walk independently.",

The severity of many individuals' impairment limits the effectiveness of traditional assessment. However, clinician and parent reports of adaptive functioning may provide insight into these patients' abilities. This review aims to synthesize the current literature assessing adaptive functioning in Rett syndrome and evaluate existing measurement tools in this population. A search was conducted on PubMed using the search term \"Rett syndrome.\" Studies that quantitatively assessed adaptive functioning outcomes in Rett syndrome with published and normed questionnaire measures were included. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Overall results indicate that the population of people with Rett syndrome is highly impaired, both in overall adaptive functioning as well as in specific subdomains (e.g., mobility, activities of daily living). Atypical Rett syndrome groups performed better on measures of adaptive functioning relative to patients with classic Rett syndrome. Our findings identified measurement weaknesses, as many of the studies found floor effects and therefore were unable to capture meaningful variability in outcomes. Individuals with Rett syndrome are highly reliant on caregivers due to disrupted adaptive functioning abilities. Optimizing measurement of adaptive skills in Rett syndrome will facilitate the quantification of meaningful change in skills and the identification of efficacious interventions aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life.",

Most time was spent in sleeping, daily care, medical health care and travel/transportation. Little time remained for receptive activities, daytime rest, physical, social/creative, communication, school/daily work and domestic chore activities, especially for the young adults. Most time was spent with staff, thereafter with families and the least time was spent with friends. The most reported response was \"interested\", and \"opposed\" was the least reported.Conclusions: Daily and medical health care activities were time consuming.

Reducing sedentary time and enhancing \"uptime\" activities, such as standing and walking, could be an important focus for interventions to address long-term health and quality of life in RTT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and health-related effects of an individualized 12-week uptime participation (U-PART) intervention in girls and women with RTT. DESIGN: The study used a single-group pretest-posttest design with 4 assessments (2 baseline, postintervention, and follow-up). METHODS: A participation-based intervention employing a whole-day approach was used. During a 12-week intervention period, individualized programs focused on participation in enjoyable uptime activities in home, school/day center, and community settings. Feasibility was assessed with a study-specific questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were sedentary time and daily step count. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skills, walking capacity, quality of life, and goal attainment scaling. RESULTS: Fourteen girls and women who were 5 to 48 years old and had RTT participated. The U-PART intervention was perceived as feasible by caregivers. Similar scores were observed at baseline assessments in all outcomes. Positive effects with small to medium effect sizes (0.27-0.54) were seen in sedentary time (- 4%), daily step count (+ 689 steps/d), walking capacity (+ 18.8 m), quality of life (+ 2.75 points), and goal attainment scaling after the intervention. Positive effects were maintained in sedentary time (- 3.2%) and walking capacity (+ 12.1 m) at short-term follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the lack of a control group. However, participants acted as their own control, and the stable baseline period partially mitigated this issue. CONCLUSIONS: The U-PART intervention was found to be feasible and effective in the short term in girls and women with RTT.",

Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a microswitch intervention on increased choice making, engagement in a targeted sorting activity, and indices of happiness, and decreased stereotypic behaviors for six girls with Rett syndrome. Targeted dependent variables were also assessed at six months post-intervention. Following the intervention study, 90 external raters completed a social validation procedure. Method: An ABABAB experimental sequence was implemented for each participant with a cross-over effect. A social validation assessment involving 90 external raters was carried out. Results: Data emphasized an improved performance for each participants involved (i.e., adaptive responses). Five participants showed a capacity of independent choice. One participant seemed to be closely linked to the position of the container. Social raters favorably endorsed the use of the program since they positively evaluated the use of the technology on all the dimensions investigated. Conclusion: A microswitch intervention may improve choice making and activity engagement for children with Rett syndrome. Further research is needed on the development of more sophisticated forms of individualized technological options to improve opportunities for enhanced engagement and choice-making for individuals with RTT.",

AIMS: the aim was to examine the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in three girls with RTT with chronic language impairments. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: we proposed an integrated intervention: tDCS and cognitive empowerment applied to language in order to enhance speech production (new functional sounds and new words). Because maximal gains usually are achieved when tDCS is coupled with behavioral training, we applied tDCS stimulation on Broca's area together with linguistic training. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: the results indicated a general enhancement in language abilities (an increase in the number of vowel/consonant sounds and words and the production and comprehension through discrimination), motor coordination (functional movements), and neurophysiological parameters (an increase in the frequency and power of alpha, beta and theta bands). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: we assume that tDCS stimulation combined with the cognitive empowerment applied to language can significantly influence a chronic impairment even in genetic syndromes. Our results provide data that support the role of tDCS in fostering brain plasticity and in particular in empowering speech production and comprehension in girls with RTT.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome, but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: The current study aimed to infer neurophysiological mechanisms of auditory processing in children with Rett syndrome (RTT)-rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by MECP2 mutations. We examined two brain responses elicited by 40-Hz click trains: auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which reflects fine temporal analysis of auditory input, and sustained wave (SW), which is associated with integral processing of the auditory signal. METHODS: We recorded electroencephalogram findings in 43 patients with RTT (aged 2.92-17.1 years) and 43 typically developing children of the same age during 40-Hz click train auditory stimulation, which lasted for 500 ms and was presented with interstimulus intervals of 500 to 800 ms. Mixed-model ancova with age as a covariate was used to compare amplitude of ASSR and SW between groups, taking into account the temporal dynamics and topography of the responses. RESULTS: Amplitude of SW was atypically small in children with RTT starting from early childhood, with the difference from typically developing children decreasing with age. ASSR showed a different pattern of developmental changes: the between-group difference was negligible in early childhood but increased with age as ASSR increased in the typically developing group, but not in those with RTT. Moreover, ASSR was associated with expressive speech development in patients, so that children who could use words had more pronounced ASSR. CONCLUSION: ASSR and SW show promise as noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers of auditory processing that have clinical relevance and can shed light onto the link between genetic impairment and the RTT phenotype.",

The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

Given the indications from case reports, this pilot study investigated the effectiveness of music therapy on RTT patients, as well as on parental stress for families of children with RTT. METHODS: Families in the study group were enrolled in a twice-weekly 120-minute music therapy program for 24 weeks (n = 11), whereas families in the control group did not receive music therapy (n = 12). Participants were administered the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Rett Syndrome Clinical Severity Scale, Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment, and Parenting Stress Index for caregivers of RTT children before and after the music therapy program. RESULTS: Music therapy improved receptive language, verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and social interaction for RTT patients. In addition, purposeful hand function, breathing patterns, and eye contact were significantly improved. Of note, music therapy also decreased the frequency of epileptic seizures.

While genetic and medical aspects have been studied for several decades, rehabilitation intervention research is still in its infancy. In this study, the investigating researchers have presented a rehabilitative framework by using music therapy for girls with RTT. This model is founded upon the use of music therapy in light of Stern's proposal of subjective experience and affect attunement; it also refers to Rosenbaum's family-centered rehabilitation medicine perspective. This study both describes the theory behind this intervention and presents a newly developed outcome measure. This novel tool may have future clinical and research applications. Music therapy for patients with RTT has not been well researched yet, and, as a result, is not universally recommended. However this study's findings suggest that music therapy is an important component of multidisciplinary therapy. Further collaborative research should be encouraged in order to study and implement the use of music therapy in the treatment of severe disabilities. Projects such as the Enablin+ program with the support from the European Commission constitute fundamental tools in promoting integrative medical research and international networks.",

The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

Respiratory morbidity represents a major cause of death in this population. Little is known about the benefit of noninvasive ventilation. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled patients with Rett syndrome who underwent a pneumological evaluation combined with a cardiorespiratory polygraphy and/or a pulse oximetry and capnography from 2012 to 2022. RESULTS: Medical records of 11 patients with Rett syndrome, mean age 13 +- 6 years, were evaluated. Most patients presented with both epilepsy and scoliosis. Five patients showed a pathologic sleep study and/or impaired night gas exchange: mean obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was 4 +- 3 events/hour; mean and minimal SpO2 were, respectively, 93% +- 2% and 83% +- 6%, while mean and maximal transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring (PtcCO2) were, respectively, 51 +- 5 mm Hg and 55 +- 8 mm Hg; and mean oxygen desaturation index was 13 +- 11 events/hour. These patients started noninvasive ventilation with clinical benefit and improved gas exchange mostly in terms of PtcCO2 (mean PtcCO2 51 +- 5 mm Hg before and 46 +- 6 mm Hg after noninvasive ventilation).

STUDY DESIGN: We included 323 females from the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and analyzed their demographic, genetic, and child and parental health data collected from over 6 waves of follow-up questionnaire between 2000 and 2011. We used mixed-effects models to estimate the association between repeated measures of outcomes and age, gastrostomy placement and their interaction and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risks of mortality for individuals with gastrostomy. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (30.3%) of the cases underwent gastrostomy placement. Nutritional status based on weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) improved over time, and BMI was greater in individuals with gastrostomy placement than in those without (adjusted beta = 0.87, 95% CI 0.02-1.73). There was no association between gastrostomy placement and individual's physical health outcomes or parental physical and mental health, nor did the age trend of these outcomes vary by gastrostomy insertion status. Nevertheless, among those at risk of suboptimal weight, the all-cause mortality rate was greater in those who had gastrostomy placement compared with those who had not (hazard ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.96-8.45). CONCLUSION: Gastrostomy placement was associated with improvement in BMI in females with Rett syndrome, but its long-term impact on individuals and their families is unclear.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

The typical group demonstrated the expected pattern of more negative amplitudes within 200-500 ms in response to words than nonwords at left temporal sites. In participants with Rett syndrome, word-nonword differentiation was observed at the right temporal sites. More negative left hemisphere amplitudes in response to words were associated (at trend level) with better receptive language skills and more adaptive behavior. The results indicate that girls with Rett syndrome differentiate known words from novel nonwords, but may do so using potentially atypical neural processes. Brain-behavior correlations support validity of the proposed neural markers of word processing, making passive listening paradigms a promising approach for assessing speech and language processing in participants with limited spoken language skills.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide, a synthetic analog of tripeptide glycine-proline-glutamate, is an investigational agent for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with affected individuals requiring lifelong support. Food can affect the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug, and this phase 1 study assessed the potential effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide. The study also evaluated the potential effect of evening dosing on trofinetide bioavailability and characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of trofinetide in urine. METHODS: A 60 mL oral solution of trofinetide (12 g) was administered in three dosing periods: morning fasted (A; reference), morning fed (B), and evening fasted (C). Healthy adult subjects (18-45 years) were randomized to sequence ABC (n = 19) or BAC (n = 22). Blood and urine samples were collected at scheduled timepoints for trofinetide pharmacokinetic analysis. Bioequivalence was confirmed if 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratio between B/A or C/A fell within 80-125% equivalence limits for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) in whole blood. RESULTS: Bioequivalence criteria were met for all conditions (i.e., morning fed vs. morning fasted and evening fasted vs. morning fasted) except Cmax in the fed versus fasted condition, which was just below the bioequivalence limit (75.49%), suggesting a negligible food effect and lack of diurnal variation on bioavailability. Trofinetide was primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Trofinetide was well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: This study supports dosing of trofinetide without regard to food.",

                    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate U.S. treatment trends and inpatient outcomes for children undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for Rett syndrome (RTT)-associated scoliosis (RAS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: RTT is a rare, sporadic neurodevelopmental disorder presenting in childhood with developmental regression, ataxia, and seizures. RAS occurs in 50-80% of cases of RTT, but little is known about the case volume and perioperative experience for children undergoing PSF. METHODS: Using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes in the national Kids' Inpatient Database, we identified children with RTT who underwent PSF in 2000-2019. Annual case volumes were analyzed. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with those of a cohort of patients with neuromuscular scoliosis (NMS). RESULTS: Among 220 patients with RAS, 216 (98.2%) were female (mean age at surgery 12.3+-3.3 y). Surgical case incidence steadily increased over 19 years, with more RAS admissions in the South (31.4%). Overall, patients with RAS demonstrated a higher mean Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score (2 vs. 1, P<0.001) and had more perioperative complications (41.4% vs. 18%, P<0.001) than patients with NMS. RTT diagnosis independently predicted higher odds of any complications (OR 1.98, P<0.001) and increased length of stay (OR 1.18, P=0.009) for admissions for PSF. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for RAS is rare but increased over a 19-year period. Cases appear to be clustering by region, with the highest proportion in the South. The higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index in RAS patients predicted higher cost, longer hospital stay, more complications (particularly respiratory), and more nonroutine discharge disposition than in other NMS patients. RTT was independently associated with higher odds of complications and longer length of stay. Because RAS cases appear to be increasing in number, future study should emphasize methods to reduce morbidity and investigate deformity-specific metrics to help better understand this population.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

METHODS: Among all ventilated patients at our Center from January 2012 to December 2022, we retrospectively included children with a cAHI >= 1 events/h on baseline poly(somno)graphic study. Additional parameters assessed included the underlying disease, type of ventilation (non-invasive vs. invasive), age at ventilation onset, ventilation mode, and transcutaneous capnometry parameters. To assess the effectiveness of ventilation on central apneas, we compared the cAHI at baseline and on ventilation. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria for central apnea (cAHI > 1 events/h). Diagnoses included hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 15 (22.4%); Ondine syndrome, 14 (20.9%); polymalformative syndrome, 10 (14.9%); Prader-Willi syndrome, 8 (11.9%); brain tumor, 6 (9.0%); Down syndrome, 4 (6.0%); ROHHAD syndrome, 2 (3.0%); other infrequent pathologies were, Arnold-Chiari II, primary central apnea, epilepsy, lisosomal diseases, hydrocephalus, myopathy, obesity, Rett Syndrome. Pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) was the most common mode used (45 out 67 patients, 67.2%), followed by pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) (15 out 67 patients, 22.4%) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (7 out 67 patients, 10.4%). Statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in cAHI was observed in patients with polymalformative syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.3, p = 0.01), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3.1 vs. 0.1, p = < 0.01), and Prader-Willi syndrome (3.5 vs. 0.1, p = 0.03), while there was no significant improvementn in children with brain tumor (6.2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Central apneas are present in children with various underlying pathologies. Ventilatory strategies tailored to the specific diagnosis and severity of central apneas yield significant improvements in cAHI. PSV was the preferred ventilation mode in this study and there was notable effectiveness across different diagnostic categories. PCV was employed in most severe cases.

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

The severity of many individuals' impairment limits the effectiveness of traditional assessment. However, clinician and parent reports of adaptive functioning may provide insight into these patients' abilities. This review aims to synthesize the current literature assessing adaptive functioning in Rett syndrome and evaluate existing measurement tools in this population. A search was conducted on PubMed using the search term \"Rett syndrome.\" Studies that quantitatively assessed adaptive functioning outcomes in Rett syndrome with published and normed questionnaire measures were included. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Overall results indicate that the population of people with Rett syndrome is highly impaired, both in overall adaptive functioning as well as in specific subdomains (e.g., mobility, activities of daily living). Atypical Rett syndrome groups performed better on measures of adaptive functioning relative to patients with classic Rett syndrome. Our findings identified measurement weaknesses, as many of the studies found floor effects and therefore were unable to capture meaningful variability in outcomes. Individuals with Rett syndrome are highly reliant on caregivers due to disrupted adaptive functioning abilities. Optimizing measurement of adaptive skills in Rett syndrome will facilitate the quantification of meaningful change in skills and the identification of efficacious interventions aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations of the MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2) gene. Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance, and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: The current study aimed to infer neurophysiological mechanisms of auditory processing in children with Rett syndrome (RTT)-rare neurodevelopmental disorders caused by MECP2 mutations. We examined two brain responses elicited by 40-Hz click trains: auditory steady-state response (ASSR), which reflects fine temporal analysis of auditory input, and sustained wave (SW), which is associated with integral processing of the auditory signal. METHODS: We recorded electroencephalogram findings in 43 patients with RTT (aged 2.92-17.1 years) and 43 typically developing children of the same age during 40-Hz click train auditory stimulation, which lasted for 500 ms and was presented with interstimulus intervals of 500 to 800 ms. Mixed-model ancova with age as a covariate was used to compare amplitude of ASSR and SW between groups, taking into account the temporal dynamics and topography of the responses. RESULTS: Amplitude of SW was atypically small in children with RTT starting from early childhood, with the difference from typically developing children decreasing with age. ASSR showed a different pattern of developmental changes: the between-group difference was negligible in early childhood but increased with age as ASSR increased in the typically developing group, but not in those with RTT. Moreover, ASSR was associated with expressive speech development in patients, so that children who could use words had more pronounced ASSR. CONCLUSION: ASSR and SW show promise as noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers of auditory processing that have clinical relevance and can shed light onto the link between genetic impairment and the RTT phenotype.",

The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

While genetic and medical aspects have been studied for several decades, rehabilitation intervention research is still in its infancy. In this study, the investigating researchers have presented a rehabilitative framework by using music therapy for girls with RTT. This model is founded upon the use of music therapy in light of Stern's proposal of subjective experience and affect attunement; it also refers to Rosenbaum's family-centered rehabilitation medicine perspective. This study both describes the theory behind this intervention and presents a newly developed outcome measure. This novel tool may have future clinical and research applications. Music therapy for patients with RTT has not been well researched yet, and, as a result, is not universally recommended. However this study's findings suggest that music therapy is an important component of multidisciplinary therapy. Further collaborative research should be encouraged in order to study and implement the use of music therapy in the treatment of severe disabilities. Projects such as the Enablin+ program with the support from the European Commission constitute fundamental tools in promoting integrative medical research and international networks.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly support the implementation of such programs for this population. As these programs were remotely supervised, they can be implemented when the children are away from referenced facilities for long durations, such as during long holidays or a Covid-19 type lockdown.Implications for rehabilitationA remote supervised motor activity program carried out by the primary caregiver supports motor functioning in RTT.Therapists should consider family members' motivation to carry out the activities and integrate them into the family's daily routine.The program should be flexible to adapt to any sudden change in medical and environmental conditions, functional ability, and family members' motivational levels.",

Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of RTT patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT.High-density electroencephalography was successfully recorded in 18 females with RTT and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven RTT and three TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900, and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the RTT group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while RTT patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.",

The purpose of the study is to fully characterize the metabolic and excretion profiles of trofinetide in humans. METHODS: This Phase 1, open-label, single-dose trial conducted in healthy male adults was designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide (absorption, metabolism, and excretion), mass balance of [14C]-trofinetide, and safety profile of trofinetide following administration of an oral 12-g dose administered as a mixture of trofinetide and [14C]-trofinetide. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at prespecified timepoints. The pharmacokinetics of trofinetide were assessed in blood and urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Bioanalysis of radioactivity was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using liquid scintillation counting. Metabolite profiling was conducted in blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples using HPLC with liquid scintillation counting of chromatographic fractions. Safety and tolerability, including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), were assessed. RESULTS: Blood concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were almost superimposable up to ~12 h after dosing. Urine concentration-time profiles of trofinetide and total radioactivity were similar. Trofinetide was rapidly absorbed into the circulation with an initial rapid decline (half-life [t1/2] alpha ~2.6 h), followed by a relatively slow terminal elimination phase (t1/2 beta ~20 h). The blood-to-plasma total radioactivity ratios were 0.529-0.592, indicating a lack of affinity for the cellular portion of blood. Renal excretion accounted for 83.8% of the administered radiochemical dose; 15.1% was recovered in feces. Urine and fecal recovery of radioactivity accounted for 99% of the administered dose at 168 h after dosing. Parent [14C]-trofinetide was the major radiolabeled entity in blood and plasma (88.4% and 93.1% in area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12] in pooled blood and plasma samples, respectively) and the major entity excreted in urine (91.5% in 0-48-h pooled urine samples) and in feces (52.7% in 0-192-h pooled fecal samples). Only small levels of metabolites were present. In blood and plasma, only two minor metabolites were identified (each metabolite <= 2.24% of the AUC0-12 pool). These two metabolites were also observed in urine and fecal samples (<= 2.41% of dose). In feces, one additional metabolite (0.84% of dose) was identified. Two mild TEAEs were reported in two participants and were not considered related to trofinetide. There were no clinically meaningful changes in individual laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical findings, or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic and excretion profiles confirm that trofinetide undergoes minimal hepatic or intestinal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Trofinetide containing radiolabeled [14C]-trofinetide was well tolerated.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen participants with classic genetically confirmed RTT followed by a three-month program of motor activities at home. A total of 47 rehabilitative goals were set. Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604). Parental reports of the involved families suggest, on average, a high level of usefulness of the program (4.4/5), adherence to the program (4.4/5), and general satisfaction (4.5/5).

Further investigations showed atypical results-neuroimaging was inconsistent with suspected disorders, while fundus evaluation, evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocity were normal. Specialised tests using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry identified methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA), implicating abnormal neurometabolism. Early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment are essential. A low-protein diet suitable for MMA along with a syrup containing vitamin B12 and levocarnitine were prescribed. Notable developmental improvements were seen after 18 days of hospitalisation and up to 36 months of age, with no further regression. To date, only one case of MMA mimicking Rett syndrome, an atypical neurodegenerative variant, has been reported. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of MMA, particularly when it mimics neurodegenerative disorders.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pathogenic variants involving the CDKL5 gene result in a severe epileptic encephalopathy, often later presenting with features similar to Rett syndrome. Cardinal features of epilepsy in the CDKL5 disorder include early onset at a median age of 6 weeks and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy in children. This study investigated use of the KD in the CDKL5 disorder and its influences on seizures. METHODS: The International CDKL5 Disorder Database, established in 2012, collects information on individuals with the CDKL5 disorder. Families have provided information regarding seizure characteristics, use, and side effects of the KD treatment. Descriptive statistics and time to event analyses were performed. Clinical vignettes were also provided on patients attending Boston Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Data regarding KD use were available for 204 individuals with a pathogenic CDKL5 variant. Median age of inclusion in the database was 4.8 years (range = 0.3-33.9 years), with median age of 6 weeks (range = 1 day-65 weeks) at seizure onset. History of KD use was reported for 51% (104 of 204) of individuals, with a median duration of use of 17 months (95% confidence interval = 9-24). Changes in seizure activity after commencing KD were reported for two-thirds (69 of 104), with improvements in 88% (61 of 69). Nearly one-third (31.7%) experienced side effects during the diet. At ascertainment, only one-third (32%) remained on the diet, with lack of long-term efficacy as the main reason for diet cessation (51%, 36 of 70). SIGNIFICANCE: Benefits of KD in the CDKL5 disorder are in keeping with previous trials on refractory epilepsies. However, poor long-term efficacy remains as a significant barrier. In view of its side effect profile, KD administration should be supervised by a pediatric neurologist and specialist dietician.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at Gillette Specialty Healthcare (2014-2018) of patients presenting to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms and select rare congenital diseases: muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Rett syndrome. RESULTS: Muscular dystrophies (n = 19) are X-linked myogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Men present to the urologist at variable ages, typically with complaints of functional incontinence and normal cystometrograms; we manage them with oral anticholinergic medications, condom catheter, or suprapubic catheter. Spinal muscular atrophy (n = 6) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients typically present with nephrolithiasis and urinary retention in late adolescence/early adulthood, but timing varies. Filling cystometrograms have been normal. We allow passive retention with intermittent catheterization and creation of catheterizable channels, when indicated. Rett syndrome (n = 5) is a rare, noninheritable genetic condition affecting females characterized by a brief period of normal development followed by loss of speech and purposeful hand use; there are characteristic behaviors. Patients present in early adulthood with complaints of urinary retention. We manage retention with permissive retention or sphincter chemodenervation. CONCLUSION: Several congenital neuromuscular conditions can cause lower urinary tract symptoms when these individuals become adults. We have discussed the clinical characteristics and management of select neurogenic and myogenic bladder conditions seen in adults with congenital conditions.",

                    "abstract": "Scoliosis is a common complication of neuromuscular disorders. These patients are frequently recalcitrant to nonoperative treatment. When treated surgically, they have the highest risk of complications of all forms of scoliosis. While recent studies have shown an improvement in the rate of complications, they still remain high ranging from 6.3 to 75% depending upon the underlying etiology and the treatment center (Mohamad et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 27:392-397, 2007; McElroy et al. in Spine, 2012; Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Cognetti et al. in Neurosurg Focus 43:E10, 2017). For those patients who are able to recover from the perioperative period without major complications, several recent studies have shown decreased long-term mortality and improved health-related quality of life in neuromuscular patients who have undergone spine fusion (Bohtz et al. in J Pediatr Orthop 31:668-673, 2011; Ahonen et al. in Neurology 101:e1787-e1792, 2023; Jain et al. in JBJS 98:1821-1828, 2016). It is critically important to optimize patients preoperatively to minimize the risk of post-operative complications and maximize long-term outcomes. In order to do so, one must familiarize themselves with the common complications and their treatment. The most common complications are pulmonary in nature. With reported rates as high as 23-29%, pre-operative optimization should be employed for these patients to minimize the risk of post-operative complications (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013; Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). The next most common cause of complications are implant related, with 13-23% of patients experiencing an implant-related complication that may require a second procedure (Toll et al. in J Neurosurg Pediatr 22:207-213, 2018; Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013) Therefore optimization of bone quality prior to surgical intervention is important to help minimize the risk of instrumentation failure. Optimization of muscle tone and spasticity may help to decrease the risk of instrumentation complications, but may also contribute to the progression of scoliosis. While only 3% of patients have neurologic complication, significant equipoise remains regarding whether or not patients should undergo prophylactic detethering procedures to minimize those risks (Sharma et al. in Eur Spine J 22:1230-1249, 2013). Although only 1.8% of complications are classified as cardiac related, they can be among the most devastating (Rumalla et al. in J Neurosurg Spine 25:500-508, 2016). Simply understanding the underlying etiology and the potential risks associated with each condition (i.e., conduction abnormalities in a patient with Rett syndrome or cardiomyopathies patients with muscular dystrophy) can be lifesaving. The following article is a summation of the half day course on neuromuscular scoliosis from the 58th annual SRS annual meeting, summarizing the recommendations from some of the world's experts on medical considerations in surgical treatment of neuromuscular scoliosis.",

Children with these conditions face an unknown lifespan as well as unstable and uncomfortable symptoms. Clinicians and other healthcare professionals are challenged by a lack of evidence for symptom management for these conditions. AIMS: In this scoping review, we systematically identified and mapped the existing literature on symptom management for children with Q3 conditions. We focused on the most common and distressing symptoms, namely alertness, behavioural problems, bowel incontinence, breathing difficulties, constipation, feeding difficulties, sleep disturbance, temperature regulation, tone and motor problems and urinary incontinence. For children with complex health conditions, good symptom management is pertinent to ensure the highest possible quality of life. METHODS: Scoping review. Electronic database searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL and a comprehensive grey literature search. RESULTS: We included 292 studies in our final synthesis. The most commonly reported conditions in the studies were Rett syndrome (n=69), followed by Cornelia de Lange syndrome (n=25) and tuberous sclerosis (n=16). Tone and motor problems were the most commonly investigated symptom (n=141), followed by behavioural problems (n=82) and sleep disturbance (n=62). CONCLUSION: The evidence for symptom management in Q3 conditions is concentrated around a few conditions, and these studies may not be applicable to other conditions. The evidence is dispersed in the literature and difficult to access, which further challenges healthcare providers. More research needs to be done in these conditions to provide high-quality evidence for the care of these children.",

METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in 10 electronic databases, from inception until August 2021. Included were speech-language teleinterventions delivered by researchers and/or clinicians via videoconferencing to users of AAC devices, without restrictions on chronological age and clinical diagnosis. The quality of the studies included in the review was appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Single-Case Experimental Design Scale; risk of bias was assessed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions and the single-case design risk of bias tools. RESULTS: Six teleinterventions including 25 participants with a variety of conditions, such as Down syndrome, autism, Rett syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used a single-case experimental design and one was a cohort study. Teleinterventions included active consultation (n = 2), functional communication training (n = 2), brain-computer interface (n = 1), and both teleintervention and in-person intervention (n = 1). All teleinterventions reported an increase in participants' independent use of AAC devices during the training sessions compared to baseline, as well as an overall high satisfaction and treatment acceptability. INTERPRETATION: Speech-language teleinterventions for users of AAC devices show great potential for a successful method of service delivery. Future telehealth studies with larger sample sizes and more robust methodology are strongly encouraged to allow the generalization of results across different populations. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Individuals can learn to use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices independently during tele-AAC interventions. Service providers and recipients reported an overall high satisfaction and acceptability for AAC services delivered via teleinterventions. Speech-language teleinterventions may be an effective method of providing AAC intervention services.",

                    "abstract": "The reversal of the Rett syndrome disease process in the Mecp2 mouse model of Guy et al. (2007) has motivated families and researchers to work on this condition. The reversibility in adult mice suggests that there is potentially much to be gained from rational treatments applied to patients of any age. However, it may be difficult to strike the right balance between enthusiasm on the one hand and realism on the other. One effect of this has been a fragmentation of the \"Rett syndrome community\" with some groups giving priority to work aimed at a cure while fewer resources are devoted to medical or therapy-based interventions to enhance the quality of life of affected patients or provide support for their families.Several possible therapeutic approaches are under development that, it is claimed and hoped, may lead to a \"cure\" for patients with Rett syndrome. While all have a rationale, there are potential obstacles to each being both safe and effective. Furthermore, any strategy that succeeded in restoring normal levels of MECP2 gene expression throughout the brain carries potential pitfalls, so that it will be of crucial importance to introduce any clinical trials of such therapies with great care.Expectations of families for a radical, rational treatment should not be inflated beyond a cautious optimism. This is particularly because affected patients with us now may not be able to reap the full benefits of a \"cure\". Thus, interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected patients should not be forgone and their importance should not be minimised.",

AIMS: the aim was to examine the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in three girls with RTT with chronic language impairments. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: we proposed an integrated intervention: tDCS and cognitive empowerment applied to language in order to enhance speech production (new functional sounds and new words). Because maximal gains usually are achieved when tDCS is coupled with behavioral training, we applied tDCS stimulation on Broca's area together with linguistic training. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: the results indicated a general enhancement in language abilities (an increase in the number of vowel/consonant sounds and words and the production and comprehension through discrimination), motor coordination (functional movements), and neurophysiological parameters (an increase in the frequency and power of alpha, beta and theta bands). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: we assume that tDCS stimulation combined with the cognitive empowerment applied to language can significantly influence a chronic impairment even in genetic syndromes. Our results provide data that support the role of tDCS in fostering brain plasticity and in particular in empowering speech production and comprehension in girls with RTT.",

Cardinal features of epilepsy in the CDKL5 disorder include early onset at a median age of 6 weeks and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment option for refractory epilepsy in children. This study investigated use of the KD in the CDKL5 disorder and its influences on seizures. METHODS: The International CDKL5 Disorder Database, established in 2012, collects information on individuals with the CDKL5 disorder. Families have provided information regarding seizure characteristics, use, and side effects of the KD treatment. Descriptive statistics and time to event analyses were performed. Clinical vignettes were also provided on patients attending Boston Children's Hospital. RESULTS: Data regarding KD use were available for 204 individuals with a pathogenic CDKL5 variant. Median age of inclusion in the database was 4.8 years (range = 0.3-33.9 years), with median age of 6 weeks (range = 1 day-65 weeks) at seizure onset. History of KD use was reported for 51% (104 of 204) of individuals, with a median duration of use of 17 months (95% confidence interval = 9-24). Changes in seizure activity after commencing KD were reported for two-thirds (69 of 104), with improvements in 88% (61 of 69). Nearly one-third (31.7%) experienced side effects during the diet. At ascertainment, only one-third (32%) remained on the diet, with lack of long-term efficacy as the main reason for diet cessation (51%, 36 of 70). SIGNIFICANCE: Benefits of KD in the CDKL5 disorder are in keeping with previous trials on refractory epilepsies. However, poor long-term efficacy remains as a significant barrier.

The typical group demonstrated the expected pattern of more negative amplitudes within 200-500 ms in response to words than nonwords at left temporal sites. In participants with Rett syndrome, word-nonword differentiation was observed at the right temporal sites. More negative left hemisphere amplitudes in response to words were associated (at trend level) with better receptive language skills and more adaptive behavior. The results indicate that girls with Rett syndrome differentiate known words from novel nonwords, but may do so using potentially atypical neural processes. Brain-behavior correlations support validity of the proposed neural markers of word processing, making passive listening paradigms a promising approach for assessing speech and language processing in participants with limited spoken language skills.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) affects many children. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

Twenty-six individuals (median [IQR] age 16.0 (9.4-20.6) years) wore an activPAL accelerometer during video-taped activities and agreement was determined between sedentary time determined by the activPAL and observation. For 11 individuals (median [IQR] age 14.5 (11.5-25.6) years), linear regression was used to determine the relationship between sedentary time recorded on the modified Bouchard activity record diary card and measured using the activPAL. In comparison to observation, the activPAL accurately measured duration of sedentary time with a mean difference (limit of agreement) of -1.0 (6.3) minutes. The duration of Bouchard activity record downtime accounted for 73% of the variance of sedentary time measured by the activPAL (coefficient 0.762, 95% CI 0.413 to 1.111). These data provide clinicians and caregivers with capacity to investigate strategies that would aim to increase activity in the nonexercise component of the activity continuum.",

We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological syndrome that affects mostly females. The syndrome leads to severe impairments impacting all areas of the affected persons' life, including speech, mobility, eating, and breathing impairments. The most distinct symptoms include stereotyped hand movements, ataxia, and atrophy of the lower limbs, and signs of autism. METHODS: According to the principle of convenience sampling, the quantitative research included five females diagnosed with Rett syndrome subject to their personalized goal oriented neurological physiotherapy. Changes in gross motor function were assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure 88 and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale. RESULTS: It was found that the 12-month multifaceted neurological physiotherapy intervention had statistically significant improvements in both Gross Motor Function Measure 88 (p = 0.005) and Rett syndrome Gross Motor Scale (p = 0.012). Despite positive improvements, the absence of control group made it difficult for a comparative evaluation to determine what interventions had the best possible outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative research demonstrates neuro-developmental treatment sessions, hippotherapy, hydrotherapy, physical therapy, a walking program, endurance exercises, active-assisted exercises, and coordination exercises, had a significant impact on improving gross motor function status. Current multifaceted intervention program leads to good improvement of gross motor skills above what can be expected from late motor deterioration.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

OBJECTIVE: To collect data on well-woman examinations and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates in women with RTT to understand the current state of women's healthcare in individuals with RTT. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey of 77 patients with Rett syndrome who were cared for at a single specialty clinic over five years was conducted to collect data on women's health examinations and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: The following percentages represent women with RTT who have met the recommendations of ACOG for well-woman examinations: breast examinations- 40.3%, pelvic examinations- 51.2%, mammograms- 75.0%, external genitourinary examinations -31.6%. Many of these women also had delayed exams. 22.9% of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccine have received it. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with RTT do not undergo well-woman examinations and HPV vaccinations as recommended by ACOG. Since these women are not usually sexually active, many guardians believe the HPV vaccine is unnecessary. However, like other women with disabilities, RTT females are at risk for sexual abuse and disparities in access to women's health services, so these topics should be discussed with caretakers.",

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may improve seizure control; however, its role in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy is not well described. The authors systematically reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness of VNS in this cohort. METHODS: In January 2021, the authors performed a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS/Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to investigate the impact of VNS on seizure outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of epilepsy. Primary outcomes included seizure freedom rate, >= 90% seizure reduction rate, and >= 50% seizure reduction rate. Secondary outcomes were seizure severity and quality of life (QOL), including cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The authors identified 125 articles, of which 47 with 216 nonduplicate patients were analyzed. Common diagnoses were Dravet syndrome (DS) (92/216 patients [42.6%]) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (63/216 [29.2%]). Seizure freedom was not reported in any patient with DS; the pooled proportion (95% CI) of patients with >= 50% seizure reduction was 41% (21%-58%). Secondary cognitive outcomes of VNS were variable in DS patients, but these patients demonstrated benefits in seizure duration and status epilepticus. In TSC patients, the pooled (95% CI) seizure freedom rate was 40% (12%-71%), >= 90% seizure reduction rate was 31% (8%-56%), and >= 50% reduction rate was 68% (48%-91%). Regarding the secondary outcomes of VNS in TSC patients, several studies reported decreased seizure severity and improved QOL outcomes. There was limited evidence regarding the use of VNS to treat patients with other genetic etiologies of epilepsy, such as mitochondrial disease, Rett syndrome, Doose syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, ring chromosome 20 syndrome, and lissencephaly; variable responses were reported in a limited number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conducted a systematic review of VNS outcomes in children with genetic etiologies of DRE. Among the most studied conditions, patients with TSC had substantial seizure reduction and improvements in QOL, whereas those with DS had less robust seizure reduction. Increased testing, diagnosis, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to better characterize VNS response in these children.",

Results: We found that parents reported favorable impressions of DBS regardless of the target condition, especially when greater improvement could be assured and when their child had the capacity to assist in the treatment decision-making.

We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). RECENT FINDINGS: We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. SUMMARY: Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

                    "abstract": "This systematic review and thematic analysis critically evaluated gene therapy trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, haemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, leukodystrophies, lysosomal storage disorders and retinal dystrophies and extrapolated the key clinical findings to individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT). The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2009, the International Ketogenic Diet Study Group published recommendations for children receiving ketogenic diet (KD) therapy for epilepsy. The document included a table listing epilepsy syndromes and conditions in which the KD has been particularly beneficial, hoping that physicians would refer children for the KD sooner. PURPOSE: To measure the impact of these 2009 recommendations on referral practice, we compared children initiated on the KD at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) 10 years before and after the recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, children referred to the KD who met indications increased from the pre- to post-recommendation group, 44 % (112/256) to 69 % (175/255) (p < 0.001), with JHH neurologists specifically referring more frequently (10/112, 9 % to 58/175, 33 %) (p < 0.01). Referrals increased for Glut-1 deficiency (0 % to 2.4 %, p = 0.015), Dravet syndrome (0 % to 6.7 %, p < 0.01), Rett syndrome (0.4 % to 3 %, p = 0.018), and formula-fed only status (16 % to 31 %, p < 0.01). The chances of > 50 % seizure reduction for all children referred improved slightly between decades (56 % to 61 %, p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Following the 2009 recommendations, our study shows there was an increase in referrals for children with indications at our center. Referrals from neurologists at our own institution increased the most. Ketogenic diet efficacy improved slightly over time but did not reach significance.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trofinetide, a synthetic analog of tripeptide glycine-proline-glutamate, is an investigational agent for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with affected individuals requiring lifelong support. Food can affect the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug, and this phase 1 study assessed the potential effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of trofinetide. The study also evaluated the potential effect of evening dosing on trofinetide bioavailability and characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of trofinetide in urine. METHODS: A 60 mL oral solution of trofinetide (12 g) was administered in three dosing periods: morning fasted (A; reference), morning fed (B), and evening fasted (C). Healthy adult subjects (18-45 years) were randomized to sequence ABC (n = 19) or BAC (n = 22). Blood and urine samples were collected at scheduled timepoints for trofinetide pharmacokinetic analysis. Bioequivalence was confirmed if 90% confidence intervals for geometric mean ratio between B/A or C/A fell within 80-125% equivalence limits for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) in whole blood. RESULTS: Bioequivalence criteria were met for all conditions (i.e., morning fed vs. morning fasted and evening fasted vs. morning fasted) except Cmax in the fed versus fasted condition, which was just below the bioequivalence limit (75.49%), suggesting a negligible food effect and lack of diurnal variation on bioavailability. Trofinetide was primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Trofinetide was well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSION: This study supports dosing of trofinetide without regard to food.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS-theta burst stimulation was used to probe long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics. RESULTS: RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (p = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.002). LTP-like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p = 0.003). INTERPRETATION: TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763-773.",

                    "abstract": "This systematic review and thematic analysis critically evaluated gene therapy trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, haemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, leukodystrophies, lysosomal storage disorders and retinal dystrophies and extrapolated the key clinical findings to individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT). The PRISMA guidelines were used to search six databases during the last decade, followed by a thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes. Thematic analysis across the different disorders revealed four themes: (I) Therapeutic time window of gene therapy; (II) Administration and dosing strategies for gene therapy; (III) Methods of gene therapeutics and (IV) Future areas of clinical interest. Our synthesis of information has further enriched the current clinical evidence base and can assist in optimising gene therapy and gene editing studies in individuals with RTT, but it would also benefit when applied to other disorders. The findings suggest that gene therapies have better outcomes when the brain is not the primary target. Across different disorders, early intervention appears to be more critical, and targeting the pre-symptomatic stage might prevent symptom pathology. Intervention at later stages of disease progression may benefit by helping to clinically stabilise patients and preventing disease-related symptoms from worsening. If gene therapy or editing has the desired outcome, older patients would need concerted rehabilitation efforts to reverse their impairments. The timing of intervention and the administration route would be critical parameters for successful outcomes of gene therapy/editing trials in individuals with RTT. Current approaches also need to overcome the challenges of MeCP2 dosing, genotoxicity, transduction efficiencies and biodistribution.",
