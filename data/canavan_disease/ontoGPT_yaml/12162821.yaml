input_text: 'Clinical protocol. Gene therapy of Canavan disease: AAV-2 vector for
  neurosurgical delivery of aspartoacylase gene (ASPA) to the human brain. This clinical
  protocol describes virus-based gene transfer for Canavan disease, a childhood leukodystrophy.
  Canavan disease, also known as Van Bogaert-Bertrand disease, is a monogeneic, autosomal
  recessive disease in which the gene coding for the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA)
  is defective. The lack of functional enzyme leads to an increase in the central
  nervous system of the substrate molecule, N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), which impairs
  normal myelination and results in spongiform degeneration of the brain. No effective
  treatment currently exists; however, virus-based gene transfer has the potential
  to arrest or reverse the course of this otherwise fatal condition. This procedure
  involves neurosurgical administration of approximately 900 billion genomic particles
  (approximately 10 billion infectious particles) of recombinant adeno-associated
  virus (AAV) containing the aspartoacylase gene (ASPA) directly to affected regions
  of the brain in each of 21 patients with Canavan disease. Pre- and post-delivery
  assessments include a battery of noninvasive biochemical, radiological, and neurological
  tests. This gene transfer study represents the first clinical use of AAV in the
  human brain and the first instance of viral gene transfer for a neurodegenerative
  disease.'
