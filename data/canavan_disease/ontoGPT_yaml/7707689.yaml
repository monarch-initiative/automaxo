input_text: Prenatal detection of Canavan disease (aspartoacylase deficiency) by DNA
  analysis. Amniocentesis was performed in four pregnancies at risk for Canavan disease
  (CD). In all families both parents were of Ashkenazi-Jewish origin and harboured
  the C854 mutation in the cDNA of the aspartoacylase gene. Using DNA analysis of
  the amniotic cells, three fetuses were predicted to be non-affected and one fetus
  was predicted to be affected. The concentration of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in
  the amniotic fluid was in agreement with these results. In urine samples of the
  three newborns predicted to be non-affected, the concentration of NAA was normal.
  Tissues of the aborted fetus were not available. We conclude that DNA analysis is
  probably a reliable method for prenatal diagnosis of CD.
