input_text: 'NGS-based expanded carrier screening for genetic disorders in North Indian
  population reveals unexpected results - a pilot study. BACKGROUND: To determine
  the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of common genetic disorders in the
  north Indian population by using next generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: After
  pre-test counselling, 200 unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened
  for pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were classified
  as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic
  variants were subjected to thorough literature-based curation in addition to the
  regular filters. Variants of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals
  were counselled explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening
  was advised when necessary. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 52 (26%) were found
  to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were identified to be
  carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier frequency of one in 17 for one
  of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2, TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order).
  Nine individuals were observed to be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency
  of one in 22. Three individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency
  one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers for the same
  disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many disorders (such as deafness,
  cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional
  epidermolysis bullosa, galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were
  different from those commonly observed in the West. CONCLUSION: A higher carrier
  frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was unexpected,
  and contrary to the generally held view about their prevalence in Asian Indians.
  In spite of the small sample size, this study would suggest that population-based
  carrier screening panels for India would differ from those in the West, and need
  to be selected with due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding
  exons with its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not
  well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes will detect
  carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the burden of genetic disorders
  in India and other resource poor countries.'
