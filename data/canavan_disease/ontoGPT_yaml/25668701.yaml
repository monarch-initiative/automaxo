input_text: 'Canavan disease: an Arab scenario. The autosomal recessive Canavan disease
  (CD) is a neurological disorder that begins in infancy. CD is caused by mutations
  in the gene encoding the ASPA enzyme. It has been reported with high frequency in
  patients with Jewish ancestry, and with low frequency in non-Jewish patients. This
  review will shed light on some updates regarding CD prevalence and causative mutations
  across the Arab World. CD was reported in several Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia,
  Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Kuwait, and Tunisia. The population with the highest risk
  is in Saudi Arabia due the prevalent consanguineous marriage culture. In several
  studies, four novel mutations were found among Arabian CD patients, including two
  missense mutations (p.C152R, p.C152W), a 3346bp deletion leading to the removal
  of exon 3 of the ASPA gene, and an insertion mutation (698insC). Other previously
  reported mutations, which led to damage in the ASPA enzyme activities found among
  CD Arab patients are c.530 T>C (p.I177T), c.79G>A (p.G27R), IVS4+1G>T, and a 92kb
  deletion, which is 7.16kb upstream from the ASPA start site. This review will help
  in developing customized molecular diagnostic approaches and promoting CD carrier
  screening in the Arab world in areas where consanguineous marriage is common particularly
  within Saudi Arabia.'
