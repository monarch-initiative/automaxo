input_text: Recent gene therapy advancements for neurological diseases. The past few
  years have seen rapid advancements in vector-mediated gene transfer to the nervous
  system and modest successes in human gene therapy trials. The purpose of this review
  is to describe commonly-used viral gene transfer vectors and recent advancements
  towards producing meaningful gene-based treatments for central nervous system (CNS)
  disorders. Gene therapy trials for Canavan disease, Batten disease, adrenoleukodystrophy,
  and Parkinson's disease are discussed to illustrate the current state of clinical
  gene transfer to the CNS. Preclinical studies are under way for a number of diseases,
  primarily lysosomal storage disorders, using a newer generation of vectors and delivery
  strategies. Relevant studies in animal models are highlighted for Mucopolysaccharidosis
  IIIB and Krabbe disease to provide a prelude for what can be expected in the coming
  years for human gene transfer trials, using recent advancements in gene transfer
  technology. In conclusion, recent improvements in CNS gene transfer technology are
  expected to significantly increase the degree of disease rescue in future CNS-directed
  clinical trials, exceeding the modest clinical successes that have been observed
  so far.
