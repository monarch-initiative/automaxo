input_text: Natural history of Canavan disease revealed by proton magnetic resonance
  spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and diffusion-weighted MRI. Canavan disease is a childhood
  leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the gene for human aspartoacylase ( ASPA),
  which leads to an abnormal accumulation of the substrate molecule N-acetyl-aspartate
  (NAA) in the brain. This study was designed to model the natural history of Canavan
  disease using MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( (1)H-MRS). NAA and
  various indices of brain structure (morphology, quantitative T1, fractional anisotropy,
  apparent diffusion coefficient) were measured in white and gray matter regions during
  the progression of Canavan disease. A mixed-effects statistical model was used to
  fit all outcome measures. Longitudinal data from 28 Canavan patients were directly
  compared in each brain region with reference data obtained from normal, age-matched
  pediatric subjects. The resultant model can be used to non-invasively monitor the
  natural history of Canavan disease or related leukodystrophies in future studies
  involving drug, gene therapy, or stem cell treatments.
