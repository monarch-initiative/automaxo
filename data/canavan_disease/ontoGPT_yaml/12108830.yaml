input_text: Canavan disease prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling. Canavan disease
  is a severe leukodystrophy more common among Ashkenazi Jews. The enzyme defect,
  apartoacylase, has been identified, and the gene cloned. Only two mutations account
  for over 98% of all Jewish alleles with Canavan disease. The carrier frequency among
  healthy Jews is 1:37-58. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis can be accurately
  carried out using molecular analysis. When mutations are unknown, analysis of amniotic
  fluid for NAA using stable isotope dilution technique can be used for prenatal diagnosis.
