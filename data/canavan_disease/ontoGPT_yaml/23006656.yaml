input_text: Advances and pitfalls of cell therapy in metabolic leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies
  are a group of disorders characterized by myelin dysfunction, either at the level
  of myelin formation or maintenance, that affect the central nervous system (CNS)
  and also in some cases, to a lesser extent, the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
  Although these genetic-based  disorders are generally rare, all together they have
  a significant impact in the society, with an estimated overall incidence of 1 in
  7,663 live births. Currently, there is no cure for leukodystrophies, and the development
  of effective treatments remains challenging. Not only leukodystrophies  generally
  progress very fast, but also most are multifocal needing the simultaneous targeting
  at multiple sites. Moreover, as the CNS is affected, the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
  limits the efficacy of treatment. Recently, interest on cell therapy has increased,
  and the leukodystrophies  for which metabolic correction is needed have become first-choice
  candidates for cell-based clinical trials. In this review, we present and discuss
  the available cell transplantation therapies in metabolic leukodystrophies including
  fucosidosis, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic  leukodystrophy, Canavan
  disease, and Krabbe's disease. We will discuss the latest advances of cell therapy
  and its pitfalls in this group of disorders, taking into account, among others,
  the limitations imposed by reduced cell migration in multifocal conditions, the
  need to achieve corrective  enzyme threshold levels, and the growing awareness that
  not only myelin but also the associated axonopathy needs to be targeted in some
  leukodystrophies.
