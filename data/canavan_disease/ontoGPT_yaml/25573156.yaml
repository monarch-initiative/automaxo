input_text: Acetate supplementation as a means of inducing glioblastoma stem-like
  cell growth arrest. Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary adult malignant
  brain tumor, is associated with a poor prognosis due, in part, to tumor recurrence
  mediated by chemotherapy and radiation resistant glioma stem-like cells (GSCs).
  The metabolic and epigenetic state of GSCs differs from their non-GSC counterparts,
  with GSCs exhibiting greater glycolytic metabolism and global hypoacetylation. However,
  little attention has been focused on the potential use of acetate supplementation
  as a therapeutic approach. N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form
  of brain acetate, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis,
  are significantly reduced in GBM tumors. We recently demonstrated that NAA supplementation
  is not an appropriate therapeutic approach since it increases GSC proliferation
  and pursued an alternative acetate source. The FDA approved food additive Triacetin
  (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) has been safely used for acetate supplementation therapy
  in Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation. This study characterized
  the effects of GTA on the proliferation and differentiation of six primary GBM-derived
  GSCs relative to established U87 and U251 GBM cell lines, normal human cerebral
  cortical astrocytes, and murine neural stem cells. GTA reduced proliferation of
  GSCs greater than established GBM lines. Moreover, GTA reduced growth of the more
  aggressive mesenchymal GSCs greater than proneural GSCs. Although sodium acetate
  induced a dose-dependent reduction of GSC growth, it also reduced cell viability.
  GTA-mediated growth inhibition was not associated with differentiation, but increased
  protein acetylation. These data suggest that GTA-mediated acetate supplementation
  is a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit GSC growth.
