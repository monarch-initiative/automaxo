input_text: 'Canavan disease: neuromorphological and biochemical analysis of a brain
  biopsy specimen. In this study we present a patient with Canavan disease or Van
  Bogaert and Bertrand type of spongiform leukodystrophy, proven by brain biopsy.
  We performed morphological studies and biochemical assays on fresh homogenates of
  the grey and white matter. Quantitative neuromorphological analysis of the cortex
  showed normal values except for poor dendritic arborization of the inner layers.
  No signs of neuronal damage were observed. The Na-K-ATPase activity was increased.
  Pyruvate and ketone bodies oxidation rates and the activity of cytochrome-c oxidase
  were normal. We conclude that there is neither a primary neuronal damage nor a primary
  mitochondrial dysfunction in the oxidative processes despite the abnormal morphology
  of mitochondria in this disease.'
