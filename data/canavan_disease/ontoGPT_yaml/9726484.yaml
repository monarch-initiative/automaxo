input_text: Imaging studies in a unique familial dysmyelinating disorder. We report
  the imaging findings in five patients with a unique dysmyelinating disorder. MR
  studies of these infants showed obstructive hydrocephalus caused by mass effect
  produced by an enlarged cerebellum. The white matter of an enlarged cerebrum and
  cerebellum showed delayed myelination. Proton spectroscopy showed normal N-acetylaspartate
  (NAA) levels. While the dysmyelinating disorder was clearly differentiated from
  Canavan disease by an absence of elevated NAA and differing histopathologic findings
  and autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern, there were similarities to this disease
  in the presentation and, to some extent, in the initial imaging findings.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
