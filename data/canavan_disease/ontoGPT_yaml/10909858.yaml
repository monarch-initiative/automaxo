input_text: 'Mutation detection in the aspartoacylase gene in 17 patients with Canavan
  disease: four new mutations in the non-Jewish population. Canavan disease is a severe
  progressive autosomal recessive disorder, which is characterised by spongy degeneration
  of the brain. The disease is caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase gene. Two
  different mutations were reported on 98% of the alleles of Ashkenazi Jewish patients,
  in which population the disease is highly prevalent. In non-Jewish patients of European
  origin, one mutation (914C > A) is found in 50% of the alleles, the other alleles
  representing all kinds of different mutations. We here describe the results of the
  mutation analysis in 17 European, non-Jewish patients. Ten different mutations were
  found, of which four had not been described before (H21P, A57T, R168H, P181T). A
  deletion of exon4, which until now had only been described once, was revealed in
  all five alleles of Turkish origin tested, indicating that this is a founder effect
  in the Turkish population.'
