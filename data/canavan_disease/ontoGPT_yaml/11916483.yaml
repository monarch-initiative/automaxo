input_text: "Critical issues in gene therapy for neurologic disease. Gene therapy
  for the nervous system is a newly emerging field with special issues related to
  modes of delivery, potential toxicity, and realistic expectations for treatment
  of this vital and highly complex tissue. This review focuses on the potential for
  gene delivery to the brain, as well as possible risks and benefits of these procedures.
  This includes discussion of appropriate vectors, such as adeno-associated virus,
  lentivirus, gutless adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus hybrid amplicons, and cell
  vehicles, such as neuroprogenitor cells. Routes of delivery for focal and global
  diseases are enumerated, including use of migratory cells, facilitation of vascular
  delivery across the blood-brain barrier, cerebrospinal fluid delivery, and convection
  injection. Attention is given to examples of diseases falling into different etiologic
  types: metabolic deficiency states, including Canavan disease and lysosomal storage
  disorders; and degenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease and other
  neurodegenerative conditions."
