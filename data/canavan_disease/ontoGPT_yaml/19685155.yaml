input_text: 'Glyceryl triacetate for Canavan disease: a low-dose trial in infants
  and evaluation of a higher dose for toxicity in the tremor rat model. Canavan disease
  (CD) is a fatal dysmyelinating genetic disorder associated with aspartoacylase deficiency,
  resulting in decreased brain acetate levels and reduced myelin lipid synthesis in
  the developing brain. Here we tested tolerability of a potent acetate precursor,
  glyceryl triacetate (GTA), at low doses in two infants diagnosed with CD, aged 8
  and 13 months. Much higher doses of GTA were evaluated for toxicity in the tremor
  rat model of CD. GTA was given orally to the infants for up to 4.5 and 6 months,
  starting at 25 mg/kg twice daily, doubling the dose weekly until a maximum of 250
  mg/kg reached. Wild-type and tremor rat pups were given GTA orally twice daily,
  initially at a dose of 4.2 g/kg from postnatal days 7 through 14, and at 5.8 g/kg
  from day 15 through 23, and thereafter in food (7.5%) and water (5%). At the end
  of the trial (approximately 90 to 120 days) sera and tissues from rats were analysed
  for changes in blood chemistry and histopathology. GTA treatment caused no detectable
  toxicity and the patients showed no deterioration in clinical status. In the high-dose
  animal studies, no significant differences in the mean blood chemistry values occurred
  between treated and untreated groups, and no lesions indicating toxicity were detectable
  in any of the tissues examined. Lack of GTA toxicity in two CD patients in low-dose
  trials, as well as in high-dose animal studies, suggests that higher, effective
  dose studies in human CD patients are warranted.'
