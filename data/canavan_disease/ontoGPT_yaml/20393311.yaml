input_text: Impact of gene patents and licensing practices on access to genetic testing
  and carrier screening for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease. Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs
  and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions
  are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because
  of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs
  between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs
  remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation
  diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis
  for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the
  National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed.
  The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital.
  Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that
  had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued
  restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense
  controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently
  allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible
  price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic
  tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case
  studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan
  diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication
  with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation,
  a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing
  for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis.
