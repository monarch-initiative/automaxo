input_text: 'Global CNS gene transfer for a childhood neurogenetic enzyme deficiency:
  Canavan disease. The neurogenetic prototypic disease on which we chose to test our
  gene therapy strategy is Canavan disease (CD). CD is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy
  associated with spongiform degeneration of the brain. At present the disease is
  uniformly fatal in affected probands. CD is characterized by mutations in the aspartoacylase
  (ASPA) gene, resulting in loss of enzyme activity. In this review, recent evidence
  is summarized on the etiology and possible treatments for CD. In particular, we
  discuss two gene delivery systems representing recent advances in both viral and
  liposome technology: a novel cationic liposome-polymer-DNA (LPD) complex, DCChol/DOPE-protamine,
  as well as recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors.'
