input_text: rAAV Gene Therapy in a Canavan's Disease Mouse Model Reveals Immune Impairments
  and an Extended Pathology Beyond the Central Nervous System. Aspartoacylase (AspA)
  gene mutations cause the pediatric lethal neurodegenerative Canavan disease (CD).
  There is emerging promise of successful gene therapy for CD using recombinant adeno-associated
  viruses (rAAVs). Here, we report an intracerebroventricularly delivered AspA gene
  therapy regime using three serotypes of rAAVs at a 20-fold reduced dose than previously
  described in AspA(-/-) mice, a bona-fide mouse model of CD. Interestingly, central
  nervous system (CNS)-restricted therapy prolonged survival over systemic therapy
  in CD mice but failed to sustain motor functions seen in systemically treated mice.
  Importantly, we reveal through histological and functional examination of untreated
  CD mice that AspA deficiency in peripheral tissues causes morphological and functional
  abnormalities in this heretofore CNS-defined disorder. We demonstrate for the first
  time that AspA deficiency, possibly through excessive N-acetyl aspartic acid accumulation,
  elicits both a peripheral and CNS immune response in CD mice. Our data establish
  a role for peripheral tissues in CD pathology and serve to aid the development of
  more efficacious and sustained gene therapy for this disease.
