input_text: 'Involvement of the pontomedullary corticospinal tracts: a useful finding
  in the diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. PURPOSE: To determine whether
  pontomedullary corticospinal tract involvement is a common and specific finding
  of adrenoleukodystrophy on MR images. METHODS: MR images of 10 patients with biochemically
  proved adrenoleukodystrophy who were examined during the last 6 years were reviewed
  retrospectively to determine the frequency of corticospinal tract involvement in
  the medulla, pons, mesencephalon, internal capsules, and corona radiata. MR images
  of 10 patients with other leukodystrophies (three with Krabbe disease, two with
  Alexander disease, two with metachromatic leukodystrophy, two with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher
  disease, and one with Canavan disease) were reviewed with specific attention to
  the pontomedullary corticospinal tracts. RESULTS: Medullary and pontine corticospinal
  tract involvement was present in eight of the 10 patients with adrenoleukodystrophy.
  Mesencephalic and internal capsular involvement was present in three patients. The
  coronal radiata portion of the corticospinal tracts was not involved in any of the
  10 patients. No pontomedullary corticospinal tract involvement was identified in
  any of the 10 patients with other leukodystrophies. The difference in the frequency
  of pontomedullary corticospinal tract involvement between the two groups was highly
  significant. CONCLUSION: Pontomedullary corticospinal tract involvement is a common
  finding in adrenoleukodystrophy and is unusual in other leukodystrophies. Awareness
  of this finding can facilitate the radiologic diagnosis of this disease and may
  expedite management of affected patients.'
