input_text: N-acetylaspartic acid impairs enzymatic antioxidant defenses and enhances
  hydrogen peroxide concentration in rat brain. N-Acetylaspartic acid accumulates
  in Canavan Disease, a severe inherited neurometabolic disease clinically characterized
  by severe mental retardation, hypotonia, macrocephaly and generalized tonic and
  clonic type seizures. Considering that the mechanisms of brain damage in this disease
  remain poorly understood, in the present study we investigated the in vitro and
  in vivo effects of N-acetylaspartic acid on the activities of catalase, superoxide
  dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as on hydrogen peroxide concentration
  in cerebral cortex of 14-day-old rats. Catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities
  were significantly inhibited, while hydrogen peroxide concentration was significantly
  enhanced by N-acetylaspartic acid both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, superoxide
  dismutase activity was not altered by N-acetylaspartic acid. Our results clearly
  show that N-acetylaspartic acid impairs the enzymatic antioxidant defenses in rat
  brain. This could be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for
  the brain damage observed in patients affected by Canavan Disease.
