input_text: Modification of aspartoacylase for potential use in enzyme replacement
  therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease. Canavan disease is a fatal neurological
  disease without any effective treatments to slow the relentless progress of this
  disorder. Enzyme replacement therapy has been used effectively to treat a number
  of metabolic disorders, but the presence of the blood-brain-barrier presents an
  additional challenge in the treatment of neurological disorders. Studies have begun
  with the aim of establishing a treatment protocol that can effectively replace the
  defective enzyme in Canavan disease patients. The human enzyme, aspartoacylase,
  has been cloned, expressed and purified, and the surface lysyl groups modified through
  PEGylation. Fully active modified enzymes were administered to mice that are defective
  in this enzyme and that show many of the symptoms of Canavan disease. Statistically
  significant increases in brain enzyme activity levels have been achieved in this
  animal model, as well as decreases in the elevated substrate levels that mimic those
  found in Canavan disease patients. These results demonstrate that the modified enzyme
  is gaining access to the brain and functions to correct this metabolic defect. The
  stage is now set for a long term study to optimize this enzyme replacement approach
  for the development of a treatment protocol.
