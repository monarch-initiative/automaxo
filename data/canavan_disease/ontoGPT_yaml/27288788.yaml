input_text: 'Non-genetic therapeutic approaches to Canavan disease. Canavan disease
  (CD) is a rare leukodystrophy characterized by diffuse spongiform white matter degeneration,
  dysmyelination and intramyelinic oedema with consequent impairment of psychomotor
  development and early death. The molecular cause of CD has been identified as being
  mutations of the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) leading to its functional
  deficiency. The physiological role of ASPA is to hydrolyse N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid
  (NAA), producing l-aspartic acid and acetate; as a result, its deficiency leads
  to abnormally high central nervous system NAA levels. The aim of this article is
  to review what is currently known regarding the aetiopathogenesis and treatment
  of CD, with emphasis on the non-genetic therapeutic strategies, both at an experimental
  and a clinical level, by highlighting: (a) major related hypotheses, (b) the results
  of the available experimental simulatory approaches, as well as (c) the relevance
  of the so far examined markers of CD neuropathology. The potential and the limitations
  of the current non-genetic neuroprotective approaches to the treatment of CD are
  particularly discussed in the current article, in a context that could be used to
  direct future experimental and (eventually) clinical work in the field. '
