input_text: 'Adeno-associated virus as a gene therapy vector: vector development,
  production and clinical applications. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as
  an attractive vector for gene therapy. AAV vectors have successfully been utilized
  to promote sustained gene expression in a variety of tissues such as muscle, eye,
  brain, liver, and lung. As the significance of AAV as a gene therapy vector has
  been realized over the past years, recent developments in recombinant AAV (rAAV)
  production and purification have revolutionized the AAV field. It is now possible
  to produce high yields of vector (10(12)-10(13) genome-containing particles per
  mL) that are free of contaminating cellular and helper virus proteins. Such vectors
  have been successfully used in preclinical applications in animal models such as
  those of hemophilia, lysosomal storage diseases and vision deficiency, all of which
  have shown therapeutic benefits from rAAV treatment. Clinical trials using rAAV2
  for the treatment of hemophilia B, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,
  and Canavan disease have begun, and reports from these phase I trials support the
  safety seen in preclinical trials. Eventually, tissue-specific vectors that can
  potentially evade the immune system will be required to optimize success in gene
  therapy. In recent years, this has led to the development of retargeted rAAV2 vectors
  and the identification and characterization of new serotypes from human and nonhuman
  primates that could potentially achieve these goals. AAV virologists and gene therapists
  alike have just begun to scratch the surface in terms of the utility of this small
  virus in a clinical setting. In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive overview
  of the recent advances in rAAV vector production and purification, vector development,
  and clinical applications.'
