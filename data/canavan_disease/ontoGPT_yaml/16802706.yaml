input_text: 'Canavan disease: studies on the knockout mouse. Canavan disease (CD)
  is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by spongy degeneration of the
  brain. Patients with CD have aspartoacylase (ASPA) deficiency, which results accumulation
  of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain and elevated excretion of urinary NAA.
  Clinically, patients with CD have macrocephaly, mental retardation and hypotonia.
  A knockout mouse for CD which was engineered, also has ASPA deficiency and elevated
  NAA. Molecular studies of the mouse brain showed abnormal expression of multiple
  genes in addition to ASPA deficiency. Adenoassociated virus mediated gene transfer
  and stem cell therapy in the knockout mouse are the latest attempts to alter pathophysiology
  in the CD mouse.'
