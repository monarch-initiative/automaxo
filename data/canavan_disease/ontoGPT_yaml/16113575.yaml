input_text: 'Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of Canavan disease. OBJECTIVE: Canavan
  disease is an autosomal recessive disorder which is relatively common in Ashkenazi
  Jews. It is characterized by developmental delay, severe hypotonia and early death,
  and is caused by a deficiency of aspartoacylase which is encoded by the ASPA gene.
  In Ashkenazi Jews, one major mutation (E285A) and one minor mutation (Y231X) account
  for the majority of cases. The objective of this study was to develop a preimplantation
  genetic diagnosis (PGD) protocol for Canavan disease. METHODS: Two carrier couples
  requested PGD for Canavan disease. In 1 couple each was a carrier of a different
  ASPA mutation (Y231X and E285A). In the other couple both were carriers of the minor
  mutation (Y231X). A single-cell duplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol
  was first developed on single leukocytes obtained from the known carrier parents.
  Following verification in single leukocytes, clinical PGD was offered to both couples.
  RESULTS: We evaluated 115 single leukocytes from known carriers and found an allele
  drop out rate of 1.7% for the fragment harboring the Y231X mutation and 0% for the
  fragment harboring the E285A mutation. One cycle of PGD was performed in each family.
  In the first, 11 embryos were successfully analyzed and 4 were found to be affected.
  Two unaffected embryos were transferred, but no pregnancy resulted. In the other
  family, 4 embryos were analyzed, 1 was affected, 2 were heterozygotes and 1 was
  homozygous normal. Following transfer of 2 unaffected embryos, a singleton pregnancy
  resulted, currently ongoing at 18 weeks gestational age. Amniocentesis performed
  at 16 weeks confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Reliable PGD for Canavan disease
  is possible using a single-cell nested PCR approach.'
