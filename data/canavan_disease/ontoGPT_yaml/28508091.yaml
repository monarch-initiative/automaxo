input_text: '[MR spectroscopy in metabolic disorders of the brain]. CLINICAL ISSUE:
  Metabolic disorders of the brain often present a particular challenge for the neuroradiologist,
  since the disorders are rare, changes on conventional MR are often non-specific
  and there are numerous differential diagnoses for the white substance lesions. STANDARD
  RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: As a complementary method to conventional brain MRI, MR spectroscopy
  may help to reduce the scope of the differential diagnosis. Entities with specific
  MR spectroscopy patterns are Canavan disease, maple syrup urine disease, nonketotic
  hyperglycinemia and creatine deficiency.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
