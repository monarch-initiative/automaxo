input_text: 'Screening semen donors for hereditary diseases. The Fairfax cryobank
  experience. OBJECTIVE: To study the carrier frequency of hereditary diseases in
  potential semen donors with no family history of a genetic disease. STUDY DESIGN:
  Carrier screening was performed on potential semen donors for chromosomal abnormalities,
  cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemoglobinopathies, Tay-Sachs disease,
  Gaucher disease, Canavan disease, and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (the
  BRCA1 185delAG mutation). The screening regimen used for each donor was dictated
  by his ethnic background. RESULTS: Among 361 individuals screened for chromosomal
  abnormalities, 1 carried an inversion, and 4 were possible mosaics. Fifteen of 407
  potential donors carried cystic fibrosis, 18 of 209 carried alpha-1-antitrypsin
  deficiency, and 2 of 74 carried a hemoglobinopathy. No carriers of Tay-Sachs disease
  (56 screened), Gaucher disease (32 screened), Canavan disease (22 screened) or the
  BRCA1 185delAG mutation (22 screened) were found. CONCLUSION: Screening semen donors
  for a number of genetic diseases that are passed silently from generation to generation
  is warranted since family history alone cannot identify them.'
