input_text: 'A case of juvenile Canavan disease with distinct pons involvement. BACKGROUND:
  Canavan disease is a genetic neurodegenerative leukodystrophy that results in the
  spongy degeneration of the white matter. Its key clinical features in the infantile
  form are developmental delay, visual problems and macrocephaly. Congenital and juvenile
  forms have also been described. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We report on a 13-year-old
  boy who is a high school student in a public school. He was diagnosed with juvenile
  Canavan disease, presenting with intentional tremor as the only clinical finding.
  RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed mainly the involvement of the caudate
  nucleus and pons extending to the mesencephalon and also the putamen and the thalamus,
  with no apparent signal increase in the cerebral white matter. A homozygous p.Gly274Arg
  (c.820A>G) missense mutation was identified. CONCLUSION: Juvenile Canavan disease
  with mainly pons involvement has not been published before. Pons, caudate nucleus
  and basal ganglia involvement without any white matter being involved could be expected
  in juvenile Canavan disease as a rare form of the disease.'
