input_text: Next generation sequencing of RNA reveals novel targets of resveratrol
  with possible implications for Canavan disease. Resveratrol (RSV) is a small compound
  first identified as an activator of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a key factor in mediating
  the effects of caloric restriction. Since then, RSV received great attention for
  its widespread beneficial effects on health and in connection to many diseases.
  RSV improves the metabolism and the mitochondrial function, and more recently it
  was shown to restore fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) capacities in patient fibroblasts
  harboring mutations with residual enzyme activity. Many of RSV's beneficial effects
  are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha, a direct target of SIRT1
  and a master regulator of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Despite numerous
  studies RSV's mechanism of action is still not completely elucidated. Our aim was
  to investigate the effects of RSV on gene regulation on a wide scale, possibly to
  detect novel genes whose up-regulation by RSV may be of interest with respect to
  disease treatment. We performed Next Generation Sequencing of RNA on normal fibroblasts
  treated with RSV. To investigate whether the effects of RSV are mediated through
  SIRT1 we expanded the analysis to include SIRT1-knockdown fibroblasts. We identified
  the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, mutated in Canavan disease, to be strongly up-regulated
  by RSV in several cell lines, including Canavan disease fibroblasts. We further
  link RSV to the up-regulation of other genes involved in myelination including the
  glial specific transcription factors POU3F1, POU3F2, and myelin basic protein (MBP).
  We also observe a strong up-regulation by RSV of the riboflavin transporter gene
  SLC52a1. Mutations in SLC52a1 cause transient multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
  (MADD). Our analysis of alternative splicing identified novel metabolically important
  genes affected by RSV, among which is particularly interesting the alpha subunit
  of the stimulatory G protein (Gsalpha), which regulates the cellular levels of cAMP
  through adenylyl cyclase. We conclude that in fibroblasts RSV stimulates the PGC-1alpha
  and p53 pathways, and up-regulates genes affecting the glucose metabolism, mitochondrial
  beta-oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. We further confirm that RSV might
  be a relevant treatment in the correction of FAO deficiencies and we suggest that
  treatment in other metabolic disorders including Canavan disease and MADD might
  be also beneficial.
