input_text: Magnetic resonance imaging in juvenile Canavan disease. We present a 2-year-old
  boy and a 6-year-old girl with mild Canavan disease (CD). Aspartoacylase activity
  in skin fibroblasts was deficient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain
  did not show the prominent leucodystrophy previously reported in CD, but there was
  a hyperintense signal from the lentiform nuclei and the heads of the caudate nuclei
  on the T2-weighted MR images. This suggests a specific vulnerability of the corpus
  striatum in these patients. In the older patient, the white matter became affected
  at the age of 6 years. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of white
  matter revealed a normal concentration of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) and a markedly
  decreased concentration of choline containing compounds (Cho) in the boy but a normal
  ratio of NAA to Cho in the girl. We conclude that deficient NAA catabolism affects
  myelin metabolism. This may present as changes in the striatum and/or as a low concentration
  of Cho before leucodystrophy appears on MRI.
