input_text: Cranial ultrasound findings in aspartoacylase deficiency (Canavan disease).
  Canavan disease (CD) is a rare leukodystrophy which is lethal in infancy or early
  childhood. The underlying biochemical abnormality in CD is a hereditary deficiency
  of N-aspartoacylase transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion. We report on
  the ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI findings of three unrelated boys with biochemically
  confirmed CD. At 6 and 9 months of age, two CD patients with rapid neurological
  deterioration showed markedly enhanced acoustic attenuation of the white matter
  with the exception of the corpus callosum, giving the appearance of a reversed pattern
  of echogenicity of cortical gray and subcortical white matter. While gyri and sulci
  had an almost normal US appearance, the periventricular gray matter featured prominently
  with increased echogenicity. In contrast another CD patient with a more protracted
  course had ventricular enlargement when examined by US at 5 and 9 months but no
  alteration in white matter echogenicity. MRI showed impaired myelinization in all
  three patients with Canavan disease.
