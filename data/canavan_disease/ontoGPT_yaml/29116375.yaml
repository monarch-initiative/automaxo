input_text: 'Uncoupling N-acetylaspartate from brain pathology: implications for Canavan
  disease gene therapy. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is the second most abundant organic
  metabolite in the brain, but its physiological significance remains enigmatic. Toxic
  NAA accumulation appears to be the key factor for neurological decline in Canavan
  disease-a fatal neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the NAA-degrading
  enzyme aspartoacylase. To date clinical outcome of gene replacement therapy for
  this spongiform leukodystrophy has not met expectations. To identify the target
  tissue and cells for maximum anticipated treatment benefit, we employed comprehensive
  phenotyping of novel mouse models to assess cell type-specific consequences of NAA
  depletion or elevation. We show that NAA-deficiency causes neurological deficits
  affecting unconscious defensive reactions aimed at protecting the body from external
  threat. This finding suggests, while NAA reduction is pivotal to treat Canavan disease,
  abrogating NAA synthesis should be avoided. At the other end of the spectrum, while
  predicting pathological severity in Canavan disease mice, increased brain NAA levels
  are not neurotoxic per se. In fact, in transgenic mice overexpressing the NAA synthesising
  enzyme Nat8l in neurons, supra-physiological NAA levels were uncoupled from neurological
  deficits. In contrast, elimination of aspartoacylase expression exclusively in oligodendrocytes
  elicited Canavan disease like pathology. Although conditional aspartoacylase deletion
  in oligodendrocytes abolished expression in the entire CNS, the remaining aspartoacylase
  in peripheral organs was sufficient to lower NAA levels, delay disease onset and
  ameliorate histopathology. However, comparable endpoints of the conditional and
  complete aspartoacylase knockout indicate that optimal Canavan disease gene replacement
  therapies should restore aspartoacylase expression in oligodendrocytes. On the basis
  of these findings we executed an ASPA gene replacement therapy targeting oligodendrocytes
  in Canavan disease mice resulting in reversal of pre-existing CNS pathology and
  lasting neurological benefits. This finding signifies the first successful post-symptomatic
  treatment of a white matter disorder using an adeno-associated virus vector tailored
  towards oligodendroglial-restricted transgene expression.'
