input_text: 'Immune responses to AAV in a phase I study for Canavan disease. BACKGROUND:
  Canavan disease is a rare leukodystrophy with no current treatment. rAAV-ASPA has
  been developed for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) for Canavan
  disease. This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to
  ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial
  infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2),
  mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum
  dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles
  were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration,
  we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority
  of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high
  levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In
  all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation.
  In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid
  was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with
  no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to
  the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2
  detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal
  administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects
  and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements
  on safety and efficacy.'
