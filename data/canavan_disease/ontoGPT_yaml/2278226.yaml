input_text: "Cerebral gigantism: report of one case. One case with the chief complaint
  of large head was diagnosed as cerebral gigantism (Sotos syndrome) according to
  the clinical picture and brain computerized tomography. This case, a one-year-old
  female infant, experienced rapid growth. Her height and head girth were excessive.
  Some degree of psychomotor retardation was present. Physical features included macrocrania,
  dolichocephaly, frontal bossing, hypertelorism, high-arched palate, large hands
  and feet. Cerebral ventricles were mildly dilated on brain computerized tomography.
  The diagnosis lied mainly on clinical characteristics. Diseases need to be differentiated
  from Sotos syndrome include fragile X syndrome, arrested hydrocephalus, Canavan
  disease and Alexander's disease."
