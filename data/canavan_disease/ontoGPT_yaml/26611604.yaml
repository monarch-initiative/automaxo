input_text: 'Gene Therapy for the Treatment of Neurological Disorders: Metabolic Disorders.
  Metabolic disorders comprise a large group of heterogeneous diseases ranging from
  very prevalent diseases such as diabetes mellitus to rare genetic disorders like
  Canavan Disease. Whether either of these diseases is amendable by gene therapy depends
  to a large degree on the knowledge of their pathomechanism, availability of the
  therapeutic gene, vector selection, and availability of suitable animal models.
  In this book chapter, we review three metabolic disorders of the central nervous
  system (CNS; Canavan Disease, Niemann-Pick disease and Phenylketonuria) to give
  examples for primary and secondary metabolic disorders of the brain and the attempts
  that have been made to use adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for treatment.
  Finally, we highlight commonalities and obstacles in the development of gene therapy
  for metabolic disorders of the CNS exemplified by those three diseases. '
