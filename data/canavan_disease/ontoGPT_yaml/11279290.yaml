input_text: Direct determination of the N-acetyl-L-aspartate synthesis rate in the
  human brain by (13)C MRS and [1-(13)C]glucose infusion. A non-invasive (13)C magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technique is described for the determination of the
  N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) synthesis rate, V(NAA), in the human brain in vivo. In
  controls, the mean V(NAA) was 9.2 +/- 3.9 nmol/min/g. In Canavan disease, where
  [NAA] is increased (p < 0.001) and [aspartate] is deceased (p < 0.001), V(NAA) was
  significantly reduced to 3.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/min/g (p < 0.001). These rates are in
  close agreement with the activity of the biosynthetic enzyme measured in vitro in
  animals, and with the rate of urinary excretion of NAA in human subjects with Canavan
  disease. The present result is consistent with the regulation of NAA synthesis by
  the activity of a single enzyme, L-aspartate-N-acetyltransferase, in vivo, and with
  its control in Canavan disease by limited substrate supply and/or product inhibition.
  The (13)C MRS technique provides the means for further determination of abnormal
  rates of neuronal NAA synthesis among neurological disorders in which low cerebral
  [NAA] has been identified.
