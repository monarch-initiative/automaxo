input_text: Rapid detection of three large novel deletions of the aspartoacylase gene
  in non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease. Canavan disease (CD), an autosomal
  recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase
  (ASPA) gene. In the present study, the ASPA gene was analyzed in 24 non-Jewish patients
  with CD from 23 unrelated families. Within this cohort, we found three large novel
  deletions of approximate 92, 56, and 12.13 kb in length, using both self-ligation
  of restriction endonuclease-digested DNA fragments with long-distance inverse PCR
  and multiplex dosage quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA. The 92 kb large deletion
  results in complete absence of the ASPA gene in one homozygous and one compound
  heterozygous patient, respectively. The 56 kb large deletion causes absence of the
  majority of the ASPA gene except for exon 1 alone in a compound heterozygous patient.
  The 12.13 kb deletion involves deletion of the ASPA gene from intron 3 to intron
  5 including exons 4 and 5 (I3 to E4E5I5) in a compound heterozygous patient. Patients
  with the three large deletions clinically manifested severe symptoms at birth, including
  seizures. Our study showed that the combined use of long-distance inverse PCR and
  multiplex dosage quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA is a helpful and rapid
  technique to search for large deletions, particularly for detection of large deletions
  in compound heterozygous patients.
