input_text: Accumulation of N-acetyl-L-aspartate in the brain of the tremor rat, a
  mutant exhibiting absence-like seizure and spongiform degeneration in the central
  nervous system. The tremor rat is a mutant that exhibits absence-like seizure and
  spongiform degeneration in the CNS. By positional cloning, a genomic deletion was
  found within the critical region in which the aspartoacylase gene is located. Accordingly,
  no aspartoacylase expression was detected in any of the tissues examined, and abnormal
  accumulation of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) was shown in the mutant brain, in correlation
  with the severity of the vacuole formation. Therefore, the tremor rat may be regarded
  as a suitable animal model of human Canavan disease, characterized by spongy leukodystrophy
  that is caused by aspartoacylase deficiency. Interestingly, direct injection of
  NAA into normal rat cerebroventricle induced 4- to 10-Hz polyspikes or spikewave-like
  complexes in cortical and hippocampal EEG, concomitantly with behavior characterized
  by sudden immobility and staring. These results suggested that accumulated NAA in
  the CNS would induce neuroexcitation and neurodegeneration directly or indirectly.
