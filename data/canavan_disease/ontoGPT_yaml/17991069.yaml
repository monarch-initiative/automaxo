input_text: Brain MRI features of merosin-negative congenital muscular dystrophy.
  The purpose of this article is to report brain MRI findings of merosin-negative
  congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) in two cases and to discuss its differentiation
  from other CMD subtypes. The cases were investigated by 1.5 Tesla MRI equipment
  using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), 3D
  fast spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) and post-contrast gadolinium enhanced sequences
  and the diagnosis was confirmed by muscle biopsy with immunohistochemical staining
  for merosin. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral subcortical U-fibre white
  matter changes with periventricular sparing in the first case. Though this imaging
  finding is non-specific and could be seen in other white matter diseases like Canavan
  disease, the absence of other distinguishing MRI and clinical features of those
  conditions allowed a proper diagnosis. The second case showed diffuse subcortical
  and deep white matter involvement and cerebellar cysts. There was no brainstem involvement,
  polymicrogyria or cobblestone lissencephaly in both of our cases which allowed differentiation
  of merosin-negative CMD from other CMDs. Muscle biopsy in both these patients showed
  dystrophic changes with absent staining for merosin confirming the diagnosis. Merosin-negative
  CMD should be considered in the imaging differential diagnosis of white matter diseases.
  In a patient presenting with features of CMD, MRI can be of help in further differentiation
  of the various CMD subtypes.
