input_text: 'Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features of L-2-hydroxyglutaric
  acidemia: report of three cases in comparison with Canavan disease. We report three
  cases of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acidemia and three cases of Canavan disease. The L-2-hydroxyglutaric
  acidemia cases are the first biochemically proven Turkish cases. Magnetic resonance
  imaging findings in the cases and similarities between the two diseases are emphasized.
  Both diseases are characterized by predominant subcortical white-matter involvement
  and dentate nuclei lesions with variable basal ganglia involvement. Canavan disease
  differs from L-2-hydroxyglutaric acidemia by the presence of typical brainstem involvement.'
