input_text: Long-term follow-up after gene therapy for canavan disease. Canavan disease
  is a hereditary leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase gene (ASPA),
  leading to loss of enzyme activity and increased concentrations of the substrate
  N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the brain. Accumulation of NAA results in spongiform
  degeneration of white matter and severe impairment of psychomotor development. The
  goal of this prospective cohort study was to assess long-term safety and preliminary
  efficacy measures after gene therapy with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying
  the ASPA gene (AAV2-ASPA). Using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging and standardized
  clinical rating scales, we observed Canavan disease in 28 patients, with a subset
  of 13 patients being treated with AAV2-ASPA. Each patient received 9 x 10(11) vector
  genomes via intraparenchymal delivery at six brain infusion sites. Safety data collected
  over a minimum 5-year follow-up period showed a lack of long-term adverse events
  related to the AAV2 vector. Posttreatment effects were analyzed using a generalized
  linear mixed model, which showed changes in predefined surrogate markers of disease
  progression and clinical assessment subscores. AAV2-ASPA gene therapy resulted in
  a decrease in elevated NAA in the brain and slowed progression of brain atrophy,
  with some improvement in seizure frequency and with stabilization of overall clinical
  status.
