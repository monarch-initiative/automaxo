input_text: Redirecting N-acetylaspartate metabolism in the central nervous system
  normalizes myelination and rescues Canavan disease. Canavan disease (CD) is a debilitating
  and lethal leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene
  and the resulting defect in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) metabolism in the CNS and peripheral
  tissues. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has the ability to cross the
  blood-brain barrier and widely transduce the CNS. We developed a rAAV-based and
  optimized gene replacement therapy, which achieves early, complete, and sustained
  rescue of the lethal disease phenotype in CD mice. Our treatment results in a super-mouse
  phenotype, increasing motor performance of treated CD mice beyond that of WT control
  mice. We demonstrate that this rescue is oligodendrocyte independent, and that gene
  correction in astrocytes is sufficient, suggesting that the establishment of an
  astrocyte-based alternative metabolic sink for NAA is a key mechanism for efficacious
  disease rescue and the super-mouse phenotype. Importantly, the use of clinically
  translatable high-field imaging tools enables the noninvasive monitoring and prediction
  of therapeutic outcomes for CD and might enable further investigation of NAA-related
  cognitive function.
