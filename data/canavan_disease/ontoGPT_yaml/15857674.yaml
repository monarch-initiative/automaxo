input_text: Effects of AAV-2-mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer in the tremor rat
  model of Canavan disease. The tremor rat is a spontaneous epilepsy model with a
  seizure phenotype caused by a deletion in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene. The absence
  of ASPA expression in these animals results in undetectable levels of enzyme activity
  and the accumulation of the substrate N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in brain, leading
  to generalized myelin vacuolation and severe motor and cognitive impairment. In
  support of human gene therapy for CD, recombinant adeno-associated viral vector
  (AAV-2) expressing ASPA was stereotactically delivered to the tremor rat brain and
  effects on the mutant phenotype were measured. AAV-ASPA gene transfer resulted in
  elevated aspartoacylase bioactivity compared to untreated mutant animals and elicited
  a significant decrease in the pathologically elevated whole-brain NAA levels. Assessment
  of motor function via quantitative rotorod testing demonstrated that rats injected
  with AAV-ASPA significantly improved on tests of balance and coordinated locomotion
  compared to animals receiving control vectors. This study provides evidence that
  AAV-2-mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer to the brain improves biochemical and
  behavioral deficits in tremor rat mutants (tm/tm) and supports the rationale of
  human gene transfer for Canavan disease.
