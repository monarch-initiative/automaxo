input_text: 'Enhanced brain distribution of modified aspartoacylase. Canavan disease
  is a fatal neurological disorder caused by defects in the gene that produces the
  enzyme aspartoacylase. Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome
  these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural
  cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified
  form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form
  of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution
  has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established,
  this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase.
  These improved properties set the stage for more extensive enzyme replacement trials
  as a possible treatment strategy. '
