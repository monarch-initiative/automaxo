input_text: '[Genetic analysis and prenatal diagnosis for a Chinese pedigree affected
  with Canavan disease]. OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient
  suspected for Canavan disease. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried
  out for the proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of
  the proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother
  by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The proband,
  a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and apathy. Urine
  metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial magnetic resonance
  imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal signals in large brain
  areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound heterozygous variants
  of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1 and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in
  exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A
  (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her mother and father. Her phenotypically
  normal brother has carried a heterozygous c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis
  by CVS indicated that the fetus was a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant.
  CONCLUSION: WES can facilitate the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for
  those lacking specific phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants
  of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the
  result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.'
