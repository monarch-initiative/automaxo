input_text: 'Canavan disease: from spongy degeneration to molecular analysis. Establishing
  the basic defect in Canavan disease has led to reliable biochemical methods for
  the diagnosis of this disease. The isolation of the gene and identification of mutations
  causing Canavan disease have led to the possibility of using DNA methods for the
  diagnosis of Canavan disease and for carrier detection. A surprising finding is
  the high carrier frequency of this gene defect among Ashkenazi Jewish people. Analysis
  for two mutations leads to the identification of 97% of Jewish patients with Canavan
  disease, and screening of Ashkenazi Jews is possible. N-Acetylaspartic acid has
  been considered to be an inert compound. The pathophysiology of Canavan disease
  links lack of NAA hydrolysis to a severe, debilitating white matter disease. Currently,
  NAA is being studied in many other brain disorders, such as Alzheimer disease, Huntington
  disease, and stroke. However, the only disease with a specific defect in the metabolism
  of NAA is Canavan disease. An animal model for Canavan disease is needed to study
  some of the questions regarding the role of NAA in brain tissue, and for the study
  of therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy.'
