input_text: 'Simultaneous high performance liquid chromatographic separation of purines,
  pyrimidines, N-acetylated amino acids, and dicarboxylic acids for the chemical diagnosis
  of inborn errors of metabolism. OBJECTIVES: To set up a novel simple, sensitive,
  and reliable ion-pairing HPLC method for the synchronous separation of several purines,
  pyrimidines, N-acetylated amino acids, and dicarboxylic acids for the chemical diagnosis
  and screening of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). DESIGN AND METHODS: The separation
  was set up using a Hypersil C-18, 5-microm particle size, 250 x 4.6 mm column, and
  a step gradient using two buffers and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as the pairing
  reagent. A highly sensitive diode array UV detector was set up at a wavelength between
  200 and 300 nm that revealed purines and pyrimidines at 260 nm and other compounds
  at 206 nm. RESULTS: Compounds were determined in the plasma of 15 healthy adults,
  in the urine of 50 healthy subjects (1-3 years, 4-6 years, 8-10 years, 12-18 years,
  25-35 years), and in 10 non-pathological amniotic fluid samples. To assess the validity
  of the chemical diagnosis of IEM, plasma and urine samples were analyzed in patients
  affected by Canavan disease (n = 10; mean age 4.6 +/- 2.3). Low plasma levels of
  N-acetylaspartate (16.96 +/- 19.57 micromol/L plasma; not detectable in healthy
  adults) and dramatically high urinary N-acetylaspartate concentrations (1872.03
  +/- 631.86 micromol/mmol creatinine; 450 times higher than that which was observed
  in age-matched controls) were recorded. Neither N-acetylglutamate nor N-acetylaspartylglutamate
  could be detected in the plasma or urine of controls or patients with Canavan disease.
  CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the suitability of the present ion-pairing
  HPLC separation with UV detection of cytosine, cytidine, creatinine, uracil, uridine,
  beta-pseudouridine, adenine, 3-methyladenine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, xanthosine,
  inosine, guanosine, ascorbic acid, thymine, thymidine, uric acid, 1-methyluric acid,
  orotic acid, N-acetylaspartate, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, malonic
  acid, methylmalonic acid, GSH, and GSSG as a reliable method for the prenatal and
  neonatal chemical diagnosis and screening of IEM using biological fluids.'
