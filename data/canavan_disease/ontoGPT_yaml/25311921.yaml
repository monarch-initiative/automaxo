input_text: "Clinical applications involving CNS gene transfer. Diseases of the central
  nervous system (CNS) have traditionally been the most difficult to treat by traditional
  pharmacological methods, due mostly to the blood-brain barrier and the difficulties
  associated with repeated drug administration targeting the CNS. Viral vector gene
  transfer represents a way to permanently provide a therapeutic protein within the
  nervous system after a single administration, whether this be a gene replacement
  strategy for an inherited disorder or a disease-modifying protein for a disease
  such as Parkinson's. Gene therapy approaches for CNS disorders has evolved considerably
  over the last two decades. Although a breakthrough treatment has remained elusive,
  current strategies are now considerably safer and potentially much more effective.
  This chapter will explore the past, current, and future status of CNS gene therapy,
  focusing on clinical trials utilizing adeno-associated virus and lentiviral vectors. "
