input_text: Genetic testing of leukodystrophies unraveling extensive heterogeneity
  in a large cohort and report of five common diseases and 38 novel variants. This
  study evaluates the genetic spectrum of leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies
  in Iran. 152 children, aged from 1 day to 15 years, were genetically tested for
  leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies based on clinical and neuroradiological
  findings from 2016 to 2019. Patients with a suggestive specific leukodystrophy,
  e. g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, Tay-Sachs disease were tested
  for mutations in single genes (108; 71%) while patients with less suggestive findings
  were evaluated by NGS. 108 of 152(71%) had MRI patterns and clinical findings suggestive
  of a known leukodystrophy. In total, 114(75%) affected individuals had (likely)
  pathogenic variants which included 38 novel variants. 35 different types of leukodystrophies
  and genetic leukoencephalopathies were identified. The more common identified disorders
  included metachromatic leukodystrophy (19 of 152; 13%), Canavan disease (12; 8%),
  Tay-Sachs disease (11; 7%), megalencephalic leukodystrophy with subcortical cysts
  (7; 5%), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (8; 5%), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease
  type 1 (8; 5%), Sandhoff disease (6; 4%), Krabbe disease (5; 3%), and vanishing
  white matter disease (4; 3%). Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed 90% leukodystrophies
  and genetic leukoencephalopathies. The total diagnosis rate was 75%. This unique
  study presents a national genetic data of leukodystrophies; it may provide clues
  to the genetic pool of neighboring countries. Patients with clinical and neuroradiological
  evidence of a genetic leukoencephalopathy should undergo a genetic analysis to reach
  a definitive diagnosis. This will allow a diagnosis at earlier stages of the disease,
  reduce the burden of uncertainty and costs, and will provide the basis for genetic
  counseling and family planning.
