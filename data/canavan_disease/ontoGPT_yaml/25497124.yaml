input_text: "An atypical case of Canavan disease with stroke-like presentation. BACKGROUND:
  Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by a deficiency
  of aspartoacylase. The disease has a severe course, with death occurring in the
  first few years of life. Atypical patients with mild courses have been reported,
  but acute presentations similar to stroke have not been well described. PATIENT
  DESCRIPTION: We present a boy who presented at 4 months of age with seizures after
  an episode of cardiopulmonary arrest is discussed. RESULTS: He was initially thought
  to have an ischemic watershed stroke based on his initial clinical presentation
  and magnetic resonance imaging. However, biochemical and follow-up radiologic evaluation
  were consistent with mild Canavan disease. DNA sequencing of the ASPA gene indicated
  one known mutation (A305E) and a novel mutation, L30V. Follow-up magnetic resonance
  imaging did not reveal the atrophy which would have been expected with watershed
  ischemia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated elevated N-acetyl aspartate
  to creatinine and N-acetyl aspartate to choline ratios. At 4 years of age, he was
  normocephalic, with mild clumsiness, speech delay, and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This
  child's unusual acute presentation, along with his prolonged mild course, raises
  questions about the relationship between biochemical signs of abnormal aspartoacylase
  function and clinical findings. This patient highlights the need for long-term clinical
  follow-up of children with mild Canavan disease to clarify the significance of these
  biochemical abnormalities."
