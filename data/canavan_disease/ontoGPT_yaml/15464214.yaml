input_text: Mouse neural progenitor cells differentiate into oligodendrocytes in the
  brain of a knockout mouse model of Canavan disease. Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal
  recessive disorder that leads to spongy degeneration in the white matter of the
  brain. Aspartoacylase (ASPA) synthesizing cells, oligodendrocytes, are lost in CD.
  Transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) offers an interesting therapeutic
  approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases by replacing the lost cells. Therefore,
  the NPCs transplantation to the brain of the CD mouse was studied. Injection of
  mouse NPCs to the striatum and cerebellum of juvenile CD mouse showed numerous BrdU
  positive cells at 1 month after injection. The same result was also observed in
  the adult CD mouse brain after 5 weeks of post-transplantation period. The implanted
  cells differentiated into oligodendrocytes and fibrous astrocytes, as observed using
  glial cell marker. This is the first report to describe the survival, distribution
  and differentiation of NPCs within the brain of CD mouse and a first step toward
  the potential clinical use of cell therapy to treat CD.
