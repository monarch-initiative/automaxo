input_text: 'Viral-Mediated Gene Replacement Therapy in the Developing Central Nervous
  System: Current Status and Future Directions. The past few years have witnessed
  rapid developments in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central
  nervous system neurogenetic disorders. Here, we provide pediatric neurologists with
  an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of these developments and note emerging trends
  for future research. This review presents the different types of viral vectors used
  in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the fundamental properties of viral-mediated
  gene replacement therapy; the challenges associated with the use of this therapy
  in the central nervous system; the pathway for therapy development, from translational
  basic science studies to clinical trials; and an overview of the therapies that
  have reached clinical trials in patients. Current viral platforms under investigation
  include adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, lentiviral/retroviral
  vectors, and herpes simplex virus type 1 vectors. This review also presents an in-depth
  analysis of numerous studies that investigated these viral platforms in cultured
  cells and in transgenic animal models for pediatric neurogenetic disorders. Viral
  vectors have been applied to clinical trials for many different pediatric neurogenetic
  disorders, including Canavan disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, neuronal ceroid
  lipofuscinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis III, spinal muscular atrophy, and aromatic
  l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Of these diseases, only spinal muscular atrophy
  has a viral-mediated gene replacement therapy approved for marketing. Despite significant
  progress in therapy development, many challenges remain. Surmounting these challenges
  is critical to advancing the current status of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy
  for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders.'
