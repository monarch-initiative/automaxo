33138774	NGS-based expanded carrier screening for genetic disorders in North Indian population reveals unexpected results - a pilot study. BACKGROUND: To determine the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of common genetic disorders in the north Indian population by using next generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: After pre-test counselling, 200 unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened for pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were classified as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were subjected to thorough literature-based curation in addition to the regular filters. Variants of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals were counselled explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening was advised when necessary. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 52 (26%) were found to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were identified to be carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier frequency of one in 17 for one of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2, TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order). Nine individuals were observed to be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency of one in 22. Three individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers for the same disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many disorders (such as deafness, cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were different from those commonly observed in the West. CONCLUSION: A higher carrier frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was unexpected, and contrary to the generally held view about their prevalence in Asian Indians. In spite of the small sample size, this study would suggest that population-based carrier screening panels for India would differ from those in the West, and need to be selected with due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding exons with its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes will detect carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the burden of genetic disorders in India and other resource poor countries.
31925837	Antisense Oligonucleotide Reverses Leukodystrophy in Canavan Disease Mice. Marked elevation in the brain concentration of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) is a characteristic feature of Canavan disease, a vacuolar leukodystrophy resulting from deficiency of the oligodendroglial NAA-cleaving enzyme aspartoacylase. We now demonstrate that inhibiting NAA synthesis by intracisternal administration of a locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide to young-adult aspartoacylase-deficient mice reverses their pre-existing ataxia and diminishes cerebellar and thalamic vacuolation and Purkinje cell dendritic atrophy. Ann Neurol 2020;87:480-485.
33547378	Genetic testing of leukodystrophies unraveling extensive heterogeneity in a large cohort and report of five common diseases and 38 novel variants. This study evaluates the genetic spectrum of leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies in Iran. 152 children, aged from 1 day to 15 years, were genetically tested for leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies based on clinical and neuroradiological findings from 2016 to 2019. Patients with a suggestive specific leukodystrophy, e. g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, Tay-Sachs disease were tested for mutations in single genes (108; 71%) while patients with less suggestive findings were evaluated by NGS. 108 of 152(71%) had MRI patterns and clinical findings suggestive of a known leukodystrophy. In total, 114(75%) affected individuals had (likely) pathogenic variants which included 38 novel variants. 35 different types of leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies were identified. The more common identified disorders included metachromatic leukodystrophy (19 of 152; 13%), Canavan disease (12; 8%), Tay-Sachs disease (11; 7%), megalencephalic leukodystrophy with subcortical cysts (7; 5%), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (8; 5%), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1 (8; 5%), Sandhoff disease (6; 4%), Krabbe disease (5; 3%), and vanishing white matter disease (4; 3%). Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed 90% leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies. The total diagnosis rate was 75%. This unique study presents a national genetic data of leukodystrophies; it may provide clues to the genetic pool of neighboring countries. Patients with clinical and neuroradiological evidence of a genetic leukoencephalopathy should undergo a genetic analysis to reach a definitive diagnosis. This will allow a diagnosis at earlier stages of the disease, reduce the burden of uncertainty and costs, and will provide the basis for genetic counseling and family planning.
30446350	Next generation sequencing of RNA reveals novel targets of resveratrol with possible implications for Canavan disease. Resveratrol (RSV) is a small compound first identified as an activator of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a key factor in mediating the effects of caloric restriction. Since then, RSV received great attention for its widespread beneficial effects on health and in connection to many diseases. RSV improves the metabolism and the mitochondrial function, and more recently it was shown to restore fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) capacities in patient fibroblasts harboring mutations with residual enzyme activity. Many of RSV's beneficial effects are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha, a direct target of SIRT1 and a master regulator of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Despite numerous studies RSV's mechanism of action is still not completely elucidated. Our aim was to investigate the effects of RSV on gene regulation on a wide scale, possibly to detect novel genes whose up-regulation by RSV may be of interest with respect to disease treatment. We performed Next Generation Sequencing of RNA on normal fibroblasts treated with RSV. To investigate whether the effects of RSV are mediated through SIRT1 we expanded the analysis to include SIRT1-knockdown fibroblasts. We identified the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, mutated in Canavan disease, to be strongly up-regulated by RSV in several cell lines, including Canavan disease fibroblasts. We further link RSV to the up-regulation of other genes involved in myelination including the glial specific transcription factors POU3F1, POU3F2, and myelin basic protein (MBP). We also observe a strong up-regulation by RSV of the riboflavin transporter gene SLC52a1. Mutations in SLC52a1 cause transient multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Our analysis of alternative splicing identified novel metabolically important genes affected by RSV, among which is particularly interesting the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsalpha), which regulates the cellular levels of cAMP through adenylyl cyclase. We conclude that in fibroblasts RSV stimulates the PGC-1alpha and p53 pathways, and up-regulates genes affecting the glucose metabolism, mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. We further confirm that RSV might be a relevant treatment in the correction of FAO deficiencies and we suggest that treatment in other metabolic disorders including Canavan disease and MADD might be also beneficial.
33892849	Recent Advancements in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies comprise a growing group of inherited white matter disorders. Diagnostic rates have improved with increased utilization of next generation sequencing. As treatment options continue to advance for leukodystrophies, so will candidacy for inclusion in the United States' newborn Recommended Universal Screening Panel as was achieved for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.
32039588	Kinetic Modeling of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) Signals and Biocatalytic Reactions Observed in the Human Brain Using MRI: An Analysis of Normal and Pathological Conditions. A kinetic model describing the pulse of increased oxygen concentrations and the subsequent changes in the concentration of N-acetylaspartate in the excited nervous tissue of the human brain in response to an external signal is presented. The model is based on biochemical data, a multistage and nonlinear dynamic process the BOLD signal and N-acetylaspartate. The existence of multiple steady states explains the triggering effect of the system. The inhibitory effect of the substrate is a necessary factor for the autostabilization of N-acetylaspartate. The kinetic model allows the dynamic behavior of previously unmeasurable metabolites, namely, products of the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartate, such as acetic and aspartic acid, and glutamic acid to be predicted. Kinetic modeling of the BOLD signal and the subsequent hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartate provides information about the biochemical and dynamic characteristics of some pathological conditions (schizophrenia, Canavan disease, and the superexcitation of the neural network).
32684374	Viral-Mediated Gene Replacement Therapy in the Developing Central Nervous System: Current Status and Future Directions. The past few years have witnessed rapid developments in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders. Here, we provide pediatric neurologists with an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of these developments and note emerging trends for future research. This review presents the different types of viral vectors used in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the fundamental properties of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the challenges associated with the use of this therapy in the central nervous system; the pathway for therapy development, from translational basic science studies to clinical trials; and an overview of the therapies that have reached clinical trials in patients. Current viral platforms under investigation include adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, lentiviral/retroviral vectors, and herpes simplex virus type 1 vectors. This review also presents an in-depth analysis of numerous studies that investigated these viral platforms in cultured cells and in transgenic animal models for pediatric neurogenetic disorders. Viral vectors have been applied to clinical trials for many different pediatric neurogenetic disorders, including Canavan disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis III, spinal muscular atrophy, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Of these diseases, only spinal muscular atrophy has a viral-mediated gene replacement therapy approved for marketing. Despite significant progress in therapy development, many challenges remain. Surmounting these challenges is critical to advancing the current status of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders.
32975148	Severe retinal degeneration in a patient with Canavan disease. Background: Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in ASPA, a gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase. Patients present with macrocephaly, developmental delay, hypotonia, vision impairment and accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid. Progressive white matter changes occur in the central nervous system. The disorder is often fatal in early childhood, but milder forms exist. Materials and methods: Case report. Results: We present the case of a 31-year-old male with mild/juvenile Canavan disease who had severe vision loss due to a retinal degeneration resembling retinitis pigmentosa. Prior to this case, vision loss in Canavan disease had been attributed to optic atrophy based on fundoscopic evidence of optic nerve pallor. Investigations for an alternative cause for our patient's retinal degeneration were non-revealing. Conclusion: We wonder if retinal degeneration may not have been previously recognized as a feature of Canavan disease. We highlight findings from animal models of Canavan disease to further support the association between Canavan disease and retinal degeneration.
38311564	[Clinical and genetic analysis of a child with Canavan disease due to compound heterozygous variants of ASPA gene]. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical phenotype and genetic characteristics for a child with Canavan disease. METHODS: A child who was admitted to the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University on April 9, 2021 for inability to uphold his head for 2 months and increased muscle tone for one week was subjected to whole exome sequencing, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Genetic testing revealed that the child has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, including a paternally derived c.556_559dupGTTC (p. L187Rfs*5) and a maternally derived c.919delA (p. S307Vfs*24). Based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, both variants were predicted to be pathogenic (PVS1+PM2_Supporting+PM3). CONCLUSION: The c.556_559dupGTTC (p.L187Rfs*5) and c.919delA (p.S307Vfs*24) compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the pathogenesis of Canavan disease in this child.
35187608	Canavan's spongiform leukodystrophy (Aspartoacylase deficiency) with emphasis on sonographic features in infancy: description of a case report and review of the literature. Canavan disease (CD; MIM 271,900) or spongy degeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) is a lethal, rare autosomal recessive leukodystrophy, first described in 1931 (Canavan in Arch Neurol Psychiatry 25: 299-308, 1931). The clinical presentation includes severe neurologic impairment and macrocephaly with onset of symptoms at the age of 3-5 months. Biochemical and genetic fundamentals of the disease are elucidated. Imaging diagnosis is principally based on MRI with important role of MR spectroscopy. We report the cerebral sonographic findings in a severely affected infant with CD: Diffuse hyperechogenicity and small multicystic changes of white matter as well as an inverted pattern of echogenicity between cortical gray and subcortical white matter. These findings are compared to to the few cases found in literature and to normal ultrasound examples. Finally, ultrasound and MRI imaging findings are correlated.
34848132	Selective screening for inborn errors of metabolism by tandem mass spectrometry at Sohag University Hospital, Egypt. BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) comprise a group of inherited diseases that can have devastating consequences and cause irreversible damage to different body systems and even lead to death. Newborn screening helps in the presymptomatic diagnosis of many medical disorders including IEMs. Early diagnosis and management of IEMs helps reduce morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of IEMs among at-risk children and contribute toward early diagnosis and management in order to minimize morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the Pediatrics and Neonatology Department, Sohag University Hospital, Egypt. The study enrolled 308 participants suspected of having IEMs. Cases were included based on the presence of any of the following: unexplained convulsions, persistent metabolic acidosis, persistent hypoglycemia, disturbed consciousness, delayed milestones, or family history of previous sibling death with IEMs or sibling death with a history suggestive of IEMs. All participants in the study were subjected to metabolic screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). RESULTS: Out of 308 neonates, 93 (30.2%) were diagnosed with IEMs. The most common diagnosis was phenylketonuria, followed by glutaric aciduria type 1 and maple syrup urine disease (43%, 19.4%, and 14%, respectively). Five patients had Canavan disease, four had medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, three had congenital lactic acidosis, two had methylmalonic acidemia, and two had primary carnitine deficiency. Propionic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, homocystinuria, short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, B-ketothiolase deficiency, and ketone body utilization defect were diagnosed in one patient each. Most patients improved (73.1%) following proper specific management. CONCLUSION: We recommend newborn screening for IEMs using MS/MS, which may help with the early diagnosis and management of this group of disorders.

29116375	Uncoupling N-acetylaspartate from brain pathology: implications for Canavan disease gene therapy. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is the second most abundant organic metabolite in the brain, but its physiological significance remains enigmatic. Toxic NAA accumulation appears to be the key factor for neurological decline in Canavan disease-a fatal neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the NAA-degrading enzyme aspartoacylase. To date clinical outcome of gene replacement therapy for this spongiform leukodystrophy has not met expectations. To identify the target tissue and cells for maximum anticipated treatment benefit, we employed comprehensive phenotyping of novel mouse models to assess cell type-specific consequences of NAA depletion or elevation. We show that NAA-deficiency causes neurological deficits affecting unconscious defensive reactions aimed at protecting the body from external threat. This finding suggests, while NAA reduction is pivotal to treat Canavan disease, abrogating NAA synthesis should be avoided. At the other end of the spectrum, while predicting pathological severity in Canavan disease mice, increased brain NAA levels are not neurotoxic per se. In fact, in transgenic mice overexpressing the NAA synthesising enzyme Nat8l in neurons, supra-physiological NAA levels were uncoupled from neurological deficits. In contrast, elimination of aspartoacylase expression exclusively in oligodendrocytes elicited Canavan disease like pathology. Although conditional aspartoacylase deletion in oligodendrocytes abolished expression in the entire CNS, the remaining aspartoacylase in peripheral organs was sufficient to lower NAA levels, delay disease onset and ameliorate histopathology. However, comparable endpoints of the conditional and complete aspartoacylase knockout indicate that optimal Canavan disease gene replacement therapies should restore aspartoacylase expression in oligodendrocytes. On the basis of these findings we executed an ASPA gene replacement therapy targeting oligodendrocytes in Canavan disease mice resulting in reversal of pre-existing CNS pathology and lasting neurological benefits. This finding signifies the first successful post-symptomatic treatment of a white matter disorder using an adeno-associated virus vector tailored towards oligodendroglial-restricted transgene expression.
37597066	High genetic heterogeneity of leukodystrophies in Iranian children: the first report of Iranian Leukodystrophy Registry. Leukodystrophies (LDs) are a heterogeneous group of progressive neurological disorders and characterized by primary involvement of white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). This is the first report of the Iranian LD Registry database to describe the clinical, radiological, and genomic data of Persian patients with leukodystrophies. From 2016 to 2019, patients suspicious of LDs were examined followed by a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A single gene testing or whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used depending on the neuroradiologic phenotypes. In a few cases, the diagnosis was made by metabolic studies. Based on the MRI pattern, diagnosed patients were divided into cohorts A (hypomyelinating LDs) versus cohort B (Other LDs). The most recent LD classification was utilized for classification of diagnosed patients. For novel variants, in silico analyses were performed to verify their pathogenicity. Out of 680 registered patients, 342 completed the diagnostic evaluations. In total, 245 patients met a diagnosis which in turn 24.5% were categorized in cohort A and the remaining in cohort B. Genetic tests revealed causal variants in 228 patients consisting of 213 variants in 110 genes with 78 novel variants. WES and single gene testing identified a causal variant in 65.5% and 34.5% cases, respectively. The total diagnostic rate of WES was 60.7%. Lysosomal disorders (27.3%; GM2-gangliosidosis-9.8%, MLD-6.1%, KD-4.5%), amino and organic acid disorders (17.15%; Canavan disease-4.5%, L-2-HGA-3.6%), mitochondrial leukodystrophies (12.6%), ion and water homeostasis disorders (7.3%; MLC-4.5%), peroxisomal disorders (6.5%; X-ALD-3.6%), and myelin protein disorders (3.6%; PMLD-3.6%) were the most commonly diagnosed disorders. Thirty-seven percent of cases had a pathogenic variant in nine genes (ARSA, HEXA, ASPA, MLC1, GALC, GJC2, ABCD1, L2HGDH, GCDH). This study highlights the most common types as well as the genetic heterogeneity of LDs in Iranian children.
30304741	Juvenile Canavan Disease: A Leukodystrophy without White Matter Changes. 
35929936	[Genetic analysis and prenatal diagnosis for a Chinese pedigree affected with Canavan disease]. OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient suspected for Canavan disease. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out for the proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of the proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal signals in large brain areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1 and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her mother and father. Her phenotypically normal brother has carried a heterozygous c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis by CVS indicated that the fetus was a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant. CONCLUSION: WES can facilitate the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for those lacking specific phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.
28879937	Canavan disease with typical brain MRI and MRS findings. 
31839386	A case of juvenile Canavan disease with distinct pons involvement. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a genetic neurodegenerative leukodystrophy that results in the spongy degeneration of the white matter. Its key clinical features in the infantile form are developmental delay, visual problems and macrocephaly. Congenital and juvenile forms have also been described. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We report on a 13-year-old boy who is a high school student in a public school. He was diagnosed with juvenile Canavan disease, presenting with intentional tremor as the only clinical finding. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed mainly the involvement of the caudate nucleus and pons extending to the mesencephalon and also the putamen and the thalamus, with no apparent signal increase in the cerebral white matter. A homozygous p.Gly274Arg (c.820A>G) missense mutation was identified. CONCLUSION: Juvenile Canavan disease with mainly pons involvement has not been published before. Pons, caudate nucleus and basal ganglia involvement without any white matter being involved could be expected in juvenile Canavan disease as a rare form of the disease.
28508091	[MR spectroscopy in metabolic disorders of the brain]. CLINICAL ISSUE: Metabolic disorders of the brain often present a particular challenge for the neuroradiologist, since the disorders are rare, changes on conventional MR are often non-specific and there are numerous differential diagnoses for the white substance lesions. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: As a complementary method to conventional brain MRI, MR spectroscopy may help to reduce the scope of the differential diagnosis. Entities with specific MR spectroscopy patterns are Canavan disease, maple syrup urine disease, nonketotic hyperglycinemia and creatine deficiency.
