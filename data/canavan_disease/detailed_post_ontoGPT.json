While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase. These improved properties set the stage for more extensive enzyme replacement trials as a possible treatment strategy. ",

Although these genetic-based  disorders are generally rare, all together they have a significant impact in the society, with an estimated overall incidence of 1 in 7,663 live births. Currently, there is no cure for leukodystrophies, and the development of effective treatments remains challenging. Not only leukodystrophies  generally progress very fast, but also most are multifocal needing the simultaneous targeting at multiple sites. Moreover, as the CNS is affected, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the efficacy of treatment. Recently, interest on cell therapy has increased, and the leukodystrophies  for which metabolic correction is needed have become first-choice candidates for cell-based clinical trials. In this review, we present and discuss the available cell transplantation therapies in metabolic leukodystrophies including fucosidosis, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic  leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, and Krabbe's disease. We will discuss the latest advances of cell therapy and its pitfalls in this group of disorders, taking into account, among others, the limitations imposed by reduced cell migration in multifocal conditions, the need to achieve corrective  enzyme threshold levels, and the growing awareness that not only myelin but also the associated axonopathy needs to be targeted in some leukodystrophies.",

This review also presents an in-depth analysis of numerous studies that investigated these viral platforms in cultured cells and in transgenic animal models for pediatric neurogenetic disorders. Viral vectors have been applied to clinical trials for many different pediatric neurogenetic disorders, including Canavan disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis III, spinal muscular atrophy, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Of these diseases, only spinal muscular atrophy has a viral-mediated gene replacement therapy approved for marketing. Despite significant progress in therapy development, many challenges remain.

The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

                    "abstract": "The clinical features, causes and potential treatment of Canavan disease are reviewed. The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase. These improved properties set the stage for more extensive enzyme replacement trials as a possible treatment strategy. ",

While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a rare leukodystrophy with no current treatment. rAAV-ASPA has been developed for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) for Canavan disease. This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.",

CD is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy associated with spongiform degeneration of the brain. At present the disease is uniformly fatal in affected probands. CD is characterized by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, resulting in loss of enzyme activity. In this review, recent evidence is summarized on the etiology and possible treatments for CD. In particular, we discuss two gene delivery systems representing recent advances in both viral and liposome technology: a novel cationic liposome-polymer-DNA (LPD) complex, DCChol/DOPE-protamine, as well as recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors.",

Whether either of these diseases is amendable by gene therapy depends to a large degree on the knowledge of their pathomechanism, availability of the therapeutic gene, vector selection, and availability of suitable animal models. In this book chapter, we review three metabolic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS; Canavan Disease, Niemann-Pick disease and Phenylketonuria) to give examples for primary and secondary metabolic disorders of the brain and the attempts that have been made to use adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for treatment. Finally, we highlight commonalities and obstacles in the development of gene therapy for metabolic disorders of the CNS exemplified by those three diseases. ",

The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

Viral vector gene transfer represents a way to permanently provide a therapeutic protein within the nervous system after a single administration, whether this be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or a disease-modifying protein for a disease such as Parkinson's. Gene therapy approaches for CNS disorders has evolved considerably over the last two decades. Although a breakthrough treatment has remained elusive, current strategies are now considerably safer and potentially much more effective. This chapter will explore the past, current, and future status of CNS gene therapy, focusing on clinical trials utilizing adeno-associated virus and lentiviral vectors. ",

This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.",

This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.",

                    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

                    "abstract": "The clinical features, causes and potential treatment of Canavan disease are reviewed. The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase. These improved properties set the stage for more extensive enzyme replacement trials as a possible treatment strategy. ",

This review focuses on the potential for gene delivery to the brain, as well as possible risks and benefits of these procedures. This includes discussion of appropriate vectors, such as adeno-associated virus, lentivirus, gutless adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus hybrid amplicons, and cell vehicles, such as neuroprogenitor cells. Routes of delivery for focal and global diseases are enumerated, including use of migratory cells, facilitation of vascular delivery across the blood-brain barrier, cerebrospinal fluid delivery, and convection injection. Attention is given to examples of diseases falling into different etiologic types: metabolic deficiency states, including Canavan disease and lysosomal storage disorders; and degenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.",

Viral vector gene transfer represents a way to permanently provide a therapeutic protein within the nervous system after a single administration, whether this be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or a disease-modifying protein for a disease such as Parkinson's. Gene therapy approaches for CNS disorders has evolved considerably over the last two decades. Although a breakthrough treatment has remained elusive, current strategies are now considerably safer and potentially much more effective.

This review presents the different types of viral vectors used in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the fundamental properties of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the challenges associated with the use of this therapy in the central nervous system; the pathway for therapy development, from translational basic science studies to clinical trials; and an overview of the therapies that have reached clinical trials in patients. Current viral platforms under investigation include adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, lentiviral/retroviral vectors, and herpes simplex virus type 1 vectors. This review also presents an in-depth analysis of numerous studies that investigated these viral platforms in cultured cells and in transgenic animal models for pediatric neurogenetic disorders. Viral vectors have been applied to clinical trials for many different pediatric neurogenetic disorders, including Canavan disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis III, spinal muscular atrophy, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Of these diseases, only spinal muscular atrophy has a viral-mediated gene replacement therapy approved for marketing. Despite significant progress in therapy development, many challenges remain. Surmounting these challenges is critical to advancing the current status of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders.",

Although these genetic-based  disorders are generally rare, all together they have a significant impact in the society, with an estimated overall incidence of 1 in 7,663 live births. Currently, there is no cure for leukodystrophies, and the development of effective treatments remains challenging. Not only leukodystrophies  generally progress very fast, but also most are multifocal needing the simultaneous targeting at multiple sites. Moreover, as the CNS is affected, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the efficacy of treatment. Recently, interest on cell therapy has increased, and the leukodystrophies  for which metabolic correction is needed have become first-choice candidates for cell-based clinical trials. In this review, we present and discuss the available cell transplantation therapies in metabolic leukodystrophies including fucosidosis, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic  leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, and Krabbe's disease. We will discuss the latest advances of cell therapy and its pitfalls in this group of disorders, taking into account, among others, the limitations imposed by reduced cell migration in multifocal conditions, the need to achieve corrective  enzyme threshold levels, and the growing awareness that not only myelin but also the associated axonopathy needs to be targeted in some leukodystrophies.",

RESULTS: Physical examination and laryngoscopy demonstrated oropharyngeal narrowing, macroglossia, and bronchial asymmetry in a child with Canavan disease. Tracheostomy decreased problems with chronic aspiration and obstructive sleep apnea. CONCLUSIONS: Oropharyngeal obstruction and bronchial asymmetry are previously undescribed upper airway abnormalities found in an individual with Canavan disease. Tracheostomy is an effective method of managing chronic aspiration and obstruction in these patients.",

In controls, the mean V(NAA) was 9.2 +/- 3.9 nmol/min/g. In Canavan disease, where [NAA] is increased (p < 0.001) and [aspartate] is deceased (p < 0.001), V(NAA) was significantly reduced to 3.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/min/g (p < 0.001). These rates are in close agreement with the activity of the biosynthetic enzyme measured in vitro in animals, and with the rate of urinary excretion of NAA in human subjects with Canavan disease. The present result is consistent with the regulation of NAA synthesis by the activity of a single enzyme, L-aspartate-N-acetyltransferase, in vivo, and with its control in Canavan disease by limited substrate supply and/or product inhibition. The (13)C MRS technique provides the means for further determination of abnormal rates of neuronal NAA synthesis among neurological disorders in which low cerebral [NAA] has been identified.",

                    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

                    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as an attractive vector for gene therapy. AAV vectors have successfully been utilized to promote sustained gene expression in a variety of tissues such as muscle, eye, brain, liver, and lung. As the significance of AAV as a gene therapy vector has been realized over the past years, recent developments in recombinant AAV (rAAV) production and purification have revolutionized the AAV field. It is now possible to produce high yields of vector (10(12)-10(13) genome-containing particles per mL) that are free of contaminating cellular and helper virus proteins. Such vectors have been successfully used in preclinical applications in animal models such as those of hemophilia, lysosomal storage diseases and vision deficiency, all of which have shown therapeutic benefits from rAAV treatment. Clinical trials using rAAV2 for the treatment of hemophilia B, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and Canavan disease have begun, and reports from these phase I trials support the safety seen in preclinical trials. Eventually, tissue-specific vectors that can potentially evade the immune system will be required to optimize success in gene therapy. In recent years, this has led to the development of retargeted rAAV2 vectors and the identification and characterization of new serotypes from human and nonhuman primates that could potentially achieve these goals. AAV virologists and gene therapists alike have just begun to scratch the surface in terms of the utility of this small virus in a clinical setting. In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in rAAV vector production and purification, vector development, and clinical applications.",

Accumulation of NAA results in spongiform degeneration of white matter and severe impairment of psychomotor development. The goal of this prospective cohort study was to assess long-term safety and preliminary efficacy measures after gene therapy with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying the ASPA gene (AAV2-ASPA). Using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging and standardized clinical rating scales, we observed Canavan disease in 28 patients, with a subset of 13 patients being treated with AAV2-ASPA. Each patient received 9 x 10(11) vector genomes via intraparenchymal delivery at six brain infusion sites. Safety data collected over a minimum 5-year follow-up period showed a lack of long-term adverse events related to the AAV2 vector. Posttreatment effects were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model, which showed changes in predefined surrogate markers of disease progression and clinical assessment subscores. AAV2-ASPA gene therapy resulted in a decrease in elevated NAA in the brain and slowed progression of brain atrophy, with some improvement in seizure frequency and with stabilization of overall clinical status.",
