While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase.

Enzyme replacement therapy has been used effectively to treat a number of metabolic disorders, but the presence of the blood-brain-barrier presents an additional challenge in the treatment of neurological disorders. Studies have begun with the aim of establishing a treatment protocol that can effectively replace the defective enzyme in Canavan disease patients. The human enzyme, aspartoacylase, has been cloned, expressed and purified, and the surface lysyl groups modified through PEGylation. Fully active modified enzymes were administered to mice that are defective in this enzyme and that show many of the symptoms of Canavan disease. Statistically significant increases in brain enzyme activity levels have been achieved in this animal model, as well as decreases in the elevated substrate levels that mimic those found in Canavan disease patients. These results demonstrate that the modified enzyme is gaining access to the brain and functions to correct this metabolic defect. The stage is now set for a long term study to optimize this enzyme replacement approach for the development of a treatment protocol.",

The gene delivery system was tested in healthy rodents and primates, before proceeding to preliminary studies in 2 children with Canavan disease. Toxicity and expression testing was first carried out in human 293 cells, which demonstrated effective transduction of cells and high levels of functional ASPA activity. We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches. Finally, we performed the first in vivo gene transfer study for a human neurodegenerative disease in 2 children with Canavan disease to assess the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ASPA gene delivery. Our results suggest that LPD/pAAVaspa is well tolerated in human subjects and is associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes.",

The gene for ASPA has been cloned and more than 40 mutations have been described, with two founder mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Screening of Ashkenazi Jews for these two common mutations revealed a high carrier frequency, approximately 1/40, so that programs for carrier testing are currently in practice. The enzyme deficiency in CD interferes with the normal hydrolysis of NAA, which results in disruption of myelin and spongy degeneration of the white matter of the brain. The clinical features of the disease are macrocephaly, head lag, progressive severe mental retardation, and hypotonia in early life, which later changes to spasticity. A knockout mouse for CD has been generated, and used to study the pathophysiological basis for CD. Findings from the knockout mouse indicate that this monogenic trait leads to a series of genomic interaction in the brain. Changes include low levels of glutamate and GABA. Microarray expression analysis showed low level of expression of GABA-A receptor (GABRA6) and glutamate transporter (EAAT4). The gene Spi2, a gene involved in apoptosis and cell death, showed high level of expression. Such complexity of gene interaction results in the phenotype, the proteome, with spongy degeneration of the brain and neurological impairment of the mouse, similar to the human counterpart. Aspartoacylase gene transfer trial in the mouse brain using adenoassociated virus (AAV) as a vector are encouraging showing improved myelination and decrease in spongy degeneration in the area of the injection and also beyond that site.",

Although these genetic-based  disorders are generally rare, all together they have a significant impact in the society, with an estimated overall incidence of 1 in 7,663 live births. Currently, there is no cure for leukodystrophies, and the development of effective treatments remains challenging. Not only leukodystrophies  generally progress very fast, but also most are multifocal needing the simultaneous targeting at multiple sites. Moreover, as the CNS is affected, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the efficacy of treatment. Recently, interest on cell therapy has increased, and the leukodystrophies  for which metabolic correction is needed have become first-choice candidates for cell-based clinical trials. In this review, we present and discuss the available cell transplantation therapies in metabolic leukodystrophies including fucosidosis, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic  leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, and Krabbe's disease. We will discuss the latest advances of cell therapy and its pitfalls in this group of disorders, taking into account, among others, the limitations imposed by reduced cell migration in multifocal conditions, the need to achieve corrective  enzyme threshold levels, and the growing awareness that not only myelin but also the associated axonopathy needs to be targeted in some leukodystrophies.",

Here, we provide pediatric neurologists with an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of these developments and note emerging trends for future research. This review presents the different types of viral vectors used in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the fundamental properties of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the challenges associated with the use of this therapy in the central nervous system; the pathway for therapy development, from translational basic science studies to clinical trials; and an overview of the therapies that have reached clinical trials in patients. Current viral platforms under investigation include adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, lentiviral/retroviral vectors, and herpes simplex virus type 1 vectors. This review also presents an in-depth analysis of numerous studies that investigated these viral platforms in cultured cells and in transgenic animal models for pediatric neurogenetic disorders. Viral vectors have been applied to clinical trials for many different pediatric neurogenetic disorders, including Canavan disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis III, spinal muscular atrophy, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Of these diseases, only spinal muscular atrophy has a viral-mediated gene replacement therapy approved for marketing. Despite significant progress in therapy development, many challenges remain. Surmounting these challenges is critical to advancing the current status of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders.",

The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

Diagnostic rates have improved with increased utilization of next generation sequencing. As treatment options continue to advance for leukodystrophies, so will candidacy for inclusion in the United States' newborn Recommended Universal Screening Panel as was achieved for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.",

This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Enzyme replacement therapy has been used effectively to treat a number of metabolic disorders, but the presence of the blood-brain-barrier presents an additional challenge in the treatment of neurological disorders. Studies have begun with the aim of establishing a treatment protocol that can effectively replace the defective enzyme in Canavan disease patients. The human enzyme, aspartoacylase, has been cloned, expressed and purified, and the surface lysyl groups modified through PEGylation. Fully active modified enzymes were administered to mice that are defective in this enzyme and that show many of the symptoms of Canavan disease. Statistically significant increases in brain enzyme activity levels have been achieved in this animal model, as well as decreases in the elevated substrate levels that mimic those found in Canavan disease patients. These results demonstrate that the modified enzyme is gaining access to the brain and functions to correct this metabolic defect. The stage is now set for a long term study to optimize this enzyme replacement approach for the development of a treatment protocol.",

Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase.

Here we tested tolerability of a potent acetate precursor, glyceryl triacetate (GTA), at low doses in two infants diagnosed with CD, aged 8 and 13 months. Much higher doses of GTA were evaluated for toxicity in the tremor rat model of CD. GTA was given orally to the infants for up to 4.5 and 6 months, starting at 25 mg/kg twice daily, doubling the dose weekly until a maximum of 250 mg/kg reached. Wild-type and tremor rat pups were given GTA orally twice daily, initially at a dose of 4.2 g/kg from postnatal days 7 through 14, and at 5.8 g/kg from day 15 through 23, and thereafter in food (7.5%) and water (5%). At the end of the trial (approximately 90 to 120 days) sera and tissues from rats were analysed for changes in blood chemistry and histopathology. GTA treatment caused no detectable toxicity and the patients showed no deterioration in clinical status. In the high-dose animal studies, no significant differences in the mean blood chemistry values occurred between treated and untreated groups, and no lesions indicating toxicity were detectable in any of the tissues examined. Lack of GTA toxicity in two CD patients in low-dose trials, as well as in high-dose animal studies, suggests that higher, effective dose studies in human CD patients are warranted.",

Interestingly, central nervous system (CNS)-restricted therapy prolonged survival over systemic therapy in CD mice but failed to sustain motor functions seen in systemically treated mice. Importantly, we reveal through histological and functional examination of untreated CD mice that AspA deficiency in peripheral tissues causes morphological and functional abnormalities in this heretofore CNS-defined disorder. We demonstrate for the first time that AspA deficiency, possibly through excessive N-acetyl aspartic acid accumulation, elicits both a peripheral and CNS immune response in CD mice.

There is emerging promise of successful gene therapy for CD using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs). Here, we report an intracerebroventricularly delivered AspA gene therapy regime using three serotypes of rAAVs at a 20-fold reduced dose than previously described in AspA(-/-) mice, a bona-fide mouse model of CD. Interestingly, central nervous system (CNS)-restricted therapy prolonged survival over systemic therapy in CD mice but failed to sustain motor functions seen in systemically treated mice. Importantly, we reveal through histological and functional examination of untreated CD mice that AspA deficiency in peripheral tissues causes morphological and functional abnormalities in this heretofore CNS-defined disorder. We demonstrate for the first time that AspA deficiency, possibly through excessive N-acetyl aspartic acid accumulation, elicits both a peripheral and CNS immune response in CD mice. Our data establish a role for peripheral tissues in CD pathology and serve to aid the development of more efficacious and sustained gene therapy for this disease.",

                    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.",

Whether either of these diseases is amendable by gene therapy depends to a large degree on the knowledge of their pathomechanism, availability of the therapeutic gene, vector selection, and availability of suitable animal models. In this book chapter, we review three metabolic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS; Canavan Disease, Niemann-Pick disease and Phenylketonuria) to give examples for primary and secondary metabolic disorders of the brain and the attempts that have been made to use adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for treatment. Finally, we highlight commonalities and obstacles in the development of gene therapy for metabolic disorders of the CNS exemplified by those three diseases. ",

The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

Viral vector gene transfer represents a way to permanently provide a therapeutic protein within the nervous system after a single administration, whether this be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or a disease-modifying protein for a disease such as Parkinson's. Gene therapy approaches for CNS disorders has evolved considerably over the last two decades. Although a breakthrough treatment has remained elusive, current strategies are now considerably safer and potentially much more effective. This chapter will explore the past, current, and future status of CNS gene therapy, focusing on clinical trials utilizing adeno-associated virus and lentiviral vectors. ",

The gene delivery system was tested in healthy rodents and primates, before proceeding to preliminary studies in 2 children with Canavan disease. Toxicity and expression testing was first carried out in human 293 cells, which demonstrated effective transduction of cells and high levels of functional ASPA activity. We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches. Finally, we performed the first in vivo gene transfer study for a human neurodegenerative disease in 2 children with Canavan disease to assess the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ASPA gene delivery. Our results suggest that LPD/pAAVaspa is well tolerated in human subjects and is associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes.",

Deficiency of ASPA leads to elevation of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain and urine. To explore the feasibility of gene transfer to replace ASPA in CD, we generated a knockout mouse and constructed an AAV vector that encodes human ASPA cDNA (hASPA) followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) after an intraribosomal entry site. We injected CD mice with rAAV-hASPA-GFP in the striatum and thalamus or injected rAAV-GFP identically into control animals. Three to five months after the injection, we determined the presence of ASPA in the CD mouse brain by ASPA activity assay, GFP expression, and Western blot analysis. While rAAV-GFP-injected animals displayed undetectable levels of ASPA, all detection methods revealed significant ASPA levels in rAAV-hASPA-GFP-injected CD mice. We evaluated the functional effects of rAAV-hASPA-GFP-mediated ASPA expression by standard histological methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo NAA levels, and magnetic resonance imaging of CD mice. rAAV-hASPA-injected animals displayed a remarkable lack of spongiform degeneration in the thalamus. However, pathology in sites unrelated to the injected areas showed no improvement in histopathology. The improvement in thalamic neuropathology was also detectable via in vivo MRI. MRS revealed that in vivo NAA levels were also reduced. These data indicate that rAAV-mediated ASPA delivery may be an interesting avenue for the treatment of CD.",

The gene for ASPA has been cloned and more than 40 mutations have been described, with two founder mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Screening of Ashkenazi Jews for these two common mutations revealed a high carrier frequency, approximately 1/40, so that programs for carrier testing are currently in practice. The enzyme deficiency in CD interferes with the normal hydrolysis of NAA, which results in disruption of myelin and spongy degeneration of the white matter of the brain. The clinical features of the disease are macrocephaly, head lag, progressive severe mental retardation, and hypotonia in early life, which later changes to spasticity. A knockout mouse for CD has been generated, and used to study the pathophysiological basis for CD. Findings from the knockout mouse indicate that this monogenic trait leads to a series of genomic interaction in the brain. Changes include low levels of glutamate and GABA. Microarray expression analysis showed low level of expression of GABA-A receptor (GABRA6) and glutamate transporter (EAAT4). The gene Spi2, a gene involved in apoptosis and cell death, showed high level of expression. Such complexity of gene interaction results in the phenotype, the proteome, with spongy degeneration of the brain and neurological impairment of the mouse, similar to the human counterpart. Aspartoacylase gene transfer trial in the mouse brain using adenoassociated virus (AAV) as a vector are encouraging showing improved myelination and decrease in spongy degeneration in the area of the injection and also beyond that site.",

Here we tested tolerability of a potent acetate precursor, glyceryl triacetate (GTA), at low doses in two infants diagnosed with CD, aged 8 and 13 months. Much higher doses of GTA were evaluated for toxicity in the tremor rat model of CD. GTA was given orally to the infants for up to 4.5 and 6 months, starting at 25 mg/kg twice daily, doubling the dose weekly until a maximum of 250 mg/kg reached. Wild-type and tremor rat pups were given GTA orally twice daily, initially at a dose of 4.2 g/kg from postnatal days 7 through 14, and at 5.8 g/kg from day 15 through 23, and thereafter in food (7.5%) and water (5%). At the end of the trial (approximately 90 to 120 days) sera and tissues from rats were analysed for changes in blood chemistry and histopathology. GTA treatment caused no detectable toxicity and the patients showed no deterioration in clinical status. In the high-dose animal studies, no significant differences in the mean blood chemistry values occurred between treated and untreated groups, and no lesions indicating toxicity were detectable in any of the tissues examined. Lack of GTA toxicity in two CD patients in low-dose trials, as well as in high-dose animal studies, suggests that higher, effective dose studies in human CD patients are warranted.",

Diagnostic rates have improved with increased utilization of next generation sequencing. As treatment options continue to advance for leukodystrophies, so will candidacy for inclusion in the United States' newborn Recommended Universal Screening Panel as was achieved for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Deficiency of ASPA leads to elevation of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain and urine. To explore the feasibility of gene transfer to replace ASPA in CD, we generated a knockout mouse and constructed an AAV vector that encodes human ASPA cDNA (hASPA) followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) after an intraribosomal entry site. We injected CD mice with rAAV-hASPA-GFP in the striatum and thalamus or injected rAAV-GFP identically into control animals. Three to five months after the injection, we determined the presence of ASPA in the CD mouse brain by ASPA activity assay, GFP expression, and Western blot analysis. While rAAV-GFP-injected animals displayed undetectable levels of ASPA, all detection methods revealed significant ASPA levels in rAAV-hASPA-GFP-injected CD mice. We evaluated the functional effects of rAAV-hASPA-GFP-mediated ASPA expression by standard histological methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo NAA levels, and magnetic resonance imaging of CD mice. rAAV-hASPA-injected animals displayed a remarkable lack of spongiform degeneration in the thalamus. However, pathology in sites unrelated to the injected areas showed no improvement in histopathology. The improvement in thalamic neuropathology was also detectable via in vivo MRI. MRS revealed that in vivo NAA levels were also reduced. These data indicate that rAAV-mediated ASPA delivery may be an interesting avenue for the treatment of CD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a rare leukodystrophy with no current treatment. rAAV-ASPA has been developed for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) for Canavan disease. This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.",

Diagnostic rates have improved with increased utilization of next generation sequencing. As treatment options continue to advance for leukodystrophies, so will candidacy for inclusion in the United States' newborn Recommended Universal Screening Panel as was achieved for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.",

We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches.

Considering that the mechanisms of brain damage in this disease remain poorly understood, in the present study we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of N-acetylaspartic acid on the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as on hydrogen peroxide concentration in cerebral cortex of 14-day-old rats. Catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly inhibited, while hydrogen peroxide concentration was significantly enhanced by N-acetylaspartic acid both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, superoxide dismutase activity was not altered by N-acetylaspartic acid. Our results clearly show that N-acetylaspartic acid impairs the enzymatic antioxidant defenses in rat brain. This could be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the brain damage observed in patients affected by Canavan Disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Deficiency of ASPA leads to elevation of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain and urine. To explore the feasibility of gene transfer to replace ASPA in CD, we generated a knockout mouse and constructed an AAV vector that encodes human ASPA cDNA (hASPA) followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) after an intraribosomal entry site. We injected CD mice with rAAV-hASPA-GFP in the striatum and thalamus or injected rAAV-GFP identically into control animals. Three to five months after the injection, we determined the presence of ASPA in the CD mouse brain by ASPA activity assay, GFP expression, and Western blot analysis. While rAAV-GFP-injected animals displayed undetectable levels of ASPA, all detection methods revealed significant ASPA levels in rAAV-hASPA-GFP-injected CD mice. We evaluated the functional effects of rAAV-hASPA-GFP-mediated ASPA expression by standard histological methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo NAA levels, and magnetic resonance imaging of CD mice. rAAV-hASPA-injected animals displayed a remarkable lack of spongiform degeneration in the thalamus. However, pathology in sites unrelated to the injected areas showed no improvement in histopathology. The improvement in thalamic neuropathology was also detectable via in vivo MRI. MRS revealed that in vivo NAA levels were also reduced. These data indicate that rAAV-mediated ASPA delivery may be an interesting avenue for the treatment of CD.",

Enzyme replacement therapy has been used effectively to treat a number of metabolic disorders, but the presence of the blood-brain-barrier presents an additional challenge in the treatment of neurological disorders. Studies have begun with the aim of establishing a treatment protocol that can effectively replace the defective enzyme in Canavan disease patients. The human enzyme, aspartoacylase, has been cloned, expressed and purified, and the surface lysyl groups modified through PEGylation. Fully active modified enzymes were administered to mice that are defective in this enzyme and that show many of the symptoms of Canavan disease. Statistically significant increases in brain enzyme activity levels have been achieved in this animal model, as well as decreases in the elevated substrate levels that mimic those found in Canavan disease patients. These results demonstrate that the modified enzyme is gaining access to the brain and functions to correct this metabolic defect. The stage is now set for a long term study to optimize this enzyme replacement approach for the development of a treatment protocol.",

                    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

The molecular cause of CD has been identified as being mutations of the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) leading to its functional deficiency. The physiological role of ASPA is to hydrolyse N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (NAA), producing l-aspartic acid and acetate; as a result, its deficiency leads to abnormally high central nervous system NAA levels. The aim of this article is to review what is currently known regarding the aetiopathogenesis and treatment of CD, with emphasis on the non-genetic therapeutic strategies, both at an experimental and a clinical level, by highlighting: (a) major related hypotheses, (b) the results of the available experimental simulatory approaches, as well as (c) the relevance of the so far examined markers of CD neuropathology. The potential and the limitations of the current non-genetic neuroprotective approaches to the treatment of CD are particularly discussed in the current article, in a context that could be used to direct future experimental and (eventually) clinical work in the field.

The molecular cause of CD has been identified as being mutations of the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) leading to its functional deficiency. The physiological role of ASPA is to hydrolyse N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (NAA), producing l-aspartic acid and acetate; as a result, its deficiency leads to abnormally high central nervous system NAA levels. The aim of this article is to review what is currently known regarding the aetiopathogenesis and treatment of CD, with emphasis on the non-genetic therapeutic strategies, both at an experimental and a clinical level, by highlighting: (a) major related hypotheses, (b) the results of the available experimental simulatory approaches, as well as (c) the relevance of the so far examined markers of CD neuropathology. The potential and the limitations of the current non-genetic neuroprotective approaches to the treatment of CD are particularly discussed in the current article, in a context that could be used to direct future experimental and (eventually) clinical work in the field.

                    "abstract": "The clinical features, causes and potential treatment of Canavan disease are reviewed. The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase. These improved properties set the stage for more extensive enzyme replacement trials as a possible treatment strategy. ",

RSV improves the metabolism and the mitochondrial function, and more recently it was shown to restore fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) capacities in patient fibroblasts harboring mutations with residual enzyme activity. Many of RSV's beneficial effects are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha, a direct target of SIRT1 and a master regulator of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.

Our aim was to investigate the effects of RSV on gene regulation on a wide scale, possibly to detect novel genes whose up-regulation by RSV may be of interest with respect to disease treatment.

To investigate whether the effects of RSV are mediated through SIRT1 we expanded the analysis to include SIRT1-knockdown fibroblasts. We identified the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, mutated in Canavan disease, to be strongly up-regulated by RSV in several cell lines, including Canavan disease fibroblasts. We further link RSV to the up-regulation of other genes involved in myelination including the glial specific transcription factors POU3F1, POU3F2, and myelin basic protein (MBP). We also observe a strong up-regulation by RSV of the riboflavin transporter gene SLC52a1. Mutations in SLC52a1 cause transient multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Our analysis of alternative splicing identified novel metabolically important genes affected by RSV, among which is particularly interesting the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsalpha), which regulates the cellular levels of cAMP through adenylyl cyclase. We conclude that in fibroblasts RSV stimulates the PGC-1alpha and p53 pathways, and up-regulates genes affecting the glucose metabolism, mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis.

                    "abstract": "Canavan disease (CD) is an inherited leukodystrophy, caused by aspartoacylase (ASPA) deficiency, and accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. The gene for ASPA has been cloned and more than 40 mutations have been described, with two founder mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Screening of Ashkenazi Jews for these two common mutations revealed a high carrier frequency, approximately 1/40, so that programs for carrier testing are currently in practice. The enzyme deficiency in CD interferes with the normal hydrolysis of NAA, which results in disruption of myelin and spongy degeneration of the white matter of the brain. The clinical features of the disease are macrocephaly, head lag, progressive severe mental retardation, and hypotonia in early life, which later changes to spasticity. A knockout mouse for CD has been generated, and used to study the pathophysiological basis for CD. Findings from the knockout mouse indicate that this monogenic trait leads to a series of genomic interaction in the brain. Changes include low levels of glutamate and GABA. Microarray expression analysis showed low level of expression of GABA-A receptor (GABRA6) and glutamate transporter (EAAT4). The gene Spi2, a gene involved in apoptosis and cell death, showed high level of expression. Such complexity of gene interaction results in the phenotype, the proteome, with spongy degeneration of the brain and neurological impairment of the mouse, similar to the human counterpart. Aspartoacylase gene transfer trial in the mouse brain using adenoassociated virus (AAV) as a vector are encouraging showing improved myelination and decrease in spongy degeneration in the area of the injection and also beyond that site.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches. Finally, we performed the first in vivo gene transfer study for a human neurodegenerative disease in 2 children with Canavan disease to assess the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ASPA gene delivery.

Diagnostic rates have improved with increased utilization of next generation sequencing. As treatment options continue to advance for leukodystrophies, so will candidacy for inclusion in the United States' newborn Recommended Universal Screening Panel as was achieved for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.",

Therefore, the NPCs transplantation to the brain of the CD mouse was studied. Injection of mouse NPCs to the striatum and cerebellum of juvenile CD mouse showed numerous BrdU positive cells at 1 month after injection. The same result was also observed in the adult CD mouse brain after 5 weeks of post-transplantation period. The implanted cells differentiated into oligodendrocytes and fibrous astrocytes, as observed using glial cell marker.

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and widely transduce the CNS. We developed a rAAV-based and optimized gene replacement therapy, which achieves early, complete, and sustained rescue of the lethal disease phenotype in CD mice. Our treatment results in a super-mouse phenotype, increasing motor performance of treated CD mice beyond that of WT control mice. We demonstrate that this rescue is oligodendrocyte independent, and that gene correction in astrocytes is sufficient, suggesting that the establishment of an astrocyte-based alternative metabolic sink for NAA is a key mechanism for efficacious disease rescue and the super-mouse phenotype. Importantly, the use of clinically translatable high-field imaging tools enables the noninvasive monitoring and prediction of therapeutic outcomes for CD and might enable further investigation of NAA-related cognitive function.",

This includes discussion of appropriate vectors, such as adeno-associated virus, lentivirus, gutless adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus hybrid amplicons, and cell vehicles, such as neuroprogenitor cells. Routes of delivery for focal and global diseases are enumerated, including use of migratory cells, facilitation of vascular delivery across the blood-brain barrier, cerebrospinal fluid delivery, and convection injection. Attention is given to examples of diseases falling into different etiologic types: metabolic deficiency states, including Canavan disease and lysosomal storage disorders; and degenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.",

Viral vector gene transfer represents a way to permanently provide a therapeutic protein within the nervous system after a single administration, whether this be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or a disease-modifying protein for a disease such as Parkinson's. Gene therapy approaches for CNS disorders has evolved considerably over the last two decades. Although a breakthrough treatment has remained elusive, current strategies are now considerably safer and potentially much more effective.

Here, we provide pediatric neurologists with an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of these developments and note emerging trends for future research. This review presents the different types of viral vectors used in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the fundamental properties of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the challenges associated with the use of this therapy in the central nervous system; the pathway for therapy development, from translational basic science studies to clinical trials; and an overview of the therapies that have reached clinical trials in patients. Current viral platforms under investigation include adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, lentiviral/retroviral vectors, and herpes simplex virus type 1 vectors. This review also presents an in-depth analysis of numerous studies that investigated these viral platforms in cultured cells and in transgenic animal models for pediatric neurogenetic disorders. Viral vectors have been applied to clinical trials for many different pediatric neurogenetic disorders, including Canavan disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis III, spinal muscular atrophy, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Of these diseases, only spinal muscular atrophy has a viral-mediated gene replacement therapy approved for marketing. Despite significant progress in therapy development, many challenges remain. Surmounting these challenges is critical to advancing the current status of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders.",

Although these genetic-based  disorders are generally rare, all together they have a significant impact in the society, with an estimated overall incidence of 1 in 7,663 live births. Currently, there is no cure for leukodystrophies, and the development of effective treatments remains challenging. Not only leukodystrophies  generally progress very fast, but also most are multifocal needing the simultaneous targeting at multiple sites. Moreover, as the CNS is affected, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the efficacy of treatment. Recently, interest on cell therapy has increased, and the leukodystrophies  for which metabolic correction is needed have become first-choice candidates for cell-based clinical trials. In this review, we present and discuss the available cell transplantation therapies in metabolic leukodystrophies including fucosidosis, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic  leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, and Krabbe's disease. We will discuss the latest advances of cell therapy and its pitfalls in this group of disorders, taking into account, among others, the limitations imposed by reduced cell migration in multifocal conditions, the need to achieve corrective  enzyme threshold levels, and the growing awareness that not only myelin but also the associated axonopathy needs to be targeted in some leukodystrophies.",

Aspartoacylase (ASPA) synthesizing cells, oligodendrocytes, are lost in CD. Transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) offers an interesting therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases by replacing the lost cells. Therefore, the NPCs transplantation to the brain of the CD mouse was studied. Injection of mouse NPCs to the striatum and cerebellum of juvenile CD mouse showed numerous BrdU positive cells at 1 month after injection. The same result was also observed in the adult CD mouse brain after 5 weeks of post-transplantation period. The implanted cells differentiated into oligodendrocytes and fibrous astrocytes, as observed using glial cell marker. This is the first report to describe the survival, distribution and differentiation of NPCs within the brain of CD mouse and a first step toward the potential clinical use of cell therapy to treat CD.",

There is emerging promise of successful gene therapy for CD using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs). Here, we report an intracerebroventricularly delivered AspA gene therapy regime using three serotypes of rAAVs at a 20-fold reduced dose than previously described in AspA(-/-) mice, a bona-fide mouse model of CD. Interestingly, central nervous system (CNS)-restricted therapy prolonged survival over systemic therapy in CD mice but failed to sustain motor functions seen in systemically treated mice. Importantly, we reveal through histological and functional examination of untreated CD mice that AspA deficiency in peripheral tissues causes morphological and functional abnormalities in this heretofore CNS-defined disorder. We demonstrate for the first time that AspA deficiency, possibly through excessive N-acetyl aspartic acid accumulation, elicits both a peripheral and CNS immune response in CD mice. Our data establish a role for peripheral tissues in CD pathology and serve to aid the development of more efficacious and sustained gene therapy for this disease.",

In controls, the mean V(NAA) was 9.2 +/- 3.9 nmol/min/g. In Canavan disease, where [NAA] is increased (p < 0.001) and [aspartate] is deceased (p < 0.001), V(NAA) was significantly reduced to 3.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/min/g (p < 0.001). These rates are in close agreement with the activity of the biosynthetic enzyme measured in vitro in animals, and with the rate of urinary excretion of NAA in human subjects with Canavan disease. The present result is consistent with the regulation of NAA synthesis by the activity of a single enzyme, L-aspartate-N-acetyltransferase, in vivo, and with its control in Canavan disease by limited substrate supply and/or product inhibition. The (13)C MRS technique provides the means for further determination of abnormal rates of neuronal NAA synthesis among neurological disorders in which low cerebral [NAA] has been identified.",

AAV vectors have successfully been utilized to promote sustained gene expression in a variety of tissues such as muscle, eye, brain, liver, and lung. As the significance of AAV as a gene therapy vector has been realized over the past years, recent developments in recombinant AAV (rAAV) production and purification have revolutionized the AAV field. It is now possible to produce high yields of vector (10(12)-10(13) genome-containing particles per mL) that are free of contaminating cellular and helper virus proteins. Such vectors have been successfully used in preclinical applications in animal models such as those of hemophilia, lysosomal storage diseases and vision deficiency, all of which have shown therapeutic benefits from rAAV treatment. Clinical trials using rAAV2 for the treatment of hemophilia B, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and Canavan disease have begun, and reports from these phase I trials support the safety seen in preclinical trials. Eventually, tissue-specific vectors that can potentially evade the immune system will be required to optimize success in gene therapy. In recent years, this has led to the development of retargeted rAAV2 vectors and the identification and characterization of new serotypes from human and nonhuman primates that could potentially achieve these goals. AAV virologists and gene therapists alike have just begun to scratch the surface in terms of the utility of this small virus in a clinical setting. In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in rAAV vector production and purification, vector development, and clinical applications.",

Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease.

                    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

Accumulation of NAA results in spongiform degeneration of white matter and severe impairment of psychomotor development. The goal of this prospective cohort study was to assess long-term safety and preliminary efficacy measures after gene therapy with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying the ASPA gene (AAV2-ASPA). Using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging and standardized clinical rating scales, we observed Canavan disease in 28 patients, with a subset of 13 patients being treated with AAV2-ASPA. Each patient received 9 x 10(11) vector genomes via intraparenchymal delivery at six brain infusion sites. Safety data collected over a minimum 5-year follow-up period showed a lack of long-term adverse events related to the AAV2 vector. Posttreatment effects were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model, which showed changes in predefined surrogate markers of disease progression and clinical assessment subscores. AAV2-ASPA gene therapy resulted in a decrease in elevated NAA in the brain and slowed progression of brain atrophy, with some improvement in seizure frequency and with stabilization of overall clinical status.",
