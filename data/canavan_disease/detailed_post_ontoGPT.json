Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

                    "text": "Acetate supplementation as a means of inducing glioblastoma stem-like cell growth arrest. Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary adult malignant brain tumor, is associated with a poor prognosis due, in part, to tumor recurrence mediated by chemotherapy and radiation resistant glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). The metabolic and epigenetic state of GSCs differs from their non-GSC counterparts, with GSCs exhibiting greater glycolytic metabolism and global hypoacetylation. However, little attention has been focused on the potential use of acetate supplementation as a therapeutic approach. N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of brain acetate, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis, are significantly reduced in GBM tumors. We recently demonstrated that NAA supplementation is not an appropriate therapeutic approach since it increases GSC proliferation and pursued an alternative acetate source. The FDA approved food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) has been safely used for acetate supplementation therapy in Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation. This study characterized the effects of GTA on the proliferation and differentiation of six primary GBM-derived GSCs relative to established U87 and U251 GBM cell lines, normal human cerebral cortical astrocytes, and murine neural stem cells. GTA reduced proliferation of GSCs greater than established GBM lines. Moreover, GTA reduced growth of the more aggressive mesenchymal GSCs greater than proneural GSCs. Although sodium acetate induced a dose-dependent reduction of GSC growth, it also reduced cell viability. GTA-mediated growth inhibition was not associated with differentiation, but increased protein acetylation. These data suggest that GTA-mediated acetate supplementation is a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit GSC growth.",

Cancer is associated with epigenetic (i.e., histone hypoacetylation) and metabolic (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) alterations. Levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of acetate in the brain, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis to generate acetate, are reduced in glioma; yet, few studies have investigated acetate as a potential therapeutic agent. This preclinical study sought to test the efficacy of the food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) as a novel therapy to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of GTA, compared to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA), were assessed in established human glioma cell lines (HOG and Hs683 oligodendroglioma, U87 and U251 glioblastoma) and primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), relative to an oligodendrocyte progenitor line (Oli-Neu), normal astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. GTA was also tested as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant with temozolomide (TMZ) in orthotopically grafted GSCs. GTA-induced cytostatic growth arrest in vitro comparable to Vorinostat, but, unlike Vorinostat, GTA did not alter astrocyte growth and promoted NSC expansion. GTA alone increased survival of mice engrafted with glioblastoma GSCs and potentiated TMZ to extend survival longer than TMZ alone. GTA was most effective on GSCs with a mesenchymal cell phenotype. Given that GTA has been chronically administered safely to infants with Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation, GTA-mediated acetate supplementation may provide a novel, safe chemotherapeutic adjuvant to reduce the growth of glioma tumors, most notably the more rapidly proliferating, glycolytic and hypoacetylated mesenchymal glioma tumors.",

Canavan disease is a fatal neurological disorder caused by defects in the gene that produces the enzyme aspartoacylase. Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase.

The human enzyme, aspartoacylase, has been cloned, expressed and purified, and the surface lysyl groups modified through PEGylation. Fully active modified enzymes were administered to mice that are defective in this enzyme and that show many of the symptoms of Canavan disease. Statistically significant increases in brain enzyme activity levels have been achieved in this animal model, as well as decreases in the elevated substrate levels that mimic those found in Canavan disease patients.

The primary purpose of this work was to assess long-term in vitro reproducibility of metabolite levels measured using 1H MRS (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy). The secondary purpose was to use the in vitro results for interpretation of 1H MRS in vivo spectra acquired from patients diagnosed with Canavan disease. 1H MRS measurements were performed in the period from April 2006 to September 2010. 118 short and 116 long echo spectra were acquired from a stable phantom during this period. Change-point analysis of the in vitro N-acetylaspartate levels was exploited in the computation of fT factor (ratio of the actual to the reference N-acetylaspartate level normalized by the reciprocity principle). This coefficient was utilized in the interpretation of in vivo spectra analyzed using absolute reference technique. The monitored time period was divided into six time intervals based on short echo in vitro data (seven time intervals based on long echo in vitro data) characterized by fT coefficient ranging from 0.97 to 1.09 (based on short echo data) and from 1.0 to 1.11 (based on long echo data). Application of this coefficient to interpretation of in vivo spectra confirmed increased N-acetylaspartate level in Canavan disease. Long-term monitoring of an MRS system reproducibility, allowing for absolute referencing of metabolite levels, facilitates interpretation of metabolic changes in white matter disorders.",

                    "text": "Canavan disease: a white matter disorder. Breakdown of oligodendrocyte-neuron interactions in white matter (WM), such as the loss of myelin, results in axonal dysfunction and hence a disruption of information processing between brain regions. The major feature of leukodystrophies is the lack of proper myelin formation during early development or the onset of myelin loss late in life. These early childhood WM diseases are described as hypomyelination or dysmyelination arising from a primary block in normal myelin synthesis because of a genetic mutation expressed in oligodendrocytes, or failure in myelination secondary to neuronal or astroglial dysfunctions (van der Knaap 2001 Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 43:705-712). Here, we describe the pathophysiological parameters of Canavan disease (CD), caused by genetic mutations of the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, a metabolic enzyme restricted in the central nervous system (CNS) to oligodendrocytes. CD presents pathophysiological dysfunctions similar to diseases caused by myelin gene mutations, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and several animal models, such as myelin deficient rat (md), jimpy (jp), shiverer (sh), and quaking (qk viable) mutant mice. These single gene mutations have pleiotropic effects, whereby the alteration of one myelin gene expression disrupts functional expression of other oligodendrocyte genes with an outcome of hypomyelination/dysmyelination. Among all of the known leukodystrophies, CD is the first disorder, which was approved and tested for the adeno-associated virus vector (AAV)-ASPA gene therapy (Leone et al. 2000 Ann. Neurol. 48:27-38; Janson et al. 2001 Trends Neurosci. 24:706-712) without much success following the first two attempts. ASPA gene delivery attempts in animal models have shown a lowering of N-acetyl L-aspartate and a change in motor functions, while sponginess of the WM, a characteristic of CD remained unchanged (Matalon et al. 2003 Mol. Ther. 7 (5, Part 1):580-587; McPhee et al. 2005 Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 135:112-121) even with better viral serotype and delivery of the gene during early phase of development (Klugmann et al. 2005 Mol. Ther. 11:745-753). While different approaches are being sought for the success of gene therapy, there are pivotal developmental questions to address regarding the specific regions of the CNS and cell lineages that become the target for the onset and progression of CD symptoms from early to late stages of development.",

With the ultimate goal of developing safe and effective in vivo gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease and other neurological disorders, we developed a non-viral lipid-entrapped, polycation-condensed delivery system (LPD) for central nervous system gene transfer, in conjunction with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based plasmids containing recombinant aspartoacylase (ASPA). The gene delivery system was tested in healthy rodents and primates, before proceeding to preliminary studies in 2 children with Canavan disease. Toxicity and expression testing was first carried out in human 293 cells, which demonstrated effective transduction of cells and high levels of functional ASPA activity. We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches. Finally, we performed the first in vivo gene transfer study for a human neurodegenerative disease in 2 children with Canavan disease to assess the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ASPA gene delivery. Our results suggest that LPD/pAAVaspa is well tolerated in human subjects and is associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes.",

OBJECTIVE: Canavan disease (OMIM 271900) is a severe autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spongy degeneration of the brain and caused by mutations in the gene encoding for aspartoacylase (ASPA). The enzyme is responsible for the catalyses of the brain-specific compound N-acetylaspartate (NAA). DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the case of two Egyptian sibling patients suspected of Canavan disease (CD) showing clinical deterioration, white matter degeneration, megalencephaly and severe intellectual impairment. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biochemical analysis of NAA in biological fluid samples (serum and urine). Subsequently, in order to determine the mutation responsible for CD in these two sibs, a molecular biological examination was performed. RESULTS: MRI findings and quantification of high NAA excretion (1378.5 and 680.1mumolNAA/mmolcreatinine in urine of 4months and 4years old patients, respectively) confirmed the diagnosis of CD and prompted a search for the responsible mutation. The molecular biological analysis revealed homozygosity for the substitution T530C (Ile177Thr) in the exon 4 of the ASPA gene in both sibs. A total loss of enzymatic activity was also recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The substitution T530C (Ile177Thr) results in a novel missense mutation causing a CD phenotype with severe clinical characteristics. This mutation was not previously described in the literature. In these two sibs, urinary concentration of NAA appears to correlate inversely to symptom severity and CD progression.",

BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by a deficiency of aspartoacylase. The disease has a severe course, with death occurring in the first few years of life. Atypical patients with mild courses have been reported, but acute presentations similar to stroke have not been well described. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We present a boy who presented at 4 months of age with seizures after an episode of cardiopulmonary arrest is discussed. RESULTS: He was initially thought to have an ischemic watershed stroke based on his initial clinical presentation and magnetic resonance imaging. However, biochemical and follow-up radiologic evaluation were consistent with mild Canavan disease. DNA sequencing of the ASPA gene indicated one known mutation (A305E) and a novel mutation, L30V. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal the atrophy which would have been expected with watershed ischemia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated elevated N-acetyl aspartate to creatinine and N-acetyl aspartate to choline ratios. At 4 years of age, he was normocephalic, with mild clumsiness, speech delay, and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This child's unusual acute presentation, along with his prolonged mild course, raises questions about the relationship between biochemical signs of abnormal aspartoacylase function and clinical findings. This patient highlights the need for long-term clinical follow-up of children with mild Canavan disease to clarify the significance of these biochemical abnormalities.",

Leukodystrophies (LDs) are a heterogeneous group of progressive neurological disorders and characterized by primary involvement of white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). This is the first report of the Iranian LD Registry database to describe the clinical, radiological, and genomic data of Persian patients with leukodystrophies. From 2016 to 2019, patients suspicious of LDs were examined followed by a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A single gene testing or whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used depending on the neuroradiologic phenotypes. In a few cases, the diagnosis was made by metabolic studies. Based on the MRI pattern, diagnosed patients were divided into cohorts A (hypomyelinating LDs) versus cohort B (Other LDs). The most recent LD classification was utilized for classification of diagnosed patients. For novel variants, in silico analyses were performed to verify their pathogenicity. Out of 680 registered patients, 342 completed the diagnostic evaluations. In total, 245 patients met a diagnosis which in turn 24.5% were categorized in cohort A and the remaining in cohort B. Genetic tests revealed causal variants in 228 patients consisting of 213 variants in 110 genes with 78 novel variants. WES and single gene testing identified a causal variant in 65.5% and 34.5% cases, respectively. The total diagnostic rate of WES was 60.7%. Lysosomal disorders (27.3%; GM2-gangliosidosis-9.8%, MLD-6.1%, KD-4.5%), amino and organic acid disorders (17.15%; Canavan disease-4.5%, L-2-HGA-3.6%), mitochondrial leukodystrophies (12.6%), ion and water homeostasis disorders (7.3%; MLC-4.5%), peroxisomal disorders (6.5%; X-ALD-3.6%), and myelin protein disorders (3.6%; PMLD-3.6%) were the most commonly diagnosed disorders. Thirty-seven percent of cases had a pathogenic variant in nine genes (ARSA, HEXA, ASPA, MLC1, GALC, GJC2, ABCD1, L2HGDH, GCDH).

PURPOSE: To describe the characteristics of Ashkenazi Jewish carrier testing panels offered by US Laboratories, including what diseases are included, the labels used to describe the panels, and the prices of individual tests compared to the prices of panels for each laboratory. METHODS: GeneTests (http://www.genetests.org) was searched for laboratories that offered Tay-Sachs disease testing. Information was obtained from laboratory web sites, printed brochures, and telephone calls about tests/panels. RESULTS: Twenty-seven laboratories offered up to 10 tests. The tests included two diseases associated with death in childhood (Niemann-Pick type A and Tay-Sachs disease), five with moderate disability and a variably shortened life span (Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia, and mucolipidosis type IV), and two diseases that are not necessarily disabling or routinely shorten the lifespan (Gaucher disease type I and DFNB1 sensorineural hearing loss). Twenty laboratories offered a total of 27 panels of tests for three to nine diseases, ranging in price from $200 to $2082. Of these, 15 panels cost less than tests ordered individually.

                    "text": "Carrier testing for autosomal-recessive disorders. The aim of carrier testing is to identify carrier couples at risk of having offspring with a serious genetic (autosomal recessive) disorder. Carrier couples are offered genetic consultation where their reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis, are explained. The Ashkenazi Jewish population is at increased risk for several recessively inherited disorders (Tay-Sachs disease, Cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Gaucher disease, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, and Bloom syndrome). Unlike Tay-Sachs disease, there is no simple biochemical or enzymatic test to detect carriers for these other disorders. However, with the rapid identification of disease-causing genes in recent years, DNA-based assays are increasingly available for carrier detection. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries a mutation affecting the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Among the most common of these disorders are the thalassemias. The global birth rate of affected infants is at least 2 per 1000 (in unscreened populations), with the greatest incidence in Southeast Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Carriers are detected by evaluation of red cell indices and morphology, followed by more sophisticated hematological testing and molecular analyses. The following issues need to be considered in the development of a carrier screening program: (1) test selection based on disease severity and test accuracy; (2) funding for testing and genetic counselling; (3) definition of the target population to be screened; (4) development of a public and professional education program; (5) informed consent for screening; and (6) awareness of community needs.",

                    "text": "Canavan disease: a monogenic trait with complex genomic interaction. Canavan disease (CD) is an inherited leukodystrophy, caused by aspartoacylase (ASPA) deficiency, and accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. The gene for ASPA has been cloned and more than 40 mutations have been described, with two founder mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Screening of Ashkenazi Jews for these two common mutations revealed a high carrier frequency, approximately 1/40, so that programs for carrier testing are currently in practice. The enzyme deficiency in CD interferes with the normal hydrolysis of NAA, which results in disruption of myelin and spongy degeneration of the white matter of the brain. The clinical features of the disease are macrocephaly, head lag, progressive severe mental retardation, and hypotonia in early life, which later changes to spasticity. A knockout mouse for CD has been generated, and used to study the pathophysiological basis for CD. Findings from the knockout mouse indicate that this monogenic trait leads to a series of genomic interaction in the brain. Changes include low levels of glutamate and GABA. Microarray expression analysis showed low level of expression of GABA-A receptor (GABRA6) and glutamate transporter (EAAT4). The gene Spi2, a gene involved in apoptosis and cell death, showed high level of expression. Such complexity of gene interaction results in the phenotype, the proteome, with spongy degeneration of the brain and neurological impairment of the mouse, similar to the human counterpart. Aspartoacylase gene transfer trial in the mouse brain using adenoassociated virus (AAV) as a vector are encouraging showing improved myelination and decrease in spongy degeneration in the area of the injection and also beyond that site.",

                    "text": "Carrier frequency of autosomal-recessive disorders in the Ashkenazi Jewish population: should the rationale for mutation choice for screening be reevaluated? BACKGROUND: Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population is at increased risk for several recessive inherited diseases. Therefore, carrier testing of AJ members is important in order to identify couples at risk of having offspring with an autosomal recessive disorder. METHODS: In the present study, a database containing the results of 28 410 genotyping assays was screened. Ten thousand seventy eight nonselected healthy members of the AJ population were tested for carrier status for the following diseases; Gaucher disease (GD), cystic fibrosis (CF), Familial dysautonomia (FD), Alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT), Mucolipidosis type 4 (ML4), Fanconi anemia type C (FAC), Canavan disease (CD), Neimann-Pick type 4 (NP) and Bloom syndrome (BLM). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 635 members were carriers of one mutation and 30 members were found to be carriers of two mutations in the different genes related to the development of the above mentioned diseases. GD was found to have the highest carrier frequency (1:17) followed by CF (1:23), FD (1:29), A1AT (1:65), ML4 (1:67) and FAC (1:77). The carrier frequency of CD, NP and BLM was 1:82, 1:103 and 1:157, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the disease-causing mutations screened routinely among the AJ population indicated that there are rare mutations with very low frequencies. The screening policy of the disease-causing mutations should be reevaluated and mutations with a high frequency should be screened, while rare mutations with a lower frequency may be tested in partners of carriers.",

                    "text": "NGS-based expanded carrier screening for genetic disorders in North Indian population reveals unexpected results - a pilot study. BACKGROUND: To determine the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of common genetic disorders in the north Indian population by using next generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: After pre-test counselling, 200 unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened for pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were classified as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were subjected to thorough literature-based curation in addition to the regular filters. Variants of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals were counselled explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening was advised when necessary. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 52 (26%) were found to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were identified to be carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier frequency of one in 17 for one of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2, TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order). Nine individuals were observed to be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency of one in 22. Three individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers for the same disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many disorders (such as deafness, cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were different from those commonly observed in the West. CONCLUSION: A higher carrier frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was unexpected, and contrary to the generally held view about their prevalence in Asian Indians. In spite of the small sample size, this study would suggest that population-based carrier screening panels for India would differ from those in the West, and need to be selected with due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding exons with its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes will detect carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the burden of genetic disorders in India and other resource poor countries.",

Background: Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in ASPA, a gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase. Patients present with macrocephaly, developmental delay, hypotonia, vision impairment and accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid. Progressive white matter changes occur in the central nervous system. The disorder is often fatal in early childhood, but milder forms exist. Materials and methods: Case report. Results: We present the case of a 31-year-old male with mild/juvenile Canavan disease who had severe vision loss due to a retinal degeneration resembling retinitis pigmentosa. Prior to this case, vision loss in Canavan disease had been attributed to optic atrophy based on fundoscopic evidence of optic nerve pallor. Investigations for an alternative cause for our patient's retinal degeneration were non-revealing. Conclusion: We wonder if retinal degeneration may not have been previously recognized as a feature of Canavan disease. We highlight findings from animal models of Canavan disease to further support the association between Canavan disease and retinal degeneration.",

Leukodystrophies are a group of disorders characterized by myelin dysfunction, either at the level of myelin formation or maintenance, that affect the central nervous system (CNS) and also in some cases, to a lesser extent, the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Although these genetic-based  disorders are generally rare, all together they have a significant impact in the society, with an estimated overall incidence of 1 in 7,663 live births. Currently, there is no cure for leukodystrophies, and the development of effective treatments remains challenging. Not only leukodystrophies  generally progress very fast, but also most are multifocal needing the simultaneous targeting at multiple sites. Moreover, as the CNS is affected, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the efficacy of treatment. Recently, interest on cell therapy has increased, and the leukodystrophies  for which metabolic correction is needed have become first-choice candidates for cell-based clinical trials. In this review, we present and discuss the available cell transplantation therapies in metabolic leukodystrophies including fucosidosis, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic  leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, and Krabbe's disease. We will discuss the latest advances of cell therapy and its pitfalls in this group of disorders, taking into account, among others, the limitations imposed by reduced cell migration in multifocal conditions, the need to achieve corrective  enzyme threshold levels, and the growing awareness that not only myelin but also the associated axonopathy needs to be targeted in some leukodystrophies.",

The primary purpose of this work was to assess long-term in vitro reproducibility of metabolite levels measured using 1H MRS (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy). The secondary purpose was to use the in vitro results for interpretation of 1H MRS in vivo spectra acquired from patients diagnosed with Canavan disease. 1H MRS measurements were performed in the period from April 2006 to September 2010. 118 short and 116 long echo spectra were acquired from a stable phantom during this period. Change-point analysis of the in vitro N-acetylaspartate levels was exploited in the computation of fT factor (ratio of the actual to the reference N-acetylaspartate level normalized by the reciprocity principle). This coefficient was utilized in the interpretation of in vivo spectra analyzed using absolute reference technique. The monitored time period was divided into six time intervals based on short echo in vitro data (seven time intervals based on long echo in vitro data) characterized by fT coefficient ranging from 0.97 to 1.09 (based on short echo data) and from 1.0 to 1.11 (based on long echo data). Application of this coefficient to interpretation of in vivo spectra confirmed increased N-acetylaspartate level in Canavan disease. Long-term monitoring of an MRS system reproducibility, allowing for absolute referencing of metabolite levels, facilitates interpretation of metabolic changes in white matter disorders.",

OBJECTIVES: To set up a novel simple, sensitive, and reliable ion-pairing HPLC method for the synchronous separation of several purines, pyrimidines, N-acetylated amino acids, and dicarboxylic acids for the chemical diagnosis and screening of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). DESIGN AND METHODS: The separation was set up using a Hypersil C-18, 5-microm particle size, 250 x 4.6 mm column, and a step gradient using two buffers and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as the pairing reagent. A highly sensitive diode array UV detector was set up at a wavelength between 200 and 300 nm that revealed purines and pyrimidines at 260 nm and other compounds at 206 nm. RESULTS: Compounds were determined in the plasma of 15 healthy adults, in the urine of 50 healthy subjects (1-3 years, 4-6 years, 8-10 years, 12-18 years, 25-35 years), and in 10 non-pathological amniotic fluid samples. To assess the validity of the chemical diagnosis of IEM, plasma and urine samples were analyzed in patients affected by Canavan disease (n = 10; mean age 4.6 +/- 2.3). Low plasma levels of N-acetylaspartate (16.96 +/- 19.57 micromol/L plasma; not detectable in healthy adults) and dramatically high urinary N-acetylaspartate concentrations (1872.03 +/- 631.86 micromol/mmol creatinine; 450 times higher than that which was observed in age-matched controls) were recorded. Neither N-acetylglutamate nor N-acetylaspartylglutamate could be detected in the plasma or urine of controls or patients with Canavan disease.

It involves a simplified urease pretreatment for sample preparation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (EI, scanning mode) with or without stable isotope dilution. Significant improvements in the recovery of NAA and the GC-MS data-handling device made the assay without stable isotope dilution sensitive and quantitative enough to diagnose CD: Its coefficient of variation (CV) was below 12%. The CV obtained with stable isotope dilution was below 9%. One patient with CD had an abnormal NAA level that was more than 6 S.D. above the mean of the age-matched controls. This diagnostic procedure is accurate for screening and for the chemical diagnosis of CD, with a good cost:benefit ratio. The urinary NAA levels of the healthy controls decreased significantly with age. This change should be considered in making a chemical diagnosis of this disease.",

Cancer is associated with epigenetic (i.e., histone hypoacetylation) and metabolic (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) alterations. Levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of acetate in the brain, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis to generate acetate, are reduced in glioma; yet, few studies have investigated acetate as a potential therapeutic agent. This preclinical study sought to test the efficacy of the food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) as a novel therapy to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of GTA, compared to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA), were assessed in established human glioma cell lines (HOG and Hs683 oligodendroglioma, U87 and U251 glioblastoma) and primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), relative to an oligodendrocyte progenitor line (Oli-Neu), normal astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. GTA was also tested as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant with temozolomide (TMZ) in orthotopically grafted GSCs. GTA-induced cytostatic growth arrest in vitro comparable to Vorinostat, but, unlike Vorinostat, GTA did not alter astrocyte growth and promoted NSC expansion. GTA alone increased survival of mice engrafted with glioblastoma GSCs and potentiated TMZ to extend survival longer than TMZ alone. GTA was most effective on GSCs with a mesenchymal cell phenotype. Given that GTA has been chronically administered safely to infants with Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation, GTA-mediated acetate supplementation may provide a novel, safe chemotherapeutic adjuvant to reduce the growth of glioma tumors, most notably the more rapidly proliferating, glycolytic and hypoacetylated mesenchymal glioma tumors.",

Cancer is associated with epigenetic (i.e., histone hypoacetylation) and metabolic (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) alterations. Levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of acetate in the brain, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis to generate acetate, are reduced in glioma; yet, few studies have investigated acetate as a potential therapeutic agent. This preclinical study sought to test the efficacy of the food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) as a novel therapy to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of GTA, compared to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA), were assessed in established human glioma cell lines (HOG and Hs683 oligodendroglioma, U87 and U251 glioblastoma) and primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), relative to an oligodendrocyte progenitor line (Oli-Neu), normal astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro.

The past few years have witnessed rapid developments in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders. Here, we provide pediatric neurologists with an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of these developments and note emerging trends for future research. This review presents the different types of viral vectors used in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the fundamental properties of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the challenges associated with the use of this therapy in the central nervous system; the pathway for therapy development, from translational basic science studies to clinical trials; and an overview of the therapies that have reached clinical trials in patients. Current viral platforms under investigation include adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, lentiviral/retroviral vectors, and herpes simplex virus type 1 vectors. This review also presents an in-depth analysis of numerous studies that investigated these viral platforms in cultured cells and in transgenic animal models for pediatric neurogenetic disorders. Viral vectors have been applied to clinical trials for many different pediatric neurogenetic disorders, including Canavan disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis III, spinal muscular atrophy, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Of these diseases, only spinal muscular atrophy has a viral-mediated gene replacement therapy approved for marketing. Despite significant progress in therapy development, many challenges remain. Surmounting these challenges is critical to advancing the current status of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders.",

The primary purpose of this work was to assess long-term in vitro reproducibility of metabolite levels measured using 1H MRS (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy). The secondary purpose was to use the in vitro results for interpretation of 1H MRS in vivo spectra acquired from patients diagnosed with Canavan disease. 1H MRS measurements were performed in the period from April 2006 to September 2010. 118 short and 116 long echo spectra were acquired from a stable phantom during this period. Change-point analysis of the in vitro N-acetylaspartate levels was exploited in the computation of fT factor (ratio of the actual to the reference N-acetylaspartate level normalized by the reciprocity principle). This coefficient was utilized in the interpretation of in vivo spectra analyzed using absolute reference technique. The monitored time period was divided into six time intervals based on short echo in vitro data (seven time intervals based on long echo in vitro data) characterized by fT coefficient ranging from 0.97 to 1.09 (based on short echo data) and from 1.0 to 1.11 (based on long echo data). Application of this coefficient to interpretation of in vivo spectra confirmed increased N-acetylaspartate level in Canavan disease. Long-term monitoring of an MRS system reproducibility, allowing for absolute referencing of metabolite levels, facilitates interpretation of metabolic changes in white matter disorders.",

Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed. The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital. Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation, a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis.",

The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient suspected for Canavan disease. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out for the proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of the proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal signals in large brain areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1 and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her mother and father. Her phenotypically normal brother has carried a heterozygous c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis by CVS indicated that the fetus was a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant. CONCLUSION: WES can facilitate the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for those lacking specific phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.",

Cancer is associated with epigenetic (i.e., histone hypoacetylation) and metabolic (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) alterations. Levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of acetate in the brain, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis to generate acetate, are reduced in glioma; yet, few studies have investigated acetate as a potential therapeutic agent. This preclinical study sought to test the efficacy of the food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) as a novel therapy to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of GTA, compared to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA), were assessed in established human glioma cell lines (HOG and Hs683 oligodendroglioma, U87 and U251 glioblastoma) and primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), relative to an oligodendrocyte progenitor line (Oli-Neu), normal astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. GTA was also tested as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant with temozolomide (TMZ) in orthotopically grafted GSCs. GTA-induced cytostatic growth arrest in vitro comparable to Vorinostat, but, unlike Vorinostat, GTA did not alter astrocyte growth and promoted NSC expansion. GTA alone increased survival of mice engrafted with glioblastoma GSCs and potentiated TMZ to extend survival longer than TMZ alone. GTA was most effective on GSCs with a mesenchymal cell phenotype. Given that GTA has been chronically administered safely to infants with Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation, GTA-mediated acetate supplementation may provide a novel, safe chemotherapeutic adjuvant to reduce the growth of glioma tumors, most notably the more rapidly proliferating, glycolytic and hypoacetylated mesenchymal glioma tumors.",

CD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the ASPA enzyme. It has been reported with high frequency in patients with Jewish ancestry, and with low frequency in non-Jewish patients. This review will shed light on some updates regarding CD prevalence and causative mutations across the Arab World. CD was reported in several Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Kuwait, and Tunisia. The population with the highest risk is in Saudi Arabia due the prevalent consanguineous marriage culture. In several studies, four novel mutations were found among Arabian CD patients, including two missense mutations (p.C152R, p.C152W), a 3346bp deletion leading to the removal of exon 3 of the ASPA gene, and an insertion mutation (698insC). Other previously reported mutations, which led to damage in the ASPA enzyme activities found among CD Arab patients are c.530 T>C (p.I177T), c.79G>A (p.G27R), IVS4+1G>T, and a 92kb deletion, which is 7.16kb upstream from the ASPA start site. This review will help in developing customized molecular diagnostic approaches and promoting CD carrier screening in the Arab world in areas where consanguineous marriage is common particularly within Saudi Arabia.",

Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive progressive neurodegenerative disorder prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. The carrier rate for the most common mutations that cause CD in the AJ population is often quoted as 1:37-1:40. This is not supported by our finding of only two diagnosed cases of CD in the last 20 years in the Toronto AJ population of 160,000 and an estimated birth rate of 1,500-2,000 per year. Therefore, we embarked on a prevalence cross-sectional screening study to determine the carrier rate of CD in this population. In order to perform low-cost, high-throughput population testing for CD using molecular techniques, we first developed a novel molecular assay using multiplex fluorescent allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test for the three most common mutations causing CD in the AJ population (A854C, C693A, C914A) and a neutral polymorphism at the site of the C693A mutation. During testing it was noted that individuals who were carriers of the A854C mutation also had a T polymorphism at the site of the C693A mutation (Y231X). We confirmed that in all A854C carriers the 854C mutation was in disequilibrium with the 693T polymorphism, indicating a founder chromosome for the A854C mutation in the AJ population. Twenty-five carriers were found from 1,423 samples yielding a carrier rate of 1:57, differing from the widely quoted frequency of 1:40 and supporting our observed frequency of disease.",

Many recessive genetic disorders are found at a higher incidence in people of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent than in the general population. The American College of Medical Genetics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended that individuals of AJ descent undergo carrier screening for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher disease. Although these recommendations have led to increased test volumes and number of laboratories offering AJ screening, well-characterized genomic reference materials are not publicly available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-based Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program, in collaboration with members of the genetic testing community and Coriell Cell Repositories, have developed a panel of characterized genomic reference materials for AJ genetic testing. DNA from 31 cell lines, representing many of the common alleles for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher disease, and glycogen storage disease, was prepared by the Repository and tested in six clinical laboratories using three different PCR-based assay platforms. A total of 33 disease alleles was assayed and 25 different alleles were identified. These characterized materials are publicly available from Coriell and may be used for quality control, proficiency testing, test development, and research.",

PURPOSE: To establish quantitative standards for age-related changes in diffusion restriction of cerebral white matter in healthy children and to compare data with results in children with white matter diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed in 44 children (age range, 7 days to 7.5 years) without brain abnormalities and in 13 children with proved leukodystrophy. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and apparent anisotropy (AA) were measured in 11 regions of interest within white matter. Age-related changes were analyzed with regression analysis. RESULTS: During normal brain myelination, ADCs in different anatomic regions were high at birth (range, 1.04 x 10(-9) m(2)/sec +/- 0.05 [SD] to 1.64 x 10(-9) m(2)/sec +/- 0.09) and low after brain maturation (range, 0.75 x 10(-9) m(2)/sec +/- 0.02 to 0.92 x 10(-9) m(2)/sec +/- 0.02). AA was low at birth (range, 0.05 +/- 0.01 to 0.52 +/- 0.04) and high after brain maturation (range, 0.25 +/- 0.02 to 0.85 +/- 0.03). Age relationship could be expressed with monoexponential functions for all anatomic regions. Anisotropy preceded the myelination-related changes at MR imaging. ADC and AA in four children with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease were identical with results in healthy newborn children and showed no age dependency. In peroxisomal disorders, Krabbe disease, and mitochondriopathy, demyelination on T1- and T2-weighted MR images led to expected findings at diffusion-weighted MR imaging, with high ADC and low AA, whereas in Canavan disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy, the opposite findings were revealed, with low ADC within the demyelinated white matter. CONCLUSION: During early brain myelination, diffusion restriction in normal white matter increases. Anisotropy precedes myelination changes that are visible at MR imaging.

Leukodystrophies are genetically determined metabolic diseases, in which the underlying biochemical abnormality interferes with the normal build-up and/or maintenance of myelin, which leads to hypo- (or arrested) myelination, or dysmyelination with resultant demyelination. Although conventional magnetic resonance imaging has significantly contributed to recent progress in the diagnostic work-up of these diseases, diffusion-weighted imaging has the potential to further improve our understanding of underlying pathological processes and their dynamics through the assessment of normal and abnormal diffusion properties of cerebral white matter. Evaluation of conventional diffusion-weighted and ADC map images allows the detection of major diffusion abnormalities and the identification of various edema types, of which the so-called myelin edema is particularly relevant to leukodystrophies. Depending on the nature of histopathological changes, stage and progression gradient of diseases, various diffusion-weighted imaging patterns may be seen in leukodystrophies. Absent or low-grade myelin edema is found in mucopolysaccharidoses, GM gangliosidoses, Zellweger disease, adrenomyeloneuropathy, L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, classical phenylketonuria, Van der Knaap disease and the vanishing white matter, medium grade myelin edema in metachromatic leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and HMG coenzyme lyase deficiency and high grade edema in Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, hyperhomocystinemias, maple syrup urine disease and leukodystrophy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and high lactate.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate parenchymal diffusion properties and metabolite ratios in affected brain tissues of inherited neurometabolic brain diseases with an overview of the current literature about the diagnostic data of both techniques in childhood inherited metabolic brain diseases. The study group was consisting, 19 patients (15 males, 4 females; mean age, 54 months (4.5 years); age range, 1-171 months (14.25 years)) diagnosed with inherited neurometabolic brain disease. Single- and multivoxel proton MRS was carried out and NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, mI/Cr, Glx/Cr ratios were calculated. Presence of lactate peak and abnormal different peaks were noted. ADC values were calculated from brain lesions. Results are compared with age and sex matched normal subjects. Elevated NAA/Cr ratio (Canavan disease), galactitol peak (galactosemia) at 3.7 ppm, branched chain amino acids (Maple syrup urine disease-MSUD) at 0.9 ppm were seen on different diseases. In Leigh disease and MSUD restricted diffusion was detected. Different diffusion properties were seen only in one Glutaric aciduria lesions. NAA/Cr ratios and calculated ADC values were significantly different from normal subjects (p<0.05). DWI combined with MRS are complementary methods to routine cranial MRI for evaluating neurometabolic diseases which can give detailed information about neurochemistry of affected brain areas.",

As treatment options continue to advance for leukodystrophies, so will candidacy for inclusion in the United States' newborn Recommended Universal Screening Panel as was achieved for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.",

                    "text": "Joint SOGC-CCMG Opinion for Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening: An Update for All Canadian Providers of Maternity and Reproductive Healthcare in the Era of Direct-to-Consumer Testing. OBJECTIVE: This guideline was written to update Canadian maternity care and reproductive healthcare providers on pre- and postconceptional reproductive carrier screening for women or couples who may be at risk of being carriers for autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD), or X-linked (XL) conditions, with risk of transmission to the fetus. Four previous SOGC- Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) guidelines are updated and merged into the current document. INTENDED USERS: All maternity care (most responsible health provider [MRHP]) and paediatric providers; maternity nursing; nurse practitioner; provincial maternity care administrator; medical student; and postgraduate resident year 1-7. TARGET POPULATION: Fertile, sexually active females and their fertile, sexually active male partners who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant (preferably in the first trimester of pregnancy, but any gestational age is acceptable). OPTIONS: Women and their partners will be able to obtain appropriate genetic carrier screening information and possible diagnosis of AR, AD, or XL disorders (preferably pre-conception), thereby allowing an informed choice regarding genetic carrier screening and reproductive options (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, egg or sperm donation, or adoption). OUTCOMES: Informed reproductive decisions related to genetic carrier screening and reproductive outcomes based on family history, ethnic background, past obstetrical history, known carrier status, or genetic diagnosis. SOGC REPRODUCTIVE CARRIER SCREENING SUMMARY STATEMENT (2016): Pre-conception or prenatal education and counselling for reproductive carrier screening requires a discussion about testing within the three perinatal genetic carrier screening/diagnosis time periods, which include pre-conception, prenatal, and neonatal for conditions currently being screened for and diagnosed. This new information should be added to the standard reproductive carrier screening protocols that are already being utilized by the most responsible maternity provider through the informed consent process with the patient. (III-A; GRADE low/moderate) SOGC OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS QUALITY AND GRADE: There was a strong observational/expert opinion (quality and grade) for the genetic carrier literature with randomized controlled trial evidence being available only for the invasive testing. Both the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care quality and classification and the GRADE evidence quality and grade are provided. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE; PubMed; government neonatal screening websites; key words/common reproductive genetic carrier screened diseases/previous SOGC Guidelines/medical academic societies (Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine [SMFM]; American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG]; CCMG; Royal College Obstetrics and Gynaecology [RCOG] [UK]; American Society of Human Genetics [ASHG]; International Society of Prenatal Diagnosis [ISPD])/provincial neonatal screening policies and programs; search terms (carrier screening, prenatal screening, neonatal genetic/metabolic screening, cystic fibrosis (CF), thalassemia, hemoglobinopathy, hemophilia, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), spinal muscular atrophy, Ashkenazi Jewish carrier screening, genetic carrier screening protocols, AR, AD, XL). SEARCH PERIOD: 10 years (June 2005-September 2015); initial search dates June 30, 2015 and September 15, 2015; completed final search January 4, 2016. Validation of articles was completed by primary authors RD Wilson and I De Bie. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COST: Benefits are to provide an evidenced based reproductive genetic carrier screening update consensus based on international opinions and publications for the use of Canadian women, who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant and have been identified to be at risk (personal or male partner family or reproductive history) for the transmission of a clinically significant genetic condition to their offspring with associated morbidity and/or mortality. Harm may arise from having counselling and informed testing of the carrier status of the mother, their partner, or their fetus, as well as from declining to have this counselling and informed testing or from not having the opportunity for counselling and informed testing. Costs will ensue both from the provision of opportunities for counselling and testing, as well as when no such opportunities are offered or are declined and the birth of a child with a significant inherited condition and resulting morbidity/mortality occurs; these comprise not only the health care costs to the system but also the social/financial/psychological/emotional costs to the family. These recommendations are based on expert opinion and have not been subjected to a health economics assessment and local or provincial implementation will be required. GUIDELINE UPDATE: This guideline is an update of four previous joint SOGC-CCMG Genetic Screening Guidelines dated 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2008 developed by the SOGC Genetic Committee in collaboration with the CCMG Prenatal Diagnosis Committee (now Clinical Practice Committee). 2016 CARRIER SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS.",

The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by a deficiency of aspartoacylase. The disease has a severe course, with death occurring in the first few years of life. Atypical patients with mild courses have been reported, but acute presentations similar to stroke have not been well described. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We present a boy who presented at 4 months of age with seizures after an episode of cardiopulmonary arrest is discussed. RESULTS: He was initially thought to have an ischemic watershed stroke based on his initial clinical presentation and magnetic resonance imaging. However, biochemical and follow-up radiologic evaluation were consistent with mild Canavan disease. DNA sequencing of the ASPA gene indicated one known mutation (A305E) and a novel mutation, L30V. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal the atrophy which would have been expected with watershed ischemia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated elevated N-acetyl aspartate to creatinine and N-acetyl aspartate to choline ratios. At 4 years of age, he was normocephalic, with mild clumsiness, speech delay, and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This child's unusual acute presentation, along with his prolonged mild course, raises questions about the relationship between biochemical signs of abnormal aspartoacylase function and clinical findings. This patient highlights the need for long-term clinical follow-up of children with mild Canavan disease to clarify the significance of these biochemical abnormalities.",

                    "text": "Impact of gene patents and licensing practices on access to genetic testing and carrier screening for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease. Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed. The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital. Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation, a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis.",

Detection of gene expression in different types of brain cells e.g., neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursors and microglia, can be hampered by the lack of specific primary or secondary antibodies for immunostaining. Here we describe a protocol to detect the expression of three different genes in the same brain section using double fluorescence in situ hybridization with two gene-specific probes followed by immunostaining with an antibody of high specificity directed against the protein encoded by a third gene. The Aspartoacyclase (ASPA) gene, mutations of which can lead to a rare human white matter disease - Canavan disease - is thought to be expressed in oligodendrocytes and microglia but not in astrocytes and neurons. However, the precise expression pattern of ASPA in the brain has yet to be established. This protocol has allowed us to determine that ASPA is expressed in a subset of mature oligodendrocytes and it can be generally applied to a wide range of gene expression pattern studies. ",

PURPOSE: To evaluate metabolic and toxic brain disorders that manifest with restricted, elevated, or both restricted and elevated diffusion patterns on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Echo-planar diffusion MRI examinations were obtained in 34 pediatric patients with metabolic and toxic brain disorders proved by appropriate laboratory studies. The MRI unit operated at 1.5 T with a gradient strength of 30 mT/ meter, and a rise time of 600 micros. b=1000s/mm2 images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps with ADC values were studied. RESULTS: Three patterns were observed: 1. A restricted diffusion pattern (high signal on b = 1000 s/mm2 images and low ADC values); 2. an elevated diffusion pattern (normal signal on b = 1000s/mm2 images and high ADC values); and 3. a mixed pattern (coexistent restricted and increased diffusion patterns in the same patient). Disorders manifesting with a restricted diffusion pattern included metachromatic leukodystrophy (n = 2), phenylketonuria (n = 3), maple syrup urine disease (intermediate form) (n = 1), infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (n = 1), Leigh (n = 2), Wilson (n = 3), and Canavan disease (n = 1). Disorders with an elevated diffusion pattern included phenylketonuria (n = 1), adrenoleukodystrophy (n = 1), merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (n = 2), mucopolysaccharidosis (n = 2), Lowe syndrome (n = 1), Leigh (n = 2), Alexander (n = 1), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher (n = 1), and Wilson (n = 3) disease. Disorders with a mixed pattern included L-2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria (n = 2), non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (n = 1), infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (n =2), maple syrup urine disease (n = 1), and Leigh (n = 1) disease. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that the three different diffusion patterns reflect the histopathological changes associated with the disorders and different stages of a particular disorder. It is likely that the restricted diffusion pattern corresponds to abnormalities related to myelin, and the elevated diffusion pattern to disintegration of the tissue. The mixed pattern has contributions from both myelin abnormalities related to myelin disintegration of the tissue.",

                    "text": "Knock-out mouse for Canavan disease: a model for gene transfer to the central nervous system. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed. The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital. Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation, a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis.",

Canavan disease is a fatal neurological disease without any effective treatments to slow the relentless progress of this disorder. Enzyme replacement therapy has been used effectively to treat a number of metabolic disorders, but the presence of the blood-brain-barrier presents an additional challenge in the treatment of neurological disorders. Studies have begun with the aim of establishing a treatment protocol that can effectively replace the defective enzyme in Canavan disease patients. The human enzyme, aspartoacylase, has been cloned, expressed and purified, and the surface lysyl groups modified through PEGylation. Fully active modified enzymes were administered to mice that are defective in this enzyme and that show many of the symptoms of Canavan disease. Statistically significant increases in brain enzyme activity levels have been achieved in this animal model, as well as decreases in the elevated substrate levels that mimic those found in Canavan disease patients. These results demonstrate that the modified enzyme is gaining access to the brain and functions to correct this metabolic defect. The stage is now set for a long term study to optimize this enzyme replacement approach for the development of a treatment protocol.",

Canavan disease is a fatal neurological disorder caused by defects in the gene that produces the enzyme aspartoacylase. Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase.

Canavan disease (CD) is a fatal dysmyelinating genetic disorder associated with aspartoacylase deficiency, resulting in decreased brain acetate levels and reduced myelin lipid synthesis in the developing brain. Here we tested tolerability of a potent acetate precursor, glyceryl triacetate (GTA), at low doses in two infants diagnosed with CD, aged 8 and 13 months. Much higher doses of GTA were evaluated for toxicity in the tremor rat model of CD. GTA was given orally to the infants for up to 4.5 and 6 months, starting at 25 mg/kg twice daily, doubling the dose weekly until a maximum of 250 mg/kg reached. Wild-type and tremor rat pups were given GTA orally twice daily, initially at a dose of 4.2 g/kg from postnatal days 7 through 14, and at 5.8 g/kg from day 15 through 23, and thereafter in food (7.5%) and water (5%). At the end of the trial (approximately 90 to 120 days) sera and tissues from rats were analysed for changes in blood chemistry and histopathology. GTA treatment caused no detectable toxicity and the patients showed no deterioration in clinical status. In the high-dose animal studies, no significant differences in the mean blood chemistry values occurred between treated and untreated groups, and no lesions indicating toxicity were detectable in any of the tissues examined. Lack of GTA toxicity in two CD patients in low-dose trials, as well as in high-dose animal studies, suggests that higher, effective dose studies in human CD patients are warranted.",

Leukodystrophies are genetically determined metabolic diseases, in which the underlying biochemical abnormality interferes with the normal build-up and/or maintenance of myelin, which leads to hypo- (or arrested) myelination, or dysmyelination with resultant demyelination. Although conventional magnetic resonance imaging has significantly contributed to recent progress in the diagnostic work-up of these diseases, diffusion-weighted imaging has the potential to further improve our understanding of underlying pathological processes and their dynamics through the assessment of normal and abnormal diffusion properties of cerebral white matter. Evaluation of conventional diffusion-weighted and ADC map images allows the detection of major diffusion abnormalities and the identification of various edema types, of which the so-called myelin edema is particularly relevant to leukodystrophies. Depending on the nature of histopathological changes, stage and progression gradient of diseases, various diffusion-weighted imaging patterns may be seen in leukodystrophies.

The aim of carrier testing is to identify carrier couples at risk of having offspring with a serious genetic (autosomal recessive) disorder. Carrier couples are offered genetic consultation where their reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis, are explained. The Ashkenazi Jewish population is at increased risk for several recessively inherited disorders (Tay-Sachs disease, Cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Gaucher disease, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, and Bloom syndrome). Unlike Tay-Sachs disease, there is no simple biochemical or enzymatic test to detect carriers for these other disorders. However, with the rapid identification of disease-causing genes in recent years, DNA-based assays are increasingly available for carrier detection. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries a mutation affecting the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Among the most common of these disorders are the thalassemias. The global birth rate of affected infants is at least 2 per 1000 (in unscreened populations), with the greatest incidence in Southeast Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Carriers are detected by evaluation of red cell indices and morphology, followed by more sophisticated hematological testing and molecular analyses. The following issues need to be considered in the development of a carrier screening program: (1) test selection based on disease severity and test accuracy; (2) funding for testing and genetic counselling; (3) definition of the target population to be screened; (4) development of a public and professional education program; (5) informed consent for screening; and (6) awareness of community needs.",

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

Significant improvements in the recovery of NAA and the GC-MS data-handling device made the assay without stable isotope dilution sensitive and quantitative enough to diagnose CD: Its coefficient of variation (CV) was below 12%. The CV obtained with stable isotope dilution was below 9%. One patient with CD had an abnormal NAA level that was more than 6 S.D. above the mean of the age-matched controls.

                    "text": "Immune responses to AAV in a phase I study for Canavan disease. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a rare leukodystrophy with no current treatment. rAAV-ASPA has been developed for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) for Canavan disease. This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.",

CD is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy associated with spongiform degeneration of the brain. At present the disease is uniformly fatal in affected probands. CD is characterized by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, resulting in loss of enzyme activity. In this review, recent evidence is summarized on the etiology and possible treatments for CD.

Canavan disease (CD) is a debilitating and lethal leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene and the resulting defect in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) metabolism in the CNS and peripheral tissues. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and widely transduce the CNS. We developed a rAAV-based and optimized gene replacement therapy, which achieves early, complete, and sustained rescue of the lethal disease phenotype in CD mice. Our treatment results in a super-mouse phenotype, increasing motor performance of treated CD mice beyond that of WT control mice. We demonstrate that this rescue is oligodendrocyte independent, and that gene correction in astrocytes is sufficient, suggesting that the establishment of an astrocyte-based alternative metabolic sink for NAA is a key mechanism for efficacious disease rescue and the super-mouse phenotype. Importantly, the use of clinically translatable high-field imaging tools enables the noninvasive monitoring and prediction of therapeutic outcomes for CD and might enable further investigation of NAA-related cognitive function.",

Canavan disease (CD) is a debilitating and lethal leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene and the resulting defect in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) metabolism in the CNS and peripheral tissues. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and widely transduce the CNS. We developed a rAAV-based and optimized gene replacement therapy, which achieves early, complete, and sustained rescue of the lethal disease phenotype in CD mice. Our treatment results in a super-mouse phenotype, increasing motor performance of treated CD mice beyond that of WT control mice. We demonstrate that this rescue is oligodendrocyte independent, and that gene correction in astrocytes is sufficient, suggesting that the establishment of an astrocyte-based alternative metabolic sink for NAA is a key mechanism for efficacious disease rescue and the super-mouse phenotype. Importantly, the use of clinically translatable high-field imaging tools enables the noninvasive monitoring and prediction of therapeutic outcomes for CD and might enable further investigation of NAA-related cognitive function.",

Metabolic disorders comprise a large group of heterogeneous diseases ranging from very prevalent diseases such as diabetes mellitus to rare genetic disorders like Canavan Disease. Whether either of these diseases is amendable by gene therapy depends to a large degree on the knowledge of their pathomechanism, availability of the therapeutic gene, vector selection, and availability of suitable animal models. In this book chapter, we review three metabolic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS; Canavan Disease, Niemann-Pick disease and Phenylketonuria) to give examples for primary and secondary metabolic disorders of the brain and the attempts that have been made to use adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for treatment. Finally, we highlight commonalities and obstacles in the development of gene therapy for metabolic disorders of the CNS exemplified by those three diseases. ",

The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

Gene therapy approaches for CNS disorders has evolved considerably over the last two decades.

With the ultimate goal of developing safe and effective in vivo gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease and other neurological disorders, we developed a non-viral lipid-entrapped, polycation-condensed delivery system (LPD) for central nervous system gene transfer, in conjunction with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based plasmids containing recombinant aspartoacylase (ASPA). The gene delivery system was tested in healthy rodents and primates, before proceeding to preliminary studies in 2 children with Canavan disease. Toxicity and expression testing was first carried out in human 293 cells, which demonstrated effective transduction of cells and high levels of functional ASPA activity. We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches. Finally, we performed the first in vivo gene transfer study for a human neurodegenerative disease in 2 children with Canavan disease to assess the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ASPA gene delivery. Our results suggest that LPD/pAAVaspa is well tolerated in human subjects and is associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes.",

Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). Deficiency of ASPA leads to elevation of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain and urine. To explore the feasibility of gene transfer to replace ASPA in CD, we generated a knockout mouse and constructed an AAV vector that encodes human ASPA cDNA (hASPA) followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) after an intraribosomal entry site. We injected CD mice with rAAV-hASPA-GFP in the striatum and thalamus or injected rAAV-GFP identically into control animals. Three to five months after the injection, we determined the presence of ASPA in the CD mouse brain by ASPA activity assay, GFP expression, and Western blot analysis. While rAAV-GFP-injected animals displayed undetectable levels of ASPA, all detection methods revealed significant ASPA levels in rAAV-hASPA-GFP-injected CD mice. We evaluated the functional effects of rAAV-hASPA-GFP-mediated ASPA expression by standard histological methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo NAA levels, and magnetic resonance imaging of CD mice. rAAV-hASPA-injected animals displayed a remarkable lack of spongiform degeneration in the thalamus. However, pathology in sites unrelated to the injected areas showed no improvement in histopathology. The improvement in thalamic neuropathology was also detectable via in vivo MRI. MRS revealed that in vivo NAA levels were also reduced. These data indicate that rAAV-mediated ASPA delivery may be an interesting avenue for the treatment of CD.",

Canavan disease (CD) is an inherited leukodystrophy, caused by aspartoacylase (ASPA) deficiency, and accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. The gene for ASPA has been cloned and more than 40 mutations have been described, with two founder mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Screening of Ashkenazi Jews for these two common mutations revealed a high carrier frequency, approximately 1/40, so that programs for carrier testing are currently in practice. The enzyme deficiency in CD interferes with the normal hydrolysis of NAA, which results in disruption of myelin and spongy degeneration of the white matter of the brain. The clinical features of the disease are macrocephaly, head lag, progressive severe mental retardation, and hypotonia in early life, which later changes to spasticity. A knockout mouse for CD has been generated, and used to study the pathophysiological basis for CD. Findings from the knockout mouse indicate that this monogenic trait leads to a series of genomic interaction in the brain. Changes include low levels of glutamate and GABA. Microarray expression analysis showed low level of expression of GABA-A receptor (GABRA6) and glutamate transporter (EAAT4). The gene Spi2, a gene involved in apoptosis and cell death, showed high level of expression. Such complexity of gene interaction results in the phenotype, the proteome, with spongy degeneration of the brain and neurological impairment of the mouse, similar to the human counterpart. Aspartoacylase gene transfer trial in the mouse brain using adenoassociated virus (AAV) as a vector are encouraging showing improved myelination and decrease in spongy degeneration in the area of the injection and also beyond that site.",

Canavan disease is characterised as a rare, neurodegenerative disease that usually causes death in early childhood. It is an autosomal recessive disorder due to an aspartoacylase (ASPA) deficiency. The causative gene has been mapped to chromosome 17 pter-p13. Here we describe three affected children from two Greek families with an unusually mild course of Canavan disease. All children presented with muscular hypotonia and macrocephaly. Diagnosis was based on elevated N-acetylaspartate in urine, reduced aspartoacylase activity in fibroblasts, and marked white matter changes on cerebral imaging. All three affected individuals exhibited continuous psychomotor development without any regression. Genetic analyses revealed compound heterozygous mutations (Y288 C; F295 S) in two individuals. The Y288 C variant was previously described in a child with macrocephaly, mild developmental delay, increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia, partial cortical blindness and retinitis pigmentosa, and slightly elevated N-acetylaspartate in the urine. Demonstration of the same variant in two unusually mildly affected Canavan disease patients and absence of this variant in 154 control chromosomes suggest a possible pathogenic role in mild Canavan disease. In the third individual, two homozygous sequence variants were identified, which comprise the known G274R mutation and a novel K213E variant.",

The aim of carrier testing is to identify carrier couples at risk of having offspring with a serious genetic (autosomal recessive) disorder. Carrier couples are offered genetic consultation where their reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis, are explained. The Ashkenazi Jewish population is at increased risk for several recessively inherited disorders (Tay-Sachs disease, Cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Gaucher disease, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, and Bloom syndrome). Unlike Tay-Sachs disease, there is no simple biochemical or enzymatic test to detect carriers for these other disorders. However, with the rapid identification of disease-causing genes in recent years, DNA-based assays are increasingly available for carrier detection. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries a mutation affecting the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Among the most common of these disorders are the thalassemias. The global birth rate of affected infants is at least 2 per 1000 (in unscreened populations), with the greatest incidence in Southeast Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Carriers are detected by evaluation of red cell indices and morphology, followed by more sophisticated hematological testing and molecular analyses. The following issues need to be considered in the development of a carrier screening program: (1) test selection based on disease severity and test accuracy; (2) funding for testing and genetic counselling; (3) definition of the target population to be screened; (4) development of a public and professional education program; (5) informed consent for screening; and (6) awareness of community needs.",

Many recessive genetic disorders are found at a higher incidence in people of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent than in the general population. The American College of Medical Genetics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended that individuals of AJ descent undergo carrier screening for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher disease. Although these recommendations have led to increased test volumes and number of laboratories offering AJ screening, well-characterized genomic reference materials are not publicly available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-based Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program, in collaboration with members of the genetic testing community and Coriell Cell Repositories, have developed a panel of characterized genomic reference materials for AJ genetic testing. DNA from 31 cell lines, representing many of the common alleles for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher disease, and glycogen storage disease, was prepared by the Repository and tested in six clinical laboratories using three different PCR-based assay platforms. A total of 33 disease alleles was assayed and 25 different alleles were identified. These characterized materials are publicly available from Coriell and may be used for quality control, proficiency testing, test development, and research.",

This study evaluates the genetic spectrum of leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies in Iran. 152 children, aged from 1 day to 15 years, were genetically tested for leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies based on clinical and neuroradiological findings from 2016 to 2019. Patients with a suggestive specific leukodystrophy, e. g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, Tay-Sachs disease were tested for mutations in single genes (108; 71%) while patients with less suggestive findings were evaluated by NGS. 108 of 152(71%) had MRI patterns and clinical findings suggestive of a known leukodystrophy. In total, 114(75%) affected individuals had (likely) pathogenic variants which included 38 novel variants. 35 different types of leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies were identified. The more common identified disorders included metachromatic leukodystrophy (19 of 152; 13%), Canavan disease (12; 8%), Tay-Sachs disease (11; 7%), megalencephalic leukodystrophy with subcortical cysts (7; 5%), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (8; 5%), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1 (8; 5%), Sandhoff disease (6; 4%), Krabbe disease (5; 3%), and vanishing white matter disease (4; 3%). Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed 90% leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies. The total diagnosis rate was 75%. This unique study presents a national genetic data of leukodystrophies; it may provide clues to the genetic pool of neighboring countries. Patients with clinical and neuroradiological evidence of a genetic leukoencephalopathy should undergo a genetic analysis to reach a definitive diagnosis. This will allow a diagnosis at earlier stages of the disease, reduce the burden of uncertainty and costs, and will provide the basis for genetic counseling and family planning.",

Astrocytic dysfunctions have been recently identified in four leukosdystrophies without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Alexander disease, the first primary genetic astrocytic disorder identified, is due to dominant GFAP mutations. The presence of Rosenthal fibers throughout the CNS is the pathological hallmark of this disease. Neurological degradation, megalencephaly, and typical MRI pattern are characteristic of infantile sporadic patients. Nevertheless, clinical and MRI expression is large, including late onset forms which can be familial. Spongiform or cystic white matter CNS degeneration is present in the other three recessive disorders. The visualization of a white matter cystic breakdown on MRI has led to the identification of CACH/VWM and MLC diseases. CACH/VWM is due to mutations in one of the five subunits of EIF2B which compromise the astrocytic lineage. The clinical spectrum is large, from antenatal to adult forms, and several extraneurological organs can be affected. Mutations in MLC1, which is mainly expressed in astrocyte endfeet, produce megalencephaly, whereas the mild clinical course contrasts with severe MRI features. An increased concentration of NAA in the urine is sufficient to diagnose Canavan disease, which is due to mutations of the ASPA gene. These disorders highlight the role of astrocytes in myelination or myelin maintenance.",

Canavan disease (CD), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene. In the present study, the ASPA gene was analyzed in 24 non-Jewish patients with CD from 23 unrelated families. Within this cohort, we found three large novel deletions of approximate 92, 56, and 12.13 kb in length, using both self-ligation of restriction endonuclease-digested DNA fragments with long-distance inverse PCR and multiplex dosage quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA. The 92 kb large deletion results in complete absence of the ASPA gene in one homozygous and one compound heterozygous patient, respectively. The 56 kb large deletion causes absence of the majority of the ASPA gene except for exon 1 alone in a compound heterozygous patient. The 12.13 kb deletion involves deletion of the ASPA gene from intron 3 to intron 5 including exons 4 and 5 (I3 to E4E5I5) in a compound heterozygous patient. Patients with the three large deletions clinically manifested severe symptoms at birth, including seizures. Our study showed that the combined use of long-distance inverse PCR and multiplex dosage quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA is a helpful and rapid technique to search for large deletions, particularly for detection of large deletions in compound heterozygous patients.",

Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed. The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital. Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation, a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis.",

                    "text": "Carrier frequency of autosomal-recessive disorders in the Ashkenazi Jewish population: should the rationale for mutation choice for screening be reevaluated? BACKGROUND: Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population is at increased risk for several recessive inherited diseases. Therefore, carrier testing of AJ members is important in order to identify couples at risk of having offspring with an autosomal recessive disorder. METHODS: In the present study, a database containing the results of 28 410 genotyping assays was screened. Ten thousand seventy eight nonselected healthy members of the AJ population were tested for carrier status for the following diseases; Gaucher disease (GD), cystic fibrosis (CF), Familial dysautonomia (FD), Alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT), Mucolipidosis type 4 (ML4), Fanconi anemia type C (FAC), Canavan disease (CD), Neimann-Pick type 4 (NP) and Bloom syndrome (BLM). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 635 members were carriers of one mutation and 30 members were found to be carriers of two mutations in the different genes related to the development of the above mentioned diseases. GD was found to have the highest carrier frequency (1:17) followed by CF (1:23), FD (1:29), A1AT (1:65), ML4 (1:67) and FAC (1:77). The carrier frequency of CD, NP and BLM was 1:82, 1:103 and 1:157, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the disease-causing mutations screened routinely among the AJ population indicated that there are rare mutations with very low frequencies. The screening policy of the disease-causing mutations should be reevaluated and mutations with a high frequency should be screened, while rare mutations with a lower frequency may be tested in partners of carriers.",

Canavan disease (CD) is a fatal dysmyelinating genetic disorder associated with aspartoacylase deficiency, resulting in decreased brain acetate levels and reduced myelin lipid synthesis in the developing brain. Here we tested tolerability of a potent acetate precursor, glyceryl triacetate (GTA), at low doses in two infants diagnosed with CD, aged 8 and 13 months. Much higher doses of GTA were evaluated for toxicity in the tremor rat model of CD. GTA was given orally to the infants for up to 4.5 and 6 months, starting at 25 mg/kg twice daily, doubling the dose weekly until a maximum of 250 mg/kg reached. Wild-type and tremor rat pups were given GTA orally twice daily, initially at a dose of 4.2 g/kg from postnatal days 7 through 14, and at 5.8 g/kg from day 15 through 23, and thereafter in food (7.5%) and water (5%). At the end of the trial (approximately 90 to 120 days) sera and tissues from rats were analysed for changes in blood chemistry and histopathology. GTA treatment caused no detectable toxicity and the patients showed no deterioration in clinical status. In the high-dose animal studies, no significant differences in the mean blood chemistry values occurred between treated and untreated groups, and no lesions indicating toxicity were detectable in any of the tissues examined. Lack of GTA toxicity in two CD patients in low-dose trials, as well as in high-dose animal studies, suggests that higher, effective dose studies in human CD patients are warranted.",

Cancer is associated with epigenetic (i.e., histone hypoacetylation) and metabolic (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) alterations. Levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of acetate in the brain, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis to generate acetate, are reduced in glioma; yet, few studies have investigated acetate as a potential therapeutic agent. This preclinical study sought to test the efficacy of the food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) as a novel therapy to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of GTA, compared to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA), were assessed in established human glioma cell lines (HOG and Hs683 oligodendroglioma, U87 and U251 glioblastoma) and primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), relative to an oligodendrocyte progenitor line (Oli-Neu), normal astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. GTA was also tested as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant with temozolomide (TMZ) in orthotopically grafted GSCs. GTA-induced cytostatic growth arrest in vitro comparable to Vorinostat, but, unlike Vorinostat, GTA did not alter astrocyte growth and promoted NSC expansion. GTA alone increased survival of mice engrafted with glioblastoma GSCs and potentiated TMZ to extend survival longer than TMZ alone. GTA was most effective on GSCs with a mesenchymal cell phenotype. Given that GTA has been chronically administered safely to infants with Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation, GTA-mediated acetate supplementation may provide a novel, safe chemotherapeutic adjuvant to reduce the growth of glioma tumors, most notably the more rapidly proliferating, glycolytic and hypoacetylated mesenchymal glioma tumors.",

The aim of carrier testing is to identify carrier couples at risk of having offspring with a serious genetic (autosomal recessive) disorder. Carrier couples are offered genetic consultation where their reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis, are explained. The Ashkenazi Jewish population is at increased risk for several recessively inherited disorders (Tay-Sachs disease, Cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Gaucher disease, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, and Bloom syndrome). Unlike Tay-Sachs disease, there is no simple biochemical or enzymatic test to detect carriers for these other disorders. However, with the rapid identification of disease-causing genes in recent years, DNA-based assays are increasingly available for carrier detection. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries a mutation affecting the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Among the most common of these disorders are the thalassemias. The global birth rate of affected infants is at least 2 per 1000 (in unscreened populations), with the greatest incidence in Southeast Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Carriers are detected by evaluation of red cell indices and morphology, followed by more sophisticated hematological testing and molecular analyses. The following issues need to be considered in the development of a carrier screening program: (1) test selection based on disease severity and test accuracy; (2) funding for testing and genetic counselling; (3) definition of the target population to be screened; (4) development of a public and professional education program; (5) informed consent for screening; and (6) awareness of community needs.",

Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by excessive excretion of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in urine. The disease is caused by deficiency of aspartoacylase, the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of NAA into acetate and l-aspartate. Patients, who are often asymptomatic in their early months, show a wide spectrum of clinical presentation thereafter that includes macrocephaly, poor head control, seizures, abnormal muscle tone, optic atrophy, significant developmental delay and death. In this work, we describe a simple liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of NAA in urine. The internal standard d3-NAA was added to untreated urine and the mixture was injected into the LC-MS/MS system operated in the negative ion mode. Detection was achieved in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode by monitoring m/z 174 --> 88, 174 --> 130 and 174 --> 58 for NAA and 177 --> 89 for the internal standard. Separation was carried out on a C8 column (2.1 x 150 mm) using a mixture of acetonitrile and water (1:1 v/v) containing 0.05% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. NAA was eluted at 1.6 min and the run time was approximately 2 min. Using spiked urine, the assay was linear up to 2 mmol/L with limit of quantification at 1 micromol/L (S/N = 12). NAA in patients' urine (n = 17) ranged between 366 and 21,235 mmol/mol creatinine compared to controls of <39 mmol/mol creatinine (n = 159). This LC-MS/MS method for NAA as described involved no extraction and no derivatization, showed no interference, and gave excellent recovery with low variability and short analytical time.",

Leukodystrophies (LDs) are a heterogeneous group of progressive neurological disorders and characterized by primary involvement of white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). This is the first report of the Iranian LD Registry database to describe the clinical, radiological, and genomic data of Persian patients with leukodystrophies. From 2016 to 2019, patients suspicious of LDs were examined followed by a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A single gene testing or whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used depending on the neuroradiologic phenotypes. In a few cases, the diagnosis was made by metabolic studies. Based on the MRI pattern, diagnosed patients were divided into cohorts A (hypomyelinating LDs) versus cohort B (Other LDs). The most recent LD classification was utilized for classification of diagnosed patients. For novel variants, in silico analyses were performed to verify their pathogenicity. Out of 680 registered patients, 342 completed the diagnostic evaluations. In total, 245 patients met a diagnosis which in turn 24.5% were categorized in cohort A and the remaining in cohort B. Genetic tests revealed causal variants in 228 patients consisting of 213 variants in 110 genes with 78 novel variants. WES and single gene testing identified a causal variant in 65.5% and 34.5% cases, respectively. The total diagnostic rate of WES was 60.7%. Lysosomal disorders (27.3%; GM2-gangliosidosis-9.8%, MLD-6.1%, KD-4.5%), amino and organic acid disorders (17.15%; Canavan disease-4.5%, L-2-HGA-3.6%), mitochondrial leukodystrophies (12.6%), ion and water homeostasis disorders (7.3%; MLC-4.5%), peroxisomal disorders (6.5%; X-ALD-3.6%), and myelin protein disorders (3.6%; PMLD-3.6%) were the most commonly diagnosed disorders. Thirty-seven percent of cases had a pathogenic variant in nine genes (ARSA, HEXA, ASPA, MLC1, GALC, GJC2, ABCD1, L2HGDH, GCDH). This study highlights the most common types as well as the genetic heterogeneity of LDs in Iranian children.",

Canavan disease is a genetic disorder associated with optic neuropathy and the metabolism of N-acetylaspartate is defective in this disorder due to mutations in the gene coding for the enzyme aspartoacylase II. Here we show that the plasma membrane transporter NaDC3, a Na+-coupled transporter for dicarboxylates, is able to transport N-acetylaspartate, suggesting that the transporter may function in concert with aspartoacylase II in the metabolism of N-acetylaspartate. Since Canavan disease is associated with ocular complications, we investigated the expression pattern of NaDC3 and aspartoacylase II in ocular tissues in mouse by in situ hybridization. These studies show that NaDC3 mRNA is expressed in the optic nerve, most layers of the retina, retinal pigment epithelium, ciliary body, iris, and lens. Aspartoacylase II mRNA is coexpressed in most of these cell types. We conclude that transport of N-acetylaspartate into ocular tissues via NaDC3 and its subsequent hydrolysis by aspartoacylase II play an essential role in the maintenance of visual function.",

Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.",

                    "text": "Joint SOGC-CCMG Opinion for Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening: An Update for All Canadian Providers of Maternity and Reproductive Healthcare in the Era of Direct-to-Consumer Testing. OBJECTIVE: This guideline was written to update Canadian maternity care and reproductive healthcare providers on pre- and postconceptional reproductive carrier screening for women or couples who may be at risk of being carriers for autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD), or X-linked (XL) conditions, with risk of transmission to the fetus. Four previous SOGC- Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) guidelines are updated and merged into the current document. INTENDED USERS: All maternity care (most responsible health provider [MRHP]) and paediatric providers; maternity nursing; nurse practitioner; provincial maternity care administrator; medical student; and postgraduate resident year 1-7. TARGET POPULATION: Fertile, sexually active females and their fertile, sexually active male partners who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant (preferably in the first trimester of pregnancy, but any gestational age is acceptable). OPTIONS: Women and their partners will be able to obtain appropriate genetic carrier screening information and possible diagnosis of AR, AD, or XL disorders (preferably pre-conception), thereby allowing an informed choice regarding genetic carrier screening and reproductive options (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, egg or sperm donation, or adoption). OUTCOMES: Informed reproductive decisions related to genetic carrier screening and reproductive outcomes based on family history, ethnic background, past obstetrical history, known carrier status, or genetic diagnosis. SOGC REPRODUCTIVE CARRIER SCREENING SUMMARY STATEMENT (2016): Pre-conception or prenatal education and counselling for reproductive carrier screening requires a discussion about testing within the three perinatal genetic carrier screening/diagnosis time periods, which include pre-conception, prenatal, and neonatal for conditions currently being screened for and diagnosed. This new information should be added to the standard reproductive carrier screening protocols that are already being utilized by the most responsible maternity provider through the informed consent process with the patient. (III-A; GRADE low/moderate) SOGC OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS QUALITY AND GRADE: There was a strong observational/expert opinion (quality and grade) for the genetic carrier literature with randomized controlled trial evidence being available only for the invasive testing. Both the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care quality and classification and the GRADE evidence quality and grade are provided. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE; PubMed; government neonatal screening websites; key words/common reproductive genetic carrier screened diseases/previous SOGC Guidelines/medical academic societies (Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine [SMFM]; American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG]; CCMG; Royal College Obstetrics and Gynaecology [RCOG] [UK]; American Society of Human Genetics [ASHG]; International Society of Prenatal Diagnosis [ISPD])/provincial neonatal screening policies and programs; search terms (carrier screening, prenatal screening, neonatal genetic/metabolic screening, cystic fibrosis (CF), thalassemia, hemoglobinopathy, hemophilia, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), spinal muscular atrophy, Ashkenazi Jewish carrier screening, genetic carrier screening protocols, AR, AD, XL). SEARCH PERIOD: 10 years (June 2005-September 2015); initial search dates June 30, 2015 and September 15, 2015; completed final search January 4, 2016. Validation of articles was completed by primary authors RD Wilson and I De Bie. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COST: Benefits are to provide an evidenced based reproductive genetic carrier screening update consensus based on international opinions and publications for the use of Canadian women, who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant and have been identified to be at risk (personal or male partner family or reproductive history) for the transmission of a clinically significant genetic condition to their offspring with associated morbidity and/or mortality. Harm may arise from having counselling and informed testing of the carrier status of the mother, their partner, or their fetus, as well as from declining to have this counselling and informed testing or from not having the opportunity for counselling and informed testing. Costs will ensue both from the provision of opportunities for counselling and testing, as well as when no such opportunities are offered or are declined and the birth of a child with a significant inherited condition and resulting morbidity/mortality occurs; these comprise not only the health care costs to the system but also the social/financial/psychological/emotional costs to the family. These recommendations are based on expert opinion and have not been subjected to a health economics assessment and local or provincial implementation will be required. GUIDELINE UPDATE: This guideline is an update of four previous joint SOGC-CCMG Genetic Screening Guidelines dated 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2008 developed by the SOGC Genetic Committee in collaboration with the CCMG Prenatal Diagnosis Committee (now Clinical Practice Committee). 2016 CARRIER SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS.",

Canavan disease is a rare autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by abnormal accumulation of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) in brain white matter. Currently, there is no cure for this disease, and management of patients consists mainly of treating symptoms. We describe a 3-month-old girl who was hospitalized for poor head control and decreased muscle tone. A battery of laboratory and genetic (homozygous mutation p.C218X) analysis revealed the presence of Canavan disease. Lithium citrate was initiated at a dosage of 45 mg/kg per day after diagnosis. Periodic controls of thyroid and liver function, and lithium levels in blood showed that this drug was sure and well tolerated. After 1 year of treatment, NAA levels decreased by approximately 20% in the brain region, urinary NAA levels showed a reduction of 80%, and patient improved alertness and visual tracking but continued with no heat support, axial hypotonia, and spastic diplegia. In our patient, the results obtained after drug administration are important with respect to the decrease in NAA and more discreet in clinical improvement. However, given the absence of adverse effects and limited treatment options, lithium citrate may be a good alternative to stop the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life of patients.",

                    "text": "Knock-out mouse for Canavan disease: a model for gene transfer to the central nervous system. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

To explore the feasibility of gene transfer to replace ASPA in CD, we generated a knockout mouse and constructed an AAV vector that encodes human ASPA cDNA (hASPA) followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) after an intraribosomal entry site. We injected CD mice with rAAV-hASPA-GFP in the striatum and thalamus or injected rAAV-GFP identically into control animals. Three to five months after the injection, we determined the presence of ASPA in the CD mouse brain by ASPA activity assay, GFP expression, and Western blot analysis. While rAAV-GFP-injected animals displayed undetectable levels of ASPA, all detection methods revealed significant ASPA levels in rAAV-hASPA-GFP-injected CD mice. We evaluated the functional effects of rAAV-hASPA-GFP-mediated ASPA expression by standard histological methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo NAA levels, and magnetic resonance imaging of CD mice. rAAV-hASPA-injected animals displayed a remarkable lack of spongiform degeneration in the thalamus. However, pathology in sites unrelated to the injected areas showed no improvement in histopathology. The improvement in thalamic neuropathology was also detectable via in vivo MRI. MRS revealed that in vivo NAA levels were also reduced. These data indicate that rAAV-mediated ASPA delivery may be an interesting avenue for the treatment of CD.",

BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a rare leukodystrophy with no current treatment. rAAV-ASPA has been developed for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) for Canavan disease. This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.",

Canavan disease (CD MIM#271900) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early infancy. The course of the disease is variable, but it is always fatal. CD is caused by mutations in the ASPA gene, which codes for the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA), which breaks down N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to acetate and aspartic acid. The lack of NAA-degrading enzyme activity leads to excess accumulation of NAA in the brain and deficiency of acetate, which is necessary for myelin lipid synthesis. Glyceryltriacetate (GTA) is a short-chain triglyceride with three acetate moieties on a glycerol backbone and has proven an effective acetate precursor. Intragastric administration of GTA to tremor mice results in greatly increased brain acetate levels, and improved motor functions. GTA given to infants with CD at a low dose (up to 0.25 g/kg/d) resulted in no improvement in their clinical status, but also no detectable toxicity. We present for the first time the safety profile of high dose GTA (4.5 g/kg/d) in 2 patients with CD. We treated 2 infants with CD at ages 8 months and 1 year with high dose GTA, for 4.5 and 6 months respectively. No significant side effects and no toxicity were observed. Although the treatment resulted in no motor improvement, it was well tolerated. The lack of clinical improvement might be explained mainly by the late onset of treatment, when significant brain damage was already present. Further larger studies of CD patients below age 3 months are required in order to test the long-term efficacy of this drug.",

Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy.

Canavan disease is a genetic disorder associated with optic neuropathy and the metabolism of N-acetylaspartate is defective in this disorder due to mutations in the gene coding for the enzyme aspartoacylase II. Here we show that the plasma membrane transporter NaDC3, a Na+-coupled transporter for dicarboxylates, is able to transport N-acetylaspartate, suggesting that the transporter may function in concert with aspartoacylase II in the metabolism of N-acetylaspartate. Since Canavan disease is associated with ocular complications, we investigated the expression pattern of NaDC3 and aspartoacylase II in ocular tissues in mouse by in situ hybridization. These studies show that NaDC3 mRNA is expressed in the optic nerve, most layers of the retina, retinal pigment epithelium, ciliary body, iris, and lens. Aspartoacylase II mRNA is coexpressed in most of these cell types. We conclude that transport of N-acetylaspartate into ocular tissues via NaDC3 and its subsequent hydrolysis by aspartoacylase II play an essential role in the maintenance of visual function.",

In contrast, superoxide dismutase activity was not altered by N-acetylaspartic acid. Our results clearly show that N-acetylaspartic acid impairs the enzymatic antioxidant defenses in rat brain.

OBJECTIVES: To set up a novel simple, sensitive, and reliable ion-pairing HPLC method for the synchronous separation of several purines, pyrimidines, N-acetylated amino acids, and dicarboxylic acids for the chemical diagnosis and screening of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). DESIGN AND METHODS: The separation was set up using a Hypersil C-18, 5-microm particle size, 250 x 4.6 mm column, and a step gradient using two buffers and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as the pairing reagent. A highly sensitive diode array UV detector was set up at a wavelength between 200 and 300 nm that revealed purines and pyrimidines at 260 nm and other compounds at 206 nm. RESULTS: Compounds were determined in the plasma of 15 healthy adults, in the urine of 50 healthy subjects (1-3 years, 4-6 years, 8-10 years, 12-18 years, 25-35 years), and in 10 non-pathological amniotic fluid samples. To assess the validity of the chemical diagnosis of IEM, plasma and urine samples were analyzed in patients affected by Canavan disease (n = 10; mean age 4.6 +/- 2.3). Low plasma levels of N-acetylaspartate (16.96 +/- 19.57 micromol/L plasma; not detectable in healthy adults) and dramatically high urinary N-acetylaspartate concentrations (1872.03 +/- 631.86 micromol/mmol creatinine; 450 times higher than that which was observed in age-matched controls) were recorded.

OBJECTIVES: To set up a novel simple, sensitive, and reliable ion-pairing HPLC method for the synchronous separation of several purines, pyrimidines, N-acetylated amino acids, and dicarboxylic acids for the chemical diagnosis and screening of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). DESIGN AND METHODS: The separation was set up using a Hypersil C-18, 5-microm particle size, 250 x 4.6 mm column, and a step gradient using two buffers and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as the pairing reagent. A highly sensitive diode array UV detector was set up at a wavelength between 200 and 300 nm that revealed purines and pyrimidines at 260 nm and other compounds at 206 nm. RESULTS: Compounds were determined in the plasma of 15 healthy adults, in the urine of 50 healthy subjects (1-3 years, 4-6 years, 8-10 years, 12-18 years, 25-35 years), and in 10 non-pathological amniotic fluid samples. To assess the validity of the chemical diagnosis of IEM, plasma and urine samples were analyzed in patients affected by Canavan disease (n = 10; mean age 4.6 +/- 2.3). Low plasma levels of N-acetylaspartate (16.96 +/- 19.57 micromol/L plasma; not detectable in healthy adults) and dramatically high urinary N-acetylaspartate concentrations (1872.03 +/- 631.86 micromol/mmol creatinine; 450 times higher than that which was observed in age-matched controls) were recorded.

A kinetic model describing the pulse of increased oxygen concentrations and the subsequent changes in the concentration of N-acetylaspartate in the excited nervous tissue of the human brain in response to an external signal is presented. The model is based on biochemical data, a multistage and nonlinear dynamic process the BOLD signal and N-acetylaspartate. The existence of multiple steady states explains the triggering effect of the system. The inhibitory effect of the substrate is a necessary factor for the autostabilization of N-acetylaspartate. The kinetic model allows the dynamic behavior of previously unmeasurable metabolites, namely, products of the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartate, such as acetic and aspartic acid, and glutamic acid to be predicted. Kinetic modeling of the BOLD signal and the subsequent hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartate provides information about the biochemical and dynamic characteristics of some pathological conditions (schizophrenia, Canavan disease, and the superexcitation of the neural network).",

BACKGROUND: To determine the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of common genetic disorders in the north Indian population by using next generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: After pre-test counselling, 200 unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened for pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were classified as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were subjected to thorough literature-based curation in addition to the regular filters. Variants of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals were counselled explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening was advised when necessary. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 52 (26%) were found to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were identified to be carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier frequency of one in 17 for one of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2, TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order). Nine individuals were observed to be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency of one in 22. Three individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers for the same disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many disorders (such as deafness, cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were different from those commonly observed in the West. CONCLUSION: A higher carrier frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was unexpected, and contrary to the generally held view about their prevalence in Asian Indians. In spite of the small sample size, this study would suggest that population-based carrier screening panels for India would differ from those in the West, and need to be selected with due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding exons with its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes will detect carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the burden of genetic disorders in India and other resource poor countries.",

Canavan disease (CD MIM#271900) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early infancy. The course of the disease is variable, but it is always fatal. CD is caused by mutations in the ASPA gene, which codes for the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA), which breaks down N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to acetate and aspartic acid. The lack of NAA-degrading enzyme activity leads to excess accumulation of NAA in the brain and deficiency of acetate, which is necessary for myelin lipid synthesis. Glyceryltriacetate (GTA) is a short-chain triglyceride with three acetate moieties on a glycerol backbone and has proven an effective acetate precursor. Intragastric administration of GTA to tremor mice results in greatly increased brain acetate levels, and improved motor functions. GTA given to infants with CD at a low dose (up to 0.25 g/kg/d) resulted in no improvement in their clinical status, but also no detectable toxicity. We present for the first time the safety profile of high dose GTA (4.5 g/kg/d) in 2 patients with CD. We treated 2 infants with CD at ages 8 months and 1 year with high dose GTA, for 4.5 and 6 months respectively. No significant side effects and no toxicity were observed. Although the treatment resulted in no motor improvement, it was well tolerated. The lack of clinical improvement might be explained mainly by the late onset of treatment, when significant brain damage was already present. Further larger studies of CD patients below age 3 months are required in order to test the long-term efficacy of this drug.",

Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive progressive neurodegenerative disorder prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. The carrier rate for the most common mutations that cause CD in the AJ population is often quoted as 1:37-1:40. This is not supported by our finding of only two diagnosed cases of CD in the last 20 years in the Toronto AJ population of 160,000 and an estimated birth rate of 1,500-2,000 per year. Therefore, we embarked on a prevalence cross-sectional screening study to determine the carrier rate of CD in this population. In order to perform low-cost, high-throughput population testing for CD using molecular techniques, we first developed a novel molecular assay using multiplex fluorescent allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test for the three most common mutations causing CD in the AJ population (A854C, C693A, C914A) and a neutral polymorphism at the site of the C693A mutation. During testing it was noted that individuals who were carriers of the A854C mutation also had a T polymorphism at the site of the C693A mutation (Y231X). We confirmed that in all A854C carriers the 854C mutation was in disequilibrium with the 693T polymorphism, indicating a founder chromosome for the A854C mutation in the AJ population. Twenty-five carriers were found from 1,423 samples yielding a carrier rate of 1:57, differing from the widely quoted frequency of 1:40 and supporting our observed frequency of disease.",

PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We report on a 13-year-old boy who is a high school student in a public school. He was diagnosed with juvenile Canavan disease, presenting with intentional tremor as the only clinical finding. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed mainly the involvement of the caudate nucleus and pons extending to the mesencephalon and also the putamen and the thalamus, with no apparent signal increase in the cerebral white matter. A homozygous p.Gly274Arg (c.820A>G) missense mutation was identified. CONCLUSION: Juvenile Canavan disease with mainly pons involvement has not been published before.

BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by a deficiency of aspartoacylase. The disease has a severe course, with death occurring in the first few years of life. Atypical patients with mild courses have been reported, but acute presentations similar to stroke have not been well described. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We present a boy who presented at 4 months of age with seizures after an episode of cardiopulmonary arrest is discussed. RESULTS: He was initially thought to have an ischemic watershed stroke based on his initial clinical presentation and magnetic resonance imaging. However, biochemical and follow-up radiologic evaluation were consistent with mild Canavan disease. DNA sequencing of the ASPA gene indicated one known mutation (A305E) and a novel mutation, L30V. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal the atrophy which would have been expected with watershed ischemia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated elevated N-acetyl aspartate to creatinine and N-acetyl aspartate to choline ratios. At 4 years of age, he was normocephalic, with mild clumsiness, speech delay, and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This child's unusual acute presentation, along with his prolonged mild course, raises questions about the relationship between biochemical signs of abnormal aspartoacylase function and clinical findings. This patient highlights the need for long-term clinical follow-up of children with mild Canavan disease to clarify the significance of these biochemical abnormalities.",

                    "text": "Knock-out mouse for Canavan disease: a model for gene transfer to the central nervous system. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). Deficiency of ASPA leads to elevation of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in the brain and urine. To explore the feasibility of gene transfer to replace ASPA in CD, we generated a knockout mouse and constructed an AAV vector that encodes human ASPA cDNA (hASPA) followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) after an intraribosomal entry site. We injected CD mice with rAAV-hASPA-GFP in the striatum and thalamus or injected rAAV-GFP identically into control animals. Three to five months after the injection, we determined the presence of ASPA in the CD mouse brain by ASPA activity assay, GFP expression, and Western blot analysis. While rAAV-GFP-injected animals displayed undetectable levels of ASPA, all detection methods revealed significant ASPA levels in rAAV-hASPA-GFP-injected CD mice. We evaluated the functional effects of rAAV-hASPA-GFP-mediated ASPA expression by standard histological methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo NAA levels, and magnetic resonance imaging of CD mice. rAAV-hASPA-injected animals displayed a remarkable lack of spongiform degeneration in the thalamus. However, pathology in sites unrelated to the injected areas showed no improvement in histopathology. The improvement in thalamic neuropathology was also detectable via in vivo MRI. MRS revealed that in vivo NAA levels were also reduced. These data indicate that rAAV-mediated ASPA delivery may be an interesting avenue for the treatment of CD.",

BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by a deficiency of aspartoacylase. The disease has a severe course, with death occurring in the first few years of life. Atypical patients with mild courses have been reported, but acute presentations similar to stroke have not been well described. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We present a boy who presented at 4 months of age with seizures after an episode of cardiopulmonary arrest is discussed. RESULTS: He was initially thought to have an ischemic watershed stroke based on his initial clinical presentation and magnetic resonance imaging. However, biochemical and follow-up radiologic evaluation were consistent with mild Canavan disease. DNA sequencing of the ASPA gene indicated one known mutation (A305E) and a novel mutation, L30V. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal the atrophy which would have been expected with watershed ischemia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated elevated N-acetyl aspartate to creatinine and N-acetyl aspartate to choline ratios. At 4 years of age, he was normocephalic, with mild clumsiness, speech delay, and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: This child's unusual acute presentation, along with his prolonged mild course, raises questions about the relationship between biochemical signs of abnormal aspartoacylase function and clinical findings. This patient highlights the need for long-term clinical follow-up of children with mild Canavan disease to clarify the significance of these biochemical abnormalities.",

Astrocytic dysfunctions have been recently identified in four leukosdystrophies without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Alexander disease, the first primary genetic astrocytic disorder identified, is due to dominant GFAP mutations. The presence of Rosenthal fibers throughout the CNS is the pathological hallmark of this disease. Neurological degradation, megalencephaly, and typical MRI pattern are characteristic of infantile sporadic patients. Nevertheless, clinical and MRI expression is large, including late onset forms which can be familial. Spongiform or cystic white matter CNS degeneration is present in the other three recessive disorders. The visualization of a white matter cystic breakdown on MRI has led to the identification of CACH/VWM and MLC diseases. CACH/VWM is due to mutations in one of the five subunits of EIF2B which compromise the astrocytic lineage. The clinical spectrum is large, from antenatal to adult forms, and several extraneurological organs can be affected. Mutations in MLC1, which is mainly expressed in astrocyte endfeet, produce megalencephaly, whereas the mild clinical course contrasts with severe MRI features. An increased concentration of NAA in the urine is sufficient to diagnose Canavan disease, which is due to mutations of the ASPA gene. These disorders highlight the role of astrocytes in myelination or myelin maintenance.",

OBJECTIVE: Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease by measuring N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in amniotic fluid is reliable and preferred over aspartoacylase enzyme assay especially in populations with unknown mutations. Typically based on GC-MS, existing methods are time-consuming and laborious. We developed a novel LC-MS/MS method for determination of NAA in amniotic fluid with minimal sample preparation. METHOD: NAA and d(3)-NAA were detected by negative-ion electrospray ionization-MS/MS. Quantification was achieved by standard addition using six 0.1 mL portions of each specimen enriched with increasing NAA amounts (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 microg) and endogenous NAA was calculated by extrapolation. RESULTS: Injection-to-injection time was 2 min whereas the turn around time from sample receipt was about 1 h. Intraday (n = 10) and interday (n = 10) variations were less than 9.4%. The reference range determined using gestation-matched controls (n = 12) of 1.1-2.7 micromol/L is in agreement with the literature. Specimens from at-risk pregnancies with established diagnosis (n = 4) were successfully analyzed. CONCLUSION: We developed a new method that enables reliable, sensitive, and selective determination of NAA in a small volume of amniotic fluid for the prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease. The simple sample preparation adopted in this work precluded the necessity for extraction and derivatization.",

Leukodystrophies (LDs) are a heterogeneous group of progressive neurological disorders and characterized by primary involvement of white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). This is the first report of the Iranian LD Registry database to describe the clinical, radiological, and genomic data of Persian patients with leukodystrophies. From 2016 to 2019, patients suspicious of LDs were examined followed by a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A single gene testing or whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used depending on the neuroradiologic phenotypes. In a few cases, the diagnosis was made by metabolic studies. Based on the MRI pattern, diagnosed patients were divided into cohorts A (hypomyelinating LDs) versus cohort B (Other LDs). The most recent LD classification was utilized for classification of diagnosed patients. For novel variants, in silico analyses were performed to verify their pathogenicity. Out of 680 registered patients, 342 completed the diagnostic evaluations. In total, 245 patients met a diagnosis which in turn 24.5% were categorized in cohort A and the remaining in cohort B. Genetic tests revealed causal variants in 228 patients consisting of 213 variants in 110 genes with 78 novel variants. WES and single gene testing identified a causal variant in 65.5% and 34.5% cases, respectively. The total diagnostic rate of WES was 60.7%. Lysosomal disorders (27.3%; GM2-gangliosidosis-9.8%, MLD-6.1%, KD-4.5%), amino and organic acid disorders (17.15%; Canavan disease-4.5%, L-2-HGA-3.6%), mitochondrial leukodystrophies (12.6%), ion and water homeostasis disorders (7.3%; MLC-4.5%), peroxisomal disorders (6.5%; X-ALD-3.6%), and myelin protein disorders (3.6%; PMLD-3.6%) were the most commonly diagnosed disorders. Thirty-seven percent of cases had a pathogenic variant in nine genes (ARSA, HEXA, ASPA, MLC1, GALC, GJC2, ABCD1, L2HGDH, GCDH).

Canavan disease is a fatal neurological disease without any effective treatments to slow the relentless progress of this disorder. Enzyme replacement therapy has been used effectively to treat a number of metabolic disorders, but the presence of the blood-brain-barrier presents an additional challenge in the treatment of neurological disorders. Studies have begun with the aim of establishing a treatment protocol that can effectively replace the defective enzyme in Canavan disease patients. The human enzyme, aspartoacylase, has been cloned, expressed and purified, and the surface lysyl groups modified through PEGylation. Fully active modified enzymes were administered to mice that are defective in this enzyme and that show many of the symptoms of Canavan disease. Statistically significant increases in brain enzyme activity levels have been achieved in this animal model, as well as decreases in the elevated substrate levels that mimic those found in Canavan disease patients. These results demonstrate that the modified enzyme is gaining access to the brain and functions to correct this metabolic defect. The stage is now set for a long term study to optimize this enzyme replacement approach for the development of a treatment protocol.",

                    "text": "Knock-out mouse for Canavan disease: a model for gene transfer to the central nervous system. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

The aim of carrier testing is to identify carrier couples at risk of having offspring with a serious genetic (autosomal recessive) disorder. Carrier couples are offered genetic consultation where their reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis, are explained. The Ashkenazi Jewish population is at increased risk for several recessively inherited disorders (Tay-Sachs disease, Cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Gaucher disease, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, and Bloom syndrome). Unlike Tay-Sachs disease, there is no simple biochemical or enzymatic test to detect carriers for these other disorders. However, with the rapid identification of disease-causing genes in recent years, DNA-based assays are increasingly available for carrier detection. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries a mutation affecting the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Among the most common of these disorders are the thalassemias. The global birth rate of affected infants is at least 2 per 1000 (in unscreened populations), with the greatest incidence in Southeast Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Carriers are detected by evaluation of red cell indices and morphology, followed by more sophisticated hematological testing and molecular analyses. The following issues need to be considered in the development of a carrier screening program: (1) test selection based on disease severity and test accuracy; (2) funding for testing and genetic counselling; (3) definition of the target population to be screened; (4) development of a public and professional education program; (5) informed consent for screening; and (6) awareness of community needs.",

OBJECTIVE: Canavan disease (OMIM 271900) is a severe autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spongy degeneration of the brain and caused by mutations in the gene encoding for aspartoacylase (ASPA). The enzyme is responsible for the catalyses of the brain-specific compound N-acetylaspartate (NAA). DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the case of two Egyptian sibling patients suspected of Canavan disease (CD) showing clinical deterioration, white matter degeneration, megalencephaly and severe intellectual impairment. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biochemical analysis of NAA in biological fluid samples (serum and urine). Subsequently, in order to determine the mutation responsible for CD in these two sibs, a molecular biological examination was performed. RESULTS: MRI findings and quantification of high NAA excretion (1378.5 and 680.1mumolNAA/mmolcreatinine in urine of 4months and 4years old patients, respectively) confirmed the diagnosis of CD and prompted a search for the responsible mutation. The molecular biological analysis revealed homozygosity for the substitution T530C (Ile177Thr) in the exon 4 of the ASPA gene in both sibs. A total loss of enzymatic activity was also recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The substitution T530C (Ile177Thr) results in a novel missense mutation causing a CD phenotype with severe clinical characteristics. This mutation was not previously described in the literature. In these two sibs, urinary concentration of NAA appears to correlate inversely to symptom severity and CD progression.",

For comprehensive carrier screening and molecular diagnostic purposes, we developed a population-specific and inclusive microarray.

These sites represent the most common variants in Tay-Sachs disease, Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, Niemann-Pick A, familial dysautonomia, torsion dystonia, mucolipidosis type IV, Fanconi anemia, Gaucher disease, factor XI deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1a, maple syrup urine disease, nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, familial Mediterranean fever, and glycogen storage disease type III. Several mutations in the selected disorders that are not prevalent per se in the Ashkenazi Jewish populations, as well pseudodeficiency alleles, are also included in the array. The initial technical evaluation of this microarray demonstrates that it is comprehensive, robust, sensitive, specific, and easily modifiable.

Canavan disease (CD) is a rare fatal childhood neurological autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the ASPA gene, which lead to catalytic deficiency of the ASPA enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) into aspartate and acetate. CD occurs frequently among Ashkenazi Jewish population, however it has been reported in many other ethnic groups with significantly lower frequency. Here, we report on two Egyptian patients diagnosed with CD, the first patient harbors five missense mutations (c.427 A > G; p. I143V, c.502C > T; p. R168C, c.530 T > C; p. I177T, c.557 T > C; p. V186D c.548C > T; p. P183L) and a silent mutation (c.693 C > T; p. Y231Y). The second patient was found to be homozygous for two missense mutations (c.427 A > G; p. I143V and c.557 T > A; p. V186D). Furthermore, molecular modeling of the novel mutation p. P183L provides an instructive explanation of the mutational impact on the protein structure that can affect the function of the ASPA. Here, the clinical, radiological, and biochemical profile of the two patients are reviewed in details.",

METHODS: The College of American Pathologists and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics cosponsor molecular proficiency testing for these disorders. Responses from 2006 to 2013 were analyzed for accuracy (genotyping and interpretations). RESULTS: Between 11 and 36 laboratories participated in each Tay-Sachs disease distribution. Samples tested per month were constant (2,900) from 2006 to 2011 but recently increased. Participants reporting <10 samples tested per month had longer turnaround times (42 vs. 7%, longer than 14 days; P = 0.03).

BACKGROUND: Canavan disease is a rare leukodystrophy with no current treatment. rAAV-ASPA has been developed for gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) for Canavan disease. This study represents the first use of a viral vector in an attempt to ameliorate a neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: Subjects received intracranial infusions via six cranial burr holes. Adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 (AAV2), mediated intraparenchymal delivery of the human aspartoacylase cDNA at a maximum dose of 1 x 10(12) vector genomes per subject. The immune response and safety profiles were monitored in the follow-up of ten subjects. RESULTS: Following rAAV2 administration, we found no evidence of AAV2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum for the majority of subjects tested (7/10). In a subset (3/10) of subjects, low to moderately high levels of AAV2 neutralizing antibody with respect to baseline were detected. In all subjects, there were minimal systemic signs of inflammation or immune stimulation. In subjects with catheter access to the brain lateral ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid was examined and there was a complete absence of neutralizing antibody titers with no overt signs of brain inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: rAAV2 vector administration to the human CNS appears well tolerated. The low levels of immune response to AAV2 detected in 3/10 subjects in this study suggest at this dose and with intraparenchymal administration this approach is relatively safe. Long-term monitoring of subjects and expansion to phase II/III will be necessary in order to make definitive statements on safety and efficacy.",

The primary purpose of this work was to assess long-term in vitro reproducibility of metabolite levels measured using 1H MRS (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy). The secondary purpose was to use the in vitro results for interpretation of 1H MRS in vivo spectra acquired from patients diagnosed with Canavan disease. 1H MRS measurements were performed in the period from April 2006 to September 2010. 118 short and 116 long echo spectra were acquired from a stable phantom during this period. Change-point analysis of the in vitro N-acetylaspartate levels was exploited in the computation of fT factor (ratio of the actual to the reference N-acetylaspartate level normalized by the reciprocity principle). This coefficient was utilized in the interpretation of in vivo spectra analyzed using absolute reference technique. The monitored time period was divided into six time intervals based on short echo in vitro data (seven time intervals based on long echo in vitro data) characterized by fT coefficient ranging from 0.97 to 1.09 (based on short echo data) and from 1.0 to 1.11 (based on long echo data). Application of this coefficient to interpretation of in vivo spectra confirmed increased N-acetylaspartate level in Canavan disease. Long-term monitoring of an MRS system reproducibility, allowing for absolute referencing of metabolite levels, facilitates interpretation of metabolic changes in white matter disorders.",

                    "text": "New T530C mutation in the aspartoacylase gene caused Canavan disease with no correlation between severity and N-acetylaspartate excretion. OBJECTIVE: Canavan disease (OMIM 271900) is a severe autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spongy degeneration of the brain and caused by mutations in the gene encoding for aspartoacylase (ASPA). The enzyme is responsible for the catalyses of the brain-specific compound N-acetylaspartate (NAA). DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the case of two Egyptian sibling patients suspected of Canavan disease (CD) showing clinical deterioration, white matter degeneration, megalencephaly and severe intellectual impairment. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biochemical analysis of NAA in biological fluid samples (serum and urine). Subsequently, in order to determine the mutation responsible for CD in these two sibs, a molecular biological examination was performed. RESULTS: MRI findings and quantification of high NAA excretion (1378.5 and 680.1mumolNAA/mmolcreatinine in urine of 4months and 4years old patients, respectively) confirmed the diagnosis of CD and prompted a search for the responsible mutation. The molecular biological analysis revealed homozygosity for the substitution T530C (Ile177Thr) in the exon 4 of the ASPA gene in both sibs. A total loss of enzymatic activity was also recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The substitution T530C (Ile177Thr) results in a novel missense mutation causing a CD phenotype with severe clinical characteristics. This mutation was not previously described in the literature. In these two sibs, urinary concentration of NAA appears to correlate inversely to symptom severity and CD progression.",

Astrocytic dysfunctions have been recently identified in four leukosdystrophies without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Alexander disease, the first primary genetic astrocytic disorder identified, is due to dominant GFAP mutations. The presence of Rosenthal fibers throughout the CNS is the pathological hallmark of this disease. Neurological degradation, megalencephaly, and typical MRI pattern are characteristic of infantile sporadic patients. Nevertheless, clinical and MRI expression is large, including late onset forms which can be familial. Spongiform or cystic white matter CNS degeneration is present in the other three recessive disorders. The visualization of a white matter cystic breakdown on MRI has led to the identification of CACH/VWM and MLC diseases. CACH/VWM is due to mutations in one of the five subunits of EIF2B which compromise the astrocytic lineage. The clinical spectrum is large, from antenatal to adult forms, and several extraneurological organs can be affected. Mutations in MLC1, which is mainly expressed in astrocyte endfeet, produce megalencephaly, whereas the mild clinical course contrasts with severe MRI features. An increased concentration of NAA in the urine is sufficient to diagnose Canavan disease, which is due to mutations of the ASPA gene. These disorders highlight the role of astrocytes in myelination or myelin maintenance.",

Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive progressive neurodegenerative disorder prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. The carrier rate for the most common mutations that cause CD in the AJ population is often quoted as 1:37-1:40. This is not supported by our finding of only two diagnosed cases of CD in the last 20 years in the Toronto AJ population of 160,000 and an estimated birth rate of 1,500-2,000 per year. Therefore, we embarked on a prevalence cross-sectional screening study to determine the carrier rate of CD in this population. In order to perform low-cost, high-throughput population testing for CD using molecular techniques, we first developed a novel molecular assay using multiplex fluorescent allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test for the three most common mutations causing CD in the AJ population (A854C, C693A, C914A) and a neutral polymorphism at the site of the C693A mutation. During testing it was noted that individuals who were carriers of the A854C mutation also had a T polymorphism at the site of the C693A mutation (Y231X). We confirmed that in all A854C carriers the 854C mutation was in disequilibrium with the 693T polymorphism, indicating a founder chromosome for the A854C mutation in the AJ population. Twenty-five carriers were found from 1,423 samples yielding a carrier rate of 1:57, differing from the widely quoted frequency of 1:40 and supporting our observed frequency of disease.",

Patients with a suggestive specific leukodystrophy, e. g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, Tay-Sachs disease were tested for mutations in single genes (108; 71%) while patients with less suggestive findings were evaluated by NGS. 108 of 152(71%) had MRI patterns and clinical findings suggestive of a known leukodystrophy. In total, 114(75%) affected individuals had (likely) pathogenic variants which included 38 novel variants. 35 different types of leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies were identified. The more common identified disorders included metachromatic leukodystrophy (19 of 152; 13%), Canavan disease (12; 8%), Tay-Sachs disease (11; 7%), megalencephalic leukodystrophy with subcortical cysts (7; 5%), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (8; 5%), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1 (8; 5%), Sandhoff disease (6; 4%), Krabbe disease (5; 3%), and vanishing white matter disease (4; 3%). Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed 90% leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies. The total diagnosis rate was 75%. This unique study presents a national genetic data of leukodystrophies; it may provide clues to the genetic pool of neighboring countries. Patients with clinical and neuroradiological evidence of a genetic leukoencephalopathy should undergo a genetic analysis to reach a definitive diagnosis. This will allow a diagnosis at earlier stages of the disease, reduce the burden of uncertainty and costs, and will provide the basis for genetic counseling and family planning.",

Canavan disease, an autosomal-recessive neurogenetic disorder, is caused by mutations in aspartoacylase, an enzyme that deacetylates N-acetylaspartate to generate free acetate in the brain. Earlier studies have shown that aspartoacylase is primarily restricted to myelin synthesizing cells (oligodendroglia) in the CNS. These findings have led us to investigate the developmental expression of aspartoacylase gene in the rat brain in an attempt to shed more light on the role of this enzyme in myelination. In situ hybridization using a 35S riboprobe based on murine aspartoacylase cDNA was used in this study. The probe hybridized mostly to the white matter tracts with different densities depending on the age of the animal and region of the brain examined. Little or no hybridization signals were detected in the 1-day-old rats, whereas the signal was clearly detectable in most of the white matter regions of the CNS in the 11-day-old rats. The signal density markedly increased at postnatal day 17, the peak of myelination. Thereafter, the hybridization signals decreased somewhat but still could be observed in the adult animals. Thus, the developmental expression pattern of aspartoacylase gene in the postnatal brain closely parallels myelination in the CNS. In the CNS, the hybridization signal of ASPA appeared to be restricted primarily to oligodendrocytes, the primary myelin synthesizing cell type in the CNS. However, the signal was not detectable in rat sciatic nerve (Schwann cells) of the peripheral nervous system. These findings indicate that the role of N-acetylaspartate in myelin synthesis is restricted to the CNS. Furthermore, they provide additional support for the acetate deficiency hypothesis of Canavan disease and also make a stronger case for acetate supplementation as an immediate and inexpensive therapy for Canavan disease.",

N-Acetylaspartic acid accumulates in Canavan Disease, a severe inherited neurometabolic disease clinically characterized by severe mental retardation, hypotonia, macrocephaly and generalized tonic and clonic type seizures. Considering that the mechanisms of brain damage in this disease remain poorly understood, in the present study we investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of N-acetylaspartic acid on the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as on hydrogen peroxide concentration in cerebral cortex of 14-day-old rats. Catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly inhibited, while hydrogen peroxide concentration was significantly enhanced by N-acetylaspartic acid both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, superoxide dismutase activity was not altered by N-acetylaspartic acid. Our results clearly show that N-acetylaspartic acid impairs the enzymatic antioxidant defenses in rat brain. This could be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the brain damage observed in patients affected by Canavan Disease.",

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary adult malignant brain tumor, is associated with a poor prognosis due, in part, to tumor recurrence mediated by chemotherapy and radiation resistant glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). The metabolic and epigenetic state of GSCs differs from their non-GSC counterparts, with GSCs exhibiting greater glycolytic metabolism and global hypoacetylation. However, little attention has been focused on the potential use of acetate supplementation as a therapeutic approach. N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of brain acetate, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis, are significantly reduced in GBM tumors. We recently demonstrated that NAA supplementation is not an appropriate therapeutic approach since it increases GSC proliferation and pursued an alternative acetate source. The FDA approved food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) has been safely used for acetate supplementation therapy in Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation. This study characterized the effects of GTA on the proliferation and differentiation of six primary GBM-derived GSCs relative to established U87 and U251 GBM cell lines, normal human cerebral cortical astrocytes, and murine neural stem cells. GTA reduced proliferation of GSCs greater than established GBM lines. Moreover, GTA reduced growth of the more aggressive mesenchymal GSCs greater than proneural GSCs. Although sodium acetate induced a dose-dependent reduction of GSC growth, it also reduced cell viability. GTA-mediated growth inhibition was not associated with differentiation, but increased protein acetylation. These data suggest that GTA-mediated acetate supplementation is a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit GSC growth.",

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) comprise a group of inherited diseases that can have devastating consequences and cause irreversible damage to different body systems and even lead to death. Newborn screening helps in the presymptomatic diagnosis of many medical disorders including IEMs. Early diagnosis and management of IEMs helps reduce morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of IEMs among at-risk children and contribute toward early diagnosis and management in order to minimize morbidity and mortality. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the Pediatrics and Neonatology Department, Sohag University Hospital, Egypt. The study enrolled 308 participants suspected of having IEMs. Cases were included based on the presence of any of the following: unexplained convulsions, persistent metabolic acidosis, persistent hypoglycemia, disturbed consciousness, delayed milestones, or family history of previous sibling death with IEMs or sibling death with a history suggestive of IEMs. All participants in the study were subjected to metabolic screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). RESULTS: Out of 308 neonates, 93 (30.2%) were diagnosed with IEMs. The most common diagnosis was phenylketonuria, followed by glutaric aciduria type 1 and maple syrup urine disease (43%, 19.4%, and 14%, respectively). Five patients had Canavan disease, four had medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, three had congenital lactic acidosis, two had methylmalonic acidemia, and two had primary carnitine deficiency. Propionic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, homocystinuria, short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, B-ketothiolase deficiency, and ketone body utilization defect were diagnosed in one patient each. Most patients improved (73.1%) following proper specific management. CONCLUSION: We recommend newborn screening for IEMs using MS/MS, which may help with the early diagnosis and management of this group of disorders.",

BACKGROUND: To determine the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of common genetic disorders in the north Indian population by using next generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: After pre-test counselling, 200 unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened for pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were classified as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were subjected to thorough literature-based curation in addition to the regular filters. Variants of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals were counselled explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening was advised when necessary. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 52 (26%) were found to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were identified to be carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier frequency of one in 17 for one of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2, TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order). Nine individuals were observed to be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency of one in 22. Three individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers for the same disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many disorders (such as deafness, cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were different from those commonly observed in the West. CONCLUSION: A higher carrier frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was unexpected, and contrary to the generally held view about their prevalence in Asian Indians. In spite of the small sample size, this study would suggest that population-based carrier screening panels for India would differ from those in the West, and need to be selected with due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding exons with its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes will detect carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the burden of genetic disorders in India and other resource poor countries.",

Canavan disease (CD) is a rare leukodystrophy characterized by diffuse spongiform white matter degeneration, dysmyelination and intramyelinic oedema with consequent impairment of psychomotor development and early death. The molecular cause of CD has been identified as being mutations of the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) leading to its functional deficiency. The physiological role of ASPA is to hydrolyse N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (NAA), producing l-aspartic acid and acetate; as a result, its deficiency leads to abnormally high central nervous system NAA levels. The aim of this article is to review what is currently known regarding the aetiopathogenesis and treatment of CD, with emphasis on the non-genetic therapeutic strategies, both at an experimental and a clinical level, by highlighting: (a) major related hypotheses, (b) the results of the available experimental simulatory approaches, as well as (c) the relevance of the so far examined markers of CD neuropathology. The potential and the limitations of the current non-genetic neuroprotective approaches to the treatment of CD are particularly discussed in the current article, in a context that could be used to direct future experimental and (eventually) clinical work in the field.

Canavan disease (CD) is a rare leukodystrophy characterized by diffuse spongiform white matter degeneration, dysmyelination and intramyelinic oedema with consequent impairment of psychomotor development and early death. The molecular cause of CD has been identified as being mutations of the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) leading to its functional deficiency. The physiological role of ASPA is to hydrolyse N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (NAA), producing l-aspartic acid and acetate; as a result, its deficiency leads to abnormally high central nervous system NAA levels. The aim of this article is to review what is currently known regarding the aetiopathogenesis and treatment of CD, with emphasis on the non-genetic therapeutic strategies, both at an experimental and a clinical level, by highlighting: (a) major related hypotheses, (b) the results of the available experimental simulatory approaches, as well as (c) the relevance of the so far examined markers of CD neuropathology. The potential and the limitations of the current non-genetic neuroprotective approaches to the treatment of CD are particularly discussed in the current article, in a context that could be used to direct future experimental and (eventually) clinical work in the field.

                    "text": "NGS-based expanded carrier screening for genetic disorders in North Indian population reveals unexpected results - a pilot study. BACKGROUND: To determine the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of common genetic disorders in the north Indian population by using next generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: After pre-test counselling, 200 unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened for pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were classified as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were subjected to thorough literature-based curation in addition to the regular filters. Variants of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals were counselled explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening was advised when necessary. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 52 (26%) were found to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were identified to be carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier frequency of one in 17 for one of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2, TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order). Nine individuals were observed to be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency of one in 22. Three individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers for the same disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many disorders (such as deafness, cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were different from those commonly observed in the West. CONCLUSION: A higher carrier frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was unexpected, and contrary to the generally held view about their prevalence in Asian Indians. In spite of the small sample size, this study would suggest that population-based carrier screening panels for India would differ from those in the West, and need to be selected with due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding exons with its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes will detect carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the burden of genetic disorders in India and other resource poor countries.",

OBJECTIVE: This guideline was written to update Canadian maternity care and reproductive healthcare providers on pre- and postconceptional reproductive carrier screening for women or couples who may be at risk of being carriers for autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD), or X-linked (XL) conditions, with risk of transmission to the fetus. Four previous SOGC- Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) guidelines are updated and merged into the current document. INTENDED USERS: All maternity care (most responsible health provider [MRHP]) and paediatric providers; maternity nursing; nurse practitioner; provincial maternity care administrator; medical student; and postgraduate resident year 1-7. TARGET POPULATION: Fertile, sexually active females and their fertile, sexually active male partners who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant (preferably in the first trimester of pregnancy, but any gestational age is acceptable). OPTIONS: Women and their partners will be able to obtain appropriate genetic carrier screening information and possible diagnosis of AR, AD, or XL disorders (preferably pre-conception), thereby allowing an informed choice regarding genetic carrier screening and reproductive options (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, egg or sperm donation, or adoption). OUTCOMES: Informed reproductive decisions related to genetic carrier screening and reproductive outcomes based on family history, ethnic background, past obstetrical history, known carrier status, or genetic diagnosis. SOGC REPRODUCTIVE CARRIER SCREENING SUMMARY STATEMENT (2016): Pre-conception or prenatal education and counselling for reproductive carrier screening requires a discussion about testing within the three perinatal genetic carrier screening/diagnosis time periods, which include pre-conception, prenatal, and neonatal for conditions currently being screened for and diagnosed. This new information should be added to the standard reproductive carrier screening protocols that are already being utilized by the most responsible maternity provider through the informed consent process with the patient. (III-A; GRADE low/moderate) SOGC OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS QUALITY AND GRADE: There was a strong observational/expert opinion (quality and grade) for the genetic carrier literature with randomized controlled trial evidence being available only for the invasive testing. Both the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care quality and classification and the GRADE evidence quality and grade are provided.

Validation of articles was completed by primary authors RD Wilson and I De Bie. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COST: Benefits are to provide an evidenced based reproductive genetic carrier screening update consensus based on international opinions and publications for the use of Canadian women, who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant and have been identified to be at risk (personal or male partner family or reproductive history) for the transmission of a clinically significant genetic condition to their offspring with associated morbidity and/or mortality. Harm may arise from having counselling and informed testing of the carrier status of the mother, their partner, or their fetus, as well as from declining to have this counselling and informed testing or from not having the opportunity for counselling and informed testing. Costs will ensue both from the provision of opportunities for counselling and testing, as well as when no such opportunities are offered or are declined and the birth of a child with a significant inherited condition and resulting morbidity/mortality occurs; these comprise not only the health care costs to the system but also the social/financial/psychological/emotional costs to the family. These recommendations are based on expert opinion and have not been subjected to a health economics assessment and local or provincial implementation will be required.

BACKGROUND: To determine the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of common genetic disorders in the north Indian population by using next generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: After pre-test counselling, 200 unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened for pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were classified as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were subjected to thorough literature-based curation in addition to the regular filters. Variants of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals were counselled explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening was advised when necessary. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 52 (26%) were found to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were identified to be carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier frequency of one in 17 for one of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2, TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order). Nine individuals were observed to be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency of one in 22. Three individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers for the same disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many disorders (such as deafness, cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were different from those commonly observed in the West. CONCLUSION: A higher carrier frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was unexpected, and contrary to the generally held view about their prevalence in Asian Indians. In spite of the small sample size, this study would suggest that population-based carrier screening panels for India would differ from those in the West, and need to be selected with due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding exons with its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes will detect carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the burden of genetic disorders in India and other resource poor countries.",

The model is based on biochemical data, a multistage and nonlinear dynamic process the BOLD signal and N-acetylaspartate. The existence of multiple steady states explains the triggering effect of the system. The inhibitory effect of the substrate is a necessary factor for the autostabilization of N-acetylaspartate.

Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed. The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital. Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation, a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis.",

                    "text": "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of Canavan disease. OBJECTIVE: Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive disorder which is relatively common in Ashkenazi Jews. It is characterized by developmental delay, severe hypotonia and early death, and is caused by a deficiency of aspartoacylase which is encoded by the ASPA gene. In Ashkenazi Jews, one major mutation (E285A) and one minor mutation (Y231X) account for the majority of cases. The objective of this study was to develop a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) protocol for Canavan disease. METHODS: Two carrier couples requested PGD for Canavan disease. In 1 couple each was a carrier of a different ASPA mutation (Y231X and E285A). In the other couple both were carriers of the minor mutation (Y231X). A single-cell duplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was first developed on single leukocytes obtained from the known carrier parents. Following verification in single leukocytes, clinical PGD was offered to both couples. RESULTS: We evaluated 115 single leukocytes from known carriers and found an allele drop out rate of 1.7% for the fragment harboring the Y231X mutation and 0% for the fragment harboring the E285A mutation. One cycle of PGD was performed in each family. In the first, 11 embryos were successfully analyzed and 4 were found to be affected. Two unaffected embryos were transferred, but no pregnancy resulted. In the other family, 4 embryos were analyzed, 1 was affected, 2 were heterozygotes and 1 was homozygous normal. Following transfer of 2 unaffected embryos, a singleton pregnancy resulted, currently ongoing at 18 weeks gestational age. Amniocentesis performed at 16 weeks confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Reliable PGD for Canavan disease is possible using a single-cell nested PCR approach.",

The course of the illness can show considerable variation, and can sometimes be protracted. It has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is caused by mutations in the gene for aspartoacetylase, localized to the short arm of chromosome 17. The changes in the central nervous system are related to the deficiency of aspartoacyclase which leads to an excess of N-acetylaspartate. Prenatal diagnosis of Canavan disease is possible by the measurement of N-acetylaspartate in the amniotic fluid, but the method of choice is by DNA analysis. If an infant is suspected of having the disease, due to megalencephaly and clinical deterioration, the diagnosis can be confirmed by elevated N-acetylaspartate levels in the urine, blood, and spinal fluid--and in the brain using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neuroradiological investigations confirm the white matter degeneration. Reports of children with megalencephaly, and similar clinical findings, but with normal metabolic tests, are also considered. Until recently treatment was symptomatic, such as the control of seizures, but now there is a possibility though not yet proven, of using gene therapy with modification of the phenotype of brain cells while bypassing the blood-brain barrier and the ependyma. This seems to be well tolerated, and was associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes. The development of knockout mice for Canavan disease should help in the development of gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease and for understanding the pathophysiology.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient suspected for Canavan disease. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out for the proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of the proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal signals in large brain areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1 and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her mother and father. Her phenotypically normal brother has carried a heterozygous c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis by CVS indicated that the fetus was a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant. CONCLUSION: WES can facilitate the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for those lacking specific phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.",

The aim of carrier testing is to identify carrier couples at risk of having offspring with a serious genetic (autosomal recessive) disorder. Carrier couples are offered genetic consultation where their reproductive options, including prenatal diagnosis, are explained. The Ashkenazi Jewish population is at increased risk for several recessively inherited disorders (Tay-Sachs disease, Cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Gaucher disease, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, and Bloom syndrome). Unlike Tay-Sachs disease, there is no simple biochemical or enzymatic test to detect carriers for these other disorders. However, with the rapid identification of disease-causing genes in recent years, DNA-based assays are increasingly available for carrier detection. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries a mutation affecting the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Among the most common of these disorders are the thalassemias. The global birth rate of affected infants is at least 2 per 1000 (in unscreened populations), with the greatest incidence in Southeast Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Carriers are detected by evaluation of red cell indices and morphology, followed by more sophisticated hematological testing and molecular analyses. The following issues need to be considered in the development of a carrier screening program: (1) test selection based on disease severity and test accuracy; (2) funding for testing and genetic counselling; (3) definition of the target population to be screened; (4) development of a public and professional education program; (5) informed consent for screening; and (6) awareness of community needs.",

                    "text": "Joint SOGC-CCMG Opinion for Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening: An Update for All Canadian Providers of Maternity and Reproductive Healthcare in the Era of Direct-to-Consumer Testing. OBJECTIVE: This guideline was written to update Canadian maternity care and reproductive healthcare providers on pre- and postconceptional reproductive carrier screening for women or couples who may be at risk of being carriers for autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD), or X-linked (XL) conditions, with risk of transmission to the fetus. Four previous SOGC- Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) guidelines are updated and merged into the current document. INTENDED USERS: All maternity care (most responsible health provider [MRHP]) and paediatric providers; maternity nursing; nurse practitioner; provincial maternity care administrator; medical student; and postgraduate resident year 1-7. TARGET POPULATION: Fertile, sexually active females and their fertile, sexually active male partners who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant (preferably in the first trimester of pregnancy, but any gestational age is acceptable). OPTIONS: Women and their partners will be able to obtain appropriate genetic carrier screening information and possible diagnosis of AR, AD, or XL disorders (preferably pre-conception), thereby allowing an informed choice regarding genetic carrier screening and reproductive options (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, egg or sperm donation, or adoption). OUTCOMES: Informed reproductive decisions related to genetic carrier screening and reproductive outcomes based on family history, ethnic background, past obstetrical history, known carrier status, or genetic diagnosis. SOGC REPRODUCTIVE CARRIER SCREENING SUMMARY STATEMENT (2016): Pre-conception or prenatal education and counselling for reproductive carrier screening requires a discussion about testing within the three perinatal genetic carrier screening/diagnosis time periods, which include pre-conception, prenatal, and neonatal for conditions currently being screened for and diagnosed. This new information should be added to the standard reproductive carrier screening protocols that are already being utilized by the most responsible maternity provider through the informed consent process with the patient. (III-A; GRADE low/moderate) SOGC OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS QUALITY AND GRADE: There was a strong observational/expert opinion (quality and grade) for the genetic carrier literature with randomized controlled trial evidence being available only for the invasive testing. Both the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care quality and classification and the GRADE evidence quality and grade are provided. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE; PubMed; government neonatal screening websites; key words/common reproductive genetic carrier screened diseases/previous SOGC Guidelines/medical academic societies (Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine [SMFM]; American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG]; CCMG; Royal College Obstetrics and Gynaecology [RCOG] [UK]; American Society of Human Genetics [ASHG]; International Society of Prenatal Diagnosis [ISPD])/provincial neonatal screening policies and programs; search terms (carrier screening, prenatal screening, neonatal genetic/metabolic screening, cystic fibrosis (CF), thalassemia, hemoglobinopathy, hemophilia, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), spinal muscular atrophy, Ashkenazi Jewish carrier screening, genetic carrier screening protocols, AR, AD, XL). SEARCH PERIOD: 10 years (June 2005-September 2015); initial search dates June 30, 2015 and September 15, 2015; completed final search January 4, 2016. Validation of articles was completed by primary authors RD Wilson and I De Bie. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COST: Benefits are to provide an evidenced based reproductive genetic carrier screening update consensus based on international opinions and publications for the use of Canadian women, who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant and have been identified to be at risk (personal or male partner family or reproductive history) for the transmission of a clinically significant genetic condition to their offspring with associated morbidity and/or mortality. Harm may arise from having counselling and informed testing of the carrier status of the mother, their partner, or their fetus, as well as from declining to have this counselling and informed testing or from not having the opportunity for counselling and informed testing. Costs will ensue both from the provision of opportunities for counselling and testing, as well as when no such opportunities are offered or are declined and the birth of a child with a significant inherited condition and resulting morbidity/mortality occurs; these comprise not only the health care costs to the system but also the social/financial/psychological/emotional costs to the family. These recommendations are based on expert opinion and have not been subjected to a health economics assessment and local or provincial implementation will be required. GUIDELINE UPDATE: This guideline is an update of four previous joint SOGC-CCMG Genetic Screening Guidelines dated 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2008 developed by the SOGC Genetic Committee in collaboration with the CCMG Prenatal Diagnosis Committee (now Clinical Practice Committee). 2016 CARRIER SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS.",

It involves a simplified urease pretreatment for sample preparation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (EI, scanning mode) with or without stable isotope dilution. Significant improvements in the recovery of NAA and the GC-MS data-handling device made the assay without stable isotope dilution sensitive and quantitative enough to diagnose CD: Its coefficient of variation (CV) was below 12%. The CV obtained with stable isotope dilution was below 9%. One patient with CD had an abnormal NAA level that was more than 6 S.D. above the mean of the age-matched controls. This diagnostic procedure is accurate for screening and for the chemical diagnosis of CD, with a good cost:benefit ratio. The urinary NAA levels of the healthy controls decreased significantly with age. This change should be considered in making a chemical diagnosis of this disease.",

Canavan disease is a fatal neurological disorder caused by defects in the gene that produces the enzyme aspartoacylase. Enzyme replacement therapy can potentially be used to overcome these defects if a stable enzyme form that can gain access to the appropriate neural cells can be produced. Achieving the proper cellular targeting requires a modified form of aspartoacylase that can traverse the blood-brain barrier. A PEGylated form of aspartoacylase that shows dramatic enhancement in brain tissue access and distribution has been produced. While the mechanism of transport has not yet been established, this modified enzyme is significantly less immunogenic than unmodified aspartoacylase. These improved properties set the stage for more extensive enzyme replacement trials as a possible treatment strategy. ",

Many recessive genetic disorders are found at a higher incidence in people of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent than in the general population. The American College of Medical Genetics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended that individuals of AJ descent undergo carrier screening for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher disease. Although these recommendations have led to increased test volumes and number of laboratories offering AJ screening, well-characterized genomic reference materials are not publicly available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-based Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program, in collaboration with members of the genetic testing community and Coriell Cell Repositories, have developed a panel of characterized genomic reference materials for AJ genetic testing. DNA from 31 cell lines, representing many of the common alleles for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher disease, and glycogen storage disease, was prepared by the Repository and tested in six clinical laboratories using three different PCR-based assay platforms. A total of 33 disease alleles was assayed and 25 different alleles were identified. These characterized materials are publicly available from Coriell and may be used for quality control, proficiency testing, test development, and research.",

CD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the ASPA enzyme. It has been reported with high frequency in patients with Jewish ancestry, and with low frequency in non-Jewish patients. This review will shed light on some updates regarding CD prevalence and causative mutations across the Arab World. CD was reported in several Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Kuwait, and Tunisia. The population with the highest risk is in Saudi Arabia due the prevalent consanguineous marriage culture. In several studies, four novel mutations were found among Arabian CD patients, including two missense mutations (p.C152R, p.C152W), a 3346bp deletion leading to the removal of exon 3 of the ASPA gene, and an insertion mutation (698insC). Other previously reported mutations, which led to damage in the ASPA enzyme activities found among CD Arab patients are c.530 T>C (p.I177T), c.79G>A (p.G27R), IVS4+1G>T, and a 92kb deletion, which is 7.16kb upstream from the ASPA start site. This review will help in developing customized molecular diagnostic approaches and promoting CD carrier screening in the Arab world in areas where consanguineous marriage is common particularly within Saudi Arabia.",

The study enrolled 308 participants suspected of having IEMs. Cases were included based on the presence of any of the following: unexplained convulsions, persistent metabolic acidosis, persistent hypoglycemia, disturbed consciousness, delayed milestones, or family history of previous sibling death with IEMs or sibling death with a history suggestive of IEMs. All participants in the study were subjected to metabolic screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). RESULTS: Out of 308 neonates, 93 (30.2%) were diagnosed with IEMs. The most common diagnosis was phenylketonuria, followed by glutaric aciduria type 1 and maple syrup urine disease (43%, 19.4%, and 14%, respectively). Five patients had Canavan disease, four had medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, three had congenital lactic acidosis, two had methylmalonic acidemia, and two had primary carnitine deficiency. Propionic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, homocystinuria, short-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, B-ketothiolase deficiency, and ketone body utilization defect were diagnosed in one patient each. Most patients improved (73.1%) following proper specific management. CONCLUSION: We recommend newborn screening for IEMs using MS/MS, which may help with the early diagnosis and management of this group of disorders.",

BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) comprise a group of inherited diseases that can have devastating consequences and cause irreversible damage to different body systems and even lead to death.

Leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies comprise a growing group of inherited white matter disorders. Diagnostic rates have improved with increased utilization of next generation sequencing. As treatment options continue to advance for leukodystrophies, so will candidacy for inclusion in the United States' newborn Recommended Universal Screening Panel as was achieved for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.",

This study was designed to model the natural history of Canavan disease using MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( (1)H-MRS). NAA and various indices of brain structure (morphology, quantitative T1, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient) were measured in white and gray matter regions during the progression of Canavan disease. A mixed-effects statistical model was used to fit all outcome measures. Longitudinal data from 28 Canavan patients were directly compared in each brain region with reference data obtained from normal, age-matched pediatric subjects. The resultant model can be used to non-invasively monitor the natural history of Canavan disease or related leukodystrophies in future studies involving drug, gene therapy, or stem cell treatments.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate parenchymal diffusion properties and metabolite ratios in affected brain tissues of inherited neurometabolic brain diseases with an overview of the current literature about the diagnostic data of both techniques in childhood inherited metabolic brain diseases. The study group was consisting, 19 patients (15 males, 4 females; mean age, 54 months (4.5 years); age range, 1-171 months (14.25 years)) diagnosed with inherited neurometabolic brain disease. Single- and multivoxel proton MRS was carried out and NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, mI/Cr, Glx/Cr ratios were calculated. Presence of lactate peak and abnormal different peaks were noted. ADC values were calculated from brain lesions. Results are compared with age and sex matched normal subjects. Elevated NAA/Cr ratio (Canavan disease), galactitol peak (galactosemia) at 3.7 ppm, branched chain amino acids (Maple syrup urine disease-MSUD) at 0.9 ppm were seen on different diseases. In Leigh disease and MSUD restricted diffusion was detected. Different diffusion properties were seen only in one Glutaric aciduria lesions. NAA/Cr ratios and calculated ADC values were significantly different from normal subjects (p<0.05). DWI combined with MRS are complementary methods to routine cranial MRI for evaluating neurometabolic diseases which can give detailed information about neurochemistry of affected brain areas.",

Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by excessive excretion of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in urine. The disease is caused by deficiency of aspartoacylase, the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of NAA into acetate and l-aspartate. Patients, who are often asymptomatic in their early months, show a wide spectrum of clinical presentation thereafter that includes macrocephaly, poor head control, seizures, abnormal muscle tone, optic atrophy, significant developmental delay and death. In this work, we describe a simple liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of NAA in urine. The internal standard d3-NAA was added to untreated urine and the mixture was injected into the LC-MS/MS system operated in the negative ion mode. Detection was achieved in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode by monitoring m/z 174 --> 88, 174 --> 130 and 174 --> 58 for NAA and 177 --> 89 for the internal standard. Separation was carried out on a C8 column (2.1 x 150 mm) using a mixture of acetonitrile and water (1:1 v/v) containing 0.05% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. NAA was eluted at 1.6 min and the run time was approximately 2 min. Using spiked urine, the assay was linear up to 2 mmol/L with limit of quantification at 1 micromol/L (S/N = 12). NAA in patients' urine (n = 17) ranged between 366 and 21,235 mmol/mol creatinine compared to controls of <39 mmol/mol creatinine (n = 159). This LC-MS/MS method for NAA as described involved no extraction and no derivatization, showed no interference, and gave excellent recovery with low variability and short analytical time.",

It involves a simplified urease pretreatment for sample preparation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (EI, scanning mode) with or without stable isotope dilution. Significant improvements in the recovery of NAA and the GC-MS data-handling device made the assay without stable isotope dilution sensitive and quantitative enough to diagnose CD: Its coefficient of variation (CV) was below 12%. The CV obtained with stable isotope dilution was below 9%. One patient with CD had an abnormal NAA level that was more than 6 S.D. above the mean of the age-matched controls. This diagnostic procedure is accurate for screening and for the chemical diagnosis of CD, with a good cost:benefit ratio. The urinary NAA levels of the healthy controls decreased significantly with age. This change should be considered in making a chemical diagnosis of this disease.",

Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy.

                    "text": "Next generation sequencing of RNA reveals novel targets of resveratrol with possible implications for Canavan disease. Resveratrol (RSV) is a small compound first identified as an activator of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a key factor in mediating the effects of caloric restriction. Since then, RSV received great attention for its widespread beneficial effects on health and in connection to many diseases. RSV improves the metabolism and the mitochondrial function, and more recently it was shown to restore fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) capacities in patient fibroblasts harboring mutations with residual enzyme activity. Many of RSV's beneficial effects are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha, a direct target of SIRT1 and a master regulator of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Despite numerous studies RSV's mechanism of action is still not completely elucidated. Our aim was to investigate the effects of RSV on gene regulation on a wide scale, possibly to detect novel genes whose up-regulation by RSV may be of interest with respect to disease treatment. We performed Next Generation Sequencing of RNA on normal fibroblasts treated with RSV. To investigate whether the effects of RSV are mediated through SIRT1 we expanded the analysis to include SIRT1-knockdown fibroblasts. We identified the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, mutated in Canavan disease, to be strongly up-regulated by RSV in several cell lines, including Canavan disease fibroblasts. We further link RSV to the up-regulation of other genes involved in myelination including the glial specific transcription factors POU3F1, POU3F2, and myelin basic protein (MBP). We also observe a strong up-regulation by RSV of the riboflavin transporter gene SLC52a1. Mutations in SLC52a1 cause transient multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Our analysis of alternative splicing identified novel metabolically important genes affected by RSV, among which is particularly interesting the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsalpha), which regulates the cellular levels of cAMP through adenylyl cyclase. We conclude that in fibroblasts RSV stimulates the PGC-1alpha and p53 pathways, and up-regulates genes affecting the glucose metabolism, mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. We further confirm that RSV might be a relevant treatment in the correction of FAO deficiencies and we suggest that treatment in other metabolic disorders including Canavan disease and MADD might be also beneficial.",

Resveratrol (RSV) is a small compound first identified as an activator of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a key factor in mediating the effects of caloric restriction. Since then, RSV received great attention for its widespread beneficial effects on health and in connection to many diseases. RSV improves the metabolism and the mitochondrial function, and more recently it was shown to restore fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) capacities in patient fibroblasts harboring mutations with residual enzyme activity. Many of RSV's beneficial effects are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha, a direct target of SIRT1 and a master regulator of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Despite numerous studies RSV's mechanism of action is still not completely elucidated. Our aim was to investigate the effects of RSV on gene regulation on a wide scale, possibly to detect novel genes whose up-regulation by RSV may be of interest with respect to disease treatment. We performed Next Generation Sequencing of RNA on normal fibroblasts treated with RSV. To investigate whether the effects of RSV are mediated through SIRT1 we expanded the analysis to include SIRT1-knockdown fibroblasts. We identified the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, mutated in Canavan disease, to be strongly up-regulated by RSV in several cell lines, including Canavan disease fibroblasts. We further link RSV to the up-regulation of other genes involved in myelination including the glial specific transcription factors POU3F1, POU3F2, and myelin basic protein (MBP). We also observe a strong up-regulation by RSV of the riboflavin transporter gene SLC52a1. Mutations in SLC52a1 cause transient multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Our analysis of alternative splicing identified novel metabolically important genes affected by RSV, among which is particularly interesting the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsalpha), which regulates the cellular levels of cAMP through adenylyl cyclase. We conclude that in fibroblasts RSV stimulates the PGC-1alpha and p53 pathways, and up-regulates genes affecting the glucose metabolism, mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. We further confirm that RSV might be a relevant treatment in the correction of FAO deficiencies and we suggest that treatment in other metabolic disorders including Canavan disease and MADD might be also beneficial.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient suspected for Canavan disease. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out for the proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of the proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal signals in large brain areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1 and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her mother and father. Her phenotypically normal brother has carried a heterozygous c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis by CVS indicated that the fetus was a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant. CONCLUSION: WES can facilitate the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for those lacking specific phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.",

OBJECTIVES: To set up a novel simple, sensitive, and reliable ion-pairing HPLC method for the synchronous separation of several purines, pyrimidines, N-acetylated amino acids, and dicarboxylic acids for the chemical diagnosis and screening of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). DESIGN AND METHODS: The separation was set up using a Hypersil C-18, 5-microm particle size, 250 x 4.6 mm column, and a step gradient using two buffers and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as the pairing reagent. A highly sensitive diode array UV detector was set up at a wavelength between 200 and 300 nm that revealed purines and pyrimidines at 260 nm and other compounds at 206 nm. RESULTS: Compounds were determined in the plasma of 15 healthy adults, in the urine of 50 healthy subjects (1-3 years, 4-6 years, 8-10 years, 12-18 years, 25-35 years), and in 10 non-pathological amniotic fluid samples. To assess the validity of the chemical diagnosis of IEM, plasma and urine samples were analyzed in patients affected by Canavan disease (n = 10; mean age 4.6 +/- 2.3). Low plasma levels of N-acetylaspartate (16.96 +/- 19.57 micromol/L plasma; not detectable in healthy adults) and dramatically high urinary N-acetylaspartate concentrations (1872.03 +/- 631.86 micromol/mmol creatinine; 450 times higher than that which was observed in age-matched controls) were recorded. Neither N-acetylglutamate nor N-acetylaspartylglutamate could be detected in the plasma or urine of controls or patients with Canavan disease. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the suitability of the present ion-pairing HPLC separation with UV detection of cytosine, cytidine, creatinine, uracil, uridine, beta-pseudouridine, adenine, 3-methyladenine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, xanthosine, inosine, guanosine, ascorbic acid, thymine, thymidine, uric acid, 1-methyluric acid, orotic acid, N-acetylaspartate, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, malonic acid, methylmalonic acid, GSH, and GSSG as a reliable method for the prenatal and neonatal chemical diagnosis and screening of IEM using biological fluids.",

                    "text": "Canavan disease: a monogenic trait with complex genomic interaction. Canavan disease (CD) is an inherited leukodystrophy, caused by aspartoacylase (ASPA) deficiency, and accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. The gene for ASPA has been cloned and more than 40 mutations have been described, with two founder mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Screening of Ashkenazi Jews for these two common mutations revealed a high carrier frequency, approximately 1/40, so that programs for carrier testing are currently in practice. The enzyme deficiency in CD interferes with the normal hydrolysis of NAA, which results in disruption of myelin and spongy degeneration of the white matter of the brain. The clinical features of the disease are macrocephaly, head lag, progressive severe mental retardation, and hypotonia in early life, which later changes to spasticity. A knockout mouse for CD has been generated, and used to study the pathophysiological basis for CD. Findings from the knockout mouse indicate that this monogenic trait leads to a series of genomic interaction in the brain. Changes include low levels of glutamate and GABA. Microarray expression analysis showed low level of expression of GABA-A receptor (GABRA6) and glutamate transporter (EAAT4). The gene Spi2, a gene involved in apoptosis and cell death, showed high level of expression. Such complexity of gene interaction results in the phenotype, the proteome, with spongy degeneration of the brain and neurological impairment of the mouse, similar to the human counterpart. Aspartoacylase gene transfer trial in the mouse brain using adenoassociated virus (AAV) as a vector are encouraging showing improved myelination and decrease in spongy degeneration in the area of the injection and also beyond that site.",

OBJECTIVES: To set up a novel simple, sensitive, and reliable ion-pairing HPLC method for the synchronous separation of several purines, pyrimidines, N-acetylated amino acids, and dicarboxylic acids for the chemical diagnosis and screening of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). DESIGN AND METHODS: The separation was set up using a Hypersil C-18, 5-microm particle size, 250 x 4.6 mm column, and a step gradient using two buffers and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as the pairing reagent. A highly sensitive diode array UV detector was set up at a wavelength between 200 and 300 nm that revealed purines and pyrimidines at 260 nm and other compounds at 206 nm. RESULTS: Compounds were determined in the plasma of 15 healthy adults, in the urine of 50 healthy subjects (1-3 years, 4-6 years, 8-10 years, 12-18 years, 25-35 years), and in 10 non-pathological amniotic fluid samples. To assess the validity of the chemical diagnosis of IEM, plasma and urine samples were analyzed in patients affected by Canavan disease (n = 10; mean age 4.6 +/- 2.3). Low plasma levels of N-acetylaspartate (16.96 +/- 19.57 micromol/L plasma; not detectable in healthy adults) and dramatically high urinary N-acetylaspartate concentrations (1872.03 +/- 631.86 micromol/mmol creatinine; 450 times higher than that which was observed in age-matched controls) were recorded. Neither N-acetylglutamate nor N-acetylaspartylglutamate could be detected in the plasma or urine of controls or patients with Canavan disease. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the suitability of the present ion-pairing HPLC separation with UV detection of cytosine, cytidine, creatinine, uracil, uridine, beta-pseudouridine, adenine, 3-methyladenine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, xanthosine, inosine, guanosine, ascorbic acid, thymine, thymidine, uric acid, 1-methyluric acid, orotic acid, N-acetylaspartate, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, malonic acid, methylmalonic acid, GSH, and GSSG as a reliable method for the prenatal and neonatal chemical diagnosis and screening of IEM using biological fluids.",

Canavan disease (CD), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene. In the present study, the ASPA gene was analyzed in 24 non-Jewish patients with CD from 23 unrelated families. Within this cohort, we found three large novel deletions of approximate 92, 56, and 12.13 kb in length, using both self-ligation of restriction endonuclease-digested DNA fragments with long-distance inverse PCR and multiplex dosage quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA. The 92 kb large deletion results in complete absence of the ASPA gene in one homozygous and one compound heterozygous patient, respectively. The 56 kb large deletion causes absence of the majority of the ASPA gene except for exon 1 alone in a compound heterozygous patient. The 12.13 kb deletion involves deletion of the ASPA gene from intron 3 to intron 5 including exons 4 and 5 (I3 to E4E5I5) in a compound heterozygous patient. Patients with the three large deletions clinically manifested severe symptoms at birth, including seizures. Our study showed that the combined use of long-distance inverse PCR and multiplex dosage quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA is a helpful and rapid technique to search for large deletions, particularly for detection of large deletions in compound heterozygous patients.",

Leukodystrophies (LDs) are a heterogeneous group of progressive neurological disorders and characterized by primary involvement of white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). This is the first report of the Iranian LD Registry database to describe the clinical, radiological, and genomic data of Persian patients with leukodystrophies. From 2016 to 2019, patients suspicious of LDs were examined followed by a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A single gene testing or whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used depending on the neuroradiologic phenotypes. In a few cases, the diagnosis was made by metabolic studies. Based on the MRI pattern, diagnosed patients were divided into cohorts A (hypomyelinating LDs) versus cohort B (Other LDs). The most recent LD classification was utilized for classification of diagnosed patients. For novel variants, in silico analyses were performed to verify their pathogenicity. Out of 680 registered patients, 342 completed the diagnostic evaluations. In total, 245 patients met a diagnosis which in turn 24.5% were categorized in cohort A and the remaining in cohort B. Genetic tests revealed causal variants in 228 patients consisting of 213 variants in 110 genes with 78 novel variants. WES and single gene testing identified a causal variant in 65.5% and 34.5% cases, respectively. The total diagnostic rate of WES was 60.7%. Lysosomal disorders (27.3%; GM2-gangliosidosis-9.8%, MLD-6.1%, KD-4.5%), amino and organic acid disorders (17.15%; Canavan disease-4.5%, L-2-HGA-3.6%), mitochondrial leukodystrophies (12.6%), ion and water homeostasis disorders (7.3%; MLC-4.5%), peroxisomal disorders (6.5%; X-ALD-3.6%), and myelin protein disorders (3.6%; PMLD-3.6%) were the most commonly diagnosed disorders. Thirty-seven percent of cases had a pathogenic variant in nine genes (ARSA, HEXA, ASPA, MLC1, GALC, GJC2, ABCD1, L2HGDH, GCDH). This study highlights the most common types as well as the genetic heterogeneity of LDs in Iranian children.",

                    "text": "Knock-out mouse for Canavan disease: a model for gene transfer to the central nervous system. BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

                    "text": "Developmental increase of aspartoacylase in oligodendrocytes parallels CNS myelination. Canavan disease, an autosomal-recessive neurogenetic disorder, is caused by mutations in aspartoacylase, an enzyme that deacetylates N-acetylaspartate to generate free acetate in the brain. Earlier studies have shown that aspartoacylase is primarily restricted to myelin synthesizing cells (oligodendroglia) in the CNS. These findings have led us to investigate the developmental expression of aspartoacylase gene in the rat brain in an attempt to shed more light on the role of this enzyme in myelination. In situ hybridization using a 35S riboprobe based on murine aspartoacylase cDNA was used in this study. The probe hybridized mostly to the white matter tracts with different densities depending on the age of the animal and region of the brain examined. Little or no hybridization signals were detected in the 1-day-old rats, whereas the signal was clearly detectable in most of the white matter regions of the CNS in the 11-day-old rats. The signal density markedly increased at postnatal day 17, the peak of myelination. Thereafter, the hybridization signals decreased somewhat but still could be observed in the adult animals. Thus, the developmental expression pattern of aspartoacylase gene in the postnatal brain closely parallels myelination in the CNS. In the CNS, the hybridization signal of ASPA appeared to be restricted primarily to oligodendrocytes, the primary myelin synthesizing cell type in the CNS. However, the signal was not detectable in rat sciatic nerve (Schwann cells) of the peripheral nervous system. These findings indicate that the role of N-acetylaspartate in myelin synthesis is restricted to the CNS. Furthermore, they provide additional support for the acetate deficiency hypothesis of Canavan disease and also make a stronger case for acetate supplementation as an immediate and inexpensive therapy for Canavan disease.",

Genetic mutations that severely diminish the activity of aspartoacylase (ASPA) result in the fatal brain dysmyelinating disorder, Canavan disease. There is no effective treatment. ASPA produces free acetate from the concentrated brain metabolite, N-acetylaspartate (NAA). Because acetyl coenzyme A is a key building block for lipid synthesis, we postulated that the inability to catabolize NAA leads to a brain acetate deficiency during a critical period of CNS development, impairing myelination and possibly other aspects of brain development. We tested the hypothesis that acetate supplementation during postnatal myelination would ameliorate the severe phenotype associated with ASPA deficiency using the tremor rat model of Canavan disease. Glyceryltriacetate (GTA) was administered orally to tremor rats starting 7 days after birth, and was continued in food and water after weaning. Motor function, myelin lipids, and brain vacuolation were analyzed in GTA-treated and untreated tremor rats. Significant improvements were observed in motor performance and myelin galactocerebroside content in tremor rats treated with GTA. Further, brain vacuolation was modestly reduced, and these reductions were positively correlated with improved motor performance. We also examined the expression of the acetyl coenzyme A synthesizing enzyme acetyl coenzyme A synthase 1 and found upregulation of expression in tremor rats, with a return to near normal expression levels in GTA-treated tremor rats. These results confirm the critical role played by NAA-derived acetate in brain myelination and development, and demonstrate the potential usefulness of acetate therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease.",

                    "text": "Immunohistochemical localization of aspartoacylase in the rat central nervous system. Aspartoacylase (ASPA; EC 3.5.1.15) catalyzes deacetylation of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to generate free acetate in the central nervous system (CNS). Mutations in the gene coding ASPA cause Canavan disease (CD), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease that results in death before 10 years of age. The pathogenesis of CD remains unclear. Our working hypothesis is that deficiency in the supply of the NAA-derived acetate leads to inadequate lipid/myelin synthesis during development, resulting in CD. To explore the localization of ASPA in the CNS, we used double-label immunohistochemistry for ASPA and several cell-specific markers. A polyclonal antibody was generated in rabbit against mouse recombinant ASPA, which reacted with a single band (approximately 37 kD) on Western blots of rat brain homogenate. ASPA colocalized throughout the brain with CC1, a marker for oligodendrocytes, with 92-98% of CC1-positive cells also reactive with the ASPA antibody. Many cells were labeled with ASPA antibodies in white matter, including cells in the corpus callosum and cerebellar white matter. Relatively fewer cells were labeled in gray matter, including cerebral cortex. No astrocytes were labeled for ASPA. Neurons were unstained in the forebrain, although small numbers of large reticular and motor neurons were faintly to moderately stained in the brainstem and spinal cord. Many ascending and descending neuronal fibers were moderately stained for ASPA in the medulla and spinal cord. Microglial-like cells showed faint to moderate staining with the ASPA antibodies throughout the brain by the avidin/biotin-peroxidase detection method, and colocalization studies with labeled lectins confirmed their identity as microglia. The predominant immunoreactivity in oligodendrocytes is consistent with the proposed role of ASPA in myelination, supporting the case for acetate supplementation as an immediate and inexpensive therapy for infants diagnosed with CD.",

                    "text": "Triacetin-based acetate supplementation as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant therapy in glioma. Cancer is associated with epigenetic (i.e., histone hypoacetylation) and metabolic (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) alterations. Levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of acetate in the brain, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis to generate acetate, are reduced in glioma; yet, few studies have investigated acetate as a potential therapeutic agent. This preclinical study sought to test the efficacy of the food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) as a novel therapy to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of GTA, compared to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA), were assessed in established human glioma cell lines (HOG and Hs683 oligodendroglioma, U87 and U251 glioblastoma) and primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), relative to an oligodendrocyte progenitor line (Oli-Neu), normal astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. GTA was also tested as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant with temozolomide (TMZ) in orthotopically grafted GSCs. GTA-induced cytostatic growth arrest in vitro comparable to Vorinostat, but, unlike Vorinostat, GTA did not alter astrocyte growth and promoted NSC expansion. GTA alone increased survival of mice engrafted with glioblastoma GSCs and potentiated TMZ to extend survival longer than TMZ alone. GTA was most effective on GSCs with a mesenchymal cell phenotype. Given that GTA has been chronically administered safely to infants with Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation, GTA-mediated acetate supplementation may provide a novel, safe chemotherapeutic adjuvant to reduce the growth of glioma tumors, most notably the more rapidly proliferating, glycolytic and hypoacetylated mesenchymal glioma tumors.",

With the ultimate goal of developing safe and effective in vivo gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease and other neurological disorders, we developed a non-viral lipid-entrapped, polycation-condensed delivery system (LPD) for central nervous system gene transfer, in conjunction with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based plasmids containing recombinant aspartoacylase (ASPA). The gene delivery system was tested in healthy rodents and primates, before proceeding to preliminary studies in 2 children with Canavan disease. Toxicity and expression testing was first carried out in human 293 cells, which demonstrated effective transduction of cells and high levels of functional ASPA activity. We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches. Finally, we performed the first in vivo gene transfer study for a human neurodegenerative disease in 2 children with Canavan disease to assess the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ASPA gene delivery. Our results suggest that LPD/pAAVaspa is well tolerated in human subjects and is associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes.",

Stem cell therapies have become standard of care for selected leukodystrophies. However, transplantation-related risks remain high and outcomes are not fully satisfactory. Transduction of autologous hematopoietic stem cells with lentiviral vectors, referred to as ex vivo gene therapy, circumvents some, but not all, of the risks of traditional transplantation and has recently been demonstrated to be safe and efficective in clinical studies of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gene therapy, through direct infusion of adeno-associated virus vectors, has emerged as a safer alternative for many monogenetic pediatric neurological disorders. Numerous preclinical studies have shown safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus gene therapy in leukodystrophies allowing expanded access treatment for Canavan disease prior to initiation of a clinical trial. For inherited white matter disorders resulting from overexpression of a protein, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, emerging RNA therapies have shown success in preclinical studies and promise for rapid translation to the clinic. Lastly, small molecule and protein therapies remain a long-term treatment option for a number of leukodystrophies, including intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Herein we review recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of inherited white matter disorders.",

Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to spongy degeneration in the white matter of the brain. Aspartoacylase (ASPA) synthesizing cells, oligodendrocytes, are lost in CD. Transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) offers an interesting therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases by replacing the lost cells. Therefore, the NPCs transplantation to the brain of the CD mouse was studied. Injection of mouse NPCs to the striatum and cerebellum of juvenile CD mouse showed numerous BrdU positive cells at 1 month after injection. The same result was also observed in the adult CD mouse brain after 5 weeks of post-transplantation period. The implanted cells differentiated into oligodendrocytes and fibrous astrocytes, as observed using glial cell marker.

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary adult malignant brain tumor, is associated with a poor prognosis due, in part, to tumor recurrence mediated by chemotherapy and radiation resistant glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). The metabolic and epigenetic state of GSCs differs from their non-GSC counterparts, with GSCs exhibiting greater glycolytic metabolism and global hypoacetylation. However, little attention has been focused on the potential use of acetate supplementation as a therapeutic approach. N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of brain acetate, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis, are significantly reduced in GBM tumors. We recently demonstrated that NAA supplementation is not an appropriate therapeutic approach since it increases GSC proliferation and pursued an alternative acetate source. The FDA approved food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) has been safely used for acetate supplementation therapy in Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation. This study characterized the effects of GTA on the proliferation and differentiation of six primary GBM-derived GSCs relative to established U87 and U251 GBM cell lines, normal human cerebral cortical astrocytes, and murine neural stem cells. GTA reduced proliferation of GSCs greater than established GBM lines. Moreover, GTA reduced growth of the more aggressive mesenchymal GSCs greater than proneural GSCs. Although sodium acetate induced a dose-dependent reduction of GSC growth, it also reduced cell viability. GTA-mediated growth inhibition was not associated with differentiation, but increased protein acetylation. These data suggest that GTA-mediated acetate supplementation is a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit GSC growth.",

Levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of acetate in the brain, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis to generate acetate, are reduced in glioma; yet, few studies have investigated acetate as a potential therapeutic agent. This preclinical study sought to test the efficacy of the food additive Triacetin (glyceryl triacetate, GTA) as a novel therapy to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of GTA, compared to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat (SAHA), were assessed in established human glioma cell lines (HOG and Hs683 oligodendroglioma, U87 and U251 glioblastoma) and primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), relative to an oligodendrocyte progenitor line (Oli-Neu), normal astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. GTA was also tested as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant with temozolomide (TMZ) in orthotopically grafted GSCs. GTA-induced cytostatic growth arrest in vitro comparable to Vorinostat, but, unlike Vorinostat, GTA did not alter astrocyte growth and promoted NSC expansion. GTA alone increased survival of mice engrafted with glioblastoma GSCs and potentiated TMZ to extend survival longer than TMZ alone. GTA was most effective on GSCs with a mesenchymal cell phenotype. Given that GTA has been chronically administered safely to infants with Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation, GTA-mediated acetate supplementation may provide a novel, safe chemotherapeutic adjuvant to reduce the growth of glioma tumors, most notably the more rapidly proliferating, glycolytic and hypoacetylated mesenchymal glioma tumors.",

Canavan disease (CD; MIM 271,900) or spongy degeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) is a lethal, rare autosomal recessive leukodystrophy, first described in 1931 (Canavan in Arch Neurol Psychiatry 25: 299-308, 1931). The clinical presentation includes severe neurologic impairment and macrocephaly with onset of symptoms at the age of 3-5 months. Biochemical and genetic fundamentals of the disease are elucidated. Imaging diagnosis is principally based on MRI with important role of MR spectroscopy. We report the cerebral sonographic findings in a severely affected infant with CD: Diffuse hyperechogenicity and small multicystic changes of white matter as well as an inverted pattern of echogenicity between cortical gray and subcortical white matter. These findings are compared to to the few cases found in literature and to normal ultrasound examples. Finally, ultrasound and MRI imaging findings are correlated.",

BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) have been detected worldwide using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) since the 1980s, but few related reports exist on the incidence, spectrum, and clinical presentation features of IEM in southern China. METHOD: From January 2009 to March 2012, 16,075 urine samples were collected from patients who were highly suspected of having IEM in Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. The specimens were evaluated using GC-MS. RESULTS: We diagnosed 303 cases of IEM by urine GC-MS analysis, including 197 cases with amino acid disorders, 86 cases with organic acidurias (OAs), 10 cases with fatty acid oxidative (FAO) disorders, and 10 cases with peroxisomal disorders. Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) was the most common (153 cases), followed by methylmalonic aciduria (48 cases), urea cycle disorders (21 cases), phenylketonuria (20 cases), propionic aciduria (11 cases), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (10 cases), multiple carboxylase deficiency (8 cases), glutaric aciduria type I (7 cases), isovaleric aciduria (6 cases), glutaric aciduria type II (4 cases), short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (4 cases), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria (3 cases), maple syrup urine disease (2 cases), very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (1 case), malonic aciduria (1 case), mevalonic aciduria (1 case), Canavan disease (1 case), lysine protein intolerance (1 case), and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (1 case).

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient suspected for Canavan disease. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out for the proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of the proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal signals in large brain areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1 and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her mother and father. Her phenotypically normal brother has carried a heterozygous c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis by CVS indicated that the fetus was a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant. CONCLUSION: WES can facilitate the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for those lacking specific phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.",

With the ultimate goal of developing safe and effective in vivo gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease and other neurological disorders, we developed a non-viral lipid-entrapped, polycation-condensed delivery system (LPD) for central nervous system gene transfer, in conjunction with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based plasmids containing recombinant aspartoacylase (ASPA). The gene delivery system was tested in healthy rodents and primates, before proceeding to preliminary studies in 2 children with Canavan disease. Toxicity and expression testing was first carried out in human 293 cells, which demonstrated effective transduction of cells and high levels of functional ASPA activity. We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches. Finally, we performed the first in vivo gene transfer study for a human neurodegenerative disease in 2 children with Canavan disease to assess the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ASPA gene delivery. Our results suggest that LPD/pAAVaspa is well tolerated in human subjects and is associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes.",

Canavan disease (CD) is a debilitating and lethal leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene and the resulting defect in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) metabolism in the CNS and peripheral tissues. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and widely transduce the CNS. We developed a rAAV-based and optimized gene replacement therapy, which achieves early, complete, and sustained rescue of the lethal disease phenotype in CD mice. Our treatment results in a super-mouse phenotype, increasing motor performance of treated CD mice beyond that of WT control mice. We demonstrate that this rescue is oligodendrocyte independent, and that gene correction in astrocytes is sufficient, suggesting that the establishment of an astrocyte-based alternative metabolic sink for NAA is a key mechanism for efficacious disease rescue and the super-mouse phenotype. Importantly, the use of clinically translatable high-field imaging tools enables the noninvasive monitoring and prediction of therapeutic outcomes for CD and might enable further investigation of NAA-related cognitive function.",

With the ultimate goal of developing safe and effective in vivo gene therapy for the treatment of Canavan disease and other neurological disorders, we developed a non-viral lipid-entrapped, polycation-condensed delivery system (LPD) for central nervous system gene transfer, in conjunction with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based plasmids containing recombinant aspartoacylase (ASPA). The gene delivery system was tested in healthy rodents and primates, before proceeding to preliminary studies in 2 children with Canavan disease. Toxicity and expression testing was first carried out in human 293 cells, which demonstrated effective transduction of cells and high levels of functional ASPA activity. We performed in vivo toxicity and expression testing of LPD/pAAVaspa and LPD/pAAVlac in rodents, which demonstrated widespread gene expression for more than 10 months after intraventricular delivery, and local expression in deep brain nuclei and white matter tracts for more than 6 months after intraparenchymal injections, with no significant adverse effects. We also performed intraventricular delivery of LPD/pAAVaspa to 2 cynomologous monkeys, with 2 additional monkeys receiving LPD and saline controls. None of the monkeys demonstrated significant adverse effects, and at 1 month the 2 LPD/pAAVaspa monkeys were positive for human ASPA transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of brain tissue punches. Finally, we performed the first in vivo gene transfer study for a human neurodegenerative disease in 2 children with Canavan disease to assess the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of ASPA gene delivery. Our results suggest that LPD/pAAVaspa is well tolerated in human subjects and is associated with biochemical, radiological, and clinical changes.",

Gene therapy for the nervous system is a newly emerging field with special issues related to modes of delivery, potential toxicity, and realistic expectations for treatment of this vital and highly complex tissue. This review focuses on the potential for gene delivery to the brain, as well as possible risks and benefits of these procedures. This includes discussion of appropriate vectors, such as adeno-associated virus, lentivirus, gutless adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus hybrid amplicons, and cell vehicles, such as neuroprogenitor cells. Routes of delivery for focal and global diseases are enumerated, including use of migratory cells, facilitation of vascular delivery across the blood-brain barrier, cerebrospinal fluid delivery, and convection injection. Attention is given to examples of diseases falling into different etiologic types: metabolic deficiency states, including Canavan disease and lysosomal storage disorders; and degenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.",

Canavan disease (CD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by early onset progressive spongy degeneration of the brain involving the axon's myelin sheath. Patients with CD have leukoencephalopathy and megalencephaly; clinically they show a variable course ranging from slow neurodegenerative course to no neurological development or rapid regression. Current treatment is symptomatic including management of seizures and spasticity. Topiramate (TPM) is a novel antiepileptic drug for treatment of a broad spectrum of seizure types in adults and children. We used TPM in two of our patients diagnosed with CD at six months of age. At seven months and 15 months' follow-up, respectively, each patient showed a decrease in head growth velocity. We suggest that TPM can be used in patients with CD and possibly in other childhood neurodegenerative diseases with leukoencephalopathy and megalencephaly. Further studies are required to reveal the underlying mechanisms that lead to decreased head growth velocity, and to conclude whether this ameliorates the clinical course of CD.",

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) have traditionally been the most difficult to treat by traditional pharmacological methods, due mostly to the blood-brain barrier and the difficulties associated with repeated drug administration targeting the CNS. Viral vector gene transfer represents a way to permanently provide a therapeutic protein within the nervous system after a single administration, whether this be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or a disease-modifying protein for a disease such as Parkinson's. Gene therapy approaches for CNS disorders has evolved considerably over the last two decades. Although a breakthrough treatment has remained elusive, current strategies are now considerably safer and potentially much more effective. This chapter will explore the past, current, and future status of CNS gene therapy, focusing on clinical trials utilizing adeno-associated virus and lentiviral vectors. ",

The past few years have witnessed rapid developments in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders. Here, we provide pediatric neurologists with an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of these developments and note emerging trends for future research. This review presents the different types of viral vectors used in viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the fundamental properties of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy; the challenges associated with the use of this therapy in the central nervous system; the pathway for therapy development, from translational basic science studies to clinical trials; and an overview of the therapies that have reached clinical trials in patients. Current viral platforms under investigation include adenovirus vectors, adeno-associated viral vectors, lentiviral/retroviral vectors, and herpes simplex virus type 1 vectors. This review also presents an in-depth analysis of numerous studies that investigated these viral platforms in cultured cells and in transgenic animal models for pediatric neurogenetic disorders. Viral vectors have been applied to clinical trials for many different pediatric neurogenetic disorders, including Canavan disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis III, spinal muscular atrophy, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Of these diseases, only spinal muscular atrophy has a viral-mediated gene replacement therapy approved for marketing. Despite significant progress in therapy development, many challenges remain. Surmounting these challenges is critical to advancing the current status of viral-mediated gene replacement therapy for pediatric central nervous system neurogenetic disorders.",

Leukodystrophies are a group of disorders characterized by myelin dysfunction, either at the level of myelin formation or maintenance, that affect the central nervous system (CNS) and also in some cases, to a lesser extent, the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Although these genetic-based  disorders are generally rare, all together they have a significant impact in the society, with an estimated overall incidence of 1 in 7,663 live births. Currently, there is no cure for leukodystrophies, and the development of effective treatments remains challenging. Not only leukodystrophies  generally progress very fast, but also most are multifocal needing the simultaneous targeting at multiple sites. Moreover, as the CNS is affected, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the efficacy of treatment. Recently, interest on cell therapy has increased, and the leukodystrophies  for which metabolic correction is needed have become first-choice candidates for cell-based clinical trials. In this review, we present and discuss the available cell transplantation therapies in metabolic leukodystrophies including fucosidosis, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic  leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, and Krabbe's disease. We will discuss the latest advances of cell therapy and its pitfalls in this group of disorders, taking into account, among others, the limitations imposed by reduced cell migration in multifocal conditions, the need to achieve corrective  enzyme threshold levels, and the growing awareness that not only myelin but also the associated axonopathy needs to be targeted in some leukodystrophies.",

Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to spongy degeneration in the white matter of the brain. Aspartoacylase (ASPA) synthesizing cells, oligodendrocytes, are lost in CD. Transplantation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) offers an interesting therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases by replacing the lost cells. Therefore, the NPCs transplantation to the brain of the CD mouse was studied. Injection of mouse NPCs to the striatum and cerebellum of juvenile CD mouse showed numerous BrdU positive cells at 1 month after injection. The same result was also observed in the adult CD mouse brain after 5 weeks of post-transplantation period. The implanted cells differentiated into oligodendrocytes and fibrous astrocytes, as observed using glial cell marker. This is the first report to describe the survival, distribution and differentiation of NPCs within the brain of CD mouse and a first step toward the potential clinical use of cell therapy to treat CD.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually shows diffuse white matter abnormalities with involvement of the basal ganglia. Mild forms of the disease with a more favorable clinical course and radiological involvement of the basal ganglia without white matter abnormalities have also been reported. Here we report an atypical case of a girl aged nine years with CD. The disease started at the classical age of five months. Classical elevation of NAA in brain and urine was present and genetic analysis identified mutations in the ASPA gene. However, clinical evolution was milder than typical CD, with partial motor impairment and relatively well-preserved cognitive skills.

PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of amplicons size and cell type on allele dropout and amplification failures in single-cell based molecular diagnosis. METHODS: 730 single lymphocytes and amniotic cells were collected from known heterozygotes individuals to one of the common Ashkenazi Jewish mutations: 1278+TATC and IVS12+1G>C which cause Tay Sachs Disease, IVS20+6T and 854A>C which underlie Familial Dysautonomia and Canavan Disease. DNA was extracted and analyzed by our routine methods. RESULTS: Reduced rates of allele dropout and amplification failure were found when smaller amplification product were designed and in amniotic cultured cells compared to peripheral lymphocytes. Cultured lymphocytes, induced to divide, demonstrated significantly less allele dropout than non induced lymphocytes suggesting the role of division potential on amplification efficiency. CONCLUSION: Single cell based diagnosis should be designed for each mutation. Minimal sized amplicons and cell having division potential should be preferred, as well as sensitive techniques to detect preferential amplification.",

This study evaluates the genetic spectrum of leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies in Iran. 152 children, aged from 1 day to 15 years, were genetically tested for leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies based on clinical and neuroradiological findings from 2016 to 2019. Patients with a suggestive specific leukodystrophy, e. g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, Tay-Sachs disease were tested for mutations in single genes (108; 71%) while patients with less suggestive findings were evaluated by NGS. 108 of 152(71%) had MRI patterns and clinical findings suggestive of a known leukodystrophy. In total, 114(75%) affected individuals had (likely) pathogenic variants which included 38 novel variants. 35 different types of leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies were identified. The more common identified disorders included metachromatic leukodystrophy (19 of 152; 13%), Canavan disease (12; 8%), Tay-Sachs disease (11; 7%), megalencephalic leukodystrophy with subcortical cysts (7; 5%), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (8; 5%), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1 (8; 5%), Sandhoff disease (6; 4%), Krabbe disease (5; 3%), and vanishing white matter disease (4; 3%). Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed 90% leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies. The total diagnosis rate was 75%. This unique study presents a national genetic data of leukodystrophies; it may provide clues to the genetic pool of neighboring countries. Patients with clinical and neuroradiological evidence of a genetic leukoencephalopathy should undergo a genetic analysis to reach a definitive diagnosis. This will allow a diagnosis at earlier stages of the disease, reduce the burden of uncertainty and costs, and will provide the basis for genetic counseling and family planning.",

Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed. The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital. Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation, a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis.",

Astrocytic dysfunctions have been recently identified in four leukosdystrophies without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Alexander disease, the first primary genetic astrocytic disorder identified, is due to dominant GFAP mutations. The presence of Rosenthal fibers throughout the CNS is the pathological hallmark of this disease. Neurological degradation, megalencephaly, and typical MRI pattern are characteristic of infantile sporadic patients. Nevertheless, clinical and MRI expression is large, including late onset forms which can be familial. Spongiform or cystic white matter CNS degeneration is present in the other three recessive disorders. The visualization of a white matter cystic breakdown on MRI has led to the identification of CACH/VWM and MLC diseases. CACH/VWM is due to mutations in one of the five subunits of EIF2B which compromise the astrocytic lineage. The clinical spectrum is large, from antenatal to adult forms, and several extraneurological organs can be affected. Mutations in MLC1, which is mainly expressed in astrocyte endfeet, produce megalencephaly, whereas the mild clinical course contrasts with severe MRI features.

Canavan disease is characterised as a rare, neurodegenerative disease that usually causes death in early childhood. It is an autosomal recessive disorder due to an aspartoacylase (ASPA) deficiency. The causative gene has been mapped to chromosome 17 pter-p13. Here we describe three affected children from two Greek families with an unusually mild course of Canavan disease. All children presented with muscular hypotonia and macrocephaly. Diagnosis was based on elevated N-acetylaspartate in urine, reduced aspartoacylase activity in fibroblasts, and marked white matter changes on cerebral imaging. All three affected individuals exhibited continuous psychomotor development without any regression. Genetic analyses revealed compound heterozygous mutations (Y288 C; F295 S) in two individuals. The Y288 C variant was previously described in a child with macrocephaly, mild developmental delay, increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia, partial cortical blindness and retinitis pigmentosa, and slightly elevated N-acetylaspartate in the urine. Demonstration of the same variant in two unusually mildly affected Canavan disease patients and absence of this variant in 154 control chromosomes suggest a possible pathogenic role in mild Canavan disease. In the third individual, two homozygous sequence variants were identified, which comprise the known G274R mutation and a novel K213E variant.",

Astrocytic dysfunctions have been recently identified in four leukosdystrophies without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Alexander disease, the first primary genetic astrocytic disorder identified, is due to dominant GFAP mutations. The presence of Rosenthal fibers throughout the CNS is the pathological hallmark of this disease. Neurological degradation, megalencephaly, and typical MRI pattern are characteristic of infantile sporadic patients. Nevertheless, clinical and MRI expression is large, including late onset forms which can be familial. Spongiform or cystic white matter CNS degeneration is present in the other three recessive disorders. The visualization of a white matter cystic breakdown on MRI has led to the identification of CACH/VWM and MLC diseases. CACH/VWM is due to mutations in one of the five subunits of EIF2B which compromise the astrocytic lineage. The clinical spectrum is large, from antenatal to adult forms, and several extraneurological organs can be affected. Mutations in MLC1, which is mainly expressed in astrocyte endfeet, produce megalencephaly, whereas the mild clinical course contrasts with severe MRI features. An increased concentration of NAA in the urine is sufficient to diagnose Canavan disease, which is due to mutations of the ASPA gene.

Aspartoacylase (AspA) gene mutations cause the pediatric lethal neurodegenerative Canavan disease (CD). There is emerging promise of successful gene therapy for CD using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs). Here, we report an intracerebroventricularly delivered AspA gene therapy regime using three serotypes of rAAVs at a 20-fold reduced dose than previously described in AspA(-/-) mice, a bona-fide mouse model of CD. Interestingly, central nervous system (CNS)-restricted therapy prolonged survival over systemic therapy in CD mice but failed to sustain motor functions seen in systemically treated mice. Importantly, we reveal through histological and functional examination of untreated CD mice that AspA deficiency in peripheral tissues causes morphological and functional abnormalities in this heretofore CNS-defined disorder. We demonstrate for the first time that AspA deficiency, possibly through excessive N-acetyl aspartic acid accumulation, elicits both a peripheral and CNS immune response in CD mice. Our data establish a role for peripheral tissues in CD pathology and serve to aid the development of more efficacious and sustained gene therapy for this disease.",

The purpose of this article is to report brain MRI findings of merosin-negative congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) in two cases and to discuss its differentiation from other CMD subtypes. The cases were investigated by 1.5 Tesla MRI equipment using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), 3D fast spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) and post-contrast gadolinium enhanced sequences and the diagnosis was confirmed by muscle biopsy with immunohistochemical staining for merosin. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral subcortical U-fibre white matter changes with periventricular sparing in the first case. Though this imaging finding is non-specific and could be seen in other white matter diseases like Canavan disease, the absence of other distinguishing MRI and clinical features of those conditions allowed a proper diagnosis. The second case showed diffuse subcortical and deep white matter involvement and cerebellar cysts. There was no brainstem involvement, polymicrogyria or cobblestone lissencephaly in both of our cases which allowed differentiation of merosin-negative CMD from other CMDs. Muscle biopsy in both these patients showed dystrophic changes with absent staining for merosin confirming the diagnosis. Merosin-negative CMD should be considered in the imaging differential diagnosis of white matter diseases. In a patient presenting with features of CMD, MRI can be of help in further differentiation of the various CMD subtypes.",

Many recessive genetic disorders are found at a higher incidence in people of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent than in the general population. The American College of Medical Genetics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended that individuals of AJ descent undergo carrier screening for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher disease. Although these recommendations have led to increased test volumes and number of laboratories offering AJ screening, well-characterized genomic reference materials are not publicly available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-based Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program, in collaboration with members of the genetic testing community and Coriell Cell Repositories, have developed a panel of characterized genomic reference materials for AJ genetic testing. DNA from 31 cell lines, representing many of the common alleles for Tay Sachs disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia type C, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher disease, and glycogen storage disease, was prepared by the Repository and tested in six clinical laboratories using three different PCR-based assay platforms. A total of 33 disease alleles was assayed and 25 different alleles were identified. These characterized materials are publicly available from Coriell and may be used for quality control, proficiency testing, test development, and research.",

                    "text": "Joint SOGC-CCMG Opinion for Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening: An Update for All Canadian Providers of Maternity and Reproductive Healthcare in the Era of Direct-to-Consumer Testing. OBJECTIVE: This guideline was written to update Canadian maternity care and reproductive healthcare providers on pre- and postconceptional reproductive carrier screening for women or couples who may be at risk of being carriers for autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD), or X-linked (XL) conditions, with risk of transmission to the fetus. Four previous SOGC- Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) guidelines are updated and merged into the current document. INTENDED USERS: All maternity care (most responsible health provider [MRHP]) and paediatric providers; maternity nursing; nurse practitioner; provincial maternity care administrator; medical student; and postgraduate resident year 1-7. TARGET POPULATION: Fertile, sexually active females and their fertile, sexually active male partners who are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant (preferably in the first trimester of pregnancy, but any gestational age is acceptable). OPTIONS: Women and their partners will be able to obtain appropriate genetic carrier screening information and possible diagnosis of AR, AD, or XL disorders (preferably pre-conception), thereby allowing an informed choice regarding genetic carrier screening and reproductive options (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, egg or sperm donation, or adoption). OUTCOMES: Informed reproductive decisions related to genetic carrier screening and reproductive outcomes based on family history, ethnic background, past obstetrical history, known carrier status, or genetic diagnosis. SOGC REPRODUCTIVE CARRIER SCREENING SUMMARY STATEMENT (2016): Pre-conception or prenatal education and counselling for reproductive carrier screening requires a discussion about testing within the three perinatal genetic carrier screening/diagnosis time periods, which include pre-conception, prenatal, and neonatal for conditions currently being screened for and diagnosed. This new information should be added to the standard reproductive carrier screening protocols that are already being utilized by the most responsible maternity provider through the informed consent process with the patient. (III-A; GRADE low/moderate) SOGC OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS QUALITY AND GRADE: There was a strong observational/expert opinion (quality and grade) for the genetic carrier literature with randomized controlled trial evidence being available only for the invasive testing. Both the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care quality and classification and the GRADE evidence quality and grade are provided. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE; PubMed; government neonatal screening websites; key words/common reproductive genetic carrier screened diseases/previous SOGC Guidelines/medical academic societies (Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine [SMFM]; American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG]; CCMG; Royal College Obstetrics and Gynaecology [RCOG] [UK]; American Society of Human Genetics [ASHG]; International Society of Prenatal Diagnosis [ISPD])/provincial neonatal screening policies and programs; search terms (carrier screening, prenatal screening, neonatal genetic/metabolic screening, cystic fibrosis (CF), thalassemia, hemoglobinopathy, hemophilia, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), spinal muscular atrophy, Ashkenazi Jewish carrier screening, genetic carrier screening protocols, AR, AD, XL). SEARCH PERIOD: 10 years (June 2005-September 2015); initial search dates June 30, 2015 and September 15, 2015; completed final search January 4, 2016. Validation of articles was completed by primary authors RD Wilson and I De Bie. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COST: Benefits are to provide an evidenced based reproductive genetic carrier screening update consensus based on international opinions and publications for the use of Canadian women, who are planning a pregnancy or who are pregnant and have been identified to be at risk (personal or male partner family or reproductive history) for the transmission of a clinically significant genetic condition to their offspring with associated morbidity and/or mortality. Harm may arise from having counselling and informed testing of the carrier status of the mother, their partner, or their fetus, as well as from declining to have this counselling and informed testing or from not having the opportunity for counselling and informed testing. Costs will ensue both from the provision of opportunities for counselling and testing, as well as when no such opportunities are offered or are declined and the birth of a child with a significant inherited condition and resulting morbidity/mortality occurs; these comprise not only the health care costs to the system but also the social/financial/psychological/emotional costs to the family. These recommendations are based on expert opinion and have not been subjected to a health economics assessment and local or provincial implementation will be required. GUIDELINE UPDATE: This guideline is an update of four previous joint SOGC-CCMG Genetic Screening Guidelines dated 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2008 developed by the SOGC Genetic Committee in collaboration with the CCMG Prenatal Diagnosis Committee (now Clinical Practice Committee). 2016 CARRIER SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS.",

Genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan disease is particularly important for Ashkenazi Jews, because both conditions are more frequent in that population. This comparative case study was possible because of different patenting and licensing practices. The role of DNA testing differs between Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases. The first-line screening test for Tay-Sachs remains an enzyme activity test rather than genotyping. Genotyping is used for preimplantation diagnosis and confirmatory testing. In contrast, DNA-based testing is the basis for Canavan screening and diagnosis. The HEXA gene for Tay-Sachs was cloned at the National Institutes of Health, and the gene was patented but has not been licensed. The ASPA gene for Canavan disease was cloned and patented by Miami Children's Hospital. Miami Children's Hospital did not inform family members and patient groups that had contributed to the gene discovery that it was applying for a patent, and pursued restrictive licensing practices when a patent issued in 1997. This led to intense controversy, litigation, and a sealed, nonpublic 2003 settlement that apparently allowed for nonexclusive licensing. A survey of laboratories revealed a possible price premium for ASPA testing, with per-unit costs higher than for other genetic tests in the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society case studies. The main conclusion from comparing genetic testing for Tay-Sachs and Canavan diseases, however, is that patenting and licensing conducted without communication with patients and advocates cause mistrust and can lead to controversy and litigation, a negative model to contrast with the positive model of patenting and licensing for genetic testing of cystic fibrosis.",

A non-invasive (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technique is described for the determination of the N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) synthesis rate, V(NAA), in the human brain in vivo. In controls, the mean V(NAA) was 9.2 +/- 3.9 nmol/min/g. In Canavan disease, where [NAA] is increased (p < 0.001) and [aspartate] is deceased (p < 0.001), V(NAA) was significantly reduced to 3.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/min/g (p < 0.001). These rates are in close agreement with the activity of the biosynthetic enzyme measured in vitro in animals, and with the rate of urinary excretion of NAA in human subjects with Canavan disease. The present result is consistent with the regulation of NAA synthesis by the activity of a single enzyme, L-aspartate-N-acetyltransferase, in vivo, and with its control in Canavan disease by limited substrate supply and/or product inhibition.

Breakdown of oligodendrocyte-neuron interactions in white matter (WM), such as the loss of myelin, results in axonal dysfunction and hence a disruption of information processing between brain regions. The major feature of leukodystrophies is the lack of proper myelin formation during early development or the onset of myelin loss late in life. These early childhood WM diseases are described as hypomyelination or dysmyelination arising from a primary block in normal myelin synthesis because of a genetic mutation expressed in oligodendrocytes, or failure in myelination secondary to neuronal or astroglial dysfunctions (van der Knaap 2001 Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 43:705-712). Here, we describe the pathophysiological parameters of Canavan disease (CD), caused by genetic mutations of the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, a metabolic enzyme restricted in the central nervous system (CNS) to oligodendrocytes. CD presents pathophysiological dysfunctions similar to diseases caused by myelin gene mutations, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and several animal models, such as myelin deficient rat (md), jimpy (jp), shiverer (sh), and quaking (qk viable) mutant mice. These single gene mutations have pleiotropic effects, whereby the alteration of one myelin gene expression disrupts functional expression of other oligodendrocyte genes with an outcome of hypomyelination/dysmyelination. Among all of the known leukodystrophies, CD is the first disorder, which was approved and tested for the adeno-associated virus vector (AAV)-ASPA gene therapy (Leone et al. 2000 Ann. Neurol. 48:27-38; Janson et al. 2001 Trends Neurosci. 24:706-712) without much success following the first two attempts. ASPA gene delivery attempts in animal models have shown a lowering of N-acetyl L-aspartate and a change in motor functions, while sponginess of the WM, a characteristic of CD remained unchanged (Matalon et al. 2003 Mol. Ther. 7 (5, Part 1):580-587; McPhee et al. 2005 Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 135:112-121) even with better viral serotype and delivery of the gene during early phase of development (Klugmann et al. 2005 Mol. Ther. 11:745-753). While different approaches are being sought for the success of gene therapy, there are pivotal developmental questions to address regarding the specific regions of the CNS and cell lineages that become the target for the onset and progression of CD symptoms from early to late stages of development.",

BACKGROUND: Canavan disease (CD) is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA) and increased levels of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in brain and body fluids, severe mental retardation and early death. Gene therapy has been attempted in a number of children with CD. The lack of an animal model has been a limiting factor in developing vectors for the treatment of CD. This paper reports the successful creation of a knock-out mouse for Canavan disease that can be used for gene transfer. METHODS: Genomic library lambda knock-out shuttle (lambdaKOS) was screened and a specific pKOS/Aspa clone was isolated and used to create a plasmid with 10 base pair (bp) deletion of exon four of the murine aspa. Following linearization, the plasmid was electroporated to ES cells. Correctly targeted ES clones were identified following positive and negative selection and confirmed by Southern analysis. Chimeras were generated by injection of ES cells to blastocysts. Germ line transmission was achieved by the birth of heterozygous mice as confirmed by Southern analysis. RESULTS: Heterozygous mice born following these experiments have no overt phenotype. The homozygous mice display neurological impairment, macrocephaly, generalized white matter disease, deficient ASPA activity and high levels of NAA in urine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain of the homozygous mice show white matter changes characteristic of Canavan disease and elevated NAA levels. CONCLUSION: The newly created ASPA deficient mouse establishes an important animal model of Canavan disease. This model should be useful for developing gene transfer vectors to treat Canavan disease. Vectors for the central nervous system (CNS) and modulation of NAA levels in the brain should further add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of Canavan disease. Data generated from this animal model will be useful for developing strategies for gene therapy in other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors mediating long term transgene expression are excellent gene therapy tools for chronic neurological diseases. While rAAV2 was the first serotype tested in the clinics, more efficient vectors derived from the rh10 serotype are currently being evaluated and other serotypes are likely to be tested in the near future. In addition, aside from the currently used stereotaxy-guided intraparenchymal delivery, new techniques for global brain transduction (by intravenous or intra-cerebrospinal injections) are very promising. Various strategies for therapeutic gene delivery to the central nervous system have been explored in human clinical trials in the past decade. Canavan disease, a genetic disease caused by an enzymatic deficiency, was the first to be approved. Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. These pioneer clinical trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of rAAV delivery in the human brain at moderate doses. Therapeutic effects however, were modest, emphasizing the need for higher doses of the therapeutic transgene product which could be achieved using more efficient vectors or expression cassettes. This will require re-addressing pharmacological aspects, with attention to which cases require either localized and cell-type specific expression or efficient brain-wide transgene expression, and when it is necessary to modulate or terminate the administration of transgene product. The ongoing development of targeted and regulated rAAV vectors is described. ",

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as an attractive vector for gene therapy. AAV vectors have successfully been utilized to promote sustained gene expression in a variety of tissues such as muscle, eye, brain, liver, and lung. As the significance of AAV as a gene therapy vector has been realized over the past years, recent developments in recombinant AAV (rAAV) production and purification have revolutionized the AAV field. It is now possible to produce high yields of vector (10(12)-10(13) genome-containing particles per mL) that are free of contaminating cellular and helper virus proteins. Such vectors have been successfully used in preclinical applications in animal models such as those of hemophilia, lysosomal storage diseases and vision deficiency, all of which have shown therapeutic benefits from rAAV treatment. Clinical trials using rAAV2 for the treatment of hemophilia B, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and Canavan disease have begun, and reports from these phase I trials support the safety seen in preclinical trials. Eventually, tissue-specific vectors that can potentially evade the immune system will be required to optimize success in gene therapy. In recent years, this has led to the development of retargeted rAAV2 vectors and the identification and characterization of new serotypes from human and nonhuman primates that could potentially achieve these goals. AAV virologists and gene therapists alike have just begun to scratch the surface in terms of the utility of this small virus in a clinical setting. In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in rAAV vector production and purification, vector development, and clinical applications.",

Breakdown of oligodendrocyte-neuron interactions in white matter (WM), such as the loss of myelin, results in axonal dysfunction and hence a disruption of information processing between brain regions. The major feature of leukodystrophies is the lack of proper myelin formation during early development or the onset of myelin loss late in life. These early childhood WM diseases are described as hypomyelination or dysmyelination arising from a primary block in normal myelin synthesis because of a genetic mutation expressed in oligodendrocytes, or failure in myelination secondary to neuronal or astroglial dysfunctions (van der Knaap 2001 Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 43:705-712). Here, we describe the pathophysiological parameters of Canavan disease (CD), caused by genetic mutations of the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, a metabolic enzyme restricted in the central nervous system (CNS) to oligodendrocytes. CD presents pathophysiological dysfunctions similar to diseases caused by myelin gene mutations, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) and several animal models, such as myelin deficient rat (md), jimpy (jp), shiverer (sh), and quaking (qk viable) mutant mice. These single gene mutations have pleiotropic effects, whereby the alteration of one myelin gene expression disrupts functional expression of other oligodendrocyte genes with an outcome of hypomyelination/dysmyelination. Among all of the known leukodystrophies, CD is the first disorder, which was approved and tested for the adeno-associated virus vector (AAV)-ASPA gene therapy (Leone et al. 2000 Ann. Neurol. 48:27-38; Janson et al. 2001 Trends Neurosci. 24:706-712) without much success following the first two attempts. ASPA gene delivery attempts in animal models have shown a lowering of N-acetyl L-aspartate and a change in motor functions, while sponginess of the WM, a characteristic of CD remained unchanged (Matalon et al. 2003 Mol. Ther. 7 (5, Part 1):580-587; McPhee et al. 2005 Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 135:112-121) even with better viral serotype and delivery of the gene during early phase of development (Klugmann et al. 2005 Mol. Ther. 11:745-753). While different approaches are being sought for the success of gene therapy, there are pivotal developmental questions to address regarding the specific regions of the CNS and cell lineages that become the target for the onset and progression of CD symptoms from early to late stages of development.",

Canavan disease is a hereditary leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the aspartoacylase gene (ASPA), leading to loss of enzyme activity and increased concentrations of the substrate N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the brain. Accumulation of NAA results in spongiform degeneration of white matter and severe impairment of psychomotor development. The goal of this prospective cohort study was to assess long-term safety and preliminary efficacy measures after gene therapy with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying the ASPA gene (AAV2-ASPA). Using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging and standardized clinical rating scales, we observed Canavan disease in 28 patients, with a subset of 13 patients being treated with AAV2-ASPA. Each patient received 9 x 10(11) vector genomes via intraparenchymal delivery at six brain infusion sites. Safety data collected over a minimum 5-year follow-up period showed a lack of long-term adverse events related to the AAV2 vector. Posttreatment effects were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model, which showed changes in predefined surrogate markers of disease progression and clinical assessment subscores. AAV2-ASPA gene therapy resulted in a decrease in elevated NAA in the brain and slowed progression of brain atrophy, with some improvement in seizure frequency and with stabilization of overall clinical status.",

It is characterized by developmental delay, severe hypotonia and early death, and is caused by a deficiency of aspartoacylase which is encoded by the ASPA gene. In Ashkenazi Jews, one major mutation (E285A) and one minor mutation (Y231X) account for the majority of cases. The objective of this study was to develop a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) protocol for Canavan disease. METHODS: Two carrier couples requested PGD for Canavan disease. In 1 couple each was a carrier of a different ASPA mutation (Y231X and E285A). In the other couple both were carriers of the minor mutation (Y231X). A single-cell duplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was first developed on single leukocytes obtained from the known carrier parents. Following verification in single leukocytes, clinical PGD was offered to both couples. RESULTS: We evaluated 115 single leukocytes from known carriers and found an allele drop out rate of 1.7% for the fragment harboring the Y231X mutation and 0% for the fragment harboring the E285A mutation. One cycle of PGD was performed in each family. In the first, 11 embryos were successfully analyzed and 4 were found to be affected. Two unaffected embryos were transferred, but no pregnancy resulted. In the other family, 4 embryos were analyzed, 1 was affected, 2 were heterozygotes and 1 was homozygous normal. Following transfer of 2 unaffected embryos, a singleton pregnancy resulted, currently ongoing at 18 weeks gestational age. Amniocentesis performed at 16 weeks confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Reliable PGD for Canavan disease is possible using a single-cell nested PCR approach.",

One cycle of PGD was performed in each family. In the first, 11 embryos were successfully analyzed and 4 were found to be affected. Two unaffected embryos were transferred, but no pregnancy resulted. In the other family, 4 embryos were analyzed, 1 was affected, 2 were heterozygotes and 1 was homozygous normal. Following transfer of 2 unaffected embryos, a singleton pregnancy resulted, currently ongoing at 18 weeks gestational age. Amniocentesis performed at 16 weeks confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Reliable PGD for Canavan disease is possible using a single-cell nested PCR approach.",

                    "text": "High genetic heterogeneity of leukodystrophies in Iranian children: the first report of Iranian Leukodystrophy Registry. Leukodystrophies (LDs) are a heterogeneous group of progressive neurological disorders and characterized by primary involvement of white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). This is the first report of the Iranian LD Registry database to describe the clinical, radiological, and genomic data of Persian patients with leukodystrophies. From 2016 to 2019, patients suspicious of LDs were examined followed by a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A single gene testing or whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used depending on the neuroradiologic phenotypes. In a few cases, the diagnosis was made by metabolic studies. Based on the MRI pattern, diagnosed patients were divided into cohorts A (hypomyelinating LDs) versus cohort B (Other LDs). The most recent LD classification was utilized for classification of diagnosed patients. For novel variants, in silico analyses were performed to verify their pathogenicity. Out of 680 registered patients, 342 completed the diagnostic evaluations. In total, 245 patients met a diagnosis which in turn 24.5% were categorized in cohort A and the remaining in cohort B. Genetic tests revealed causal variants in 228 patients consisting of 213 variants in 110 genes with 78 novel variants. WES and single gene testing identified a causal variant in 65.5% and 34.5% cases, respectively. The total diagnostic rate of WES was 60.7%. Lysosomal disorders (27.3%; GM2-gangliosidosis-9.8%, MLD-6.1%, KD-4.5%), amino and organic acid disorders (17.15%; Canavan disease-4.5%, L-2-HGA-3.6%), mitochondrial leukodystrophies (12.6%), ion and water homeostasis disorders (7.3%; MLC-4.5%), peroxisomal disorders (6.5%; X-ALD-3.6%), and myelin protein disorders (3.6%; PMLD-3.6%) were the most commonly diagnosed disorders. Thirty-seven percent of cases had a pathogenic variant in nine genes (ARSA, HEXA, ASPA, MLC1, GALC, GJC2, ABCD1, L2HGDH, GCDH). This study highlights the most common types as well as the genetic heterogeneity of LDs in Iranian children.",

This study evaluates the genetic spectrum of leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies in Iran. 152 children, aged from 1 day to 15 years, were genetically tested for leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies based on clinical and neuroradiological findings from 2016 to 2019. Patients with a suggestive specific leukodystrophy, e. g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, Tay-Sachs disease were tested for mutations in single genes (108; 71%) while patients with less suggestive findings were evaluated by NGS. 108 of 152(71%) had MRI patterns and clinical findings suggestive of a known leukodystrophy. In total, 114(75%) affected individuals had (likely) pathogenic variants which included 38 novel variants. 35 different types of leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies were identified. The more common identified disorders included metachromatic leukodystrophy (19 of 152; 13%), Canavan disease (12; 8%), Tay-Sachs disease (11; 7%), megalencephalic leukodystrophy with subcortical cysts (7; 5%), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (8; 5%), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1 (8; 5%), Sandhoff disease (6; 4%), Krabbe disease (5; 3%), and vanishing white matter disease (4; 3%). Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed 90% leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies. The total diagnosis rate was 75%. This unique study presents a national genetic data of leukodystrophies; it may provide clues to the genetic pool of neighboring countries. Patients with clinical and neuroradiological evidence of a genetic leukoencephalopathy should undergo a genetic analysis to reach a definitive diagnosis. This will allow a diagnosis at earlier stages of the disease, reduce the burden of uncertainty and costs, and will provide the basis for genetic counseling and family planning.",

                    "text": "[Genetic analysis and prenatal diagnosis for a Chinese pedigree affected with Canavan disease]. OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a Chinese patient suspected for Canavan disease. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out for the proband, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing of the proband, her parents and brother. Prenatal diagnosis was provided to her mother by chorionic villi sampling (CVS) upon her subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The proband, a 4-month-old female infant, had manifested drowsiness, hypotonia and apathy. Urine metabolism screening showed elevated N-acetylaspartic acid. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormal myelination and multiple abnormal signals in large brain areas. WES revealed that the proband has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene, namely c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) in exon 1 and c.634+1G>A (P.?) in exon 4. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the c.187A>G (p.Arg63Gly) and c.634+1G>A (p.?) variants were respectively inherited from her mother and father. Her phenotypically normal brother has carried a heterozygous c.634+1G>A (p.?) variant. Prenatal diagnosis by CVS indicated that the fetus was a heterozygous carrier of the c.187A>G variant. CONCLUSION: WES can facilitate the diagnosis of Canavan disease, particularly for those lacking specific phenotypes of the disease. The compound heterozygous variants of the ASPA gene probably underlay the Canavan disease in this patient, and the result has enabled prenatal diagnosis for this family.",
