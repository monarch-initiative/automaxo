input_text: Airway obstruction in the Pierre Robin sequence. Airway obstruction and
  feeding difficulties vary among patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). Treatment
  is challenging and the appropriate management may not be readily identified, leading
  to delay in securing the airway. A retrospective review of 90 children with PRS
  was done to identify subgroups at a higher risk of developing severe airway obstruction
  using oxygen and apnea monitoring, sleep studies, and response to treatment. Patients
  with isolated PRS (group I, 27 patients) and Stickler syndrome (group II, 32 patients)
  do not suffer from debilitating airway and feeding difficulties when compared to
  those with unique syndromes (group III, 16 patients) and recognized named syndromes
  (group IV, 15 patients). Feeding difficulties were universal with the severity proportional
  to airway obstruction. Aggressive intervention should be considered early in group
  III and IV patients.
