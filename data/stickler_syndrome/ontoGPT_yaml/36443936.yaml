input_text: 'The Incidence of Velopharyngeal Insufficiency in Stickler Syndrome. OBJECTIVE:
  Stickler Syndrome (SS) is an inherited collagenopathy characterized by heterogenous
  orofacial, ocular, auditory, and skeletal abnormalities. The orofacial manifestations
  are variable and some patients present with cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency
  (VPI). The incidence of VPI in SS is poorly studied and no studies have compared
  the incidence of VPI between Type I (COL2A1) and Type II (COL11A1) SS. The objective
  of this study is to compare the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes and discuss
  the surgical techniques used to treat them. DESIGN: Single-institution, retrospective
  chart review. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three
  children were diagnosed with SS between January 2003 and December 2018. Genetic
  testing results, genetics notes, craniofacial clinic notes, and operative reports
  were reviewed. Patients without genetic testing or craniofacial/otolaryngologic
  evaluation were excluded. Thirty-one patients met criteria and were included. MAIN
  OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was VPI incidence. RESULTS: There were 18 patients
  with Type I SS and 13 with Type II SS. Five (16%) patients had VPI, 2 (11%) with
  Type I SS compared to 3 (23%) with Type II SS (P > .05). All patients with VPI underwent
  surgery with either sphincter pharyngoplasty (3) or pharyngeal flap (2). Two patients
  with Type II SS underwent revision sphincter pharyngoplasty, with one conversion
  to pharyngeal flap. CONCLUSION: VPI is common for patients with SS. In this study,
  there was no significant difference in the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes.
  Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which could be important for
  patient counseling and treatment planning.'
