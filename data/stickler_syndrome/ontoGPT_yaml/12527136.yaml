input_text: Auditory function associated with Col11a1 haploinsufficiency in chondrodysplasia
  (cho) mice. Heterozygosity for mutations in the fibrillar collagen gene COL11A1
  causes sensorineural hearing loss in patients with Stickler syndrome or Marshall
  syndrome. Chondrodysplasia (cho) is a functional null allele of Col11a1 that causes
  lethal chondrodysplasia in cho/cho newborn mice, and osteoarthritis in cho/+ heterozygotes.
  To determine if Col11a1 haploinsufficiency causes hearing loss in cho/+ mice, auditory
  brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 months of
  age. There was no difference in ABR thresholds for click and tone burst stimuli
  between cho/+ and +/+ mice at all ages. In contrast to the conclusion of a previous
  report, our results indicate that Col11a1 haploinsufficiency does not cause significant
  hearing loss on the C57BL/6 strain background. We conclude that Stickler syndrome
  and Marshall syndrome mutations in COL11A1 cause hearing loss via dominant negative
  effects upon wild-type fibrillar collagen polypeptides in the extracellular matrices
  of the cochlea.
