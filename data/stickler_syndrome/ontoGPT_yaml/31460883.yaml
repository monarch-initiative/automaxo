input_text: 'XEN-augmented Baerveldt Implantation for Refractory Childhood Glaucoma:
  A Retrospective Case Series. BACKGROUND: Tube implants can lead to long-term decompensation
  of the cornea after decades, in particular in complicated childhood glaucoma, because
  of a variety of causes including contact between the tube tip and the corneal endothelium.
  The augmentation of a XEN implant with a Baerveldt (250) tube implant, introduced
  2016 by Mermoud et al for refractory glaucoma in adult patients, may reduce this
  risk in children. In our retrospective study, we report on the XEN-augmented Baerveldt
  (250) tube implant in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with
  refractory childhood glaucoma who underwent XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation
  by a single surgeon (F.G.) between January 2016 and August 2018 were retrospectively
  analyzed. In this technique, a XEN tube was inserted under a standard scleral flap
  from outside into the anterior chamber and its outer end was connected to the Baerveldt
  (250) tube. The follow-up consisted of regular anterior and posterior segment examination
  with intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements using a hand-held slit lamp and a Perkins
  applanation tonometer and/or rebound tonometer (Icare). RESULTS: Ten cases (6 female
  individuals, 4 male individuals, median age 6 years) were operated using a XEN-augmented
  Baerveldt implant [aphakic glaucoma, primary congenital glaucoma, secondary congenital
  glaucoma (Peters anomaly), ectropion uveae, and Stickler syndrome were 4, 3, 1,
  1, and 1]. Before surgery (XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation), median IOP was
  31 mm Hg. At the last postoperative follow-up, the mean IOP was 18.5 mm Hg with
  a median follow-up period of 13 months (range, 3 to 21 mo). No shallow or flat anterior
  chamber was observed. In all cases, this technique could be performed without intraoperative
  complications. In 3 cases, however, a surgical revision was necessary. There was
  no prolonged postoperative hypotony or short-term corneal alteration. By using an
  S-shaped loop the original Baerveldt tube length could be preserved for potential
  future use. In a total of 6 out of 10 cases, the procedure was a complete success
  (IOP, <=20 mm Hg without additional medication). CONCLUSIONS: XEN-augmented Baerveldt
  implantation was used for refractory pediatric glaucoma in which conventional surgery
  had already failed. A new additional modification using an S-shaped loop was introduced.
  Short-term IOP control seems promising, but long-term results are still pending
  and the long-term efficacy and safety must still be proven before this technique
  can be generally recommended.'
