input_text: 'Regression of central giant cell granuloma by a combination of imatinib
  and interferon: a case report. Central giant cell granuloma is a benign lesion of
  the jaws which is sometimes aggressive locally. The most common treatment is curettage,which
  has a high recurrence rate, particularly in more aggressive lesions. Other treatments
  such as interferon (IFN) and calcitonin have been described. We report a patient
  with Stickler syndrome and an aggressive central giant cell granuloma in the mandible.
  Initial treatment with calcitonin was not successful. A combination of IFN and imatinib,
  given for 9 months, initiated regression of the lesion that continued after treatment
  had ceased.'
