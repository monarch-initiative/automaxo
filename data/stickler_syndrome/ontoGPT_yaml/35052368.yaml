input_text: Precision Medicine through Next-Generation Sequencing in Inherited Eye
  Diseases in a Korean Cohort. In this study, we investigated medically or surgically
  actionable genes in inherited eye disease, based on clinical phenotype and genomic
  data. This retrospective consecutive case series included 149 patients with inherited
  eye diseases, seen by a single pediatric ophthalmologist, who underwent genetic
  testing between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018. Variants were detected using
  a target enrichment panel of 429 genes and known deep intronic variants associated
  with inherited eye disease. Among 149 patients, 38 (25.5%) had a family history,
  and this cohort includes heterogeneous phenotype including anterior segment dysgenesis,
  congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus syndrome, optic atrophy, and retinal dystrophy.
  Overall, 90 patients (60.4%) received a definite molecular diagnosis. Overall, NGS-guided
  precision care was provided to 8 patients (5.4%). The precision care included cryotherapy
  to prevent retinal detachment in COL2A1 Stickler syndrome, osteoporosis management
  in patients with LRP5-associated familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and avoidance
  of unnecessary phlebotomy in hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. A revision of
  the initial clinical diagnosis was made in 22 patients (14.8%). Unexpected multi-gene
  deletions and dual diagnosis were noted in 4 patients (2.7%). We found that precision
  medical or surgical managements were provided for 8 of 149 patients (5.4%), and
  multiple locus variants were found in 2.7% of cases. These findings are important
  because individualized management of inherited eye diseases can be achieved through
  genetic testing.
