input_text: 'Retinal capillary hemangioma in Marshall-Stickler syndrome. PURPOSE:
  Retinal capillary hemangioma, often associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome,
  is not characteristically seen in other conditions. We report a patient with Marshall-Stickler
  syndrome who had a retinal capillary hemangioma. METHOD: A 31-year-old man with
  Marshall-Stickler syndrome was evaluated for a retinal vascular tumor. RESULTS:
  Evaluation showed a retinal capillary hemangioma of the von Hippel type. Magnetic
  resonance imaging disclosed no tumors of brain, kidney, or other organs. The retinal
  tumor was treated with cryotherapy. CONCLUSION: Retinal capillary hemangioma is
  not pathognomonic of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and it may be associated with the
  Marshall-Stickler syndrome.'
