input_text: Prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in Stickler syndrome. The prevalence
  of mitral valve prolapse in Stickler syndrome has been reported to be much higher
  than in the general population. As a result, it has been recommended that all patients
  with Stickler syndrome undergo routine echocardiography and have antibiotic prophylaxis
  prior to surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of mitral
  valve prolapse in a large cohort of UK patients with Stickler syndrome in whom the
  clinical diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular genetic analysis. Probands and
  pedigrees were identified from the Vitreoretinal Service database according to previously
  published criteria. Ophthalmic, skeletal, audiometric, and orofacial features were
  assessed. Affected individuals underwent a full cardiological examination including
  auscultation and two-dimensional echocardiography. Mutation analysis of the COL2A1
  and COL11A1 genes was carried out. Seventy-eight patients from 25 pedigrees were
  studied. Mutation analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis in every pedigree. No
  patient was found to have clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease and no patient
  had significant mitral or other valvular prolapse on echocardiography. These data
  from a large cohort of UK patients with proven Stickler syndrome do not suggest
  an increased incidence of mitral valve prolapse over and above that found in the
  general population. Routine echocardiography screening and use of preoperative antibiotics
  are unnecessary and should be reserved for those individual cases where there is
  clear clinical indication.
