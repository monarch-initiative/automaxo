input_text: "Pierre Robin sequence: an institutional experience in the multidisciplinary
  management of airway, feeding and serous otitis media challenges. OBJECTIVES: To
  evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and
  hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective
  review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at
  the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management,
  nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS:
  Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen
  in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional
  therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed
  intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved
  with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved
  with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a
  surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated
  PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had
  Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months,
  mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in
  the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully
  managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and
  three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed
  with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway
  managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding.
  Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage,
  which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%)
  required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation
  tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS
  can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an
  adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological
  assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to
  ensure adequate speech and language development."
