input_text: 'Perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy (tongue-lip
  adhesion) procedure: a retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Glossopexy (tongue-lip adhesion)
  is a procedure in which the tongue is anchored to the lower lip and mandible to
  relieve the upper airway obstruction mainly in infants with Pierre Robin sequence.
  Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties
  due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate
  difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined
  the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our
  institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence
  was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1.
  In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in
  place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients
  were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube
  to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea
  intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen
  patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate
  repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation.
  CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before
  but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining
  the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.'
