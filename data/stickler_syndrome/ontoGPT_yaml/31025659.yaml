input_text: 'Brittle cornea syndrome: Disease-causing mutations in ZNF469 and two
  novel variants identified in a patient followed for 26 years. AIMS: Brittle cornea
  syndrome (BCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The aim of this study was
  to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an
  additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was
  undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence
  variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the
  literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2.
  RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and
  hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5
  years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation.
  At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also
  managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular
  follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left
  eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be
  a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del;
  p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have
  been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only
  four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound
  heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations
  which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation
  into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders
  may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.'
