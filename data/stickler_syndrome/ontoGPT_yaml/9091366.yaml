input_text: Prophylactic laser photocoagulation in Stickler syndrome. The ocular manifestations
  in a family with Stickler syndrome and the results of laser photocoagulation as
  preventive treatment for retinal detachment are described. Forty-two family members
  with Stickler syndrome were retrospectively reviewed; 22 had ocular abnormalities,
  22 had myopia and 16 had high myopia. Ten patients had developed retinal detachment
  and 9 of them were blind in one or both eyes because of irreparable detachment.
  Only 2 eyes had been operated on successfully. Ten eyes were lasered prophylactically.
  In eyes with extensive vitreoretinopathy laser burns were applied 360 degrees around
  the peripheral retina at the border between the pathological and normal retina.
  Eyes with isolated lesions received focal treatment around the pathological areas.
  Four eyes received 360 degrees laser photocoagulation and 6 eyes received focal
  treatment. Of the treated cases, 9 retinas remained attached for a follow-up period
  ranging from 1 to 15 years. One patient was lost to follow-up, and 5 years later
  developed retinal detachment in one eye from a new non-lasered lesion. In conclusion,
  in this particular family the incidence of retinal detachment was significantly
  higher in non-lasered eyes than in lasered eyes (p < 0.025).
