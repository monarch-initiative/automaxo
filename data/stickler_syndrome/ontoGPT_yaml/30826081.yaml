input_text: 'Bilateral Retinal Detachment in a Pediatric Patient. BACKGROUND: Pediatric
  retinal detachments occur rarely, and thus may be easily missed. Without treatment,
  this condition leads to permanent vision loss. Patients with Stickler syndrome,
  an inherited disorder of collagen synthesis, are more likely to have retinal detachments
  than the general population. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 9-year-old boy
  who presented to the Emergency Department with blurry vision, and who was subsequently
  diagnosed with bilateral retinal detachments. The patient underwent successful operative
  intervention. He was eventually determined to have Stickler syndrome. WHY SHOULD
  AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: It is important for emergency physicians
  to recognize pediatric visual problems such as retinal detachment, as their presentations
  may be unusual, and delay of definitive care could result in lifelong visual impairment.'
