input_text: 'Ocular complications and prophylactic strategies in Stickler syndrome:
  a systematic literature review. BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a collagenopathy
  caused by mutations in the genes COL2A1 (STL1) or COL11A1 (STL2). Affected patients
  manifest ocular, auditory, articular, and craniofacial manifestations in varying
  degrees. Ocular symptoms include myopia, retinal detachment, cataract, and glaucoma.
  The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the prevalence of ocular manifestations
  and the outcome of prophylactic treatment on reducing the risk of retinal detachment.
  METHOD: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed database. Information
  on the cross-study prevalence of myopia, retinal detachment, cataract, glaucoma,
  visual impairment, severity and age of onset of myopia and retinal detachments.
  Studies that reported on the outcome of prophylactic treatment against a control
  group were explored. RESULTS: 37 articles with 2324 individual patients were included.
  Myopia was found in 83% of patients, mostly of a moderate to severe degree. Retinal
  detachments occurred in 45% of patients. Generally, the first detachment occurred
  in the second decade of life in STL1 patients and later in STL2. Cataracts were
  more common in STL2 patients, 59% versus 36% in STL1. Glaucoma (10%) and visual
  impairment (blind: 6%; vision loss in one eye: 10%) were rare. Three studies reported
  on the effect of prophylactic treatment being protective. CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestations
  are common in Stickler patients, but the comparison between studies was difficult
  because of inconsistencies in diagnostic and inclusion criteria by different studies.
  Sight-threatening complications such as retinal detachments are common but although
  prophylactic therapy is reported to be effective in retrospective studies, evidence
  from randomized trials is missing.'
