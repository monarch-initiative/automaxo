input_text: 'Myopic Shift 5 Years after Intraocular Lens Implantation in the Infant
  Aphakia Treatment Study. PURPOSE: To report the myopic shift at 5 years of age after
  cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation for infants enrolled in
  the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS). METHODS: Refractions were performed at
  1 month and every 3 months postoperatively until age 4 years and then at ages 4.25,
  4.5, and 5 years. The change in refraction over time was estimated by linear mixed
  model analysis. RESULTS: Intraocular lens implantation was completed in 56 eyes;
  43 were analyzed (median age, 2.4 months; range, 1.0-6.8 months). Exclusions included
  11 patients with glaucoma, 1 patient with Stickler syndrome, and 1 patient with
  an IOL exchange at 8 months postoperatively. The mean rate of change in a myopic
  direction from 1 month after cataract surgery to age 1.5 years was 0.35 diopters
  (D)/month (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.40 D/month); after age 1.5 years,
  the mean rate of change in a myopic direction was 0.97 D/year (95% CI, 0.66-1.28
  D/year). The mean refractive change was 8.97 D (95% CI, 7.25-10.68 D) at age 5 years
  for children 1 month of age at surgery and 7.22 D (95% CI, 5.54-8.91 D) for children
  6 months of age at surgery. The mean refractive error at age 5 years was -2.53 D
  (95% CI, -4.05 to -1.02). CONCLUSIONS: After IOL implantation during infancy, the
  rate of myopic shift occurs most rapidly during the first 1.5 years of life. Myopic
  shift varies substantially among patients. If the goal is emmetropia at age 5 years,
  then the immediate postoperative hypermetropic targets should be +10.5 D at 4 to
  6 weeks and +8.50 D from 7 weeks to 6 months. However, even using these targets,
  it is likely that many children will require additional refractive correction given
  the high variability of refractive outcomes.'
