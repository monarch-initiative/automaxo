input_text: 'A 35-year experience with syndromic cleft palate repair: operative outcomes
  and long-term speech function. BACKGROUND: Associated comorbidities can put syndromic
  patients with cleft palate at risk for poor speech outcomes. Reported rates of velopharyngeal
  insufficiency (VPI) vary from 8% to 64%, and need for secondary VPI surgery from
  23% to 64%, with few studies providing long-term follow-up. The purpose of this
  study was to describe our institutional long-term experience with syndromic patients
  undergoing cleft palatoplasty. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of
  all patients with syndromic diagnoses undergoing primary Furlow palatoplasty from
  1975 to 2011. Outcomes included postoperative oronasal fistula (ONF) and need for
  secondary VPI surgery. Speech scores for verbal patients 5 years or older were collected
  via the Pittsburgh scale for speech assessment. Aggregate scores categorized the
  velopharyngeal mechanism as competent, borderline, or incompetent. Outcomes were
  analyzed by patient and operative factors. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients
  were included with average age at repair of 20.7 months. Cleft type was 9% submucosal,
  16% Veau class I, 50% class II, 12% class III, and 13% class IV. Forty-five syndromes
  were recorded, most commonly Stickler syndrome (n = 32) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
  [22q11.2DS (n = 19)]. Forty-four patients also had associated Pierre Robin sequence
  (PRS). The overall ONF rate was 4.5% and was highest in Veau class IV clefts (P
  = 0.048). Seventy-six patients were included in speech analysis, with an average
  age at last assessment of 10.4 years. Overall, 60.5% of patients had a competent
  velopharyngeal mechanism, 23.7% borderline, and 15.8% incompetent mechanism. Fifty
  percent of 22q11.2DS patients had borderline speech and none had competent speech,
  compared to 73.3% with Stickler syndrome (P = 0.01) and 71.4% of patients with associated
  PRS (P = 0.02). Secondary VPI surgery was performed in 11.4% of patients overall.
  Patients with PRS (13.6%) and with Stickler syndrome (15.6%) had secondary VPI surgery,
  compared to 31.6% of patients with 22q11.2DS (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study
  demonstrates low rates of postoperative ONF after modified Furlow palatoplasty in
  syndromic patients. Speech outcomes were comparable to nonsyndromic patients at
  our institution, but patients with 22q11.2DS consistently had borderline-incompetent
  speech and a 3-fold higher incidence of secondary VPI surgery.'
