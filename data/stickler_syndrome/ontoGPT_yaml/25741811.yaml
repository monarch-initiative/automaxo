input_text: 'PRIMARY SCLERAL BUCKLING FOR PEDIATRIC RHEGMATOGENOUS RETINAL DETACHMENT.
  PURPOSE: To evaluate the anatomical outcomes of primary scleral buckling (SB) procedures
  for pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. METHODS: Retrospective consecutive
  case series. One hundred and four eyes of 99 consecutive nonselected pediatric patients
  undergoing primary SB were identified. Baseline factors recorded were demographics,
  presenting clinical examination findings, previous ocular surgery, predisposing
  factors. Intraoperative factors recorded were the type of buckle, number and distribution
  of retinal breaks, number of retinal quadrants detached, macular status (involved
  vs. uninvolved), the use of subretinal fluid drainage, and surgical complications.
  Anatomical reattachment rate at last follow-up. Subgroup analysis was carried out
  to identify any predisposing factors for failure of primary surgery, effect of age
  on outcome, intraoperative pathology, effect of posterior versus anterior SB, and
  redetachment and secondary-procedure complications specific to SB. RESULTS: The
  initial surgery was segmental SB alone in 87 eyes (83.6%). Retinal reattachment
  was achieved with 1 operation in 73% (76 of 104 eyes). Of the 28 cases that redetached,
  14 eyes underwent a repeat SB procedure (success rate of this second operation:
  85.7% [12 of 14 eyes]), 13 eyes underwent vitrectomy (success rate of this second
  operation: 38.4% [5 of 13 eyes]), and 1 case was not reoperated. Overall, the final
  success rate was 94% (98 of 104 eyes). Factors associated with a statistically significant
  increased risk of failure included more than one break; three or more quadrants
  of detachment; horseshoe tears; no breaks seen on preoperative examination; Stickler
  syndrome. CONCLUSION: In selected cases, primary SB is an effective treatment for
  pediatric, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.'
