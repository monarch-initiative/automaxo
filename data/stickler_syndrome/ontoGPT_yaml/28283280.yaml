input_text: 'Foveal Hypoplasia in Patients with Stickler Syndrome. PURPOSE: To determine
  the microstructure of the fovea in patients with Stickler syndrome using imaging
  by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) and swept-source OCT. DESIGN:
  Retrospective case series study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 eyes of 25 patients
  with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome were studied. METHODS: All of the patients
  had mutations in the COL2A1 gene and were diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Cross-sectional
  OCT images, OCT angiography (OCTA), and en face OCT images were assessed. The ratio
  of the foveal inner retinal layer (fIRL) thickness to the parafoveal inner retinal
  layer (pIRL) thickness, the ratio of the foveal outer retinal layer (fORL) thickness
  to the parafoveal outer retinal layer (pORL) thickness, and the size of the foveal
  avascular zone (FAZ) were determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The degree of foveal
  hypoplasia and the best-corrected visual acuity in patients with Stickler syndrome.
  RESULTS: A persistence of the inner retinal layers in the fovea with an fIRL/pIRL
  ratio >0.2 was present in 32 of the 39 eyes (82%). Optical coherence tomography
  angiography showed that the FAZ was smaller, 0 to 0.19 mm2, than that of normal
  eyes, in 25 eyes of 17 patients who underwent OCTA. There was no significant correlation
  between the visual acuities and the fIRL/pIRL ratios. CONCLUSIONS: A mild foveal
  hypoplasia with a persistence of the IRL is characteristic of eyes with Stickler
  syndrome. The visual acuities were not correlated with the fIRL/pIRL ratios.'
