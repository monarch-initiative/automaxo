input_text: 'RETINAL DETACHMENT SURGERY IN A PEDIATRIC POPULATION: Visual and Anatomic
  Outcomes. PURPOSE: Pediatric retinal detachments (RDs) are unique in etiology, anatomy,
  and prognosis compared with the adult population. The mechanisms of pediatric RD
  include tractional (TRD), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, traumatic, and other
  types, such as exudative or hemorrhagic. This study examined visual and anatomical
  outcomes of pediatric RD undergoing surgical repair at a single university referral
  center. METHODS: A retrospective consecutive case series of patients clinically
  diagnosed and undergoing surgery for RD between birth and 15 years of age from 2002
  to 2013 at a single academic institution. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients (231
  eyes) were included in this study, of which 25 (12%) had bilateral RD. Of those
  patients, 67 (29%) had TRD (retinopathy of prematurity, persistent fetal vasculature,
  or familial exudative vitreoretinopathy), 51 (22%) had rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
  (myopia, X-linked retinoschisis, or Stickler syndrome), 60 (26%) had traumatic RD,
  and 53 (23%) were due to other types of RD, such as Coats disease or coloboma. Presenting
  best-corrected visual acuity better than 20/200 correlated with better final best-corrected
  visual acuity (P < 0.0001). Anatomical success was strongly correlated with visual
  acuity outcome (P < 0.00001) and was significantly more likely in rhegmatogenous
  retinal detachment versus TRD (78% vs. 39%, P < 0.05). The rates of obtaining a
  final best-corrected visual acuity > 20/200 were poorer in TRD (10%) compared with
  rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (39%, P < 0.01) or traumatic RD (28%, P < 0.05).
  CONCLUSION: Visual and anatomical outcomes varied among categories of RD. Rhegmatogenous
  retinal detachments were associated with the best outcomes (anatomical success and
  globe conservation), whereas TRDs generally had poorer visual and anatomical outcomes.'
