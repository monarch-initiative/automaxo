input_text: "Visual complications of Stickler syndrome in paediatric patients with
  Robin sequence. BACKGROUND: The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic
  Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital
  high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler
  syndrome with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group
  of patients by members of the cleft team. This study was designed to determine the
  prevalence of Stickler syndrome among the author's group of patients with Robin
  sequence, and to investigate the visual outcome among paediatric patients with Robin
  sequence and Stickler syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children (six male and
  two female) with Stickler syndrome and Robin sequence were referred to be followed
  up every 6 months in the Ophthalmologic Department because of high myopia at less
  than 10 years of age. Three patients came from the author's study group and five
  were referred by other cleft surgeons. They were examined with repeat ophthalmic
  and indirect fundus examinations including cycloplegic refraction, and slit lamp
  biomicroscope examinations. Laser photocoagulation (2 cases) treatment for retinal
  degeneration or operation (3 cases) for retinal detachment was performed once evidence
  of significant ophthalmologic finding was noted. RESULTS: Of the 91 cases of newborns
  with isolated cleft palate treated by the first author, eight patients had Robin
  sequence, and among these, three had Stickler syndrome. The prevalence of Stickler
  syndrome among this subgroup of patients was 37.5% (3/8). Among these three patients
  and the additional five referred by other cleft surgeons, the average spherical
  equivalents of the first cycloplegic refraction for the 16 eyes was -12.39+/-2.72
  diopter (D) (range -8.75 to -18.5D). Of the eight patients, five did not need any
  therapy, two children had retinal degeneration in the left eye and retinal detachment
  in the right eye while one child had retinal detachment in the right eye only. Laser
  photocoagulation was performed in the two left eyes with retinal degeneration and
  was successful. Surgery was performed on the three eyes with retinal detachment,
  one was successful while two failed and the patients developed total blindness at
  ages four and six respectively. Out of these three children with retinal complications,
  only one child remained free of visual deterioration in both eyes during the follow-up
  period. CONCLUSION: Early identification of Stickler syndrome in children with Robin
  sequence by cleft surgeons is necessary to insure early referral to an ophthalmologist
  for detection of myopia, monitoring for retinal detachment, and prevention of visual
  complications."
