input_text: "Bifid uvula and familial Stickler syndrome diagnosed prenatally before
  the sonographic \"equals sign\" landmark. PURPOSE: The prenatal ultrasound visualization
  of the soft palate and especially the uvula may be technically difficult due to
  its anatomy and presence of surrounding structures. A cleft involving the soft palate
  and the uvula is one of the clinical features of Stickler syndrome, a rare connective
  tissue disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Third trimester scan performed at 30 weeks'
  gestation in a pregnant woman with a familial history of Stickler syndrome using
  conventional 2D ultrasound. RESULTS: Transabdominal scan performed with the fetal
  head in oblique plane and following fetal swallowing movements enabled a previously
  unrecognized median cleft at the level of the uvula. Molecular biology analysis
  allowed a precise prenatal diagnosis of Stickler syndrome and excluded overlapping
  syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The prenatal ultrasound diagnosis was achieved time before
  the \"equals signs\" was proposed as a useful sonographic marker of a normal uvula.
  The identification of a bifid uvula by conventional 2D ultrasound led to a prenatal
  diagnosis of Stickler syndrome in this affected Family and allowed the neonatologist
  team to be available at the time of birth. Moreover, postnatal multispecialist follow
  up could be timely planned for targeted organ examination and appropriate management."
