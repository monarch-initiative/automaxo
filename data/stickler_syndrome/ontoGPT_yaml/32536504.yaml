input_text: Surgical management in a severe OSA patient diagnosed with Stickler syndrome.
  Stickler syndrome is a genetic disorder of connective tissue. One of the major symptoms
  associated with this disorder is an oro-facial malformation, which may cause a submucous
  cleft or a complete cleft of the hard palate. A 32-year-old man diagnosed with Stickler
  syndrome and a submucosal cleft palate (SMCP) visited our hospital with a chief
  complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness. The patient was diagnosed with severe
  obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and administration of a polysomnography test revealed
  an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 30.9 events/hour (h). Auto-titrating continuous
  positive airway pressure was initiated to control the OSA symptoms and subsequently
  the patient showed some improvement. However, due to continuous velopharyngeal insufficiency
  symptoms, intravelar veloplasty was performed. Three months after surgery, the AHI
  had decreased to 12.4 events/h. Recent studies have described a greater risk for
  OSA in individuals with cleft palate, than in the general population. The present
  case demonstrates surgical success in a patient with OSA and SMCP, suggesting that
  palatal surgery may be considered an optional surgical treatment for OSA patients
  with SMCP.
