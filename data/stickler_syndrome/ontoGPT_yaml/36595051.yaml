input_text: 'Long-term anatomical and functional outcomes of surgical treatment of
  retinal complications in children and adolescents with Stickler syndrome between
  2004 and 2021. BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome (STL) is an inherited progressive connective
  tissue collagen disorder. STL is the most common hereditary cause of retinal complications,
  retinal tears, and the development of retinal detachment (RD) in childhood. The
  aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term anatomical and functional results
  of surgical treatment of retinal complications in children and adolescents affected
  by STL. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study was performed a cohort of
  children with STL who underwent retinal surgery between 2004 and 2021. RESULTS:
  The study group consisted of nine children; the mean age at the time of the retinal
  tear with/without retinal detachment was 7.2 (2-10) years, and the mean follow-up
  period was 9.6 (5-16) years. Pathogenic variants COL2A1 (5 children) and COL11A1
  (3 children) were confirmed in our cohort. In total, we operated on 13 eyes, 11
  eyes with complicated RD and two eyes with multiple retinal defects, but without
  RD. At the end of the follow-up period, an attached retina was achieved 77% (10
  eyes) with or without silicone oil tamponade: cryopexy alone was successful in one
  eye (10%), scleral buckling (EB) in five eyes (50%), and vitrectomy with silicone
  oil tamponade combined with EB in four eyes (40%). The mean number of surgeries
  was 2.3 per eye. The resulting best corrected visual acuity ranged from 0.03 to
  0.1 in one eye, from 0.16 to 0.4 in two eyes, and from 0.5 to 1.0 in 7 eyes. CONCLUSION:
  Repair of retinal tears with/without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler
  syndrome often requires multiple surgeries with combinations of cryopexy, scleral
  buckling, and/or vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade. Treatment of the ocular
  complications arising from STL requires long-term comprehensive care.'
