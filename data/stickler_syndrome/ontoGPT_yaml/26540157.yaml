input_text: "Use of External Distractors and the Role of Imaging Prior to Mandibular
  Distraction in Infants With Isolated Pierre Robin Sequence and Stickler Syndrome.
  IMPORTANCE: Computed tomographic (CT) scans are often obtained before mandibular
  distraction osteogenesis in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. There
  is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE:
  To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and
  aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices
  in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
  In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction
  between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals
  were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014,
  to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre
  Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time
  of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did
  not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis
  for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
  Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation,
  who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in
  whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion,
  no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the
  10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not
  receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation
  (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube
  or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There
  were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5
  outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement,
  2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated
  with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry
  at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests
  that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic
  outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants
  with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications
  for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population.
