input_text: 'A novel mutation in the COL2A1 gene in a patient with Stickler syndrome
  type 1: a case report and review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome
  is a group of collagenopathies characterized by ophthalmic, skeletal, and orofacial
  abnormalities, with the degree of symptoms varying among patients. Mutations in
  the COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2 procollagen genes cause Stickler syndrome. Marshall
  syndrome, caused by a COL11A1 mutation, has clinical overlap with Stickler syndrome.
  CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old Japanese boy was presented to our hospital with
  short stature (79.1 cm, -2.52 standard deviation). His past medical history was
  significant for soft cleft palate and bilateral cataracts. He had a flat midface,
  micrognathia, and limitations in bilateral elbow flexion. Radiographs showed mild
  spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Initially, we suspected Marshall syndrome, but no
  mutation was identified in COL11A1. At 8 years old, his height was 116.2 cm (-1.89
  standard deviation), and his orofacial characteristics appeared unremarkable. We
  analyzed the COL2A1 gene and found a novel heterozygous mutation (c.1142 G > A,
  p.Gly381Asp). CONCLUSIONS: In this case report, we identify a novel missense mutation
  in the COL2A1 gene in a patient with Stickler syndrome type 1, and we describe age-related
  changes in the clinical phenotype with regard to orofacial characteristics and height.
  Genetic analysis is helpful for the diagnosis of this clinically variable and genetically
  heterogeneous disorder.'
