input_text: 'Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment in Children: Clinical Factors Predictive
  of Successful Surgical Repair. PURPOSE: To describe presenting clinical features
  and surgical techniques that are associated with successful surgical repair of pediatric
  rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case
  series. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twelve eyes of 191 patients 0 to 18 years of age
  undergoing surgical repair for RRD between 2001 and 2015 with a minimum follow-up
  of 3 months. METHODS: Patients were divided into 3 age groups (0-6 years, 7-12 years,
  and 13-18 years) and comparisons were made using bivariate and multivariate generalized
  estimating equation models. A mixed means model was used to examine visual acuity
  in each age group over time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete reattachment of the
  retina at final follow-up. RESULTS: Of 212 eyes, 166 (78%) achieved total reattachment
  at final follow-up. Mean follow-up was 36.3 months. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
  associated with Stickler syndrome was more likely to occur in the younger cohorts
  (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.91), whereas RRD associated
  with blunt trauma was more likely to occur in the oldest cohort (OR, 2.3; 95% CI,
  1.2-4.4). Subtotal RRD was more likely to be repaired successfully than total RRD
  (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4; P = 0.0100), and eyes with previous vitreoretinal surgery
  were less likely to undergo successful repair (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.78; P =
  0.0258). There was no significant difference between age groups in the rate of surgical
  success (P = 0.55). There was a significantly higher success rate with primary scleral
  buckle (SB; 63%; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) and combined SB plus pars plana vitrectomy
  (PPV; 68%; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1) compared with PPV alone (51%). CONCLUSIONS:
  Most pediatric patients with RRD achieved complete reattachment with surgery. Success
  was more common in patients with a subtotal RRD at presentation. Previous vitreoretinal
  surgery was a risk factor for failure. Younger patients were more likely to demonstrate
  RRD involving the macula, but there was no difference between age groups in successful
  reattachment at final follow-up. Primary PPV showed a lower rate of success than
  SB or combined SB plus PPV.'
