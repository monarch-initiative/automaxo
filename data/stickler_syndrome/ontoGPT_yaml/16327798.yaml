input_text: "Type 1 Stickler syndrome: a histological and ultrastructural study of
  an untreated globe. AIMS: To present a histological and ultrastructural study of
  an untreated globe in a patient with genetically confirmed type 1 Stickler syndrome.
  METHODS: Histological and electron microscopic examinations were performed on the
  enucleated globe from the proband of a pedigree with type 1 Stickler syndrome. Linkage
  analysis was carried out using polymorphic markers flanking the COL2A1 gene and
  the mutation was identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The significant retinal
  abnormality was incarceration of vitreous collagen within glial strands on the inner
  surface of an atrophic and gliotic detached retina. The incarcerated collagenous
  layers contained glial cells and extended from the retina to form strands, some
  of which contributed to a retrolental membrane. Mutation screening detected a C
  to T mutation in exon 47 that inserted a premature termination codon into the reading
  frame of the mRNA. Sequence analysis of three of the four affected children confirmed
  that they were also heterozygous for the base change. The youngest child's DNA was
  not analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The study represents the first evidence of abnormal interactions
  between pathological vitreous collagen and the inner retina in a patient with type
  1 Stickler syndrome with a confirmed mutation in the COL2A1 gene."
