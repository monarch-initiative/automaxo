input_text: 'Phenotypic characterization of patients with early-onset high myopia
  due to mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1: Why not Stickler syndrome? Purpose: Our previous
  study reported that 5.5% of probands with early-onset high myopia (eoHM) had mutations
  in COL2A1 or COL11A1. Why were the probands initially considered to have eoHM but
  not Stickler syndrome (STL)? Methods: Probands and family members with eoHM and
  mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 were followed up and reexamined based on the criteria
  for STL. Further comprehensive examinations were conducted for patients with eoHM
  and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1
  or COL11A1. We performed comparisons between probands, affected family members with
  mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1
  or COL11A1. Results: Twelve probands (8.91+-4.03 years) and 14 affected family members
  (37.00+-11.18 years) with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, as well as 30
  controls with eoHM but without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, were recruited. Among
  them, 25.0% of probands and 50.0% of affected family members met the diagnostic
  criteria for STL after reexamination. Posterior vitreous detachment/foveal hypoplasia
  (PVD/FH), hypermobility of the elbow joint (HJ), and vitreous opacity were more
  frequent in patients with eoHM with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 than in the controls
  (p = 1.40 x 10-5, 3.72 x 10-4, 2.30x 10-3, respectively). HJ was more common in
  the probands than in the affected family members (11/12 versus 3/14; p = 3.42 x
  10-4), suggesting age-dependent manifestation. EoHM presented in all the probands
  and in 11/14 affected family members, suggesting that it is a more common indicator
  of STL than the previously described vitreoretinal abnormalities, especially in
  children. The rate of STL diagnosis could increase from 25.0% to 66.7% for probands
  and from 50.0% to 92.9% for affected family members if eoHM, PVD/FH, and HJ are
  added to the diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: In summary, it is not easy to differentiate
  STL from eoHM with routine ocular examination in outpatient clinics. Awareness of
  atypical phenotypes and newly recognized signs may be of help in identifying atypical
  STL, especially in children at eye clinics.'
