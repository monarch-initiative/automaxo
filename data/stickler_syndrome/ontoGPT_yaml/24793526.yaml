input_text: 'Prevention of retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome: the Cambridge
  prophylactic cryotherapy protocol. PURPOSE: The Stickler syndromes are the most
  common causes of inherited and childhood retinal detachment; however, no consensus
  exists regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic intervention. We evaluate the
  long-term safety and efficacy of the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol,
  a standardized retinal prophylactic treatment developed to prevent retinal detachment
  arising from giant retinal tears in type 1 Stickler syndrome. DESIGN: Retrospective
  comparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty seven patients with type
  1 Stickler syndrome. METHODS: Time to retinal detachment was compared between patients
  who received bilateral prophylaxis and untreated controls, with and without individual
  patient matching. Patients receiving unilateral prophylaxis (after fellow eye retinal
  detachment) were similarly compared with an appropriate control subgroup. Individual
  patient matching ensured equal age and follow-up between groups and that an appropriate
  control (who had not suffered a retinal detachment before the age at which their
  individually matched treatment patient underwent prophylactic treatment) was selected.
  Matching was blinded to outcome events. Individual patient matching protocols purposely
  weighted bias against the effectiveness of treatment. All treatment side effects
  are reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to retinal detachment and side effects
  occurring after prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: The bilateral control group (n
  = 194) had a 7.4-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the bilateral
  prophylaxis group (n = 229) (hazard ratio [HR], 7.40; 95% confidence interval [CI],
  4.53-12.08; P<0.001); the matched bilateral control group (n = 165) had a 5.0-fold
  increased risk compared to the matched bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 165) (HR,
  4.97; 95% CI, 2.82-8.78; P<0.001). The unilateral control group (n = 104) had a
  10.3-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the unilateral prophylaxis
  group (n = 64) (HR, 10.29; 95% CI, 4.96-21.36; P<0.001); the matched unilateral
  control group (n = 39) had a 8.4-fold increased risk compared to the matched unilateral
  prophylaxis group (n = 39) (HR, 8.36; 95% CI, 3.24-21.57; P<0.001). No significant
  long-term side effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest global cohort of type
  1 Stickler syndrome patients published, all analyses indicate that the Cambridge
  prophylactic cryotherapy protocol is safe and markedly reduces the risk of retinal
  detachment.'
