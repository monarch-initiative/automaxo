input_text: "Orofacial Manifestations of Stickler Syndrome: An Analysis of Speech
  Outcome and Facial Growth After Cleft Palate Repair. PURPOSE: The purpose of this
  study was to characterize airway problems, speech outcomes, and facial growth in
  patients with Stickler syndrome undergoing cleft palate repair. METHODS: A retrospective,
  longitudinal study was performed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on 25
  patients with Stickler syndrome and 53 nonsyndromic patients with clefts of the
  secondary palate repaired between 1977 and 2000. Airway problems were characterized
  by the incidence of Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) and the necessity for surgical airway
  management. Speech was analyzed using the Pittsburgh weighted values for speech
  symptoms associated with velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI). Longitudinal anthropometric
  measurements represented up to 12 years of longitudinal cephalofacial growth. RESULTS:
  Seventy-two percent of patients with Stickler syndrome were diagnosed with PRS,
  55.6% of whom required surgical airway management. Conversely, 20.8% of nonsyndromic
  patients were diagnosed with PRS (P < 0.0001), 18% of whom required surgical intervention
  (P < 0.05). Speech outcomes were poorer in patients with Stickler syndrome with
  40% demonstrating borderline VPI and 13.3% demonstrating VPI, compared with 21.8%
  and 9.1%, respectively, in the nonsyndromic group. Both groups exhibited significantly
  shallower upper and mid facial depths and wider upper facial breadths when compared
  with normal standards of facial growth. Although there was a tendency toward decreased
  facial depths in patients with Stickler syndrome relative to nonsyndromic patients,
  the differences were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Stickler syndrome
  show significant potential for early airway compromise and a poorer prognosis for
  speech outcome after cleft palate repair. Their cephalofacial growth does not differ
  significantly from that of nonsyndromic cleft palate patients."
