input_text: "Chronic Pediatric Retinal Detachment with Multiple Macrocysts. PURPOSE:
  To describe a case of chronic pediatric retinal detachment with multiple macrocysts,
  its surgical management, and a review of the literature. METHODS: Case report with
  fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case
  of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
  with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity
  upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral
  buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month
  follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100
  with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular
  ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation.
  CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic
  retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric
  patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance
  of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population."
