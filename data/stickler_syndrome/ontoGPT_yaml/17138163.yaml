input_text: 'Difficulties in anesthetic management of patients with micrognathia:
  report of a patient with Stickler syndrome. Stickler syndrome is an autosomal dominant
  multisystem disorder with characteristic midface hypoplasia, retromicrognathia,
  cleft palate and a "moon-shaped" appearance. Progressive myopia and retinal degeneration
  are frequent. It is estimated that one third of all Pierre Robin patients have Stickler
  syndrome. Patients with a mandibular hypoplasia like Stickler syndrome present the
  anesthesiologist considerable problems when mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation
  is attempted. In this case report the difficulties in anesthetic management of patients
  with micrognathia and repeated anesthetic courses of a child with Stickler syndrome
  are presented. It is vital to detect the syndrome in early stages so that adequate
  counseling and treatment may be given to avoid the potentially irreversible and
  disabling consequences.'
