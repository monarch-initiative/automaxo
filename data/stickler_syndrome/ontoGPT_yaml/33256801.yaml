input_text: "Basedow-Graves' disease in a pediatric patient with Sticlker syndrome,
  a new endocrine finding to improve personalized treatment. BACKGROUND: Stickler
  syndrome is a connective tissue disorder with predominantly autosomal dominant inheritance,
  with ocular, auditory and joint involvement. Thyroid dysfunction was not described
  as part of alterations in Stickler syndrome and in particular, the association between
  Stickler's syndrome and Graves' disease has never been previously reported in literature.
  Moreover, the presence of Graves' disease is uncommon in the pediatric age (especially
  in children younger than 6 years old). CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of
  a 5-years old child affected by Stickler syndrome who received the diagnosis of
  Graves's disease, in absence of suggestive symptoms, during health supervision.
  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence of thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune pattern
  for Sticker syndrome. Further clinical reports are expected before suggesting the
  implementation of new clinical skills for Stickler syndrome, but this paper may
  contribute to improve personalized management of this rare disorder."
