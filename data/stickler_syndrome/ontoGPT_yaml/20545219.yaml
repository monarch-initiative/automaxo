input_text: '[Stickler syndrome with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment]. BACKGROUND:
  Stickler syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by various disorders
  of the eyes and the connective tissues throughout the body. It can arise from a
  mutation in the collagen associated gene. We present a case of Stickler syndrome
  with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. CASE: A 10-years-old boy was referred to
  us with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment of the right eye. His family history included
  eye disease and a cleft palate. He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice
  degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge.
  His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral
  buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did
  a reattachment of the retina in the right eye. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric retinal detachment
  may indicate the presence of Stickler syndrome and a complete examination of the
  eye as well as a full family history must be obtained in such cases.'
