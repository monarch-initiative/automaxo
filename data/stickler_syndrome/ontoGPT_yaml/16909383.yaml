input_text: A new autosomal recessive form of Stickler syndrome is caused by a mutation
  in the COL9A1 gene. Stickler syndrome is characterized by ophthalmic, articular,
  orofacial, and auditory manifestations. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance
  pattern and is caused by mutations in COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2. We describe
  a family of Moroccan origin that consists of four children with Stickler syndrome,
  six unaffected children, and two unaffected parents who are distant relatives (fifth
  degree). All family members were clinically investigated for ear, nose, and throat;
  ophthalmologic; and radiological abnormalities. Four children showed symptoms characteristic
  of Stickler syndrome, including moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, moderate-to-high
  myopia with vitreoretinopathy, and epiphyseal dysplasia. We considered the COL9A1
  gene, located on chromosome 6q13, to be a candidate gene on the basis of the structural
  association with collagen types II and XI and because of the high expression in
  the human inner ear indicated by cDNA microarray. Mutation analysis of the coding
  region of the COL9A1 gene showed a homozygous R295X mutation in the four affected
  children. The parents and four unaffected children were heterozygous carriers of
  the R295X mutation. Two unaffected children were homozygous for the wild-type allele.
  None of the family members except the homozygous R295X carriers had any signs of
  Stickler syndrome. Therefore, COL9A1 is the fourth identified gene that can cause
  Stickler syndrome. In contrast to the three previously reported Stickler syndrome-causing
  genes, this gene causes a form of Stickler syndrome with an autosomal recessive
  inheritance pattern. This finding will have a major impact on the genetic counseling
  of patients with Stickler syndrome and on the understanding of the pathophysiology
  of collagens. Mutation analysis of this gene is recommended in patients with Stickler
  syndrome with possible autosomal recessive inheritance.
