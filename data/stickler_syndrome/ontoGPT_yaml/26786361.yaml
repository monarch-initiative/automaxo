input_text: 'Auditory phenotype in Stickler syndrome: results of audiometric analysis
  in 20 patients. Hearing loss in Stickler syndrome has received little attention
  due to the often more disabling ocular, orofacial and skeletal manifestations. Estimates
  suggest a global prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) ranging from 50
  % to about 100 % though, depending on the underlying Stickler genotype. By performing
  extensive audiometric analysis in Stickler patients, we aimed to further elucidate
  the auditory phenotype. Twenty molecularly confirmed Stickler patients (age 10-62
  year), of whom sixteen with type 1 Stickler syndrome (COL2A1 mutation) and four
  with type 2 Stickler syndrome (COL11A1 mutation) underwent an otological questionnaire,
  clinical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry and otoacoustic
  emission testing. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis of the audiograms
  was performed to assess progression. In type 1 Stickler syndrome, 75 % demonstrated
  hearing loss, predominantly in the high frequencies. No significant progression
  beyond presbyacusis was observed. All type 2 Stickler patients exhibited mild-to-moderate
  low- and mid-frequency SNHL and moderate-to-severe high-frequency SNHL. In both
  types, hearing loss was observed in childhood. Otoacoustic emissions were only detectable
  in 7/40 ears and had very low amplitudes, even in frequency bands with normal hearing
  on pure tone audiometry. Type 1 Stickler syndrome is characterized by a mild high-frequency
  SNHL, emerging in childhood and non-progressive. Absent otoacoustic emissions are
  a frequent finding. Patients with type 2 Stickler syndrome exhibit early-onset moderate
  SNHL affecting all frequencies with a sloping audiogram. Taking into account the
  visual impairment in many patients, we recommend regular auditory follow-up in patients
  with Stickler syndrome, especially in childhood. '
