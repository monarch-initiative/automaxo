input_text: 'WAGNER syndrome: anatomic, functional and genetic characterization of
  a Portuguese family. PURPOSE: To report the clinical (anatomic and functional) and
  genetic findings of Wagner Syndrome (WS) in a Portuguese family. METHODS: Nine members
  of the family agreed to be examined. All had complete clinical eye examinations.
  The proband and selected patients underwent color fundus photography, spectral domain
  optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), automatic static white-on-white computerized
  perimetry, and electrophysiology assessment (flash ERG, multifocal(mf) ERG and dark
  adaptometry). A pedigree was constructed based on interviews with known affected
  subjects. Genomic DNA samples derived from venous blood were collected from all
  affected family members examined. RESULTS: Twenty-eight family members are affected.
  This family has the typical features of Wagner Syndrome, namely an empty vitreous
  cavity with veils, mild myopia and cataract. Four examined patients underwent vitreoretinal
  surgery due to abnormal peripheral vitreoretinal adhesions with peripheral retinal
  traction (n = 3). Retinal detachment was observed in 5 of the examined subjects.
  Four of them occurred between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Chorioretinal atrophy
  is also a frequent finding which results in moderate to severe visual field and
  advanced rod-cone dystrophy from younger ages, also confirmed by absence of scotopic
  function on dark adaptation. The macular dysfunction on mfERG was profound and of
  early onset. A heterozygous mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (c.4004-1G > A)
  was found. CONCLUSIONS: We described a rare autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy
  with near complete penetrance in a Portuguese family. Abnormal peripheral vitreoretinal
  adhesions, retinal detachment and chorioretinal atrophy are present in most of the
  examined individuals at young ages. Early onset of advanced visual field and electrophysiologic
  abnormalities were observed in this family. We also added relevant information to
  the literature by reporting our experience in surgical management of Wagner Syndrome
  patients with, and at risk of, retinal detachment.'
