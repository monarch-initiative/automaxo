input_text: "Robin sequence: a retrospective review of 115 patients. OBJECTIVES: Review
  a large series of patients with Robin sequence to document the incidence of (1)
  associated syndromic diagnoses; (2) co-morbid conditions; (3) frequency and type
  of operative management for airway compromise and feeding difficulties; and (4)
  possible differences in treatment between syndromic and nonsyndromic infants. METHODS:
  Retrospective case-review of 115 patients with Robin sequence managed between 1962
  and 2002 at two tertiary-care teaching hospitals for evaluation of demographic information,
  clinical findings, and treatment interventions. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent (N=63)
  of patients were nonsyndromic. Syndromic patients included: Stickler syndrome (18%),
  velocardiofacial syndrome (7%), Treacher-Collins (5%), facial and hemifacial microsomia
  (3%), and other defined (3.5%) and undefined (9%) disorders. There was no statistical
  difference between the syndromic and nonsyndromic patients with regard to need for
  operative airway management (Fisher's exact test, p=0.264). Forty-two percent of
  patients required a feeding gastrostomy tube to correct feeding difficulties. Patients
  with a syndromic diagnosis were more likely to be developmentally delayed. Fifty-one
  (44%) patients underwent operative airway management: 61% underwent tongue-lip adhesion
  and 39% underwent tracheotomy. Fifteen percent of patients initially had tongue-lip
  adhesion subsequently required tracheotomy. While the preferred treatment for respiratory
  compromise differed between the two institutions, the percentage of patients requiring
  operative intervention was similar. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of Robin sequence
  is multifactorial and syndromic in nearly half of the patients. Operative treatment
  of respiratory failure was required in 44% of infants; the rate was similar in both
  hospitals. The operative approach differed significantly between the institutions,
  however, based on the philosophy and training of the managing surgical specialty.
  Co-morbid factors such as baseline cardiopulmonary and neurologic status did not
  play a significant role in surgical decision making."
