input_text: 'Stickler Syndrome: Airway Complications in a Case Series of 502 Patients.
  BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and
  are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment
  repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there
  is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe
  anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome
  cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature.
  METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler
  syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking
  to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt
  to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD).
  Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected.
  Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed.
  RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five
  (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed
  with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were
  required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression,
  modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were
  significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation.
  CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard
  management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced
  anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend
  that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.'
