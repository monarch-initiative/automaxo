input_text: 'Case Series of Stickler Syndrome Presenting With Acute Angle Closure.
  PURPOSE: Stickler syndrome is associated with open-angle glaucoma, but no reports
  exist of adults presenting with acute angle closure. Here, we report the clinical
  associations and short-term outcomes in 2 patients with Stickler syndrome who presented
  with acute angle closure at a single tertiary referral center. OBSERVATIONS: A 36-year-old
  female with Stickler syndrome presented with acute onset of red and painful left
  eye with cloudy vision. Initial intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured to be 54
  mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed no angle structures or peripheral anterior synechiae
  in the left eye. Two laser peripheral iridotomies were created 5 days apart without
  adequate IOP lowering. Left eye cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation
  and Ahmed glaucoma drainage device implantation were performed with resolution of
  ocular hypertension.A 35-year-old male with Stickler syndrome presented with intermittent
  right eye pain and blurry vision. IOP was 42 mm Hg and gonioscopy revealed 270 degrees
  of angle closure in the right eye. The patient underwent laser peripheral iridotomy
  in the right eye with resolution of ocular hypertension by the next day. CONCLUSIONS:
  Recognizing angle closure as a potential feature of Stickler syndrome can help providers
  adequately screen and manage patients with Stickler syndrome presenting with acutely
  elevated IOP.'
