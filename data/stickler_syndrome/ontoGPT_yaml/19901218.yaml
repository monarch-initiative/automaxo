input_text: 'Mutational hot spot potential of a novel base pair mutation of the CSPG2
  gene in a family with Wagner syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To report a 3-generation white
  family clinically diagnosed variably with Wagner, Stickler, and Jansen syndromes
  and screened for sequence variants in the COL2A1 and CSPG2 genes. Wagner syndrome
  is an autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy with a predisposition to retinal detachment
  and cataracts. It has significant phenotypic overlap with allelic Jansen syndrome
  and ocular Stickler syndrome type 1. Sticker syndrome type 1 maps to chromosome
  12q13.11-q13.2, with associated COL2A1 gene mutations. Wagner syndrome maps to chromosome
  5q13-q14 and is associated with mutations in CSPG2 encoding versican, a proteoglycan
  present in human vitreous. METHODS: Genomic DNA samples derived from venous blood
  were collected from all family members. Complete sequencing of COL2A1 was performed
  on a proband. Primers for polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were designed
  to cover all exon and intron-exon boundaries. Direct sequencing of CSPG2 was performed
  on all family member samples. RESULTS: No detectable COL2A1 mutations were noted,
  making the diagnosis of ocular Stickler syndrome highly unlikely for this family.
  A unique base pair substitution (c.9265 + 1G>T) in intron 8 of the CSPG2 gene cosegregating
  with disease status was identified. This mutation occurred in a highly conserved
  previously reported splice site with a similar base pair substitution (G>A). Direct
  sequencing of this splice site mutation in 107 unrelated external controls revealed
  no variants, supporting the rarity of this base pair change and its causation in
  Wagner syndrome. This novel base pair substitution is thought to cause the deletion
  of exon 8 and formation of a truncated protein product. CONCLUSION: Mutation screening
  of CSPG2 in autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy families is important for accurate
  diagnosis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study underscores the importance of obtaining
  extensive pedigree information and comparative ophthalmologic clinical information,
  as the phenotypic findings may vary greatly among independent family members. The
  study also affirms the paradigm shift from diagnosis assignment based on eponyms
  to that based on gene mutation type.'
