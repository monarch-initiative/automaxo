input_text: 'Retinal Detachment Prophylaxis for Patients With Stickler Syndrome: A
  Survey of Pediatric Retinal Specialist Treatment Preferences. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:
  Stickler syndrome is the most common inherited cause of pediatric rhegmatogenous
  retinal detachment. The purpose of this study was to survey pediatric retinal surgeon
  preferences for prophylactic treatment of Stickler syndrome patients. STUDY DESIGN:
  A voluntary, anonymous 27-question survey was developed by RedCap and distributed
  to the Association of Pediatric Retinal Surgeons. The survey was distributed on
  March 17, 2021. Results were tabulated on April 12, 2021 in Microsoft Excel. All
  surveys returned were included. RESULTS: Thirty-four (76% response rate) respondents
  completed the survey. Twenty-six (76%) reported primarily using prophylactic laser
  retinopexy, four (12%) preferred use of cryotherapy, and 12% reported using prophylactic
  scleral buckle. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the United States. and international
  pediatric retinal surgeons use laser retinopexy as the primary method of prophylactic
  treatment. These results may serve as a benchmark for retinal surgeons less familiar
  with prophylactic treatment approaches. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina 2023;54:102-107.].'
