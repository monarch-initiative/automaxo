input_text: Stickler syndrome, ocular-only variants and a key diagnostic role for
  the ophthalmologist. The entity described by Gunnar Stickler, which included hereditary
  arthro-ophthalmopathy associated with retinal detachment, has recently been recognised
  to consist of a number of subgroups, which might now more correctly be referred
  to as the Stickler syndromes. They are the most common clinical manifestation of
  the type II/XI collagenopathies and are the most common cause of inherited rhegmatogenous
  retinal detachment. This review article is intended to provide the ophthalmologist
  with an update on current research, subgroups, and their diagnosis together with
  a brief overview of allied conditions to be considered in the clinical differential
  diagnosis. We highlight the recently identified subgroups with a high risk of retinal
  detachment but with minimal or absent systemic involvement--a particularly important
  group for the ophthalmologist to identify.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
