input_text: 'Incidence of mandibular distraction osteogenesis in Stickler Syndrome:
  Variation due to COL2A1 and COL11A1. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the two most
  common genetic mutations seen in Stickler Syndrome (SS) (COL2A1 and COL11A1) affect
  the incidence of mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) and what impact Robin
  sequence (RS) has on diagnosis. SS is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder
  characterized by almost complete penetrance. COL2A1 and COL11A1 are the two most
  common mutations seen in SS patients. SS often presents at birth with RS, which
  is characterized by the triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and tongue-based airway
  obstruction. MDO is one surgical intervention that has been shown to be successful
  in relieving tongue base obstruction and is the surgical intervention of choice
  for this condition. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients
  with a diagnosis of SS at a tertiary pediatric hospital between January 1, 2003
  and December 31, 2018. The included patient charts were reviewed for demographic
  information, SS mutation, and history of MDO. Forty-six patients had a clinical
  diagnosis of SS. Of those, 31 met inclusion criteria which involved having a molecular
  diagnosis of SS and sufficient follow up information to determine if MDO was indicated
  or performed. Twenty-two of the 31 included patients had a diagnosis of RS (70.96%).
  Thirteen of the 31 patients (41.94%) included in this study required MDO as a neonate.
  RESULTS: Fifty-percent of patients with type I (COL2A1) required MDO as a neonate
  compared to only 31% of patients with type II (COL11A1), though the difference between
  the two groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The findings of this
  study suggest that patients with type I mutation may have a higher incidence of
  MDO than patients with a type II mutation, though further research with larger sample
  sizes is needed. This information is helpful in counseling those with SS or family
  history of SS about what they can expect related to RS and need for MDO based on
  genetic findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.'
