input_text: Subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth in airway management in
  Pierre Robin sequence. Procedures to relieve airway obstruction in Pierre Robin
  sequence (PRS) include glossopexy, mandibular distraction, and tracheostomy. Previously,
  it has been suggested that the imbalance of the genioglossus insertion on the mandible
  could be responsible for the micrognathia, tongue elevation, and glossoptosis seen
  in PRS. We performed a retrospective study to determine the usefulness of subperiosteal
  release of the floor of the mouth in PRS with airway problems. Between 1991 and
  2005, 14 consecutive patients with PRS were treated with subperiosteal release of
  the floor of the mouth performed at the British Columbia's Children's Hospital.
  There were 8 boys and 6 girls. Mean age at surgery was 15 weeks (range, 1-68 weeks).
  Postoperative follow-up ranged from 8 months to 13 years. Seven patients (4 boys
  and 3 girls) were successfully treated, and a tracheostomy was prevented. Fifty-five
  percent of the syndromic patients needed a tracheostomy, whereas 1 patient (33%)
  with isolated PRS needed a tracheostomy. The most common syndrome associated with
  PRS was Stickler syndrome. Five (72%) of the 7 patients who required a tracheostomy
  were boys. If conservative measures fail to relieve supraglottic airway obstruction
  seen in patients with PRS, a subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth can
  be an effective intervention in certain patients. It is a simple intervention with
  few complications and little morbidity. More investigations are mandatory to precisely
  define patient characteristics ideal for this intervention.
