input_text: Management of retinal detachment in the Wagner-Stickler syndrome. Thirty
  six retinal detachments in 33 patients with Wagner-Stickler syndrome are reported.
  The results of surgery are correlated with the types of break (giant retinal tear
  or multiple breaks), the surgical approach (conventional buckling or closed microsurgery)
  and the presence or absence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Overall, 27 detachments
  were successfully reattached.
