  Using Data From the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized
  Clinical Trial. IMPORTANCE: Patching has been a mainstay in treating unilateral
  congenital cataract. However, its efficacy has not been rigorously assessed. OBJECTIVE:
  To examine the association between patching and visual acuity in a cohort of children
  treated for unilateral congenital cataract. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This
  study was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (Infant Aphakia Treatment
  Study) of infants born from August 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008, who were
  treated with 1 of 2 treatments for unilateral congenital cataract and followed up
  to 5 years of age. Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2013, to March 1, 2016.
  INTERVENTIONS: Cataract extraction and randomization to receipt of an intraocular
  lens vs being left aphakic for the first 5 years of life. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
  Caregivers reported patching in the previous 48 hours in quarterly semistructured
  telephone interviews. The mean number of hours of patching per day was calculated
  from surgery to the first birthday (n = 92) and between 12 and 48 months of age
  (n = 102). Monocular optotype acuity was assessed at 41/2 years of age by a traveling
  examiner using the Aphakia Treatment Study HOTV protocol. RESULTS: The Infant Aphakia
  Treatment Study enrolled 114 children; 57 were randomized to each treatment group.
  At 41/2 years of age, optotype visual acuity was assessed in 112 children. The current
  analyses exclude an additional 3 children (2 who had adverse events that limited
  visual potential and 1 who had Stickler syndrome), leaving 109 total children analyzed
  (59 female [54.1%] and 92 white [84.4%]). Caregivers reported patching their children
  a mean (SD) of 3.73 (1.47) hours per day in the first year of life and 3.43 (2.04)
  hours per day thereafter. An association between reported patching and treatment
  was not identified (mean difference in first year, -0.29 hours per day; 95% CI,
  -0.90 to 0.33 hours per day; mean difference between 12 and 48 months of age, -0.40
  hours per day; 95% CI, -1.20 to 0.40 hours per day). Visual acuity was associated
  with reported hours of patching in the first year of life (r = -0.32; 95% CI, -0.49
  to -0.13) and between 12 and 48 months of age (r = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.18).
  However, patching accounted for less than 15% of the variance in logMAR acuity at
  41/2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results support the association
  of occlusion throughout the preschool years with improved visual acuity in infants
  treated for unilateral congenital cataract. However, similar visual outcomes were
  achieved with varying amounts of patching. These conclusions should be interpreted
  in the context of limitations related to generalizability from incomplete data collected
  in a clinical trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00212134.'
