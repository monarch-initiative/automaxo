RESULTS: Of the 316 usable replies, 95% of persons had eye problems (retinal detachment occurred in 60% of patients, myopia in 90%, and blindness in 4%); 84% had problems with facial structures such as a flat face, small mandible, or cleft palate; 70%, hearing loss; and 90%, joint problems, primarily early joint pain from degenerative joint disease. Treatment included cryotherapy and laser therapy for retinal detachment, repair of cleft palate, use of hearing and mobility aids, and joint replacements. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations of symptoms and signs among affected persons, even within the same family. There are delays in diagnosis, lack of understanding among family members, denial about the risk of serious eye problems, and joint disease.",

METHODS: A total of 14 patients, diagnosed by clinical criteria, were included. The following variables were evaluated: age, gender, ocular background, follow-up, initial and final visual acuity (VA), optical prescription, prophylactic treatment, surgery and techniques performed. The risk age to suffer a RD, as well as cataracts, was determined by using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 5 men and 9 women, the median initial VA was 0.35, which was the same as the final VA. The median optical prescription was -9.5 D myopia. The median of follow-up was 7 years. Ocular background was 4 RD cases and 2 Lasik surgeries. The operations performed were 8 RD, 12 cataract, 2 glaucoma, 2 macular hole, and one endotropia. The median age of RD was 20 years and cataract 34 years. As regards surgical tecnique, 4 scleral buckle cases, and 4 scleral buckle+pars plana vitrectomy cases were formed. The prophylactic treatments performed were: one scleral buckle case, 4 endolaser photocoagulation, and one cryotherapy. Two of which presented with RD. CONCLUSION: In the series presented, retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome mainly occurs in the second decade of life, with cataracts mainly developing in the fourth decade.",

METHODS: Retrospective review of 52 Stickler syndrome patients who received a 6-mm wide, 360  encircling scleral buckling. Thirty-nine (75%; Cryo + Group) also received cryo treatment, whereas the reminder 13/52 (25% Cryo - Group) did not. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 15.6 +- 2.41 years. Five patients (5/52; 9.6%) developed a retinal detachment 2.6 +- 0.55 years after prophylactic treatment, respectively, 0/39 patients in the Cryo + Group and 5/13 in the Cryo - Group (P < 0.001). All five RD eyes were successfully reattached through revised episcleral surgery and adjunctive cryo treatment. Postop refraction changed an average -1.9 +- 0.74 diopters and best corrected visual acuity at the end of follow-up was 20/25 (0.1 +- 0.07 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), not significantly different from the rest of sample population who did not develop RD in their fellow eye.

STL is the most common hereditary cause of retinal complications, retinal tears, and the development of retinal detachment (RD) in childhood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term anatomical and functional results of surgical treatment of retinal complications in children and adolescents affected by STL. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study was performed a cohort of children with STL who underwent retinal surgery between 2004 and 2021. RESULTS: The study group consisted of nine children; the mean age at the time of the retinal tear with/without retinal detachment was 7.2 (2-10) years, and the mean follow-up period was 9.6 (5-16) years. Pathogenic variants COL2A1 (5 children) and COL11A1 (3 children) were confirmed in our cohort. In total, we operated on 13 eyes, 11 eyes with complicated RD and two eyes with multiple retinal defects, but without RD. At the end of the follow-up period, an attached retina was achieved 77% (10 eyes) with or without silicone oil tamponade: cryopexy alone was successful in one eye (10%), scleral buckling (EB) in five eyes (50%), and vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade combined with EB in four eyes (40%). The mean number of surgeries was 2.3 per eye. The resulting best corrected visual acuity ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 in one eye, from 0.16 to 0.4 in two eyes, and from 0.5 to 1.0 in 7 eyes. CONCLUSION: Repair of retinal tears with/without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome often requires multiple surgeries with combinations of cryopexy, scleral buckling, and/or vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade. Treatment of the ocular complications arising from STL requires long-term comprehensive care.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Computed tomographic (CT) scans are often obtained before mandibular distraction osteogenesis in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively if scleral buckling combined or not to cryopexy reduces fellow-eye retinal detachment (RD) in Stickler syndrome patients who lost their first eye due to RD. METHODS: Retrospective review of 52 Stickler syndrome patients who received a 6-mm wide, 360  encircling scleral buckling. Thirty-nine (75%; Cryo + Group) also received cryo treatment, whereas the reminder 13/52 (25% Cryo - Group) did not. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 15.6 +- 2.41 years. Five patients (5/52; 9.6%) developed a retinal detachment 2.6 +- 0.55 years after prophylactic treatment, respectively, 0/39 patients in the Cryo + Group and 5/13 in the Cryo - Group (P < 0.001). All five RD eyes were successfully reattached through revised episcleral surgery and adjunctive cryo treatment. Postop refraction changed an average -1.9 +- 0.74 diopters and best corrected visual acuity at the end of follow-up was 20/25 (0.1 +- 0.07 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), not significantly different from the rest of sample population who did not develop RD in their fellow eye. CONCLUSION: Cryopexy significantly reduced the risk of RD in Stickler syndrome patients undergoing scleral buckling. If RD ensues, the presence of scleral buckling may ease surgical repair and improve final outcome.",

One of the major symptoms associated with this disorder is an oro-facial malformation, which may cause a submucous cleft or a complete cleft of the hard palate. A 32-year-old man diagnosed with Stickler syndrome and a submucosal cleft palate (SMCP) visited our hospital with a chief complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness. The patient was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and administration of a polysomnography test revealed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 30.9 events/hour (h). Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure was initiated to control the OSA symptoms and subsequently the patient showed some improvement. However, due to continuous velopharyngeal insufficiency symptoms, intravelar veloplasty was performed. Three months after surgery, the AHI had decreased to 12.4 events/h. Recent studies have described a greater risk for OSA in individuals with cleft palate, than in the general population. The present case demonstrates surgical success in a patient with OSA and SMCP, suggesting that palatal surgery may be considered an optional surgical treatment for OSA patients with SMCP.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a collagen disorder that can affect multiple organ systems. It is characterized by ocular abnormalities, hearing loss, midfacial hypoplasia, hypermobility, and joint abnormalities. The phenotypic expression of Stickler syndrome can vary among those affected. Since Stickler syndrome is a collagen disorder, it is possible to expect pregnancy complications similar to those reported in other collagen disorders. To our knowledge, there is only one case report in the literature on the management of pregnancy and delivery of a patient with Stickler syndrome. METHODS/CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old primigravid woman with a diagnosis of Stickler syndrome presented at 9 weeks gestation for prenatal genetic consultation. At 26, the patient had prophylactic laser therapy for lattice degeneration of the retina. At 32, she was found to be heterozygous for the c.1527 G>T variant in the COL2A1 gene, which is associated with ocular abnormalities and autosomal dominant form of Stickler syndrome. Subsequently, she desired to pursue prenatal diagnostic testing for the familial variant. The patient voiced that the results would impact pregnancy management. Amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks gestation. Results were negative for the maternal COL2A1 variant. Karyotype was normal (46, XX). RESULTS: A multidisciplinary team using a patient-centered approach including obstetrics, ophthalmology, maternal-fetal medicine, and genetics determined that there were no contraindications for vaginal delivery. At 39 weeks, the patient underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of data available regarding the maternal outcomes of women affected with collagen disorders, especially Stickler Syndrome. This case highlights the importance of accurate genetic diagnosis in the prenatal period and provides information to physicians caring for patients with Stickler syndrome.",

METHODS: We identified a family with 2 adults with polyarticular OA and a child with generalized arthralgia. General, musculoskeletal, ocular, and auditory evaluations were undertaken. Investigations included radiographs of symptomatic joints, analysis of serum inflammatory markers and joint fluid, and mutational analyses of the COL11A2 gene. RESULTS: The 3 affected individuals had normal stature, mild mid-face hypoplasia, and hearing impairment, but normal eyes. Radiographs of the affected adults showed severe polyarticular OA but did not reveal diagnostic evidence of an underlying skeletal dysplasia. However, the child's radiographs showed enlarged epiphyses with an advanced bone age. The combination of skeletal, facial, and auditory features together with the absence of ocular features indicated that they had otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia, also known as Stickler syndrome type III. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a mutation in the COL11A2 gene that encodes the pre-pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen that is involved in type II collagen fibrillogenesis. CONCLUSION: Early-onset polyarticular OA may occur in adults without a known or obvious underlying skeletal dysplasia. This study provides an approach to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia in such individuals.",

As a result, it has been recommended that all patients with Stickler syndrome undergo routine echocardiography and have antibiotic prophylaxis prior to surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in a large cohort of UK patients with Stickler syndrome in whom the clinical diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular genetic analysis. Probands and pedigrees were identified from the Vitreoretinal Service database according to previously published criteria. Ophthalmic, skeletal, audiometric, and orofacial features were assessed. Affected individuals underwent a full cardiological examination including auscultation and two-dimensional echocardiography. Mutation analysis of the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes was carried out. Seventy-eight patients from 25 pedigrees were studied. Mutation analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis in every pedigree. No patient was found to have clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease and no patient had significant mitral or other valvular prolapse on echocardiography. These data from a large cohort of UK patients with proven Stickler syndrome do not suggest an increased incidence of mitral valve prolapse over and above that found in the general population. Routine echocardiography screening and use of preoperative antibiotics are unnecessary and should be reserved for those individual cases where there is clear clinical indication.",

METHODS: The probands of two consanguineous autosomal recessive Stickler families were evaluated for homozygosity using SNP microarray in one and haplotype analysis in the other. Subsequently, the entire COL9A1 open reading frame was analyzed by DNA sequencing in all members of the respective families. Several family members were investigated for dysmorphic features as well as ophthalmic, audiologic, and radiologic abnormalities. RESULTS: A novel homozygous COL9A1 mutation (p.R507X) was identified in two affected Turkish sisters, and the previously published mutation (p.R295X) was found in a Moroccan boy. Ophthalmic assessment revealed myopia, cataracts, distinct vitreous changes, progressive chorioretinal degeneration, and exudative and rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. All three had sensorineural hearing loss and epiphyseal dysplasia. Intervertebral disc bulging was observed in one patient and in two heterozygous carriers of the p.R507X mutation. CONCLUSIONS: A second, novel mutation was identified in COL9A1, causing autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome together with the previously described nucleotide change in two separate families. Although the overall phenotype was comparable to autosomal dominant Stickler, vitreous changes that may enable recognition of patients who are likely to carry mutations in COL9A1 were identified, and exudative retinal detachment was observed as a new finding in Stickler syndrome.",

DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals, including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing. Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography, and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants. RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately 28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding 95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive. It is less severe than that reported for types II and III Stickler syndrome linked to COL11A2 (OMIM 120290) and COL11A1 (OMIM 120280) mutations, respectively, or the closely related Marshall syndrome. This difference will be a useful discriminatory feature in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders.",

One of the major symptoms associated with this disorder is an oro-facial malformation, which may cause a submucous cleft or a complete cleft of the hard palate. A 32-year-old man diagnosed with Stickler syndrome and a submucosal cleft palate (SMCP) visited our hospital with a chief complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness. The patient was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and administration of a polysomnography test revealed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 30.9 events/hour (h). Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure was initiated to control the OSA symptoms and subsequently the patient showed some improvement. However, due to continuous velopharyngeal insufficiency symptoms, intravelar veloplasty was performed. Three months after surgery, the AHI had decreased to 12.4 events/h. Recent studies have described a greater risk for OSA in individuals with cleft palate, than in the general population. The present case demonstrates surgical success in a patient with OSA and SMCP, suggesting that palatal surgery may be considered an optional surgical treatment for OSA patients with SMCP.",

There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase.

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Computed tomographic (CT) scans are often obtained before mandibular distraction osteogenesis in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

This retrospective consecutive case series included 149 patients with inherited eye diseases, seen by a single pediatric ophthalmologist, who underwent genetic testing between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018. Variants were detected using a target enrichment panel of 429 genes and known deep intronic variants associated with inherited eye disease. Among 149 patients, 38 (25.5%) had a family history, and this cohort includes heterogeneous phenotype including anterior segment dysgenesis, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus syndrome, optic atrophy, and retinal dystrophy. Overall, 90 patients (60.4%) received a definite molecular diagnosis. Overall, NGS-guided precision care was provided to 8 patients (5.4%). The precision care included cryotherapy to prevent retinal detachment in COL2A1 Stickler syndrome, osteoporosis management in patients with LRP5-associated familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and avoidance of unnecessary phlebotomy in hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. A revision of the initial clinical diagnosis was made in 22 patients (14.8%). Unexpected multi-gene deletions and dual diagnosis were noted in 4 patients (2.7%). We found that precision medical or surgical managements were provided for 8 of 149 patients (5.4%), and multiple locus variants were found in 2.7% of cases. These findings are important because individualized management of inherited eye diseases can be achieved through genetic testing.",

Molecular analysis has proven effective in diagnosis, confirmation and classification of the disease. We aimed to describe the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in genetic analysis of four Indian families with suspected Stickler syndrome. Methods: The index cases presented with retinal detachment with family history. Genetic analysis in the index case was performed by next-generation sequencing of inherited retinal degeneration genes, and validated by Sanger sequencing followed by co-segregation analysis in the other family members. Results: Twenty patients were included for the genetic analysis (15 males and 5 females from four families). Clinical details were available for 15 patients (30 eyes). Fourteen eyes (11 patients) developed RRD. In the 16 eyes without RRD, 8 underwent barrage laser to lattice degeneration and 8 were under observation. Disease segregating heterozygous mutations with pathogenic/likely pathogenic effect was identified in COL2A1 (c.4318-1G>A, c.141G>A, c.1221+1G>A for 3 families) and COL11A1 (c.1737+1 G>A for 1 family) gene. In addition to the mutation in the COL2A1 gene, a pathogenic heterozygous variant associated with risk for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) was identified in one member. Conclusion: NGS testing confirmed the presence of the causative gene for Stickler syndrome in the index case followed by evaluation of family members and confirmation of genetic and ocular findings. We believe that this may be the first such report of families with RRD from India.",

Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis. RESULTS: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis. CONCLUSION: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of the disease process and may allow for future growth.",

We evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol, a standardized retinal prophylactic treatment developed to prevent retinal detachment arising from giant retinal tears in type 1 Stickler syndrome. DESIGN: Retrospective comparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty seven patients with type 1 Stickler syndrome. METHODS: Time to retinal detachment was compared between patients who received bilateral prophylaxis and untreated controls, with and without individual patient matching. Patients receiving unilateral prophylaxis (after fellow eye retinal detachment) were similarly compared with an appropriate control subgroup. Individual patient matching ensured equal age and follow-up between groups and that an appropriate control (who had not suffered a retinal detachment before the age at which their individually matched treatment patient underwent prophylactic treatment) was selected. Matching was blinded to outcome events. Individual patient matching protocols purposely weighted bias against the effectiveness of treatment. All treatment side effects are reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to retinal detachment and side effects occurring after prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: The bilateral control group (n = 194) had a 7.4-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 229) (hazard ratio [HR], 7.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.53-12.08; P<0.001); the matched bilateral control group (n = 165) had a 5.0-fold increased risk compared to the matched bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 165) (HR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.82-8.78; P<0.001). The unilateral control group (n = 104) had a 10.3-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 64) (HR, 10.29; 95% CI, 4.96-21.36; P<0.001); the matched unilateral control group (n = 39) had a 8.4-fold increased risk compared to the matched unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 39) (HR, 8.36; 95% CI, 3.24-21.57; P<0.001). No significant long-term side effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest global cohort of type 1 Stickler syndrome patients published, all analyses indicate that the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol is safe and markedly reduces the risk of retinal detachment.",

Currently about 40 different genes have been identified which encode for at least 27 different collagens. The majority of mutations occur in the COL2A1 gene on chromosome 12q13 (SS type I). Mutations in COL11A1 are less frequent (SS type II). More recently, mutations in COL11A2 and in the COL9A1 gene have been reported with particular phenotypes. The main features of this autosomal inherited disease are ocular, auditory with orofacial abnormalities and early-onset osteoarthritis. We report the clinical presentation of an adult and his son, with a particular focus on the bone status of the father, radiography, bone densitometry and transiliac bone biopsy showing that he was suffering from osteoporosis. The lumbar bone mineral density was low with a Z-score at -2.9. Transiliac bone biopsy showed a dramatic decrease of trabecular bone volume (8.6%; Nl: 19.5+-4.9%), thin trabeculae and a disorganized trabecular network. A slight increase of osteoid parameters was observed. Bone resorption was markedly increased with an excessive number of active (TRAcP+) osteoclasts. The cortical width was normal, but a slight increase of cortical porosity was found. Osteoporosis has been rarely described in the SS. It might be useful to systematically perform a bone densitometry in all patients with SS and to discuss the indication of a transiliac bone biopsy in severe cases.",

Ten percent of patients had protrusio acetabuli, 21% coxa valga, and 34% of adults had hip osteoarthritis. Sixty-three percent of all patients and 79% of adults had chronic hip pain. In addition, 16% of adult patients had a history of femoral head failure during youth. Arthritic changes and adult age were associated with hip pain. In summary, hip abnormalities are commonly observed in Stickler syndrome. Young patients require careful evaluation of hip pain, and regular screening of children with Stickler syndrome may be indicated for early detection of hip complications.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Patching has been a mainstay in treating unilateral congenital cataract. However, its efficacy has not been rigorously assessed. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between patching and visual acuity in a cohort of children treated for unilateral congenital cataract. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (Infant Aphakia Treatment Study) of infants born from August 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008, who were treated with 1 of 2 treatments for unilateral congenital cataract and followed up to 5 years of age. Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2013, to March 1, 2016. INTERVENTIONS: Cataract extraction and randomization to receipt of an intraocular lens vs being left aphakic for the first 5 years of life. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Caregivers reported patching in the previous 48 hours in quarterly semistructured telephone interviews. The mean number of hours of patching per day was calculated from surgery to the first birthday (n = 92) and between 12 and 48 months of age (n = 102). Monocular optotype acuity was assessed at 41/2 years of age by a traveling examiner using the Aphakia Treatment Study HOTV protocol. RESULTS: The Infant Aphakia Treatment Study enrolled 114 children; 57 were randomized to each treatment group. At 41/2 years of age, optotype visual acuity was assessed in 112 children. The current analyses exclude an additional 3 children (2 who had adverse events that limited visual potential and 1 who had Stickler syndrome), leaving 109 total children analyzed (59 female [54.1%] and 92 white [84.4%]). Caregivers reported patching their children a mean (SD) of 3.73 (1.47) hours per day in the first year of life and 3.43 (2.04) hours per day thereafter. An association between reported patching and treatment was not identified (mean difference in first year, -0.29 hours per day; 95% CI, -0.90 to 0.33 hours per day; mean difference between 12 and 48 months of age, -0.40 hours per day; 95% CI, -1.20 to 0.40 hours per day). Visual acuity was associated with reported hours of patching in the first year of life (r = -0.32; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.13) and between 12 and 48 months of age (r = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.18). However, patching accounted for less than 15% of the variance in logMAR acuity at 41/2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results support the association of occlusion throughout the preschool years with improved visual acuity in infants treated for unilateral congenital cataract. However, similar visual outcomes were achieved with varying amounts of patching. These conclusions should be interpreted in the context of limitations related to generalizability from incomplete data collected in a clinical trial.

Here, we report the clinical associations and short-term outcomes in 2 patients with Stickler syndrome who presented with acute angle closure at a single tertiary referral center. OBSERVATIONS: A 36-year-old female with Stickler syndrome presented with acute onset of red and painful left eye with cloudy vision. Initial intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured to be 54 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed no angle structures or peripheral anterior synechiae in the left eye. Two laser peripheral iridotomies were created 5 days apart without adequate IOP lowering. Left eye cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and Ahmed glaucoma drainage device implantation were performed with resolution of ocular hypertension.A 35-year-old male with Stickler syndrome presented with intermittent right eye pain and blurry vision. IOP was 42 mm Hg and gonioscopy revealed 270 degrees of angle closure in the right eye. The patient underwent laser peripheral iridotomy in the right eye with resolution of ocular hypertension by the next day. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing angle closure as a potential feature of Stickler syndrome can help providers adequately screen and manage patients with Stickler syndrome presenting with acutely elevated IOP.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Stickler syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by orofacial, ocular, skeletal and auditory symptoms. The orofacial phenotype mainly consists of midfacial hypoplasia, micrognathia and cleft palate. Large phenotypic variability is evident though. Few studies have tried to substantiate the typical facial appearance in Stickler syndrome patients. METHODS: Molecularly confirmed Stickler patients were invited to undergo cephalometric analysis based on a lateral radiograph in standardized conditions. Angular and linear measurements were performed according to Steiner's and Sassouni's analysis and compared with age- and gender-matched reference values. RESULTS: Thirteen patients aged 10-62y were included, twelve of whom had type 1 Stickler syndrome (COL2A1 mutation) and one type 2 Stickler syndrome (COL11A1 mutation). The position of maxilla and mandible relative to the cranial base was not significantly different from the reference population (S-N-A: p = 0.73, S-N-B: p = 0.43). The mandibular plane and y-axis showed an elevated angle with the cranial base in most patients, although not significant for the total group (S-N to Go-Me: p = 0.20, S-N to S-Gn: p = 0.18). Dental analysis was normal, except for a higher overjet value (p = 0.006) and a higher angle between occlusal plane and Frankfort plane (p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Cephalometric analysis was not able to thoroughly prove the abnormal facial appearance in Stickler syndrome. The majority of patients had normal dentofacial proportions. The most frequently observed anomaly in our series is a rather short and posteriorly rotated mandible, but clinical variability is high.",

                    "abstract": "Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is an important craniofacial anomaly that can be seen as an isolated finding or manifestation of multiple syndromes. 22q11.2 deletion and Stickler syndrome are cited as the two most common conditions associated with PRS, but their frequencies are debated. We performed a retrospective study of 66 patients with PRS and reviewed their genetic testing, diagnoses, and clinical findings. The case series is complemented by a comprehensive literature review of the nature and frequency of genetic diagnosis in PRS. In our cohort 65% of patients had associated anomalies; of these, a genetic diagnosis was established in 56%. Stickler syndrome was the most common diagnosis, comprising approximately 11% of all cases, followed by Treacher Collins syndrome (9%). The frequency of 22q11.2 deletion was 1.5%. Chromosome arrays, performed for 72% of idiopathic PRS with associated anomalies, revealed two cases of 18q22 qter deletion, a region not previously reported in association with PRS. A review of the cytogenetic anomalies identified in this population supports an association between the 4q33-qter, 17q24.3, 2q33.1, and 11q23 chromosomal loci and PRS. We found a low frequency of 22q11.2 deletion in PRS, suggesting it is less commonly implicated in this malformation. Our data also indicate a higher frequency of cytogenetic anomalies in PRS patients with associated anomalies, and a potential new link with the 18q22 qter locus. The present findings underscore the utility of chromosomal microarrays in cases of PRS with associated anomalies and suggest that delaying testing for apparently isolated cases should be considered.",

METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study was performed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on 25 patients with Stickler syndrome and 53 nonsyndromic patients with clefts of the secondary palate repaired between 1977 and 2000. Airway problems were characterized by the incidence of Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) and the necessity for surgical airway management. Speech was analyzed using the Pittsburgh weighted values for speech symptoms associated with velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI). Longitudinal anthropometric measurements represented up to 12 years of longitudinal cephalofacial growth. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients with Stickler syndrome were diagnosed with PRS, 55.6% of whom required surgical airway management. Conversely, 20.8% of nonsyndromic patients were diagnosed with PRS (P < 0.0001), 18% of whom required surgical intervention (P < 0.05). Speech outcomes were poorer in patients with Stickler syndrome with 40% demonstrating borderline VPI and 13.3% demonstrating VPI, compared with 21.8% and 9.1%, respectively, in the nonsyndromic group. Both groups exhibited significantly shallower upper and mid facial depths and wider upper facial breadths when compared with normal standards of facial growth. Although there was a tendency toward decreased facial depths in patients with Stickler syndrome relative to nonsyndromic patients, the differences were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Stickler syndrome show significant potential for early airway compromise and a poorer prognosis for speech outcome after cleft palate repair.

The most important ocular findings were: high myopia (80%), lens subluxation (70%), exotropia (50%) and vitreoretinal abnormalities (80%) including vitreous cavity (50%). The clinical genetic examination disclosed that 30% of the patients had micrognathia, 50% hearing loss, 40% nasal depression and 60% high palate.

METHODS: X-rays for bone age, clinical and genetic evaluation were performed in all patients with ocular alterations. The Stickler syndrome diagnosis was established after correlating these examinations. RESULTS: Type II Stickler syndrome was found in 11 patients. The most important ocular findings were: high myopia (80%), lens subluxation (70%), exotropia (50%) and vitreoretinal abnormalities (80%) including vitreous cavity (50%). The clinical genetic examination disclosed that 30% of the patients had micrognathia, 50% hearing loss, 40% nasal depression and 60% high palate. Seven cases had articular hypermotility and long fingers and arthropathy was present in 3 cases.

DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals, including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing. Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography, and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants. RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately 28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding 95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive. It is less severe than that reported for types II and III Stickler syndrome linked to COL11A2 (OMIM 120290) and COL11A1 (OMIM 120280) mutations, respectively, or the closely related Marshall syndrome. This difference will be a useful discriminatory feature in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders.",

METHODS: We identified a family with 2 adults with polyarticular OA and a child with generalized arthralgia. General, musculoskeletal, ocular, and auditory evaluations were undertaken. Investigations included radiographs of symptomatic joints, analysis of serum inflammatory markers and joint fluid, and mutational analyses of the COL11A2 gene. RESULTS: The 3 affected individuals had normal stature, mild mid-face hypoplasia, and hearing impairment, but normal eyes. Radiographs of the affected adults showed severe polyarticular OA but did not reveal diagnostic evidence of an underlying skeletal dysplasia. However, the child's radiographs showed enlarged epiphyses with an advanced bone age. The combination of skeletal, facial, and auditory features together with the absence of ocular features indicated that they had otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia, also known as Stickler syndrome type III. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a mutation in the COL11A2 gene that encodes the pre-pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen that is involved in type II collagen fibrillogenesis. CONCLUSION: Early-onset polyarticular OA may occur in adults without a known or obvious underlying skeletal dysplasia. This study provides an approach to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia in such individuals.",

It has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is caused by mutations in COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2. We describe a family of Moroccan origin that consists of four children with Stickler syndrome, six unaffected children, and two unaffected parents who are distant relatives (fifth degree). All family members were clinically investigated for ear, nose, and throat; ophthalmologic; and radiological abnormalities. Four children showed symptoms characteristic of Stickler syndrome, including moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, moderate-to-high myopia with vitreoretinopathy, and epiphyseal dysplasia. We considered the COL9A1 gene, located on chromosome 6q13, to be a candidate gene on the basis of the structural association with collagen types II and XI and because of the high expression in the human inner ear indicated by cDNA microarray. Mutation analysis of the coding region of the COL9A1 gene showed a homozygous R295X mutation in the four affected children. The parents and four unaffected children were heterozygous carriers of the R295X mutation. Two unaffected children were homozygous for the wild-type allele. None of the family members except the homozygous R295X carriers had any signs of Stickler syndrome. Therefore, COL9A1 is the fourth identified gene that can cause Stickler syndrome. In contrast to the three previously reported Stickler syndrome-causing genes, this gene causes a form of Stickler syndrome with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This finding will have a major impact on the genetic counseling of patients with Stickler syndrome and on the understanding of the pathophysiology of collagens. Mutation analysis of this gene is recommended in patients with Stickler syndrome with possible autosomal recessive inheritance.",

Patients were divided into two categories: isolated PRS (group 1) and PRS plus, i.e. PRS as part of a more complex syndrome (group 2). A total of 74 patients with PRS were found, 29 (39%) males and 45 (61%) females of whom 47 (63.5%) could be categorised as isolated PRS and 27 (36.8%) as PRS plus. The most frequent diagnoses in patients with PRS plus were Stickler syndrome and the velocardiofacial syndrome. Ophthalmological and fluorescent in situ hybridisation of chromosome 22 investigations should therefore be performed in all patients, as soon as the diagnosis of PRS is established. Some form of airway treatment was necessary in the majority of patients (52 of 74), most could be treated conservatively with prone/lateral positioning and close observation. Endotracheal intubation was necessary in one child from group 1 versus five from group 2. Tracheostomy was performed in three children from group 1 and two from group 2. Feeding problems occurred in about 25% of all PRS patients and stunted growth was seen especially in boys with isolated PRS before the age of 10 months. CONCLUSION: In our series, 33% of patients with Pierre Robin sequence plus had Stickler and velocardiofacial syndromes. Conservative airway management was a sufficient treatment for respiratory problems in the majority of patients. Feeding and growth need special attention in patients with Pierre Robin sequence.",

Molecular analysis has proven effective in diagnosis, confirmation and classification of the disease. We aimed to describe the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in genetic analysis of four Indian families with suspected Stickler syndrome. Methods: The index cases presented with retinal detachment with family history. Genetic analysis in the index case was performed by next-generation sequencing of inherited retinal degeneration genes, and validated by Sanger sequencing followed by co-segregation analysis in the other family members. Results: Twenty patients were included for the genetic analysis (15 males and 5 females from four families). Clinical details were available for 15 patients (30 eyes). Fourteen eyes (11 patients) developed RRD. In the 16 eyes without RRD, 8 underwent barrage laser to lattice degeneration and 8 were under observation. Disease segregating heterozygous mutations with pathogenic/likely pathogenic effect was identified in COL2A1 (c.4318-1G>A, c.141G>A, c.1221+1G>A for 3 families) and COL11A1 (c.1737+1 G>A for 1 family) gene. In addition to the mutation in the COL2A1 gene, a pathogenic heterozygous variant associated with risk for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) was identified in one member. Conclusion: NGS testing confirmed the presence of the causative gene for Stickler syndrome in the index case followed by evaluation of family members and confirmation of genetic and ocular findings. We believe that this may be the first such report of families with RRD from India.",

These disorders range from simple refractive disorder to severe disease that can lead to disability. Hence the interest of early screening. This study aims to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary management and of the need for ophthalmological examination in each deaf child. We conducted a prospective monocentric data collection from medical records of 200 children followed for hypoacousia from January 2014 to January 2015. Each child underwent complete ophthalmological examination, ENT examination and clinical examination. Data from 155 medical records were collected. Ocular involvement was found in 47 patients, reflecting a rate of 30.4%. Bilateral involvement was found in 45 patients. The main syndromic causes were: Usher syndrome (8 casess), Waardenbourg syndrome (5 cases), Alport syndrome (3 cases), Wolfram syndrome (2 cases), Goldenhar syndrome (3 cases), Cogan syndrome (3 cases), Franceschetti-Kleinsyndrome (1 case), Charge syndrome(1 case), otomandibular syndrome (1 case), Stickler syndrome(1 case), Alstrom syndrome (1 case), Refsum disease (1 case), Susac syndrome (1 case) and KID Syndrome (1 case). Screening for ocular involvement allowed to shorten the average length of cochlear implantation from 9 months to 3 months. There are numerous ocular and auditory involvements because of the embryological and cellular similarities of these two organs, including the retina and the inner ear. The diagnosis of these involvements is facilitated by the presence of facial dysmorphism; on the other hand, diagnosis is difficult when there are visual and auditory sensorineural involvements. Early diagnosis of ocular and auditory involvements allows for best psychomotor development and optimal social inclusion. Therefore multidisciplinary management is necessary to allow for the best psychomotor, orthophonic and visual rehabilitation.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare surgical outcomes for syndromes with optically empty vitreous (SOEV) associated rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional, two-arm study of a single pediatric vitreoretinal surgeon's patients from a quaternary referral center with syndromes with optically empty vitreous was performed to examine visual and anatomic outcomes of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and laser prophylaxis. SUBJECTS: Patients identified either through slit lamp examination (presence of an optically empty or void space in the vitreous gel structure) or genetic testing. 56 eyes of 49 patients were identified in the retinal detachment arm. 60 eyes of 48 patients were identified in the laser prophylaxis arm. METHODS: Comparison of initial retinal detachment (RD) surgical repair via PPV, SB, or PPV-SB with final anatomic success, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and number of surgical procedures. Secondary analysis was performed looking at eyes failing their initial SB, eyes with a GRT at presentation, eyes failing RD repair within specific time intervals, and eyes where hyaloid was elevated during initial vitrectomy. An additional study arm examined the outcomes of final BCVA and the presence and timing of developing a retinal tear or RD in eyes who received laser prophylaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, Surgical repair techniques (PPV, SB, PPV-SB), Number of Surgeries, Anatomical retinal reattachment success. RESULTS: Initial scleral buckle (SB) had statistically significant better final BCVA (p<0.01) and better final anatomic success (p<0.01). No statistical difference in the number of surgeries needed to achieve anatomic success between the initial SB versus initial PPV-SB/PPV. Hyaloidal elevation during the initial vitrectomy was associated with improved final BCVA and higher final anatomic success without the use of silicone oil (p <0.01 and 0.04 respectively). Lastly, eyes who developed RDs after laser prophylaxis had better final BCVA compared to untreated eyes (p 0.05). CONCLUSION: Initial SB yields better overall outcomes in SOEV presenting with RRD. Stickler Type-1 patients had similar outcomes compared to other SOEV, suggesting both populations should be treated with similar approaches.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe presenting clinical features and surgical techniques that are associated with successful surgical repair of pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twelve eyes of 191 patients 0 to 18 years of age undergoing surgical repair for RRD between 2001 and 2015 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months. METHODS: Patients were divided into 3 age groups (0-6 years, 7-12 years, and 13-18 years) and comparisons were made using bivariate and multivariate generalized estimating equation models. A mixed means model was used to examine visual acuity in each age group over time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete reattachment of the retina at final follow-up. RESULTS: Of 212 eyes, 166 (78%) achieved total reattachment at final follow-up. Mean follow-up was 36.3 months. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with Stickler syndrome was more likely to occur in the younger cohorts (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.91), whereas RRD associated with blunt trauma was more likely to occur in the oldest cohort (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4). Subtotal RRD was more likely to be repaired successfully than total RRD (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4; P = 0.0100), and eyes with previous vitreoretinal surgery were less likely to undergo successful repair (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.78; P = 0.0258). There was no significant difference between age groups in the rate of surgical success (P = 0.55). There was a significantly higher success rate with primary scleral buckle (SB; 63%; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) and combined SB plus pars plana vitrectomy (PPV; 68%; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1) compared with PPV alone (51%). CONCLUSIONS: Most pediatric patients with RRD achieved complete reattachment with surgery. Success was more common in patients with a subtotal RRD at presentation. Previous vitreoretinal surgery was a risk factor for failure. Younger patients were more likely to demonstrate RRD involving the macula, but there was no difference between age groups in successful reattachment at final follow-up. Primary PPV showed a lower rate of success than SB or combined SB plus PPV.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report the clinical (anatomic and functional) and genetic findings of Wagner Syndrome (WS) in a Portuguese family. METHODS: Nine members of the family agreed to be examined. All had complete clinical eye examinations. The proband and selected patients underwent color fundus photography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), automatic static white-on-white computerized perimetry, and electrophysiology assessment (flash ERG, multifocal(mf) ERG and dark adaptometry). A pedigree was constructed based on interviews with known affected subjects. Genomic DNA samples derived from venous blood were collected from all affected family members examined. RESULTS: Twenty-eight family members are affected. This family has the typical features of Wagner Syndrome, namely an empty vitreous cavity with veils, mild myopia and cataract. Four examined patients underwent vitreoretinal surgery due to abnormal peripheral vitreoretinal adhesions with peripheral retinal traction (n = 3). Retinal detachment was observed in 5 of the examined subjects. Four of them occurred between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Chorioretinal atrophy is also a frequent finding which results in moderate to severe visual field and advanced rod-cone dystrophy from younger ages, also confirmed by absence of scotopic function on dark adaptation. The macular dysfunction on mfERG was profound and of early onset. A heterozygous mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (c.4004-1G > A) was found. CONCLUSIONS: We described a rare autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy with near complete penetrance in a Portuguese family. Abnormal peripheral vitreoretinal adhesions, retinal detachment and chorioretinal atrophy are present in most of the examined individuals at young ages. Early onset of advanced visual field and electrophysiologic abnormalities were observed in this family. We also added relevant information to the literature by reporting our experience in surgical management of Wagner Syndrome patients with, and at risk of, retinal detachment.",

Why were the probands initially considered to have eoHM but not Stickler syndrome (STL)? Methods: Probands and family members with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 were followed up and reexamined based on the criteria for STL. Further comprehensive examinations were conducted for patients with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. We performed comparisons between probands, affected family members with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. Results: Twelve probands (8.91+-4.03 years) and 14 affected family members (37.00+-11.18 years) with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, as well as 30 controls with eoHM but without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, were recruited. Among them, 25.0% of probands and 50.0% of affected family members met the diagnostic criteria for STL after reexamination. Posterior vitreous detachment/foveal hypoplasia (PVD/FH), hypermobility of the elbow joint (HJ), and vitreous opacity were more frequent in patients with eoHM with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 than in the controls (p = 1.40 x 10-5, 3.72 x 10-4, 2.30x 10-3, respectively). HJ was more common in the probands than in the affected family members (11/12 versus 3/14; p = 3.42 x 10-4), suggesting age-dependent manifestation. EoHM presented in all the probands and in 11/14 affected family members, suggesting that it is a more common indicator of STL than the previously described vitreoretinal abnormalities, especially in children. The rate of STL diagnosis could increase from 25.0% to 66.7% for probands and from 50.0% to 92.9% for affected family members if eoHM, PVD/FH, and HJ are added to the diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: In summary, it is not easy to differentiate STL from eoHM with routine ocular examination in outpatient clinics. Awareness of atypical phenotypes and newly recognized signs may be of help in identifying atypical STL, especially in children at eye clinics.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Computed tomographic (CT) scans are often obtained before mandibular distraction osteogenesis in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Stickler Syndrome (SS) is an inherited collagenopathy characterized by heterogenous orofacial, ocular, auditory, and skeletal abnormalities. The orofacial manifestations are variable and some patients present with cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The incidence of VPI in SS is poorly studied and no studies have compared the incidence of VPI between Type I (COL2A1) and Type II (COL11A1) SS. The objective of this study is to compare the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes and discuss the surgical techniques used to treat them. DESIGN: Single-institution, retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three children were diagnosed with SS between January 2003 and December 2018. Genetic testing results, genetics notes, craniofacial clinic notes, and operative reports were reviewed. Patients without genetic testing or craniofacial/otolaryngologic evaluation were excluded. Thirty-one patients met criteria and were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was VPI incidence. RESULTS: There were 18 patients with Type I SS and 13 with Type II SS. Five (16%) patients had VPI, 2 (11%) with Type I SS compared to 3 (23%) with Type II SS (P > .05). All patients with VPI underwent surgery with either sphincter pharyngoplasty (3) or pharyngeal flap (2). Two patients with Type II SS underwent revision sphincter pharyngoplasty, with one conversion to pharyngeal flap. CONCLUSION: VPI is common for patients with SS. In this study, there was no significant difference in the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which could be important for patient counseling and treatment planning.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The aim of this study was to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2. RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5 years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation. At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del; p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.",

                    "abstract": "Hearing loss in Stickler syndrome has received little attention due to the often more disabling ocular, orofacial and skeletal manifestations. Estimates suggest a global prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) ranging from 50 % to about 100 % though, depending on the underlying Stickler genotype. By performing extensive audiometric analysis in Stickler patients, we aimed to further elucidate the auditory phenotype. Twenty molecularly confirmed Stickler patients (age 10-62 year), of whom sixteen with type 1 Stickler syndrome (COL2A1 mutation) and four with type 2 Stickler syndrome (COL11A1 mutation) underwent an otological questionnaire, clinical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry and otoacoustic emission testing. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis of the audiograms was performed to assess progression. In type 1 Stickler syndrome, 75 % demonstrated hearing loss, predominantly in the high frequencies. No significant progression beyond presbyacusis was observed. All type 2 Stickler patients exhibited mild-to-moderate low- and mid-frequency SNHL and moderate-to-severe high-frequency SNHL. In both types, hearing loss was observed in childhood. Otoacoustic emissions were only detectable in 7/40 ears and had very low amplitudes, even in frequency bands with normal hearing on pure tone audiometry. Type 1 Stickler syndrome is characterized by a mild high-frequency SNHL, emerging in childhood and non-progressive. Absent otoacoustic emissions are a frequent finding. Patients with type 2 Stickler syndrome exhibit early-onset moderate SNHL affecting all frequencies with a sloping audiogram. Taking into account the visual impairment in many patients, we recommend regular auditory follow-up in patients with Stickler syndrome, especially in childhood. ",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a hereditary oculo-systemic disorder where patients are predisposed to retinal detachments which are often complex and challenging to manage. Significant progress has been made regarding the molecular genetics of the condition; however, there is little recent literature on surgery for retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome. Our aim is to describe a population of Stickler patients presenting to Moorfields Eye Hospital with detachment from 1986 to 2003. We looked at patient characteristics, characteristics of detachment, management and anatomical and functional outcomes. We also aim to compare this group from 1986 to 2003 with a past group of Stickler patients treated at Moorfields between 1965 and 1985, reported by (Billington et al. in Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 104:875-879, 1985). This comparison of 20-year matched cohorts examined patient characteristics, features of detachment, management and anatomical outcome in the two groups using the same definitions as the earlier authors. RESULTS: In the Stickler group from 1986 to 2003, complete re-attachment rate was 67% for primary scleral-buckle surgery, 84.2% for primary vitrectomy and 78.57% for all surgery in 30 eyes of 23 patients. Overall in this group there was an average increase in Logmar visual acuity of 0.33 and 0.32 in patients undergoing primary cryo-buckle and primary vitrectomy surgery respectively. When comparing the two groups using Fisher's exact test, we found that the group from 1986 to 2003 had significant improvement in re-attachment for detachments with multiple tears and for vitrectomy surgery, compared with the group from 1965 to 1985. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that despite complicated surgery and often multiple procedures, good anatomical outcomes were achieved as well as useful functional visual results after retinal detachment surgery in Stickler patients. It would also appear that when comparing the group of Stickler patients from 1986 to 2003 with the group from 1965 to 1985 improvements were seen in outcome from vitrectomy surgery and surgery for multiple breaks probably due to advances in technique and technology in vitreoretinal surgery, over the past 4 decades.",

It is one of the more complex surgical scenarios that a retina surgeon can face. There is no consensus on the ideal surgical technique; however, the \"traditional\" approach has been to perform a combined procedure including lensectomy, scleral buckle and vitrectomy. OBJECTIVE: To report the outcome over 2 years of five patients with giant retinal tears managed with lens sparing, bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with giant retinal tears managed with lens sparing, bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle. Included in the analysis were age, lens status, etiology and size of the tear, pre- and postoperative visual acuity, anatomic success, tamponade used, laser or criopexy where recorded. RESULTS: Three patients had high myopia, one secondary to blunt trauma and one with Wagner-Stickler syndrome were included in the analysis. The size of the tear varied from 120-280 . Anatomic success was achieved in all patients. One patient developed proliferative vitreoretinopathy and was re-operated and the retina remained attached. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of selected patients, lens-sparing bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle seems a safe and effective option in the management of retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tears. Further prospective and comparative studies are warranted to establish the role of this technique in the treatment of patients with this complex pathology.",

METHODS: Retrospective review of 52 Stickler syndrome patients who received a 6-mm wide, 360  encircling scleral buckling. Thirty-nine (75%; Cryo + Group) also received cryo treatment, whereas the reminder 13/52 (25% Cryo - Group) did not. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 15.6 +- 2.41 years. Five patients (5/52; 9.6%) developed a retinal detachment 2.6 +- 0.55 years after prophylactic treatment, respectively, 0/39 patients in the Cryo + Group and 5/13 in the Cryo - Group (P < 0.001). All five RD eyes were successfully reattached through revised episcleral surgery and adjunctive cryo treatment. Postop refraction changed an average -1.9 +- 0.74 diopters and best corrected visual acuity at the end of follow-up was 20/25 (0.1 +- 0.07 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), not significantly different from the rest of sample population who did not develop RD in their fellow eye. CONCLUSION: Cryopexy significantly reduced the risk of RD in Stickler syndrome patients undergoing scleral buckling. If RD ensues, the presence of scleral buckling may ease surgical repair and improve final outcome.",

STL is the most common hereditary cause of retinal complications, retinal tears, and the development of retinal detachment (RD) in childhood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term anatomical and functional results of surgical treatment of retinal complications in children and adolescents affected by STL. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study was performed a cohort of children with STL who underwent retinal surgery between 2004 and 2021. RESULTS: The study group consisted of nine children; the mean age at the time of the retinal tear with/without retinal detachment was 7.2 (2-10) years, and the mean follow-up period was 9.6 (5-16) years. Pathogenic variants COL2A1 (5 children) and COL11A1 (3 children) were confirmed in our cohort. In total, we operated on 13 eyes, 11 eyes with complicated RD and two eyes with multiple retinal defects, but without RD. At the end of the follow-up period, an attached retina was achieved 77% (10 eyes) with or without silicone oil tamponade: cryopexy alone was successful in one eye (10%), scleral buckling (EB) in five eyes (50%), and vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade combined with EB in four eyes (40%). The mean number of surgeries was 2.3 per eye. The resulting best corrected visual acuity ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 in one eye, from 0.16 to 0.4 in two eyes, and from 0.5 to 1.0 in 7 eyes. CONCLUSION: Repair of retinal tears with/without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome often requires multiple surgeries with combinations of cryopexy, scleral buckling, and/or vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade. Treatment of the ocular complications arising from STL requires long-term comprehensive care.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome, also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, is an inherited progressive disorder of the collagen connective tissues. Manifestations include short-sightedness, cataracts, retinal problems leading to retinal detachment and possible blindness. This is principally the case among individuals with type 1 Stickler Syndrome. It is the most commonly identified inherited cause of retinal detachment in childhood. However, there is no consensus regarding best practice and no current guidelines on prophylactic interventions for this population. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of primary prophylactic interventions for the prevention of retinal detachment in previously untreated eyes without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome. The primary outcome of interest was retinal detachment post prophylaxis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was made of 11 databases of published and unpublished literature, which included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library. There was no restriction by language or date. The references of all included studies were checked for further relevant citations and authors of studies with potentially relevant data were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers double-screened all titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the search to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Both reviewers also independently extracted and quality assessed all included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1444 unique citations, of which four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The two principal studies were both retrospective cohort studies with control groups in populations with type 1 Stickler syndrome. One study evaluated 360  cryotherapy (n = 204) and the other focal or circumferential laser treatment (n = 22). Both studies reported a statistically significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment per eye between the groups receiving prophylaxis and the controls. However, both studies were subject to a high risk of bias. The results of the two supporting studies of Wagner-Stickler patients were either relatively inconsistent or unreliable. No study reported any major or long-term complications associated with the interventions. Despite the weaknesses of the evidence, the rate of retinal detachment in the intervention groups, especially the cryotherapy group, was lower than the rate either experienced in the study control groups or reported in other studies of untreated Stickler syndrome populations not exposed to prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Only 360  cryotherapy and focal and circumferential laser treatment have been evaluated for the type 1 Stickler syndrome population, and then only by a single retrospective, controlled, cohort study in each case. Both of these studies report a significant difference between intervention and control groups (principally no treatment) and no major or long-term side effects or complications. However, there is a high risk of bias within these two studies, so the relative effectiveness of either intervention is uncertain. FUTURE WORK: A service priority is to determine reliably the prevalence of Stickler syndrome, i.e. how many individuals have type 1 or type 2 Stickler syndrome, and their risk of retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. A non-randomised, prospective cohort comparison study, in which eligible participants are treated, followed-up and analysed in one of three study arms, for no treatment, laser therapy or cryotherapy, would potentially offer further certainty in terms of the relative efficacy of both prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis and cryotherapy versus laser therapy than is possible with the currently available data. Alternatively, continued follow-up and analysis of existing study data, and data collection from relevant sample populations, are required to assess the long-term risks of blindness, retinal detachment and prophylaxis.

METHODS: Case report with fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population.",

This retrospective consecutive case series included 149 patients with inherited eye diseases, seen by a single pediatric ophthalmologist, who underwent genetic testing between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018. Variants were detected using a target enrichment panel of 429 genes and known deep intronic variants associated with inherited eye disease. Among 149 patients, 38 (25.5%) had a family history, and this cohort includes heterogeneous phenotype including anterior segment dysgenesis, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus syndrome, optic atrophy, and retinal dystrophy. Overall, 90 patients (60.4%) received a definite molecular diagnosis. Overall, NGS-guided precision care was provided to 8 patients (5.4%). The precision care included cryotherapy to prevent retinal detachment in COL2A1 Stickler syndrome, osteoporosis management in patients with LRP5-associated familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and avoidance of unnecessary phlebotomy in hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. A revision of the initial clinical diagnosis was made in 22 patients (14.8%). Unexpected multi-gene deletions and dual diagnosis were noted in 4 patients (2.7%). We found that precision medical or surgical managements were provided for 8 of 149 patients (5.4%), and multiple locus variants were found in 2.7% of cases. These findings are important because individualized management of inherited eye diseases can be achieved through genetic testing.",

This is a descriptive case report of a 9-year-old child with ocular history of high myopia who presented to our institution with suboptimal visual acuity in both eyes. After 2 years of follow up, he developed unilateral progressive visual loss with marked atrophy of the outer retinal layers and peripheral vascular leakage.

                    "abstract": "Establishing a simple and effective mutation screening method is one of the most compelling problems with applying genetic diagnosis to clinical use. Because there is no reliable and inexpensive screening system, amplifying by PCR and performing direct sequencing of every coding exon is the gold standard strategy even today. However, this approach is expensive and time consuming, especially when gene size or sample number is large. Previously, we developed CEL nuclease mediated heteroduplex incision with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (CHIPS) as an ideal simple mutation screening system constructed with only conventional apparatuses and commercially available reagents. In this study, we evaluated the utility of CHIPS technology for genetic diagnosis in clinical practice by applying this system to screening for the COL2A1, WRN and RPS6KA3 mutations in newly diagnosed patients with Stickler syndrome (autosomal dominant inheritance), Werner syndrome (autosomal recessive inheritance) and Coffin-Lowry syndrome (X-linked inheritance), respectively. In all three genes, CHIPS detected all DNA variations including disease causative mutations within a day. Direct sequencing of all coding exons of these genes confirmed 100% sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate high sensitivity, high cost performance and reliability of this simple system, with compatibility to all inheritance modes. Because of its low technology, CHIPS is ready to use and potentially disseminate to any laboratories in the world.",

A group of hereditary disorders is associated with characteristic systemic abnormalities. Allied conditions should be considered in the clinical diagnosis. Vitreoretinopathies are the most common cause of inherited retinal detachment. In most eyes primary vitrectomy is necessary, and disease-specific surgical treatment is discussed. ",

DESIGN:   Prospective review of two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment. PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty-two family members from two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment were examined. METHODS:   A full ophthalmic history and examination were performed, and DNA was analysed by linkage analysis and mutation screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Characterization of a causative hereditary gene mutation in each family. RESULTS:   All affected family members of one pedigree carried a C192A COL2A1 exon 2 mutation. None of the affected family members had early-onset arthritis, hearing abnormalities, abnormal clefting or facial features characteristic of classical Stickler syndrome. All affected members of the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy pedigree carried a 957delG FZD4 mutation. CONCLUSIONS:   Patients with retinal detachment and a positive family history should be investigated for heritable conditions associated with retinal detachment such as Stickler syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The absence of non-ocular features of Stickler syndrome should raise the possibility of mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1. Similarly, late-onset familial exudative vitreoretinopathy may appear more like a rhegmatogenous detachment and not be correctly diagnosed. When a causative gene mutation is identified, cascade genetic screening of the family will facilitate genetic counselling and screening of high-risk relatives, allowing targeted management of the pre-detachment changes in affected patients.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate COL9A1 in two families suggestive of autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome and to delineate the associated phenotype. METHODS: The probands of two consanguineous autosomal recessive Stickler families were evaluated for homozygosity using SNP microarray in one and haplotype analysis in the other. Subsequently, the entire COL9A1 open reading frame was analyzed by DNA sequencing in all members of the respective families. Several family members were investigated for dysmorphic features as well as ophthalmic, audiologic, and radiologic abnormalities. RESULTS: A novel homozygous COL9A1 mutation (p.R507X) was identified in two affected Turkish sisters, and the previously published mutation (p.R295X) was found in a Moroccan boy. Ophthalmic assessment revealed myopia, cataracts, distinct vitreous changes, progressive chorioretinal degeneration, and exudative and rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. All three had sensorineural hearing loss and epiphyseal dysplasia. Intervertebral disc bulging was observed in one patient and in two heterozygous carriers of the p.R507X mutation. CONCLUSIONS: A second, novel mutation was identified in COL9A1, causing autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome together with the previously described nucleotide change in two separate families. Although the overall phenotype was comparable to autosomal dominant Stickler, vitreous changes that may enable recognition of patients who are likely to carry mutations in COL9A1 were identified, and exudative retinal detachment was observed as a new finding in Stickler syndrome.",

PLOD3 mRNA expression in the developing embryo was analysed for tissue-specific localisation. Mouse microarray expression data were assessed for phylogenetic gene expression similarities across CTDs with overlapping clinical features. RESULTS: Key clinical features included ocular abnormalities with risk for retinal detachment, sensorineural hearing loss, reduced palmar creases, finger contractures, prominent knees, scoliosis, low bone mineral density, recognisable craniofacial dysmorphisms, developmental delay and risk for vascular dissection. Collated clinical features showed most overlap with Stickler syndrome with variable features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and epidermolysis bullosa (EB).

OBJECTIVES: To describe thoracolumbar spinal abnormalities and their correlation with age and back pain among patients with Stickler syndrome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Stickler syndrome (hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathy) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by skeletal, ocular, oral-facial, cardiac, and auditory manifestations. Prevalence is approximately 1 in 10,000 (similar to that of Marfan syndrome). No one has investigated spinal abnormalities in a large series of patients. METHODS: A single-center evaluation of 53 patients from 24 families with Stickler syndrome (age range, 1-70 years) in a multidisciplinary genetics clinic. Thoracolumbar radiographs were analyzed for spinal abnormalities and correlation with age and back pain. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of patients had scoliosis, 74% endplate abnormalities, 64% Schmorl's nodes, 43% platyspondylia, and 43% Scheuermann-like kyphosis. Sixty-seven percent of patients and 85% of adults reported chronic back pain. Endplate abnormalities and Schmorl's nodes were associated with adult age; endplate abnormalities, Schmorl's nodes, and adult age were associated with back pain. Only one adult patient was free of spinal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal abnormalities are nearly uniformly observed in Stickler syndrome, progress with age, and are associated with back pain. Although common, scoliosis is generally self-limited (only one patient needed surgical treatment). Correct diagnosis of this syndrome facilitates early identification and management of other potentially severe systemic manifestations and genetic counseling for affected families. Moreover, recognition of Stickler syndrome allows accurate prognosis for skeletal abnormalities and anticipation of potential surgical complications.",

METHODS: Histological and electron microscopic examinations were performed on the enucleated globe from the proband of a pedigree with type 1 Stickler syndrome. Linkage analysis was carried out using polymorphic markers flanking the COL2A1 gene and the mutation was identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The significant retinal abnormality was incarceration of vitreous collagen within glial strands on the inner surface of an atrophic and gliotic detached retina. The incarcerated collagenous layers contained glial cells and extended from the retina to form strands, some of which contributed to a retrolental membrane. Mutation screening detected a C to T mutation in exon 47 that inserted a premature termination codon into the reading frame of the mRNA. Sequence analysis of three of the four affected children confirmed that they were also heterozygous for the base change. The youngest child's DNA was not analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The study represents the first evidence of abnormal interactions between pathological vitreous collagen and the inner retina in a patient with type 1 Stickler syndrome with a confirmed mutation in the COL2A1 gene.",

METHODS: A clinical study including electroretinographic investigations followed by laboratory-based genetic and molecular analysis. Four affected and 3 unaffected members of the family were examined. Ten candidate regions were tested by linkage analysis with highly polymorphic molecular markers or with intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphisms. RESULTS: Of 8 siblings,4 were affected, showing high myopia with pronounced vitreous liquefaction, retinitis pigmentosa-like retinal degeneration, diffuse retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, macular staphylomata, and premature cataract formation. Strikingly abnormal results on electroretinograms, affecting both the rod and the cone systems, revealed an extensive defect of retinal function, unlike those usually found in pathologic myopia. No extraocular manifestations were observed. Three types of nonsyndromic high myopia, Stickler syndrome I, II, and III, Wagner syndrome, Knobloch syndrome, Goldmann-Favre dystrophy, and multiple vitreoretinopathies were excluded by linkage analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The reported phenotype as well as the results of molecular linkage analysis in the siblings described here suggest an autosomal recessively inherited vitreoretinal dystrophy, which, to our knowledge, has not been described until now.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.",

DESIGN: Retrospective case series study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 eyes of 25 patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome were studied. METHODS: All of the patients had mutations in the COL2A1 gene and were diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Cross-sectional OCT images, OCT angiography (OCTA), and en face OCT images were assessed. The ratio of the foveal inner retinal layer (fIRL) thickness to the parafoveal inner retinal layer (pIRL) thickness, the ratio of the foveal outer retinal layer (fORL) thickness to the parafoveal outer retinal layer (pORL) thickness, and the size of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) were determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The degree of foveal hypoplasia and the best-corrected visual acuity in patients with Stickler syndrome. RESULTS: A persistence of the inner retinal layers in the fovea with an fIRL/pIRL ratio >0.2 was present in 32 of the 39 eyes (82%). Optical coherence tomography angiography showed that the FAZ was smaller, 0 to 0.19 mm2, than that of normal eyes, in 25 eyes of 17 patients who underwent OCTA. There was no significant correlation between the visual acuities and the fIRL/pIRL ratios. CONCLUSIONS: A mild foveal hypoplasia with a persistence of the IRL is characteristic of eyes with Stickler syndrome. The visual acuities were not correlated with the fIRL/pIRL ratios.",

He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge. His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did a reattachment of the retina in the right eye.

METHODS: A total of 14 patients, diagnosed by clinical criteria, were included. The following variables were evaluated: age, gender, ocular background, follow-up, initial and final visual acuity (VA), optical prescription, prophylactic treatment, surgery and techniques performed. The risk age to suffer a RD, as well as cataracts, was determined by using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 5 men and 9 women, the median initial VA was 0.35, which was the same as the final VA. The median optical prescription was -9.5 D myopia. The median of follow-up was 7 years. Ocular background was 4 RD cases and 2 Lasik surgeries. The operations performed were 8 RD, 12 cataract, 2 glaucoma, 2 macular hole, and one endotropia. The median age of RD was 20 years and cataract 34 years. As regards surgical tecnique, 4 scleral buckle cases, and 4 scleral buckle+pars plana vitrectomy cases were formed. The prophylactic treatments performed were: one scleral buckle case, 4 endolaser photocoagulation, and one cryotherapy. Two of which presented with RD. CONCLUSION: In the series presented, retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome mainly occurs in the second decade of life, with cataracts mainly developing in the fourth decade.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively if scleral buckling combined or not to cryopexy reduces fellow-eye retinal detachment (RD) in Stickler syndrome patients who lost their first eye due to RD. METHODS: Retrospective review of 52 Stickler syndrome patients who received a 6-mm wide, 360  encircling scleral buckling. Thirty-nine (75%; Cryo + Group) also received cryo treatment, whereas the reminder 13/52 (25% Cryo - Group) did not. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 15.6 +- 2.41 years. Five patients (5/52; 9.6%) developed a retinal detachment 2.6 +- 0.55 years after prophylactic treatment, respectively, 0/39 patients in the Cryo + Group and 5/13 in the Cryo - Group (P < 0.001). All five RD eyes were successfully reattached through revised episcleral surgery and adjunctive cryo treatment. Postop refraction changed an average -1.9 +- 0.74 diopters and best corrected visual acuity at the end of follow-up was 20/25 (0.1 +- 0.07 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), not significantly different from the rest of sample population who did not develop RD in their fellow eye. CONCLUSION: Cryopexy significantly reduced the risk of RD in Stickler syndrome patients undergoing scleral buckling. If RD ensues, the presence of scleral buckling may ease surgical repair and improve final outcome.",

METHODS: Twenty-two eyes of 14 Japanese patients from nine families with Stickler syndrome were studied. All of the patients were found to have mutations in the COL2A1 gene and had undergone ERG recordings. The ERGs from one of the two eyes were compared to 11 eyes of 11 normal control subjects who were matched by age, sex, and refractive error. RESULTS: One patient had non-recordable ERGs under both scotopic and photopic conditions. For the remaining 13 patients, the amplitudes of the b-waves of the scotopic combined, rod, and cone responses were significantly smaller than those of the control subjects (P = 0.0001, P = 0.015, P = 0.0006, respectively). The implicit times of the b-wave of the scotopic combined and photopic responses were significantly prolonged (P = 0.0037 and P = 0.0126). The age was inversely and significantly correlated with the amplitudes of the scotopic combined a-wave (P = 0.0184) and b-wave (P = 0.0076) in 13 eyes. The amplitudes of the scotopic combined b-wave amplitudes were not significantly correlated with the refractive error. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced or absent full-field ERGs in eyes with Stickler syndrome indicate that the physiology of the entire retina was negatively altered. The greater reduction in the ERGs with increasing age suggests that the physiological alterations of the retina are progressive.",

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical records of 10 eyes of six patients from two families with the Stickler syndrome. The members of both families were heterozygous for the p.R565C mutation. The clinical features including the visual acuity, fundus appearances, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images, and electroretinograms were examined. RESULTS: Myopia of -12 diopters (D) to -24 D with an average of -16.8 D was observed in 9 eyes of the 5 patients. The FAF images showed different degrees of hyper and hypoautofluorescent patterns in the macula in all but the two youngest patients (7 of 9 eyes, 78%). The OCT images showed the absence of a foveal pit and destruction of the outer retinal layers in the macular area in all patients. The ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the macular region was disrupted in eight eyes (80%) of which seven were fovea sparing. CONCLUSION: Two families with Stickler syndrome with the p.R565C mutation showed more severe foveal hypoplasia, macular degeneration, and extensive retinal degeneration. A correlation of the OCT and FAF images with the genotype is helpful in determining the prognosis of Stickler syndrome.",

METHODS: A retrospective review of all cases of children < or =10 years of age with high myopia (>6.00 diopters) who were evaluated for presumed risk of retinal detachment by either an examination under anesthesia or office examination by a single retina specialist from January 2001 through December 2008. Patients with regressed retinopathy of prematurity, retinal detachment in the fellow eye, or known Stickler syndrome were excluded. RESULTS: Fifty-four eyes of 30 patients with high myopia were examined. Twenty-six eyes of 14 patients were examined under anesthesia because of the examiner's inability to adequately visualize the peripheral retina during an office examination. Mean age at examination was 6 +/- 3 (range, 1-10) years. Mean spherical equivalent refractive error was -13.88 +/- 3.79 (range, -6.00 to -25.00) diopters. Peripheral retinal findings were identified in 33% of eyes, the most common being lattice degeneration (20%), white without pressure (11%), and retinal holes with subretinal fluid (4%). CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of highly myopic children in our study showed peripheral retinal findings. If the peripheral retina is not adequately visualized during an office evaluation, examination under anesthesia should be considered.",

Subsequent investigation identified low molecular weight proteinuria as part of their syndrome. Exome sequencing of one of the probands revealed a new non-synonymous variant in the LRP2 gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation and segregation in the family. No mutation was identified in COL9A1/2, COL11A1/2, or COL2A1 genes. The variant (c.11483A>G; p.Asp3828Gly) is predicted to be damaging and is conserved among vertebrate species. Mutations in LRP2 have been shown to cause the Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) or facio-oculo-acoustico-renal (FOAR) syndrome, a syndrome associated with facial dysmorphism, ocular anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss, low molecular weight proteinuria, and diaphragmatic hernia and absent corpus callosum, although there is variability in the expression of some features. This family shows a milder phenotype with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome and only a few features of the DBS, including microglobulinuria. The presence of microglobulinuria was only detected after molecular results were known. In conclusion, with the identification of a new mutation in LRP2 associated with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome, we have broadened the phenotypic spectrum of LRP2 mutations.

                    "abstract": "Two siblings, from a consanguineous Iraqi family, were investigated to identify the underlying genetic cause of their high myopia, esotropia, vitreous changes and cataract. Subsequent investigation identified low molecular weight proteinuria as part of their syndrome. Exome sequencing of one of the probands revealed a new non-synonymous variant in the LRP2 gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation and segregation in the family. No mutation was identified in COL9A1/2, COL11A1/2, or COL2A1 genes. The variant (c.11483A>G; p.Asp3828Gly) is predicted to be damaging and is conserved among vertebrate species. Mutations in LRP2 have been shown to cause the Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) or facio-oculo-acoustico-renal (FOAR) syndrome, a syndrome associated with facial dysmorphism, ocular anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss, low molecular weight proteinuria, and diaphragmatic hernia and absent corpus callosum, although there is variability in the expression of some features. This family shows a milder phenotype with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome and only a few features of the DBS, including microglobulinuria. The presence of microglobulinuria was only detected after molecular results were known. In conclusion, with the identification of a new mutation in LRP2 associated with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome, we have broadened the phenotypic spectrum of LRP2 mutations.

To date three genes, COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2, encoding the heterotypic type II/XI collagen fibrils present in vitreous and cartilage have been shown to have mutations that result in Stickler syndrome. As systemic features in this disorder are variable we have used an ophthalmic examination to differentiate those patients with a membranous vitreous phenotype associated with mutations in COL2A1, from other patients who may have mutations in other genes. Gene amplification and exon sequencing was used to screen 50 families or sporadic cases with this membranous phenotype, for mutations in COL2A1. Mutations were detected in 47 (94%) cases consisting of 166 affected and 78 unaffected individuals. We also demonstrate that the predominantly ocular form of type 1 Stickler syndrome is not confined to mutations in the alternatively spliced exon 2. Using splicing reporter constructs we demonstrate that a mutant GC donor splice site in intron 51 can be spliced normally; this contributed to the predominantly ocular phenotype in the family in which it occurred.",

                    "abstract": "Stickler syndrome (SS) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder affecting bones, eyes, and hearing. Type 2 SS and the SS variant otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) are caused by deleterious variants in COL11A1 and COL11A2, respectively. In both genes, available database information indicates a high rate of potentially deleterious intronic variants, but published evidence of their biological effect is usually insufficient for a definite clinical interpretation. We report four previously unpublished intronic variants in COL11A1 (c.2241 + 5G>T, c.2809 - 2A>G, c.3168 + 5G>C) and COL11A2 (c.4392 + 1G>A) identified in type 2 SS/OSMED individuals. The pathogenic effect of these variants was first predicted in silico and then investigated by an exon-trapping assay. We demonstrated that all variants can induce exon in-frame deletions, which lead to the synthesis of shorter collagen XI alpha1 or 2 chains. Lacking residues are located in the alpha-triple helical region, which has a crucial role in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis. In conclusion, this study suggests that these alternative COL11A1 and COL11A2 transcripts might result in aberrant triple helix collagen. Our approach may help to improve the diagnostic molecular pathway of COL11-related disorders.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.",

METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1.

After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months.

                    "title": "The clinical effectiveness and safety of prophylactic retinal interventions to reduce the risk of retinal detachment and subsequent vision loss in adults and children with Stickler syndrome: a systematic review.",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome, also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, is an inherited progressive disorder of the collagen connective tissues. Manifestations include short-sightedness, cataracts, retinal problems leading to retinal detachment and possible blindness. This is principally the case among individuals with type 1 Stickler Syndrome. It is the most commonly identified inherited cause of retinal detachment in childhood. However, there is no consensus regarding best practice and no current guidelines on prophylactic interventions for this population. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of primary prophylactic interventions for the prevention of retinal detachment in previously untreated eyes without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome. The primary outcome of interest was retinal detachment post prophylaxis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was made of 11 databases of published and unpublished literature, which included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library. There was no restriction by language or date. The references of all included studies were checked for further relevant citations and authors of studies with potentially relevant data were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers double-screened all titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the search to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Both reviewers also independently extracted and quality assessed all included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1444 unique citations, of which four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The two principal studies were both retrospective cohort studies with control groups in populations with type 1 Stickler syndrome. One study evaluated 360  cryotherapy (n = 204) and the other focal or circumferential laser treatment (n = 22). Both studies reported a statistically significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment per eye between the groups receiving prophylaxis and the controls. However, both studies were subject to a high risk of bias. The results of the two supporting studies of Wagner-Stickler patients were either relatively inconsistent or unreliable. No study reported any major or long-term complications associated with the interventions. Despite the weaknesses of the evidence, the rate of retinal detachment in the intervention groups, especially the cryotherapy group, was lower than the rate either experienced in the study control groups or reported in other studies of untreated Stickler syndrome populations not exposed to prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Only 360  cryotherapy and focal and circumferential laser treatment have been evaluated for the type 1 Stickler syndrome population, and then only by a single retrospective, controlled, cohort study in each case. Both of these studies report a significant difference between intervention and control groups (principally no treatment) and no major or long-term side effects or complications. However, there is a high risk of bias within these two studies, so the relative effectiveness of either intervention is uncertain. FUTURE WORK: A service priority is to determine reliably the prevalence of Stickler syndrome, i.e. how many individuals have type 1 or type 2 Stickler syndrome, and their risk of retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. A non-randomised, prospective cohort comparison study, in which eligible participants are treated, followed-up and analysed in one of three study arms, for no treatment, laser therapy or cryotherapy, would potentially offer further certainty in terms of the relative efficacy of both prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis and cryotherapy versus laser therapy than is possible with the currently available data. Alternatively, continued follow-up and analysis of existing study data, and data collection from relevant sample populations, are required to assess the long-term risks of blindness, retinal detachment and prophylaxis. FUNDING: This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.",

METHODS: Patients with genetically confirmed STL with axial length >= 26 mm and controls matched for axial length were included. The following data were obtained from SD-OCT scans and fundus photography: choroidal and retinal thickness (respectively, CT and RT), peripapillary atrophy area (PAA), presence of posterior staphyloma (PS). RESULTS: Twenty-six eyes of 17 patients with STL and 25 eyes of 19 controls were evaluated. Compared with controls, patients with STL showed a greater CT subfoveally, at 1000 mum from the fovea at both nasal and temporal location, and at 2000 and 3000 mum from the fovea in nasal location (respectively, 188.7+-72.8 vs 126.0+-88.7 mum, 172.5+-77.7 vs 119.3+-80.6 mum, 190.1+-71.9 vs 134.9+-79.7 mum, 141.3+-56.0 vs 98.1+-68.5 mum, and 110.9+-51.0 vs 67.6+-50.7 mum, always P< 0.05). Furthermore, patients with STL showed a lower prevalence of PS (11.5% vs 68%, P< 0.001) and a lower PAA (2.2+-2.1 vs 5.4+-5.8 mm2, P=0.03), compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that high myopic patients with STL show a greater CT, a lower PAA and a lower prevalence of PS, compared with controls matched for axial length. These findings could be relevant for the development and progression of myopic maculopathy in patients with STL.",

Reported rates of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) vary from 8% to 64%, and need for secondary VPI surgery from 23% to 64%, with few studies providing long-term follow-up. The purpose of this study was to describe our institutional long-term experience with syndromic patients undergoing cleft palatoplasty. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients with syndromic diagnoses undergoing primary Furlow palatoplasty from 1975 to 2011. Outcomes included postoperative oronasal fistula (ONF) and need for secondary VPI surgery. Speech scores for verbal patients 5 years or older were collected via the Pittsburgh scale for speech assessment. Aggregate scores categorized the velopharyngeal mechanism as competent, borderline, or incompetent. Outcomes were analyzed by patient and operative factors. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were included with average age at repair of 20.7 months. Cleft type was 9% submucosal, 16% Veau class I, 50% class II, 12% class III, and 13% class IV. Forty-five syndromes were recorded, most commonly Stickler syndrome (n = 32) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [22q11.2DS (n = 19)]. Forty-four patients also had associated Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). The overall ONF rate was 4.5% and was highest in Veau class IV clefts (P = 0.048). Seventy-six patients were included in speech analysis, with an average age at last assessment of 10.4 years. Overall, 60.5% of patients had a competent velopharyngeal mechanism, 23.7% borderline, and 15.8% incompetent mechanism. Fifty percent of 22q11.2DS patients had borderline speech and none had competent speech, compared to 73.3% with Stickler syndrome (P = 0.01) and 71.4% of patients with associated PRS (P = 0.02). Secondary VPI surgery was performed in 11.4% of patients overall. Patients with PRS (13.6%) and with Stickler syndrome (15.6%) had secondary VPI surgery, compared to 31.6% of patients with 22q11.2DS (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates low rates of postoperative ONF after modified Furlow palatoplasty in syndromic patients. Speech outcomes were comparable to nonsyndromic patients at our institution, but patients with 22q11.2DS consistently had borderline-incompetent speech and a 3-fold higher incidence of secondary VPI surgery.",

Aggregate scores categorized the velopharyngeal mechanism as competent, borderline, or incompetent. Outcomes were analyzed by patient and operative factors. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were included with average age at repair of 20.7 months. Cleft type was 9% submucosal, 16% Veau class I, 50% class II, 12% class III, and 13% class IV. Forty-five syndromes were recorded, most commonly Stickler syndrome (n = 32) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [22q11.2DS (n = 19)]. Forty-four patients also had associated Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). The overall ONF rate was 4.5% and was highest in Veau class IV clefts (P = 0.048). Seventy-six patients were included in speech analysis, with an average age at last assessment of 10.4 years. Overall, 60.5% of patients had a competent velopharyngeal mechanism, 23.7% borderline, and 15.8% incompetent mechanism. Fifty percent of 22q11.2DS patients had borderline speech and none had competent speech, compared to 73.3% with Stickler syndrome (P = 0.01) and 71.4% of patients with associated PRS (P = 0.02). Secondary VPI surgery was performed in 11.4% of patients overall. Patients with PRS (13.6%) and with Stickler syndrome (15.6%) had secondary VPI surgery, compared to 31.6% of patients with 22q11.2DS (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates low rates of postoperative ONF after modified Furlow palatoplasty in syndromic patients. Speech outcomes were comparable to nonsyndromic patients at our institution, but patients with 22q11.2DS consistently had borderline-incompetent speech and a 3-fold higher incidence of secondary VPI surgery.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.",

RESULTS: A 24-year-old woman presented with right eye exotropia and decreased vision. She had no facial or typical retinal features of Stickler syndrome but complained of right-sided hearing loss and right-sided neck pain. Examination of the right eye showed a chronic combined exudative and traction retinal detachment with temporal retinal dragging associated with far temporal retinal exudations and fibrovascular proliferations. The left eye had an attached retina with large areas of peripheral temporal retinal nonperfusion on fluorescein angiography, sharply demarcated by end circulation vascular pruning and mild peripheral vascular leakage, consistent with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy phenotype. Genetic analysis identified two heterozygous c.1052C>A and c.1349A>G variants in COL9A1, but did not disclose any mutation in genes classically associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.

Mutations in the COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2 procollagen genes cause Stickler syndrome. Marshall syndrome, caused by a COL11A1 mutation, has clinical overlap with Stickler syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old Japanese boy was presented to our hospital with short stature (79.1 cm, -2.52 standard deviation). His past medical history was significant for soft cleft palate and bilateral cataracts. He had a flat midface, micrognathia, and limitations in bilateral elbow flexion. Radiographs showed mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Initially, we suspected Marshall syndrome, but no mutation was identified in COL11A1. At 8 years old, his height was 116.2 cm (-1.89 standard deviation), and his orofacial characteristics appeared unremarkable. We analyzed the COL2A1 gene and found a novel heterozygous mutation (c.1142 G > A, p.Gly381Asp). CONCLUSIONS: In this case report, we identify a novel missense mutation in the COL2A1 gene in a patient with Stickler syndrome type 1, and we describe age-related changes in the clinical phenotype with regard to orofacial characteristics and height. Genetic analysis is helpful for the diagnosis of this clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous disorder.",

METHODS: A clinical study including electroretinographic investigations followed by laboratory-based genetic and molecular analysis. Four affected and 3 unaffected members of the family were examined. Ten candidate regions were tested by linkage analysis with highly polymorphic molecular markers or with intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphisms. RESULTS: Of 8 siblings,4 were affected, showing high myopia with pronounced vitreous liquefaction, retinitis pigmentosa-like retinal degeneration, diffuse retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, macular staphylomata, and premature cataract formation. Strikingly abnormal results on electroretinograms, affecting both the rod and the cone systems, revealed an extensive defect of retinal function, unlike those usually found in pathologic myopia. No extraocular manifestations were observed. Three types of nonsyndromic high myopia, Stickler syndrome I, II, and III, Wagner syndrome, Knobloch syndrome, Goldmann-Favre dystrophy, and multiple vitreoretinopathies were excluded by linkage analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The reported phenotype as well as the results of molecular linkage analysis in the siblings described here suggest an autosomal recessively inherited vitreoretinal dystrophy, which, to our knowledge, has not been described until now.",

Both the mutations and the clinical features vary widely across affected patients. The main manifestations are craniofacial birth defects, bone and joint symptoms, ocular abnormalities, and hearing loss. Stickler syndrome may be revealed at birth (25% of cases) by a combination of cleft palate, retrognathism, and micrognathism known as Pierre Robin sequence, which may cause neonatal respiratory problems. The ocular abnormalities include severe myopia, abnormalities of the vitreous, and a high risk of retinal detachment (60% of cases), which may cause blindness (4% of cases). Severe hearing loss with onset in early childhood may impair performance at school. Osteoarthritis (75% of patients) with onset before 30 years of age is a severe manifestation that causes chronic hip and low back pain and functional impairments. Joint replacement surgery is often required. The risk associated with multiple anesthesias is highest in patients with craniofacial defects. The bone status may deserve to be evaluated, as the combination of genetic abnormalities and physical impairments may promote bone loss. Clinicians should be cognizant of Stickler syndrome so that they can detect the disease in patients and their family members, prevent functional impairments, organize a multidisciplinary management strategy, and arrange for genetic counseling.",

OBJECTIVES: To describe thoracolumbar spinal abnormalities and their correlation with age and back pain among patients with Stickler syndrome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Stickler syndrome (hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathy) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by skeletal, ocular, oral-facial, cardiac, and auditory manifestations. Prevalence is approximately 1 in 10,000 (similar to that of Marfan syndrome). No one has investigated spinal abnormalities in a large series of patients. METHODS: A single-center evaluation of 53 patients from 24 families with Stickler syndrome (age range, 1-70 years) in a multidisciplinary genetics clinic. Thoracolumbar radiographs were analyzed for spinal abnormalities and correlation with age and back pain. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of patients had scoliosis, 74% endplate abnormalities, 64% Schmorl's nodes, 43% platyspondylia, and 43% Scheuermann-like kyphosis. Sixty-seven percent of patients and 85% of adults reported chronic back pain. Endplate abnormalities and Schmorl's nodes were associated with adult age; endplate abnormalities, Schmorl's nodes, and adult age were associated with back pain. Only one adult patient was free of spinal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal abnormalities are nearly uniformly observed in Stickler syndrome, progress with age, and are associated with back pain. Although common, scoliosis is generally self-limited (only one patient needed surgical treatment). Correct diagnosis of this syndrome facilitates early identification and management of other potentially severe systemic manifestations and genetic counseling for affected families. Moreover, recognition of Stickler syndrome allows accurate prognosis for skeletal abnormalities and anticipation of potential surgical complications.",

The syndrome fully expressed clinical phenotype includes the degeneration of the vitreous gel and retina, frequently associated with myopia, accompanied by non-ocular features, such as craniofacial dysmorphisms or malformations, hearing impairment, skeletal dysplasia and progressive arthropathy. So far, mutations at three collagen loci, COL2A1, COL11A1 and COL11A2, have been found in Stickler syndrome patients, with about two thirds of investigated familial cases found to be associated to COL2A1 gene mutations. We report on a three generation family in which a diagnosis of Stickler syndrome was made and linkage analysis suggested COL2A1 to be the causing gene. These data permitted us to perform two prenatal diagnosis analysing the 3'VNTR polymorphism of the involved gene on amniocytes' DNA and to provide the family with genetic counselling and paediatric support at the delivery.",

DESIGN:   Prospective review of two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment. PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty-two family members from two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment were examined. METHODS:   A full ophthalmic history and examination were performed, and DNA was analysed by linkage analysis and mutation screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Characterization of a causative hereditary gene mutation in each family. RESULTS:   All affected family members of one pedigree carried a C192A COL2A1 exon 2 mutation. None of the affected family members had early-onset arthritis, hearing abnormalities, abnormal clefting or facial features characteristic of classical Stickler syndrome. All affected members of the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy pedigree carried a 957delG FZD4 mutation. CONCLUSIONS:   Patients with retinal detachment and a positive family history should be investigated for heritable conditions associated with retinal detachment such as Stickler syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The absence of non-ocular features of Stickler syndrome should raise the possibility of mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1. Similarly, late-onset familial exudative vitreoretinopathy may appear more like a rhegmatogenous detachment and not be correctly diagnosed. When a causative gene mutation is identified, cascade genetic screening of the family will facilitate genetic counselling and screening of high-risk relatives, allowing targeted management of the pre-detachment changes in affected patients.",

Ocular-only variant of Stickler syndrome type 1 (OSTL1) is characterized by high risk of retinal detachment without systemic involvement and is caused by alternatively spliced exon 2 mutation of COL2A1. We report the cases of two Korean families with OSTL1 carrying likely pathogenic variants of COL2A1. All patients presented with membranous vitreous anomaly, peripheral retinal degeneration, and/or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, but no systemic manifestations. By genetic analysis, two likely pathogenic non-exon 2 variants, c.2678dupC (p.Ala895Serfs*49) and c.3327+ 1G>C, were identified in COL2A1. Our results demonstrate that COL2A1 defects in OSTL1 are not confined to mutations in exon 2. Together with molecular data, ophthalmologists should consider genetic diagnosis of Stickler syndrome in patients with vitreous anomaly to prevent blindness from retinal detachment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genetically confirmed OSTL1 in Korea. ",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report posterior chorioretinal atrophy (PCRA) and correlate the vitreous phenotype with inheritance of the disease mutation in a family with vitreoretinal dystrophy. DESIGN: Prospective observational case series. METHODS: Twenty-four members of a family with 14 affected individuals were examined, and genetic linkage analysis was performed at the COL2A1, COL11A1, and Wagner disease loci. The vitreous phenotype was prospectively graded as optically empty with retrolenticular membrane, fibrillar, or normal. Ocular ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed on selected individuals to study the vitreous structure and vitreoretinal interface. RESULTS: The 6-year-old proband had PCRA and optically empty vitreous without systemic features, suggestive of Wagner disease. The family history was negative for systemic disease, except for one cousin with cleft palate. However, when examined, clinical features of the 14 affected subjects included 5 with small chin, 4 with at least submucosal cleft palate, and 9 with a myopic refractive error greater than 5 diopters. Lens opacity or previous cataract extraction was found in 13 family members. All affected individuals in whom the vitreous could be examined had an optically empty vitreous with retrolental membrane. Posterior chorioretinal atrophy was found in eight of the affected subjects. The finding was not limited to highly myopic subjects, nor did all the high myopes have PCRA. Ultrasonography and OCT revealed vitreous adherent to the retina, but without apparent retinal distortion or edema of the macula. Significant linkage was established to the COL2A1 locus; the other loci were excluded. A single nucleotide insertion mutation (c.2012 2013insC) was identified in exon 34, leading to a downstream premature stop codon in the COL2A1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Although posterior chorioretinal atrophy and vitreoretinal degeneration have been classically associated with Wagner disease, we demonstrate its presence in a family with typical Stickler syndrome. On the basis of clinical, ultrasonographic, and OCT studies, the etiology of PCRA in this family does not seem to be attributable to vitreomacular traction or myopia. The vitreous findings in this large family confirm reports that mutations in the COL2A1 gene lead to the optically empty vitreous with retrolenticular membrane phenotype.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to unravel the genetic cause of medical problems in a 21-year-old woman, whose phenotypic presentation extended beyond Stickler syndrome and included enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and persistent microhematuria. METHODS AND RESULTS: After sequencing of clinical exome, a known de novo COL2A1 pathogenic variant (c.1833+1G>A, p.?) causative for Stickler syndrome and one paternally inherited pathogenic change in COL4A5 (c.1871G>A, p.Gly624Asp) causative for X-linked Alport syndrome were found. No pathogenic variants, including those within the SLC26A4 5' region (Caucasian EVA haplotype), explaining the development of EVA, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals a multilocus genomic variation in one individual and provides a molecular diagnosis of two HL syndromes that co-occur in the proband independent of each other. For the third entity, EVA, no etiological factor was identified. Our data emphasize the relevance of detailed clinical phenotyping for accurate genotype interpretation. Focus on broadening the phenotypic spectrum of known genetic syndromes may actually obscure patients with multiple molecular diagnoses.",

METHODS: Case report with fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population.",

Why were the probands initially considered to have eoHM but not Stickler syndrome (STL)? Methods: Probands and family members with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 were followed up and reexamined based on the criteria for STL. Further comprehensive examinations were conducted for patients with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. We performed comparisons between probands, affected family members with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. Results: Twelve probands (8.91+-4.03 years) and 14 affected family members (37.00+-11.18 years) with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, as well as 30 controls with eoHM but without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, were recruited. Among them, 25.0% of probands and 50.0% of affected family members met the diagnostic criteria for STL after reexamination. Posterior vitreous detachment/foveal hypoplasia (PVD/FH), hypermobility of the elbow joint (HJ), and vitreous opacity were more frequent in patients with eoHM with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 than in the controls (p = 1.40 x 10-5, 3.72 x 10-4, 2.30x 10-3, respectively). HJ was more common in the probands than in the affected family members (11/12 versus 3/14; p = 3.42 x 10-4), suggesting age-dependent manifestation. EoHM presented in all the probands and in 11/14 affected family members, suggesting that it is a more common indicator of STL than the previously described vitreoretinal abnormalities, especially in children. The rate of STL diagnosis could increase from 25.0% to 66.7% for probands and from 50.0% to 92.9% for affected family members if eoHM, PVD/FH, and HJ are added to the diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: In summary, it is not easy to differentiate STL from eoHM with routine ocular examination in outpatient clinics. Awareness of atypical phenotypes and newly recognized signs may be of help in identifying atypical STL, especially in children at eye clinics.",

Radiographic and tomographic analyses were organized. METHODS: From a series of Stickler syndrome patients followed from early life to late childhood. Ten patients (6 boys and four girls of different ethnic origins were consistent with the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome type I ). Phenotypic characterization was the baseline tool applied for all patients and genotypic correlation was performed on four families RESULTS: A constellation of axial abnormalities namely; anterolateral ossification of the anterior longitudinal spinal ligament with subsequent fusion of two cervical vertebrae, early onset Forestier disease (progressive spinal hyperostosis with subsequent vertebral fusion on top of bridging osteophytes and \"Bamboo-like spine\" resembling ankylosing spondylitis) and severe premature spine degeneration were evident. Appendicular abnormalities in connection with generalized epiphyseal dysplasia were the underlying aetiology in patients with Intoeing gait and femoral anteversion, early onset severe osteoarthritis of the weight bearing joint. Remarkable trochleo-patellar dysplasia secondary to severe osteoarthritis causing effectively the development of patellar instability was additional pathology. Mutation of COL2A1 has been confirmed as the causative gene for Stickler syndrome type I CONCLUSION: We concluded that conventional radiographs and the molecular determination of a COL2A1 in patients with (Stickler syndrome type I) are insufficient tools to explain the reasons behind the tremendous magnitude of axial and appendicular skeletal abnormalities. We were able to modify the criteria of the clinical phenotype as designated by Rose et al in accordance with the novel axial and appendicular criteria as emerged from within our current study.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dwarfism is a common severe growth disorder, but the etiology is unclear in the majority of cases. Recombinant human growth hormone may be a treatment option, but it has limited efficacy. The currently known laboratory assays do not meet the precision requirements for clinical diagnosis. Here, we have constructed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of selected genes that are suspected to be associated with dwarfism for genetic screening. METHODS: Genetic screening of 91 children with short stature of unknown etiology was performed with the help of the NGS panel. All the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of 166 genes were included in the panel. To clarify the pathogenicity of these mutations, their clinical data were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The assay identified p.A72G, p.I282V, and p.P491S variants of the PTPN11 gene and a p.I437T variant of the SOS1 gene in 4 cases with Noonan syndrome. A frameshift mutation (p.D2407fs) of the ACAN gene was identified in a case of idiopathic short stature with moderately advanced bone age. A p.R904C variant of the COL2A1 gene was found in a patient, who was accordingly diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Severe short stature without limb deformity was associated with a p.G11A variant of HOXD13. In addition, we evaluated evidence that a p.D401N variant of the COMP gene may cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that syndromes, particularly Noonan syndrome, may be overlooked due to atypical clinical features. This gene panel has been verified to be effective for the rapid screening of genetic etiologies associated with short stature and for guiding precision medicine-based clinical management.",

Also, infantile-onset glaucoma associated with Stickler syndrome has been rarely reported and no reports exist that examine outcomes after glaucoma surgery. This study describes the clinical and genetic associations and the long-term outcomes of retinal detachment repair or glaucoma surgery in patients with Stickler syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, case series of patients with Stickler syndrome. Demographics, clinical features, genetic mutations, and long-term surgical outcomes of eyes that experienced retinal detachment or diagnosed with infantile-onset glaucoma were assessed. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were identified with a mean age of 13 years at presentation and followed for a mean of 6 years. Two-thirds were male. Genetic analysis was performed as part of routine examination in nine patients from eight families. All were identified as having variants in COL2A1, three of which were novel. Six eyes of six patients experienced retinal detachment. Fifty percent of eyes without prophylactic laser treatment experienced retinal detachment, whereas only 5% of eyes that underwent prophylactic therapy detached. Despite surgical intervention for retinal detachment, five eyes became phthisical. Five eyes of three patients were diagnosed with infantile-onset glaucoma. All five eyes required multiple glaucoma surgeries, and three eyes became phthisical. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the surgical challenges encountered in patients with Stickler syndrome. Additionally, infantile-onset glaucoma may be more prevalent than previously reported and presents a challenge in terms of management. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to provide optimal care to these patients.",

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

                    "abstract": "Procedures to relieve airway obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) include glossopexy, mandibular distraction, and tracheostomy. Previously, it has been suggested that the imbalance of the genioglossus insertion on the mandible could be responsible for the micrognathia, tongue elevation, and glossoptosis seen in PRS. We performed a retrospective study to determine the usefulness of subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth in PRS with airway problems. Between 1991 and 2005, 14 consecutive patients with PRS were treated with subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth performed at the British Columbia's Children's Hospital. There were 8 boys and 6 girls. Mean age at surgery was 15 weeks (range, 1-68 weeks). Postoperative follow-up ranged from 8 months to 13 years. Seven patients (4 boys and 3 girls) were successfully treated, and a tracheostomy was prevented. Fifty-five percent of the syndromic patients needed a tracheostomy, whereas 1 patient (33%) with isolated PRS needed a tracheostomy. The most common syndrome associated with PRS was Stickler syndrome. Five (72%) of the 7 patients who required a tracheostomy were boys. If conservative measures fail to relieve supraglottic airway obstruction seen in patients with PRS, a subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth can be an effective intervention in certain patients. It is a simple intervention with few complications and little morbidity. More investigations are mandatory to precisely define patient characteristics ideal for this intervention.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the characteristics of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images and visual functions in eyes with Stickler syndrome using ultra-widefield FAF images. METHODS: Forty-six eyes of 26 patients with mutations in the COL2A1 gene underwent ultra-widefield FAF imaging. The eyes were categorized into three types; no signs of abnormal AF, predominantly hyperfluorescent AF (hyper-AF), and predominantly hypofluorescent AF (hypo-AF). Goldmann perimetry was performed on 34 eyes, and line-scan images of the abnormal AF lesions were obtained by swept-source optical coherence tomography in 4 eyes. RESULTS: Abnormal AF lesions were found in 37 eyes of 21 (80.7%) of the 26 patients. Hyper-AF was found in 15 eyes and hypo-AF was found in 22 eyes. The FAF changes corresponded with the funduscopically observed radial paravascular retinal degeneration. The average age at the examination was significantly younger in patients who had eyes with hyper-AF or no abnormal AF than in those with hypo-AF (12.8 vs. 28.4 years; P = 0.009). Abnormal AF-associated visual field defects were found in 5/10 (50%) eyes with hyper-AF and 17/18 (94%) eyes with hypo-AF. Hyper-AF changes tended to appear before retinal changes were detectable by fluorescein angiography. An absence of the ellipsoid zone and the outer nuclear layer and a thinning of the overall retinal thickness were found corresponding to the hypo-AF lesions in the swept source optical coherence tomography images. CONCLUSION: Abnormal FAF is characteristic of eyes with Stickler syndrome. Age-related alterations of the FAF was associated with visual field defects and disruption of the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells.",

The aim of this study was to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2. RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5 years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation. At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del; p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a connective tissue disorder with predominantly autosomal dominant inheritance, with ocular, auditory and joint involvement. Thyroid dysfunction was not described as part of alterations in Stickler syndrome and in particular, the association between Stickler's syndrome and Graves' disease has never been previously reported in literature. Moreover, the presence of Graves' disease is uncommon in the pediatric age (especially in children younger than 6 years old). CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 5-years old child affected by Stickler syndrome who received the diagnosis of Graves's disease, in absence of suggestive symptoms, during health supervision. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence of thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune pattern for Sticker syndrome. Further clinical reports are expected before suggesting the implementation of new clinical skills for Stickler syndrome, but this paper may contribute to improve personalized management of this rare disorder.",

Prognosis of micrognathia depends on the risk of respiratory distress at birth and on the long-term risk of intellectual disability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis of fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of micrognathia by estimating the prevalence and the severity of confirmed genetic diagnosis in our cohort. Our retrospective study included 41 fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of micrognathia referred to the multidisciplinary centers for prenatal diagnosis in Nice and Marseille, France, between 2006 and 2016. Fetal micrognathia was associated with cleft palate in 27 cases. A genetic cause was confirmed in 21 cases (67%). A chromosomal abnormality was present in 12 cases, including three copy-number variations diagnosed by array CGH. Monogenic disorders were identified in nine cases, most often after birth. Fetuses with family history of micrognathia or Pierre Robin sequence had a favorable outcome. Prognosis was good for the fetuses without associated findings and normal chromosomal analysis, with the exception of one case with a postnatal diagnosis of mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly. Prognostic was poor for the fetuses with additional ultrasound anomalies, as only 5 out of 28 children had a good outcome. Prenatal diagnosis of micrognathia is an indicator of a possible fetal pathology justifying multidisciplinary management. Our study confirms the necessity of performing prenatal array CGH. Use of high-throughput gene sequencing in prenatal period could improve diagnostic performance, prenatal counseling, and adequate postnatal care.",

The eyes were collected from C57BL mice heterozygous for a targeted inactivation of one allele of the Col2a1 gene (Col2a1(+/-) mice). The eyes of C57BL mice with normal gene alleles were used as controls (Col2a1(+/+) mice). Ocular histology was analyzed from tissue sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue and alcian blue. Type II collagen was localized by immunohistochemistry. Hyaluronan (HA) was stained utilizing the biotinylated complex of the hyaluronan-binding region of aggrecan and link protein (bHABC). The anterior segment of the eye was well-formed in both genotypes, but typical folding of ciliary processes was decreased, while increased stromal extracellular matrix vacuolization was seen in the Col2a1(+/-) mice. In the lens of these mice, subcapsular extracellular matrix changes were observed. Differences in retinal structures or the number of the eyes with retinal detachment were not detected between the genotypes. In Col2a1(+/-) mice, staining for type II collagen was weaker in cornea, ciliary body, iris, lens, vitreous, retina, choroid and sclera than in the control mice. HA staining was detected in the extraocular tissues, ciliary body, iris and the choroid of both genotypes. HA staining was observed only in the vitreous body of the control animals. Heterozygous inactivation of Col2a1 gene causes structural defects in the murine eye. The observed structural changes in the ciliary body, lens and vitreous of the Col2a1(+/-) mice may represent ocular features found in the human Stickler syndrome, where the abnormalities result from COL2A1 gene mutations which lead to functional haploinsufficiency.",

DESIGN: Retrospective case series study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 eyes of 25 patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome were studied. METHODS: All of the patients had mutations in the COL2A1 gene and were diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Cross-sectional OCT images, OCT angiography (OCTA), and en face OCT images were assessed. The ratio of the foveal inner retinal layer (fIRL) thickness to the parafoveal inner retinal layer (pIRL) thickness, the ratio of the foveal outer retinal layer (fORL) thickness to the parafoveal outer retinal layer (pORL) thickness, and the size of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) were determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The degree of foveal hypoplasia and the best-corrected visual acuity in patients with Stickler syndrome. RESULTS: A persistence of the inner retinal layers in the fovea with an fIRL/pIRL ratio >0.2 was present in 32 of the 39 eyes (82%). Optical coherence tomography angiography showed that the FAZ was smaller, 0 to 0.19 mm2, than that of normal eyes, in 25 eyes of 17 patients who underwent OCTA. There was no significant correlation between the visual acuities and the fIRL/pIRL ratios. CONCLUSIONS: A mild foveal hypoplasia with a persistence of the IRL is characteristic of eyes with Stickler syndrome. The visual acuities were not correlated with the fIRL/pIRL ratios.",

Type 2 SS and the SS variant otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) are caused by deleterious variants in COL11A1 and COL11A2, respectively. In both genes, available database information indicates a high rate of potentially deleterious intronic variants, but published evidence of their biological effect is usually insufficient for a definite clinical interpretation. We report four previously unpublished intronic variants in COL11A1 (c.2241 + 5G>T, c.2809 - 2A>G, c.3168 + 5G>C) and COL11A2 (c.4392 + 1G>A) identified in type 2 SS/OSMED individuals. The pathogenic effect of these variants was first predicted in silico and then investigated by an exon-trapping assay. We demonstrated that all variants can induce exon in-frame deletions, which lead to the synthesis of shorter collagen XI alpha1 or 2 chains. Lacking residues are located in the alpha-triple helical region, which has a crucial role in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis. In conclusion, this study suggests that these alternative COL11A1 and COL11A2 transcripts might result in aberrant triple helix collagen. Our approach may help to improve the diagnostic molecular pathway of COL11-related disorders.",

The purpose of this study was to review our institution's experience with valgus SCFE to better describe its prevalence, clinical presentation, and treatment. METHODS: Radiographs of patients undergoing treatment of SCFE between 1996 and 2008 were reviewed. Valgus SCFE was identified by increased prominence of the lateral femoral epiphysis relative to the lateral femoral neck and an increased anteroposterior physis shaft angle. We identified 12 patients (16 hips) with valgus SCFE and compared them with 123 cases identified as classic posteromedial SCFE. RESULTS: The prevalence of valgus SCFE at our institution was 4.7% (12 of 258 patients). Significant differences between patients with valgus SCFE and those with classic SCFE were found for age at presentation (mean 1.1 y younger, P=0.033), sex (58% female vs. 28% male, P=0.044), and classification as atypical SCFE (42% vs. 3%, P<0.001), respectively. Four patients in the valgus group had pituitary and growth hormone dysfunction, and 1 was diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Hips of valgus patients had a significantly higher mean femoral neck shaft angle (154.3 degrees) as compared with classic SCFE patients (140.5 degrees) (P<0.001). Difficulty placing hardware for in situ fixation was noted in 5 of 11 valgus cases, with 1 case complicated by articular surface penetration and chondrolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Valgus displacement often presents with a relatively normal appearance on anteroposterior radiographs. Valgus SCFE may be associated with obesity, coxa valga, hypopituitarism, and Stickler syndrome. Posterolateral displacement of the femoral epiphysis makes in situ fixation of valgus SCFE more difficult, due to the necessity of a more medial starting point.

DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals, including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing. Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography, and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants. RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately 28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding 95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive.

Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1. In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.",

METHODS: A clinical study including electroretinographic investigations followed by laboratory-based genetic and molecular analysis. Four affected and 3 unaffected members of the family were examined. Ten candidate regions were tested by linkage analysis with highly polymorphic molecular markers or with intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphisms. RESULTS: Of 8 siblings,4 were affected, showing high myopia with pronounced vitreous liquefaction, retinitis pigmentosa-like retinal degeneration, diffuse retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, macular staphylomata, and premature cataract formation. Strikingly abnormal results on electroretinograms, affecting both the rod and the cone systems, revealed an extensive defect of retinal function, unlike those usually found in pathologic myopia. No extraocular manifestations were observed. Three types of nonsyndromic high myopia, Stickler syndrome I, II, and III, Wagner syndrome, Knobloch syndrome, Goldmann-Favre dystrophy, and multiple vitreoretinopathies were excluded by linkage analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The reported phenotype as well as the results of molecular linkage analysis in the siblings described here suggest an autosomal recessively inherited vitreoretinal dystrophy, which, to our knowledge, has not been described until now.",

One of the major symptoms associated with this disorder is an oro-facial malformation, which may cause a submucous cleft or a complete cleft of the hard palate. A 32-year-old man diagnosed with Stickler syndrome and a submucosal cleft palate (SMCP) visited our hospital with a chief complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness. The patient was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and administration of a polysomnography test revealed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 30.9 events/hour (h). Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure was initiated to control the OSA symptoms and subsequently the patient showed some improvement. However, due to continuous velopharyngeal insufficiency symptoms, intravelar veloplasty was performed. Three months after surgery, the AHI had decreased to 12.4 events/h. Recent studies have described a greater risk for OSA in individuals with cleft palate, than in the general population. The present case demonstrates surgical success in a patient with OSA and SMCP, suggesting that palatal surgery may be considered an optional surgical treatment for OSA patients with SMCP.",

METHODS: We identified a family with 2 adults with polyarticular OA and a child with generalized arthralgia. General, musculoskeletal, ocular, and auditory evaluations were undertaken. Investigations included radiographs of symptomatic joints, analysis of serum inflammatory markers and joint fluid, and mutational analyses of the COL11A2 gene. RESULTS: The 3 affected individuals had normal stature, mild mid-face hypoplasia, and hearing impairment, but normal eyes. Radiographs of the affected adults showed severe polyarticular OA but did not reveal diagnostic evidence of an underlying skeletal dysplasia. However, the child's radiographs showed enlarged epiphyses with an advanced bone age. The combination of skeletal, facial, and auditory features together with the absence of ocular features indicated that they had otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia, also known as Stickler syndrome type III. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a mutation in the COL11A2 gene that encodes the pre-pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen that is involved in type II collagen fibrillogenesis. CONCLUSION: Early-onset polyarticular OA may occur in adults without a known or obvious underlying skeletal dysplasia. This study provides an approach to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia in such individuals.",

Both the mutations and the clinical features vary widely across affected patients. The main manifestations are craniofacial birth defects, bone and joint symptoms, ocular abnormalities, and hearing loss. Stickler syndrome may be revealed at birth (25% of cases) by a combination of cleft palate, retrognathism, and micrognathism known as Pierre Robin sequence, which may cause neonatal respiratory problems. The ocular abnormalities include severe myopia, abnormalities of the vitreous, and a high risk of retinal detachment (60% of cases), which may cause blindness (4% of cases). Severe hearing loss with onset in early childhood may impair performance at school. Osteoarthritis (75% of patients) with onset before 30 years of age is a severe manifestation that causes chronic hip and low back pain and functional impairments. Joint replacement surgery is often required. The risk associated with multiple anesthesias is highest in patients with craniofacial defects. The bone status may deserve to be evaluated, as the combination of genetic abnormalities and physical impairments may promote bone loss. Clinicians should be cognizant of Stickler syndrome so that they can detect the disease in patients and their family members, prevent functional impairments, organize a multidisciplinary management strategy, and arrange for genetic counseling.",

Treatment included cryotherapy and laser therapy for retinal detachment, repair of cleft palate, use of hearing and mobility aids, and joint replacements. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations of symptoms and signs among affected persons, even within the same family. There are delays in diagnosis, lack of understanding among family members, denial about the risk of serious eye problems, and joint disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A giant retinal tear is defined as a full thickness break in the neurosensory retina that extends circumferentially for 3 or more clock hours around the retina in the presence of a posterior vitreous detachment. It is one of the more complex surgical scenarios that a retina surgeon can face. There is no consensus on the ideal surgical technique; however, the \"traditional\" approach has been to perform a combined procedure including lensectomy, scleral buckle and vitrectomy. OBJECTIVE: To report the outcome over 2 years of five patients with giant retinal tears managed with lens sparing, bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with giant retinal tears managed with lens sparing, bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle. Included in the analysis were age, lens status, etiology and size of the tear, pre- and postoperative visual acuity, anatomic success, tamponade used, laser or criopexy where recorded. RESULTS: Three patients had high myopia, one secondary to blunt trauma and one with Wagner-Stickler syndrome were included in the analysis. The size of the tear varied from 120-280 . Anatomic success was achieved in all patients. One patient developed proliferative vitreoretinopathy and was re-operated and the retina remained attached. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of selected patients, lens-sparing bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle seems a safe and effective option in the management of retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tears. Further prospective and comparative studies are warranted to establish the role of this technique in the treatment of patients with this complex pathology.",

Left eye cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and Ahmed glaucoma drainage device implantation were performed with resolution of ocular hypertension.A 35-year-old male with Stickler syndrome presented with intermittent right eye pain and blurry vision. IOP was 42 mm Hg and gonioscopy revealed 270 degrees of angle closure in the right eye. The patient underwent laser peripheral iridotomy in the right eye with resolution of ocular hypertension by the next day. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing angle closure as a potential feature of Stickler syndrome can help providers adequately screen and manage patients with Stickler syndrome presenting with acutely elevated IOP.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler syndrome with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group of patients by members of the cleft team. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of Stickler syndrome among the author's group of patients with Robin sequence, and to investigate the visual outcome among paediatric patients with Robin sequence and Stickler syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children (six male and two female) with Stickler syndrome and Robin sequence were referred to be followed up every 6 months in the Ophthalmologic Department because of high myopia at less than 10 years of age. Three patients came from the author's study group and five were referred by other cleft surgeons. They were examined with repeat ophthalmic and indirect fundus examinations including cycloplegic refraction, and slit lamp biomicroscope examinations. Laser photocoagulation (2 cases) treatment for retinal degeneration or operation (3 cases) for retinal detachment was performed once evidence of significant ophthalmologic finding was noted. RESULTS: Of the 91 cases of newborns with isolated cleft palate treated by the first author, eight patients had Robin sequence, and among these, three had Stickler syndrome. The prevalence of Stickler syndrome among this subgroup of patients was 37.5% (3/8). Among these three patients and the additional five referred by other cleft surgeons, the average spherical equivalents of the first cycloplegic refraction for the 16 eyes was -12.39+/-2.72 diopter (D) (range -8.75 to -18.5D). Of the eight patients, five did not need any therapy, two children had retinal degeneration in the left eye and retinal detachment in the right eye while one child had retinal detachment in the right eye only. Laser photocoagulation was performed in the two left eyes with retinal degeneration and was successful. Surgery was performed on the three eyes with retinal detachment, one was successful while two failed and the patients developed total blindness at ages four and six respectively. Out of these three children with retinal complications, only one child remained free of visual deterioration in both eyes during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Early identification of Stickler syndrome in children with Robin sequence by cleft surgeons is necessary to insure early referral to an ophthalmologist for detection of myopia, monitoring for retinal detachment, and prevention of visual complications.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare surgical outcomes for syndromes with optically empty vitreous (SOEV) associated rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional, two-arm study of a single pediatric vitreoretinal surgeon's patients from a quaternary referral center with syndromes with optically empty vitreous was performed to examine visual and anatomic outcomes of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and laser prophylaxis. SUBJECTS: Patients identified either through slit lamp examination (presence of an optically empty or void space in the vitreous gel structure) or genetic testing. 56 eyes of 49 patients were identified in the retinal detachment arm. 60 eyes of 48 patients were identified in the laser prophylaxis arm. METHODS: Comparison of initial retinal detachment (RD) surgical repair via PPV, SB, or PPV-SB with final anatomic success, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and number of surgical procedures. Secondary analysis was performed looking at eyes failing their initial SB, eyes with a GRT at presentation, eyes failing RD repair within specific time intervals, and eyes where hyaloid was elevated during initial vitrectomy. An additional study arm examined the outcomes of final BCVA and the presence and timing of developing a retinal tear or RD in eyes who received laser prophylaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, Surgical repair techniques (PPV, SB, PPV-SB), Number of Surgeries, Anatomical retinal reattachment success. RESULTS: Initial scleral buckle (SB) had statistically significant better final BCVA (p<0.01) and better final anatomic success (p<0.01). No statistical difference in the number of surgeries needed to achieve anatomic success between the initial SB versus initial PPV-SB/PPV. Hyaloidal elevation during the initial vitrectomy was associated with improved final BCVA and higher final anatomic success without the use of silicone oil (p <0.01 and 0.04 respectively). Lastly, eyes who developed RDs after laser prophylaxis had better final BCVA compared to untreated eyes (p 0.05). CONCLUSION: Initial SB yields better overall outcomes in SOEV presenting with RRD. Stickler Type-1 patients had similar outcomes compared to other SOEV, suggesting both populations should be treated with similar approaches.",

Treatment included cryotherapy and laser therapy for retinal detachment, repair of cleft palate, use of hearing and mobility aids, and joint replacements. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations of symptoms and signs among affected persons, even within the same family. There are delays in diagnosis, lack of understanding among family members, denial about the risk of serious eye problems, and joint disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A giant retinal tear is defined as a full thickness break in the neurosensory retina that extends circumferentially for 3 or more clock hours around the retina in the presence of a posterior vitreous detachment. It is one of the more complex surgical scenarios that a retina surgeon can face. There is no consensus on the ideal surgical technique; however, the \"traditional\" approach has been to perform a combined procedure including lensectomy, scleral buckle and vitrectomy. OBJECTIVE: To report the outcome over 2 years of five patients with giant retinal tears managed with lens sparing, bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with giant retinal tears managed with lens sparing, bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle. Included in the analysis were age, lens status, etiology and size of the tear, pre- and postoperative visual acuity, anatomic success, tamponade used, laser or criopexy where recorded. RESULTS: Three patients had high myopia, one secondary to blunt trauma and one with Wagner-Stickler syndrome were included in the analysis. The size of the tear varied from 120-280 . Anatomic success was achieved in all patients. One patient developed proliferative vitreoretinopathy and was re-operated and the retina remained attached. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of selected patients, lens-sparing bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle seems a safe and effective option in the management of retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tears. Further prospective and comparative studies are warranted to establish the role of this technique in the treatment of patients with this complex pathology.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report the myopic shift at 5 years of age after cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation for infants enrolled in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS). METHODS: Refractions were performed at 1 month and every 3 months postoperatively until age 4 years and then at ages 4.25, 4.5, and 5 years. The change in refraction over time was estimated by linear mixed model analysis. RESULTS: Intraocular lens implantation was completed in 56 eyes; 43 were analyzed (median age, 2.4 months; range, 1.0-6.8 months). Exclusions included 11 patients with glaucoma, 1 patient with Stickler syndrome, and 1 patient with an IOL exchange at 8 months postoperatively. The mean rate of change in a myopic direction from 1 month after cataract surgery to age 1.5 years was 0.35 diopters (D)/month (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.40 D/month); after age 1.5 years, the mean rate of change in a myopic direction was 0.97 D/year (95% CI, 0.66-1.28 D/year). The mean refractive change was 8.97 D (95% CI, 7.25-10.68 D) at age 5 years for children 1 month of age at surgery and 7.22 D (95% CI, 5.54-8.91 D) for children 6 months of age at surgery. The mean refractive error at age 5 years was -2.53 D (95% CI, -4.05 to -1.02). CONCLUSIONS: After IOL implantation during infancy, the rate of myopic shift occurs most rapidly during the first 1.5 years of life. Myopic shift varies substantially among patients. If the goal is emmetropia at age 5 years, then the immediate postoperative hypermetropic targets should be +10.5 D at 4 to 6 weeks and +8.50 D from 7 weeks to 6 months. However, even using these targets, it is likely that many children will require additional refractive correction given the high variability of refractive outcomes.",

DESIGN:   Prospective review of two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment. PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty-two family members from two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment were examined. METHODS:   A full ophthalmic history and examination were performed, and DNA was analysed by linkage analysis and mutation screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Characterization of a causative hereditary gene mutation in each family. RESULTS:   All affected family members of one pedigree carried a C192A COL2A1 exon 2 mutation. None of the affected family members had early-onset arthritis, hearing abnormalities, abnormal clefting or facial features characteristic of classical Stickler syndrome. All affected members of the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy pedigree carried a 957delG FZD4 mutation. CONCLUSIONS:   Patients with retinal detachment and a positive family history should be investigated for heritable conditions associated with retinal detachment such as Stickler syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The absence of non-ocular features of Stickler syndrome should raise the possibility of mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1. Similarly, late-onset familial exudative vitreoretinopathy may appear more like a rhegmatogenous detachment and not be correctly diagnosed. When a causative gene mutation is identified, cascade genetic screening of the family will facilitate genetic counselling and screening of high-risk relatives, allowing targeted management of the pre-detachment changes in affected patients.",

The syndrome fully expressed clinical phenotype includes the degeneration of the vitreous gel and retina, frequently associated with myopia, accompanied by non-ocular features, such as craniofacial dysmorphisms or malformations, hearing impairment, skeletal dysplasia and progressive arthropathy. So far, mutations at three collagen loci, COL2A1, COL11A1 and COL11A2, have been found in Stickler syndrome patients, with about two thirds of investigated familial cases found to be associated to COL2A1 gene mutations. We report on a three generation family in which a diagnosis of Stickler syndrome was made and linkage analysis suggested COL2A1 to be the causing gene. These data permitted us to perform two prenatal diagnosis analysing the 3'VNTR polymorphism of the involved gene on amniocytes' DNA and to provide the family with genetic counselling and paediatric support at the delivery.",

METHODS: A clinical study including electroretinographic investigations followed by laboratory-based genetic and molecular analysis. Four affected and 3 unaffected members of the family were examined. Ten candidate regions were tested by linkage analysis with highly polymorphic molecular markers or with intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphisms. RESULTS: Of 8 siblings,4 were affected, showing high myopia with pronounced vitreous liquefaction, retinitis pigmentosa-like retinal degeneration, diffuse retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, macular staphylomata, and premature cataract formation. Strikingly abnormal results on electroretinograms, affecting both the rod and the cone systems, revealed an extensive defect of retinal function, unlike those usually found in pathologic myopia. No extraocular manifestations were observed. Three types of nonsyndromic high myopia, Stickler syndrome I, II, and III, Wagner syndrome, Knobloch syndrome, Goldmann-Favre dystrophy, and multiple vitreoretinopathies were excluded by linkage analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The reported phenotype as well as the results of molecular linkage analysis in the siblings described here suggest an autosomal recessively inherited vitreoretinal dystrophy, which, to our knowledge, has not been described until now.",

PATIENTS & METHODS: Ten patients from two different families with non-ocular Stickler syndrome (Stickler syndrome type 3) were included. Six members of the first family and four members of the second family participated in this study. Otorhinolaryngologic examinations were performed. Pure-tone and speech audiograms were obtained. Longitudinal analysis was performed. Psychophysical measurements, including loudness scaling, gap detection, difference limen for frequency and speech perception in noise were administered to assess cochlear function at a deeper level. RESULTS: Affected individuals in the first family were carriers of a heterozygous splice donor mutation in the COL11A2 gene. Affected individuals in the second family were carriers of a novel heterozygous missense mutation in COL11A2. Both families showed bilateral, non-progressive hearing impairment with childhood onset. The severity of the hearing impairment exhibited inter- and intrafamilial variability and was mostly mild to moderate. The results of the psychophysical measurements were similar to those previously published for DFNA8/12 (TECTA) and DFNA13 (COL11A2) patients and thus consistent with an intra-cochlear conductive hearing impairment. This is in line with the theory that mutations in COL11A2 affect tectorial membrane function. CONCLUSION: Hearing impairment in non-ocular Stickler syndrome is characterized by non-progressive hearing loss, present since childhood, and mostly mild to moderate in severity. Psychophysical measurements in non-ocular Stickler patients were suggestive of intra-cochlear conductive hearing impairment.",

It may be an isolated occurrence or part of a more complex syndrome and it is associated with long-term respiratory, nutritional, and developmental difficulties. Stickler syndrome (SS) is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder estimated to affect approximately 1/7500 newborns. It is diagnosed clinically and, at present, there is no consensus on a minimal clinical diagnostic criterion. The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment.

It may be an isolated occurrence or part of a more complex syndrome and it is associated with long-term respiratory, nutritional, and developmental difficulties. Stickler syndrome (SS) is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder estimated to affect approximately 1/7500 newborns. It is diagnosed clinically and, at present, there is no consensus on a minimal clinical diagnostic criterion. The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler syndrome with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group of patients by members of the cleft team.

                    "abstract": "Procedures to relieve airway obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) include glossopexy, mandibular distraction, and tracheostomy. Previously, it has been suggested that the imbalance of the genioglossus insertion on the mandible could be responsible for the micrognathia, tongue elevation, and glossoptosis seen in PRS. We performed a retrospective study to determine the usefulness of subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth in PRS with airway problems. Between 1991 and 2005, 14 consecutive patients with PRS were treated with subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth performed at the British Columbia's Children's Hospital. There were 8 boys and 6 girls. Mean age at surgery was 15 weeks (range, 1-68 weeks). Postoperative follow-up ranged from 8 months to 13 years. Seven patients (4 boys and 3 girls) were successfully treated, and a tracheostomy was prevented. Fifty-five percent of the syndromic patients needed a tracheostomy, whereas 1 patient (33%) with isolated PRS needed a tracheostomy. The most common syndrome associated with PRS was Stickler syndrome. Five (72%) of the 7 patients who required a tracheostomy were boys. If conservative measures fail to relieve supraglottic airway obstruction seen in patients with PRS, a subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth can be an effective intervention in certain patients. It is a simple intervention with few complications and little morbidity. More investigations are mandatory to precisely define patient characteristics ideal for this intervention.",

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015.

RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001).

There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To review a series of infants with Robin sequence (RS) who underwent mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) at the authors' institution and document changes in pre- and postoperative laryngoscopy grades. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with RS who underwent MDO from March 2005 to June 2017 were identified. Patients were included if they had a preoperative polysomnogram confirming obstructive sleep apnea, had failed nonoperative airway management, had undergone MDO by the senior author (C.M.R.), and had complete documentation. Patients were excluded if they did not have a laryngoscopy performed (ie, tracheostomy dependent) or if there was insufficient information in their medical record. Variables included demographic data, operative information, and laryngoscopic details at 3 time points: before MDO (T0), at device removal (T1), and at latest follow-up laryngoscopy (T2). Descriptive statistics were computed. Significance was set at a P value less than .05. RESULTS: Twenty-two infants with RS underwent MDO during the study period and 13 of these met criteria for inclusion. Mean age at MDO (T0) was 19.6 +- 38.8 weeks. Mean ages at device removal (T1) and latest follow-up laryngoscopy (T2) were 28.2 +- 41.5 and 62.7 +- 49.6 weeks, respectively. Three patients had Stickler syndrome; the others had nonsyndromic RS. Mean apnea-hypopnea index was 23.6 +- 16.6 preoperatively and 0.3 +- 0.7 after MDO (P = .011). At T0, a grade IIb laryngoscopic view was most common (46.1%) and only 3 patients (23.1%) had a grade I view. At T1, most patients (69.2%) had a grade I view and only 2 (14.4%) had a grade of IIb or worse (P = .011). At T2, all but 1 patient had a grade I view. CONCLUSION: In addition to resolving obstructive apnea, MDO is associated with an improvement in the grade of laryngoscopic view. This could increase airway safety at home and improve ease of intubation for future operations.",

Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis. RESULTS: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis. CONCLUSION: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of the disease process and may allow for future growth.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the two most common genetic mutations seen in Stickler Syndrome (SS) (COL2A1 and COL11A1) affect the incidence of mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) and what impact Robin sequence (RS) has on diagnosis. SS is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by almost complete penetrance. COL2A1 and COL11A1 are the two most common mutations seen in SS patients. SS often presents at birth with RS, which is characterized by the triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and tongue-based airway obstruction. MDO is one surgical intervention that has been shown to be successful in relieving tongue base obstruction and is the surgical intervention of choice for this condition. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with a diagnosis of SS at a tertiary pediatric hospital between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2018. The included patient charts were reviewed for demographic information, SS mutation, and history of MDO. Forty-six patients had a clinical diagnosis of SS. Of those, 31 met inclusion criteria which involved having a molecular diagnosis of SS and sufficient follow up information to determine if MDO was indicated or performed. Twenty-two of the 31 included patients had a diagnosis of RS (70.96%). Thirteen of the 31 patients (41.94%) included in this study required MDO as a neonate. RESULTS: Fifty-percent of patients with type I (COL2A1) required MDO as a neonate compared to only 31% of patients with type II (COL11A1), though the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that patients with type I mutation may have a higher incidence of MDO than patients with a type II mutation, though further research with larger sample sizes is needed. This information is helpful in counseling those with SS or family history of SS about what they can expect related to RS and need for MDO based on genetic findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To review clinical and epidemiologic data of orofacial clefts and to evaluate the efficacy and the impact of prenatal diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based retrospective study was carried out on data from the Congenital Malformations of Alsace Registry (France) between 1995 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 321 orofacial clefts were recorded (overall prevalence, 2.1 per 1000), divided into cleft lip (CL) or cleft lip palate (CLP) (204 cases) and cleft palate (117 cases). The cleft lip and cleft lip palate CL+-P sex-ratio was 1.87, whereas the CP sex-ratio was 1. CLs were more often unilateral than CLPs (79% versus 59%). CLs were unilateral in 79% of the cases (60/76), bilateral in 20% of the cases (15/76), and median in 1% (1/76); 55% of the unilateral CLs were right and 45% were left. CLPs were unilateral in 59% of the cases (76/128), bilateral in 39% of the cases (50/128), and median in 2% (2/128); 45% of the unilateral CLPs were right and 55% were left. The 117 CPs were divided into 50 clefts of the total palate (43%) and 67 clefts of the posterior palate (57%); 25 cases (21%) of Pierre Robin sequence were collected. Sixty-six percent of CL+-P (134/204) were associated with other congenital anomalies, including chromosome abnormality in 31 cases and identified monogenic syndrome or association in 12 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormalities were 16 cases of trisomy 13 and 7 cases of trisomy 18. No cases of 22q11.2 microdeletion or duplication were detected among CL+-P. Monogenic syndromes were identified in 6% (12/204) of CL+-P cases: Van der Woude syndrome (2 cases); CHARGE syndrome (2 cases); ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft/lip palate (EEC) syndrome (2 cases); branchiooculofacial (BOF) syndrome (1 case); Treacher-Collins syndrome (1 case); Nager syndrome (1 case); Goldenhar syndrome (1 case); holoprosencephaly spectrum (1 case); and Meckel syndrome (1 case). Forty-two percent of CPs (49/117) were associated with other congenital anomalies; chromosome abnormality was identified in 12 cases and monogenic syndrome was diagnosed in 14 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormality was 22q11 microdeletion (5 cases). Monogenic syndromes were recognized in 12% of the CP cases (14/117): fragile X syndrome (2 cases), Meckel syndrome (2 cases), Orofaciodigital syndrome type I (OFD1) (1 case), Stickler syndrome (1 case), Larsen syndrome (1 case), Kniest syndrome (1 case), Cornelia de Lange syndrome (1 case), thanatophoric dysplasia (1 case), other unknown bone chondrodysplasia (1 case), Fryns syndrome (1 case), fetal akinesia sequence (1 case), and Silver-Russel syndrome (1 case). Fifty-two percent of CL cases (106/204) were prenatally diagnosed. An increasing tendency was observed between the 1995-2000 and 2001-2006 periods with a detection rate increasing from 47% to 56%. During the whole period, only 1 case of CP was prenatally diagnosed. Eighty-two percent of all cases (263/321) were livebirths; 8 stillbirths were reported (2%); 50 syndromic or associated cases (16%) led to medical abortion (no termination of pregnancy was performed for isolated cleft). CONCLUSION: Orofacial clefts are a frequent malformation with a total prevalence of 2.1 per 1000 total births. Sonbographic prenatal diagnosis of orofacial clefts remains difficult with a mean detection rate about 50% for CL+-P and is extremely rare for CP. Associated malformations and genetic syndromes are frequent and require a systematic survey. This study also highlights the different pathogenic background of CL+-P compared to CP, regarding the sex-ratio and the proportion and type of associated malformations.",

DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals, including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing. Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography, and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants. RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately 28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding 95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive. It is less severe than that reported for types II and III Stickler syndrome linked to COL11A2 (OMIM 120290) and COL11A1 (OMIM 120280) mutations, respectively, or the closely related Marshall syndrome. This difference will be a useful discriminatory feature in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an approach to the clinical, radiographic, and molecular diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia in adults presenting with early-onset polyarticular osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: We identified a family with 2 adults with polyarticular OA and a child with generalized arthralgia. General, musculoskeletal, ocular, and auditory evaluations were undertaken. Investigations included radiographs of symptomatic joints, analysis of serum inflammatory markers and joint fluid, and mutational analyses of the COL11A2 gene. RESULTS: The 3 affected individuals had normal stature, mild mid-face hypoplasia, and hearing impairment, but normal eyes. Radiographs of the affected adults showed severe polyarticular OA but did not reveal diagnostic evidence of an underlying skeletal dysplasia. However, the child's radiographs showed enlarged epiphyses with an advanced bone age. The combination of skeletal, facial, and auditory features together with the absence of ocular features indicated that they had otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia, also known as Stickler syndrome type III. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a mutation in the COL11A2 gene that encodes the pre-pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen that is involved in type II collagen fibrillogenesis. CONCLUSION: Early-onset polyarticular OA may occur in adults without a known or obvious underlying skeletal dysplasia. This study provides an approach to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia in such individuals.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: It is understood that the National Health Service (NHS) commissioned service at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK has the largest cohort of Stickler syndrome patients in the paediatric age group worldwide with 240 registered children. Fifty-nine were assessed radiologically and for their genotypes. These radiographs were reviewed and 74 knee, 45 pelvic, and 47 spinal examinations were evaluated. RESULTS: Radiological features were noted in 45.9% of knee radiographs, 11.1% of pelvic radiographs, and 42.6% of spinal radiographs. The findings were reviewed in the light of each patient's specific genetic Stickler syndrome subtype. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of orthopaedic abnormalities overall in the present series is substantially below those published in previous smaller case series. This would support the more recent findings of an array of ocular only phenotypes of Stickler syndrome described in the literature.",

                    "abstract": "Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is an important craniofacial anomaly that can be seen as an isolated finding or manifestation of multiple syndromes. 22q11.2 deletion and Stickler syndrome are cited as the two most common conditions associated with PRS, but their frequencies are debated. We performed a retrospective study of 66 patients with PRS and reviewed their genetic testing, diagnoses, and clinical findings. The case series is complemented by a comprehensive literature review of the nature and frequency of genetic diagnosis in PRS. In our cohort 65% of patients had associated anomalies; of these, a genetic diagnosis was established in 56%. Stickler syndrome was the most common diagnosis, comprising approximately 11% of all cases, followed by Treacher Collins syndrome (9%). The frequency of 22q11.2 deletion was 1.5%. Chromosome arrays, performed for 72% of idiopathic PRS with associated anomalies, revealed two cases of 18q22 qter deletion, a region not previously reported in association with PRS. A review of the cytogenetic anomalies identified in this population supports an association between the 4q33-qter, 17q24.3, 2q33.1, and 11q23 chromosomal loci and PRS. We found a low frequency of 22q11.2 deletion in PRS, suggesting it is less commonly implicated in this malformation. Our data also indicate a higher frequency of cytogenetic anomalies in PRS patients with associated anomalies, and a potential new link with the 18q22 qter locus. The present findings underscore the utility of chromosomal microarrays in cases of PRS with associated anomalies and suggest that delaying testing for apparently isolated cases should be considered.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pathogenic PLOD3 variants cause a connective tissue disorder (CTD) that has been described rarely. We further characterise this CTD and propose a clinical diagnostic label to improve recognition and diagnosis of PLOD3-related disease. METHODS: Reported PLOD3 phenotypes were compared with known CTDs utilising data from three further individuals from a consanguineous family with a homozygous PLOD3 c.809C>T; p.(Pro270Leu) variant. PLOD3 mRNA expression in the developing embryo was analysed for tissue-specific localisation. Mouse microarray expression data were assessed for phylogenetic gene expression similarities across CTDs with overlapping clinical features. RESULTS: Key clinical features included ocular abnormalities with risk for retinal detachment, sensorineural hearing loss, reduced palmar creases, finger contractures, prominent knees, scoliosis, low bone mineral density, recognisable craniofacial dysmorphisms, developmental delay and risk for vascular dissection. Collated clinical features showed most overlap with Stickler syndrome with variable features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Human lysyl hydroxylase 3/PLOD3 expression was localised to the developing cochlea, eyes, skin, forelimbs, heart and cartilage, mirroring the clinical phenotype of this disorder. CONCLUSION: These data are consistent with pathogenic variants in PLOD3 resulting in a clinically distinct Stickler-like syndrome with vascular complications and variable features of EDS and EB. Early identification of PLOD3 variants would improve monitoring for comorbidities and may avoid serious adverse ocular and vascular outcomes.",

Prognosis of micrognathia depends on the risk of respiratory distress at birth and on the long-term risk of intellectual disability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis of fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of micrognathia by estimating the prevalence and the severity of confirmed genetic diagnosis in our cohort. Our retrospective study included 41 fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of micrognathia referred to the multidisciplinary centers for prenatal diagnosis in Nice and Marseille, France, between 2006 and 2016. Fetal micrognathia was associated with cleft palate in 27 cases. A genetic cause was confirmed in 21 cases (67%). A chromosomal abnormality was present in 12 cases, including three copy-number variations diagnosed by array CGH. Monogenic disorders were identified in nine cases, most often after birth. Fetuses with family history of micrognathia or Pierre Robin sequence had a favorable outcome. Prognosis was good for the fetuses without associated findings and normal chromosomal analysis, with the exception of one case with a postnatal diagnosis of mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly. Prognostic was poor for the fetuses with additional ultrasound anomalies, as only 5 out of 28 children had a good outcome. Prenatal diagnosis of micrognathia is an indicator of a possible fetal pathology justifying multidisciplinary management. Our study confirms the necessity of performing prenatal array CGH. Use of high-throughput gene sequencing in prenatal period could improve diagnostic performance, prenatal counseling, and adequate postnatal care.",

In this study we aimed to clarify the mutation spectrum of syndromic hearing loss patients in Japan by using next-generation sequencing analysis with a multiple syndromic targeted resequencing panel (36 target genes). We analyzed single nucleotide variants, small insertions, deletions and copy number variations in the target genes. We enrolled 140 patients with any of 14 syndromes (BOR syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Stickler syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, Pendred syndrome, Klippel-Feil syndrome, Alport syndrome, Norrie disease, Treacher-Collins syndrome, Perrault syndrome and auditory neuropathy with optic atrophy) and identified the causative variants in 56% of the patients. This analysis could identify the causative variants in syndromic hearing loss patients in a short time with a high diagnostic rate. In addition, it was useful for the analysis of the cases who only partially fulfilled the diagnostic criteria.",

Four children showed symptoms characteristic of Stickler syndrome, including moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, moderate-to-high myopia with vitreoretinopathy, and epiphyseal dysplasia. We considered the COL9A1 gene, located on chromosome 6q13, to be a candidate gene on the basis of the structural association with collagen types II and XI and because of the high expression in the human inner ear indicated by cDNA microarray. Mutation analysis of the coding region of the COL9A1 gene showed a homozygous R295X mutation in the four affected children. The parents and four unaffected children were heterozygous carriers of the R295X mutation. Two unaffected children were homozygous for the wild-type allele. None of the family members except the homozygous R295X carriers had any signs of Stickler syndrome. Therefore, COL9A1 is the fourth identified gene that can cause Stickler syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Only in the last year has the specific genetic defect in Wagner syndrome been identified, and the background literature of the molecular genetics is outlined. Clinical and laboratory findings in a second case of Wagner syndrome are included to highlight difficulties that can be encountered when identifying pathogenic mutations for disorders arising in complex genes.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a 3-generation white family clinically diagnosed variably with Wagner, Stickler, and Jansen syndromes and screened for sequence variants in the COL2A1 and CSPG2 genes. Wagner syndrome is an autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy with a predisposition to retinal detachment and cataracts. It has significant phenotypic overlap with allelic Jansen syndrome and ocular Stickler syndrome type 1. Sticker syndrome type 1 maps to chromosome 12q13.11-q13.2, with associated COL2A1 gene mutations. Wagner syndrome maps to chromosome 5q13-q14 and is associated with mutations in CSPG2 encoding versican, a proteoglycan present in human vitreous. METHODS: Genomic DNA samples derived from venous blood were collected from all family members. Complete sequencing of COL2A1 was performed on a proband. Primers for polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were designed to cover all exon and intron-exon boundaries. Direct sequencing of CSPG2 was performed on all family member samples. RESULTS: No detectable COL2A1 mutations were noted, making the diagnosis of ocular Stickler syndrome highly unlikely for this family. A unique base pair substitution (c.9265 + 1G>T) in intron 8 of the CSPG2 gene cosegregating with disease status was identified. This mutation occurred in a highly conserved previously reported splice site with a similar base pair substitution (G>A). Direct sequencing of this splice site mutation in 107 unrelated external controls revealed no variants, supporting the rarity of this base pair change and its causation in Wagner syndrome. This novel base pair substitution is thought to cause the deletion of exon 8 and formation of a truncated protein product. CONCLUSION: Mutation screening of CSPG2 in autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy families is important for accurate diagnosis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study underscores the importance of obtaining extensive pedigree information and comparative ophthalmologic clinical information, as the phenotypic findings may vary greatly among independent family members. The study also affirms the paradigm shift from diagnosis assignment based on eponyms to that based on gene mutation type.",

DESIGN:   Prospective review of two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment. PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty-two family members from two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment were examined. METHODS:   A full ophthalmic history and examination were performed, and DNA was analysed by linkage analysis and mutation screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Characterization of a causative hereditary gene mutation in each family. RESULTS:   All affected family members of one pedigree carried a C192A COL2A1 exon 2 mutation. None of the affected family members had early-onset arthritis, hearing abnormalities, abnormal clefting or facial features characteristic of classical Stickler syndrome. All affected members of the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy pedigree carried a 957delG FZD4 mutation. CONCLUSIONS:   Patients with retinal detachment and a positive family history should be investigated for heritable conditions associated with retinal detachment such as Stickler syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The absence of non-ocular features of Stickler syndrome should raise the possibility of mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1. Similarly, late-onset familial exudative vitreoretinopathy may appear more like a rhegmatogenous detachment and not be correctly diagnosed. When a causative gene mutation is identified, cascade genetic screening of the family will facilitate genetic counselling and screening of high-risk relatives, allowing targeted management of the pre-detachment changes in affected patients.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a 3-generation white family clinically diagnosed variably with Wagner, Stickler, and Jansen syndromes and screened for sequence variants in the COL2A1 and CSPG2 genes. Wagner syndrome is an autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy with a predisposition to retinal detachment and cataracts. It has significant phenotypic overlap with allelic Jansen syndrome and ocular Stickler syndrome type 1. Sticker syndrome type 1 maps to chromosome 12q13.11-q13.2, with associated COL2A1 gene mutations. Wagner syndrome maps to chromosome 5q13-q14 and is associated with mutations in CSPG2 encoding versican, a proteoglycan present in human vitreous. METHODS: Genomic DNA samples derived from venous blood were collected from all family members. Complete sequencing of COL2A1 was performed on a proband. Primers for polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were designed to cover all exon and intron-exon boundaries. Direct sequencing of CSPG2 was performed on all family member samples. RESULTS: No detectable COL2A1 mutations were noted, making the diagnosis of ocular Stickler syndrome highly unlikely for this family. A unique base pair substitution (c.9265 + 1G>T) in intron 8 of the CSPG2 gene cosegregating with disease status was identified. This mutation occurred in a highly conserved previously reported splice site with a similar base pair substitution (G>A). Direct sequencing of this splice site mutation in 107 unrelated external controls revealed no variants, supporting the rarity of this base pair change and its causation in Wagner syndrome. This novel base pair substitution is thought to cause the deletion of exon 8 and formation of a truncated protein product. CONCLUSION: Mutation screening of CSPG2 in autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy families is important for accurate diagnosis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study underscores the importance of obtaining extensive pedigree information and comparative ophthalmologic clinical information, as the phenotypic findings may vary greatly among independent family members. The study also affirms the paradigm shift from diagnosis assignment based on eponyms to that based on gene mutation type.",

METHODS: Histological and electron microscopic examinations were performed on the enucleated globe from the proband of a pedigree with type 1 Stickler syndrome. Linkage analysis was carried out using polymorphic markers flanking the COL2A1 gene and the mutation was identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The significant retinal abnormality was incarceration of vitreous collagen within glial strands on the inner surface of an atrophic and gliotic detached retina. The incarcerated collagenous layers contained glial cells and extended from the retina to form strands, some of which contributed to a retrolental membrane. Mutation screening detected a C to T mutation in exon 47 that inserted a premature termination codon into the reading frame of the mRNA. Sequence analysis of three of the four affected children confirmed that they were also heterozygous for the base change. The youngest child's DNA was not analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The study represents the first evidence of abnormal interactions between pathological vitreous collagen and the inner retina in a patient with type 1 Stickler syndrome with a confirmed mutation in the COL2A1 gene.",

METHODS: We identified a family with 2 adults with polyarticular OA and a child with generalized arthralgia. General, musculoskeletal, ocular, and auditory evaluations were undertaken. Investigations included radiographs of symptomatic joints, analysis of serum inflammatory markers and joint fluid, and mutational analyses of the COL11A2 gene. RESULTS: The 3 affected individuals had normal stature, mild mid-face hypoplasia, and hearing impairment, but normal eyes. Radiographs of the affected adults showed severe polyarticular OA but did not reveal diagnostic evidence of an underlying skeletal dysplasia. However, the child's radiographs showed enlarged epiphyses with an advanced bone age. The combination of skeletal, facial, and auditory features together with the absence of ocular features indicated that they had otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia, also known as Stickler syndrome type III. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a mutation in the COL11A2 gene that encodes the pre-pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen that is involved in type II collagen fibrillogenesis. CONCLUSION: Early-onset polyarticular OA may occur in adults without a known or obvious underlying skeletal dysplasia.

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1. In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.",

We evaluated the son of a consanguineous couple who presented with profound hypotonia and global developmental delay. Other features included sensorineural hearing loss, asymmetric astigmatism, and high myopia. Clinical whole-exome sequence analysis identified a homozygous missense variant in AMPD2 (NM_001257360.1:c.2201C > T, p.[Pro734Leu]) that has not been previously reported. Given the strong phenotypic overlap with PCH9, including the identification of the typical \"Figure 8\" appearance of the brainstem on neuroimaging, we suspect this variant was causative of the neurodevelopmental disability in this individual. An additional homozygous nonsense variant in COL11A1 (NM_001854.4:c.1168G > T, p.[Glu390Ter]) was identified. Variants in this alternatively spliced region of COL11A1 have been identified to cause an autosomal recessive form of Stickler syndrome type 2 characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and eye abnormalities, but without musculoskeletal abnormalities. The COL11A1 variant likely also contributed to the individual's phenotype, suggesting two potentially relevant genetic findings.

Molecular analysis has proven effective in diagnosis, confirmation and classification of the disease. We aimed to describe the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in genetic analysis of four Indian families with suspected Stickler syndrome. Methods: The index cases presented with retinal detachment with family history. Genetic analysis in the index case was performed by next-generation sequencing of inherited retinal degeneration genes, and validated by Sanger sequencing followed by co-segregation analysis in the other family members. Results: Twenty patients were included for the genetic analysis (15 males and 5 females from four families). Clinical details were available for 15 patients (30 eyes). Fourteen eyes (11 patients) developed RRD. In the 16 eyes without RRD, 8 underwent barrage laser to lattice degeneration and 8 were under observation. Disease segregating heterozygous mutations with pathogenic/likely pathogenic effect was identified in COL2A1 (c.4318-1G>A, c.141G>A, c.1221+1G>A for 3 families) and COL11A1 (c.1737+1 G>A for 1 family) gene. In addition to the mutation in the COL2A1 gene, a pathogenic heterozygous variant associated with risk for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) was identified in one member. Conclusion: NGS testing confirmed the presence of the causative gene for Stickler syndrome in the index case followed by evaluation of family members and confirmation of genetic and ocular findings. We believe that this may be the first such report of families with RRD from India.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To review a series of infants with Robin sequence (RS) who underwent mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) at the authors' institution and document changes in pre- and postoperative laryngoscopy grades. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with RS who underwent MDO from March 2005 to June 2017 were identified. Patients were included if they had a preoperative polysomnogram confirming obstructive sleep apnea, had failed nonoperative airway management, had undergone MDO by the senior author (C.M.R.), and had complete documentation. Patients were excluded if they did not have a laryngoscopy performed (ie, tracheostomy dependent) or if there was insufficient information in their medical record. Variables included demographic data, operative information, and laryngoscopic details at 3 time points: before MDO (T0), at device removal (T1), and at latest follow-up laryngoscopy (T2). Descriptive statistics were computed. Significance was set at a P value less than .05. RESULTS: Twenty-two infants with RS underwent MDO during the study period and 13 of these met criteria for inclusion. Mean age at MDO (T0) was 19.6 +- 38.8 weeks. Mean ages at device removal (T1) and latest follow-up laryngoscopy (T2) were 28.2 +- 41.5 and 62.7 +- 49.6 weeks, respectively. Three patients had Stickler syndrome; the others had nonsyndromic RS. Mean apnea-hypopnea index was 23.6 +- 16.6 preoperatively and 0.3 +- 0.7 after MDO (P = .011). At T0, a grade IIb laryngoscopic view was most common (46.1%) and only 3 patients (23.1%) had a grade I view. At T1, most patients (69.2%) had a grade I view and only 2 (14.4%) had a grade of IIb or worse (P = .011). At T2, all but 1 patient had a grade I view. CONCLUSION: In addition to resolving obstructive apnea, MDO is associated with an improvement in the grade of laryngoscopic view. This could increase airway safety at home and improve ease of intubation for future operations.",

DESIGN: Retrospective case series study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 eyes of 25 patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome were studied. METHODS: All of the patients had mutations in the COL2A1 gene and were diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Cross-sectional OCT images, OCT angiography (OCTA), and en face OCT images were assessed. The ratio of the foveal inner retinal layer (fIRL) thickness to the parafoveal inner retinal layer (pIRL) thickness, the ratio of the foveal outer retinal layer (fORL) thickness to the parafoveal outer retinal layer (pORL) thickness, and the size of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) were determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The degree of foveal hypoplasia and the best-corrected visual acuity in patients with Stickler syndrome. RESULTS: A persistence of the inner retinal layers in the fovea with an fIRL/pIRL ratio >0.2 was present in 32 of the 39 eyes (82%). Optical coherence tomography angiography showed that the FAZ was smaller, 0 to 0.19 mm2, than that of normal eyes, in 25 eyes of 17 patients who underwent OCTA. There was no significant correlation between the visual acuities and the fIRL/pIRL ratios. CONCLUSIONS: A mild foveal hypoplasia with a persistence of the IRL is characteristic of eyes with Stickler syndrome. The visual acuities were not correlated with the fIRL/pIRL ratios.",

Why were the probands initially considered to have eoHM but not Stickler syndrome (STL)? Methods: Probands and family members with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 were followed up and reexamined based on the criteria for STL. Further comprehensive examinations were conducted for patients with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. We performed comparisons between probands, affected family members with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. Results: Twelve probands (8.91+-4.03 years) and 14 affected family members (37.00+-11.18 years) with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, as well as 30 controls with eoHM but without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, were recruited. Among them, 25.0% of probands and 50.0% of affected family members met the diagnostic criteria for STL after reexamination. Posterior vitreous detachment/foveal hypoplasia (PVD/FH), hypermobility of the elbow joint (HJ), and vitreous opacity were more frequent in patients with eoHM with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 than in the controls (p = 1.40 x 10-5, 3.72 x 10-4, 2.30x 10-3, respectively). HJ was more common in the probands than in the affected family members (11/12 versus 3/14; p = 3.42 x 10-4), suggesting age-dependent manifestation. EoHM presented in all the probands and in 11/14 affected family members, suggesting that it is a more common indicator of STL than the previously described vitreoretinal abnormalities, especially in children. The rate of STL diagnosis could increase from 25.0% to 66.7% for probands and from 50.0% to 92.9% for affected family members if eoHM, PVD/FH, and HJ are added to the diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: In summary, it is not easy to differentiate STL from eoHM with routine ocular examination in outpatient clinics. Awareness of atypical phenotypes and newly recognized signs may be of help in identifying atypical STL, especially in children at eye clinics.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Stickler syndrome is a collagenopathy that is typically COL2A1-related (autosomal dominant) and less commonly related to other collagen gene mutations. Diagnosis is straightforward when a child has myopia or retinal detachment in the setting of classic diagnostic criteria such as hearing impairment, midfacial hypoplasia, and arthropathy. However, some children have primarily ocular disease with mild or no extraocular features. Such children can remain undiagnosed unless suspicion is raised by the ophthalmologist. METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series (2014-2016) of children (<12 years old) suspected to have Stickler syndrome type collagenopathy by a single ophthalmologist and able to complete genetic testing for this possibility. Suspicion was based on vitreous abnormalities and myopia or lens opacities in the setting of prior retinal detachment, hearing impairment, or facial flatness. RESULTS: Average age of the 12 identified children was 8 years old (range 3-11; five boys). Average spherical equivalent for phakic eyes was -13 (range -3.5 to -30). Nine children had lens opacities or aphakia; two with aphakia also had lens subluxation or iridodonesis. Other recurrent clinical features included flat facies (12/12), hearing impairment (5/12), and prior retinal detachment (4/12). Pathogenic variants for collagenopathy were uncovered in 10/12 children: COL11A1 (heterozygous) in six, COL2A1 (heterozygous) in two, and COL9A1 (homozygous) in two. One child was homozygous for pathogenic variation in LRPAP1. One child had no detectable gene mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these clinical features (particularly vitreous abnormality, myopia, and lens opacity) had a high molecular yield for collagen gene mutation. Ophthalmologists who see such children should suspect Stickler syndrome, even in the absence of overt systemic disease. COL11A1-related rather than COL2A1-related autosomal dominant disease may be more common when undiagnosed children are identified based on ocular examination. Biallelic mutations in LRPAP1 can result in a phenotype that may resemble Stickler syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report posterior chorioretinal atrophy (PCRA) and correlate the vitreous phenotype with inheritance of the disease mutation in a family with vitreoretinal dystrophy. DESIGN: Prospective observational case series. METHODS: Twenty-four members of a family with 14 affected individuals were examined, and genetic linkage analysis was performed at the COL2A1, COL11A1, and Wagner disease loci. The vitreous phenotype was prospectively graded as optically empty with retrolenticular membrane, fibrillar, or normal. Ocular ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed on selected individuals to study the vitreous structure and vitreoretinal interface. RESULTS: The 6-year-old proband had PCRA and optically empty vitreous without systemic features, suggestive of Wagner disease. The family history was negative for systemic disease, except for one cousin with cleft palate. However, when examined, clinical features of the 14 affected subjects included 5 with small chin, 4 with at least submucosal cleft palate, and 9 with a myopic refractive error greater than 5 diopters. Lens opacity or previous cataract extraction was found in 13 family members. All affected individuals in whom the vitreous could be examined had an optically empty vitreous with retrolental membrane. Posterior chorioretinal atrophy was found in eight of the affected subjects. The finding was not limited to highly myopic subjects, nor did all the high myopes have PCRA. Ultrasonography and OCT revealed vitreous adherent to the retina, but without apparent retinal distortion or edema of the macula. Significant linkage was established to the COL2A1 locus; the other loci were excluded. A single nucleotide insertion mutation (c.2012 2013insC) was identified in exon 34, leading to a downstream premature stop codon in the COL2A1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Although posterior chorioretinal atrophy and vitreoretinal degeneration have been classically associated with Wagner disease, we demonstrate its presence in a family with typical Stickler syndrome. On the basis of clinical, ultrasonographic, and OCT studies, the etiology of PCRA in this family does not seem to be attributable to vitreomacular traction or myopia. The vitreous findings in this large family confirm reports that mutations in the COL2A1 gene lead to the optically empty vitreous with retrolenticular membrane phenotype.",

Patients with regressed retinopathy of prematurity, retinal detachment in the fellow eye, or known Stickler syndrome were excluded. RESULTS: Fifty-four eyes of 30 patients with high myopia were examined. Twenty-six eyes of 14 patients were examined under anesthesia because of the examiner's inability to adequately visualize the peripheral retina during an office examination. Mean age at examination was 6 +/- 3 (range, 1-10) years. Mean spherical equivalent refractive error was -13.88 +/- 3.79 (range, -6.00 to -25.00) diopters. Peripheral retinal findings were identified in 33% of eyes, the most common being lattice degeneration (20%), white without pressure (11%), and retinal holes with subretinal fluid (4%). CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of highly myopic children in our study showed peripheral retinal findings. If the peripheral retina is not adequately visualized during an office evaluation, examination under anesthesia should be considered.",

Patients with Stickler syndrome, an inherited disorder of collagen synthesis, are more likely to have retinal detachments than the general population. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 9-year-old boy who presented to the Emergency Department with blurry vision, and who was subsequently diagnosed with bilateral retinal detachments. The patient underwent successful operative intervention. He was eventually determined to have Stickler syndrome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: It is important for emergency physicians to recognize pediatric visual problems such as retinal detachment, as their presentations may be unusual, and delay of definitive care could result in lifelong visual impairment.",

METHODS: The probands of two consanguineous autosomal recessive Stickler families were evaluated for homozygosity using SNP microarray in one and haplotype analysis in the other. Subsequently, the entire COL9A1 open reading frame was analyzed by DNA sequencing in all members of the respective families. Several family members were investigated for dysmorphic features as well as ophthalmic, audiologic, and radiologic abnormalities. RESULTS: A novel homozygous COL9A1 mutation (p.R507X) was identified in two affected Turkish sisters, and the previously published mutation (p.R295X) was found in a Moroccan boy. Ophthalmic assessment revealed myopia, cataracts, distinct vitreous changes, progressive chorioretinal degeneration, and exudative and rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. All three had sensorineural hearing loss and epiphyseal dysplasia. Intervertebral disc bulging was observed in one patient and in two heterozygous carriers of the p.R507X mutation. CONCLUSIONS: A second, novel mutation was identified in COL9A1, causing autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome together with the previously described nucleotide change in two separate families. Although the overall phenotype was comparable to autosomal dominant Stickler, vitreous changes that may enable recognition of patients who are likely to carry mutations in COL9A1 were identified, and exudative retinal detachment was observed as a new finding in Stickler syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate COL9A1 in two families suggestive of autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome and to delineate the associated phenotype. METHODS: The probands of two consanguineous autosomal recessive Stickler families were evaluated for homozygosity using SNP microarray in one and haplotype analysis in the other. Subsequently, the entire COL9A1 open reading frame was analyzed by DNA sequencing in all members of the respective families. Several family members were investigated for dysmorphic features as well as ophthalmic, audiologic, and radiologic abnormalities. RESULTS: A novel homozygous COL9A1 mutation (p.R507X) was identified in two affected Turkish sisters, and the previously published mutation (p.R295X) was found in a Moroccan boy. Ophthalmic assessment revealed myopia, cataracts, distinct vitreous changes, progressive chorioretinal degeneration, and exudative and rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. All three had sensorineural hearing loss and epiphyseal dysplasia. Intervertebral disc bulging was observed in one patient and in two heterozygous carriers of the p.R507X mutation. CONCLUSIONS: A second, novel mutation was identified in COL9A1, causing autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome together with the previously described nucleotide change in two separate families. Although the overall phenotype was comparable to autosomal dominant Stickler, vitreous changes that may enable recognition of patients who are likely to carry mutations in COL9A1 were identified, and exudative retinal detachment was observed as a new finding in Stickler syndrome.",

In case 1, the proposita had Albright hereditary osteodystrophy which was inherited from her mother and type 1 Stickler syndrome which was a new mutation. The combination of manifestations from the two syndromes had resulted in initial diagnostic confusion. Diagnosis of the latter syndrome was made only following ophthalmic examination which documented the presence of a membranous vitreous anomaly characteristic of type 1 Stickler syndrome. Subsequent confirmation was achieved by mutation analysis of the COL2A1 gene. The propositus in case 2 inherited Treacher Collins syndrome paternally and type 2 Stickler syndrome maternally. The overlap of facial anomalies may have resulted in a more severe phenotype for the patient. The diagnosis of Stickler syndrome in the propositus was confirmed initially by vitreous assessment and later by demonstration of mutation in the COL11A1 gene. These two patients highlight the key role of vitreous examination and vitreoretinal phenotyping in the differential diagnosis of Stickler syndrome and its subtypes in cases where the clinical picture is complicated by double heterozygosity.",

To date three genes, COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2, encoding the heterotypic type II/XI collagen fibrils present in vitreous and cartilage have been shown to have mutations that result in Stickler syndrome. As systemic features in this disorder are variable we have used an ophthalmic examination to differentiate those patients with a membranous vitreous phenotype associated with mutations in COL2A1, from other patients who may have mutations in other genes. Gene amplification and exon sequencing was used to screen 50 families or sporadic cases with this membranous phenotype, for mutations in COL2A1. Mutations were detected in 47 (94%) cases consisting of 166 affected and 78 unaffected individuals. We also demonstrate that the predominantly ocular form of type 1 Stickler syndrome is not confined to mutations in the alternatively spliced exon 2. Using splicing reporter constructs we demonstrate that a mutant GC donor splice site in intron 51 can be spliced normally; this contributed to the predominantly ocular phenotype in the family in which it occurred.",

DESIGN:   Prospective review of two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment. PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty-two family members from two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment were examined. METHODS:   A full ophthalmic history and examination were performed, and DNA was analysed by linkage analysis and mutation screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Characterization of a causative hereditary gene mutation in each family. RESULTS:   All affected family members of one pedigree carried a C192A COL2A1 exon 2 mutation. None of the affected family members had early-onset arthritis, hearing abnormalities, abnormal clefting or facial features characteristic of classical Stickler syndrome. All affected members of the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy pedigree carried a 957delG FZD4 mutation. CONCLUSIONS:   Patients with retinal detachment and a positive family history should be investigated for heritable conditions associated with retinal detachment such as Stickler syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The absence of non-ocular features of Stickler syndrome should raise the possibility of mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1. Similarly, late-onset familial exudative vitreoretinopathy may appear more like a rhegmatogenous detachment and not be correctly diagnosed. When a causative gene mutation is identified, cascade genetic screening of the family will facilitate genetic counselling and screening of high-risk relatives, allowing targeted management of the pre-detachment changes in affected patients.",

It has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is caused by mutations in COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2. We describe a family of Moroccan origin that consists of four children with Stickler syndrome, six unaffected children, and two unaffected parents who are distant relatives (fifth degree). All family members were clinically investigated for ear, nose, and throat; ophthalmologic; and radiological abnormalities. Four children showed symptoms characteristic of Stickler syndrome, including moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, moderate-to-high myopia with vitreoretinopathy, and epiphyseal dysplasia. We considered the COL9A1 gene, located on chromosome 6q13, to be a candidate gene on the basis of the structural association with collagen types II and XI and because of the high expression in the human inner ear indicated by cDNA microarray. Mutation analysis of the coding region of the COL9A1 gene showed a homozygous R295X mutation in the four affected children. The parents and four unaffected children were heterozygous carriers of the R295X mutation. Two unaffected children were homozygous for the wild-type allele. None of the family members except the homozygous R295X carriers had any signs of Stickler syndrome. Therefore, COL9A1 is the fourth identified gene that can cause Stickler syndrome. In contrast to the three previously reported Stickler syndrome-causing genes, this gene causes a form of Stickler syndrome with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This finding will have a major impact on the genetic counseling of patients with Stickler syndrome and on the understanding of the pathophysiology of collagens. Mutation analysis of this gene is recommended in patients with Stickler syndrome with possible autosomal recessive inheritance.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler syndrome with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group of patients by members of the cleft team. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of Stickler syndrome among the author's group of patients with Robin sequence, and to investigate the visual outcome among paediatric patients with Robin sequence and Stickler syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children (six male and two female) with Stickler syndrome and Robin sequence were referred to be followed up every 6 months in the Ophthalmologic Department because of high myopia at less than 10 years of age. Three patients came from the author's study group and five were referred by other cleft surgeons. They were examined with repeat ophthalmic and indirect fundus examinations including cycloplegic refraction, and slit lamp biomicroscope examinations. Laser photocoagulation (2 cases) treatment for retinal degeneration or operation (3 cases) for retinal detachment was performed once evidence of significant ophthalmologic finding was noted. RESULTS: Of the 91 cases of newborns with isolated cleft palate treated by the first author, eight patients had Robin sequence, and among these, three had Stickler syndrome. The prevalence of Stickler syndrome among this subgroup of patients was 37.5% (3/8). Among these three patients and the additional five referred by other cleft surgeons, the average spherical equivalents of the first cycloplegic refraction for the 16 eyes was -12.39+/-2.72 diopter (D) (range -8.75 to -18.5D). Of the eight patients, five did not need any therapy, two children had retinal degeneration in the left eye and retinal detachment in the right eye while one child had retinal detachment in the right eye only. Laser photocoagulation was performed in the two left eyes with retinal degeneration and was successful. Surgery was performed on the three eyes with retinal detachment, one was successful while two failed and the patients developed total blindness at ages four and six respectively. Out of these three children with retinal complications, only one child remained free of visual deterioration in both eyes during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Early identification of Stickler syndrome in children with Robin sequence by cleft surgeons is necessary to insure early referral to an ophthalmologist for detection of myopia, monitoring for retinal detachment, and prevention of visual complications.",

These disorders range from simple refractive disorder to severe disease that can lead to disability. Hence the interest of early screening. This study aims to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary management and of the need for ophthalmological examination in each deaf child. We conducted a prospective monocentric data collection from medical records of 200 children followed for hypoacousia from January 2014 to January 2015. Each child underwent complete ophthalmological examination, ENT examination and clinical examination. Data from 155 medical records were collected. Ocular involvement was found in 47 patients, reflecting a rate of 30.4%. Bilateral involvement was found in 45 patients. The main syndromic causes were: Usher syndrome (8 casess), Waardenbourg syndrome (5 cases), Alport syndrome (3 cases), Wolfram syndrome (2 cases), Goldenhar syndrome (3 cases), Cogan syndrome (3 cases), Franceschetti-Kleinsyndrome (1 case), Charge syndrome(1 case), otomandibular syndrome (1 case), Stickler syndrome(1 case), Alstrom syndrome (1 case), Refsum disease (1 case), Susac syndrome (1 case) and KID Syndrome (1 case). Screening for ocular involvement allowed to shorten the average length of cochlear implantation from 9 months to 3 months. There are numerous ocular and auditory involvements because of the embryological and cellular similarities of these two organs, including the retina and the inner ear. The diagnosis of these involvements is facilitated by the presence of facial dysmorphism; on the other hand, diagnosis is difficult when there are visual and auditory sensorineural involvements. Early diagnosis of ocular and auditory involvements allows for best psychomotor development and optimal social inclusion. Therefore multidisciplinary management is necessary to allow for the best psychomotor, orthophonic and visual rehabilitation.",

The clinical features including the visual acuity, fundus appearances, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images, and electroretinograms were examined. RESULTS: Myopia of -12 diopters (D) to -24 D with an average of -16.8 D was observed in 9 eyes of the 5 patients. The FAF images showed different degrees of hyper and hypoautofluorescent patterns in the macula in all but the two youngest patients (7 of 9 eyes, 78%). The OCT images showed the absence of a foveal pit and destruction of the outer retinal layers in the macular area in all patients. The ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the macular region was disrupted in eight eyes (80%) of which seven were fovea sparing.

This retrospective consecutive case series included 149 patients with inherited eye diseases, seen by a single pediatric ophthalmologist, who underwent genetic testing between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018. Variants were detected using a target enrichment panel of 429 genes and known deep intronic variants associated with inherited eye disease. Among 149 patients, 38 (25.5%) had a family history, and this cohort includes heterogeneous phenotype including anterior segment dysgenesis, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus syndrome, optic atrophy, and retinal dystrophy. Overall, 90 patients (60.4%) received a definite molecular diagnosis. Overall, NGS-guided precision care was provided to 8 patients (5.4%). The precision care included cryotherapy to prevent retinal detachment in COL2A1 Stickler syndrome, osteoporosis management in patients with LRP5-associated familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and avoidance of unnecessary phlebotomy in hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. A revision of the initial clinical diagnosis was made in 22 patients (14.8%). Unexpected multi-gene deletions and dual diagnosis were noted in 4 patients (2.7%). We found that precision medical or surgical managements were provided for 8 of 149 patients (5.4%), and multiple locus variants were found in 2.7% of cases. These findings are important because individualized management of inherited eye diseases can be achieved through genetic testing.",

Estimates suggest a global prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) ranging from 50 % to about 100 % though, depending on the underlying Stickler genotype. By performing extensive audiometric analysis in Stickler patients, we aimed to further elucidate the auditory phenotype. Twenty molecularly confirmed Stickler patients (age 10-62 year), of whom sixteen with type 1 Stickler syndrome (COL2A1 mutation) and four with type 2 Stickler syndrome (COL11A1 mutation) underwent an otological questionnaire, clinical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry and otoacoustic emission testing. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis of the audiograms was performed to assess progression. In type 1 Stickler syndrome, 75 % demonstrated hearing loss, predominantly in the high frequencies. No significant progression beyond presbyacusis was observed. All type 2 Stickler patients exhibited mild-to-moderate low- and mid-frequency SNHL and moderate-to-severe high-frequency SNHL. In both types, hearing loss was observed in childhood. Otoacoustic emissions were only detectable in 7/40 ears and had very low amplitudes, even in frequency bands with normal hearing on pure tone audiometry. Type 1 Stickler syndrome is characterized by a mild high-frequency SNHL, emerging in childhood and non-progressive. Absent otoacoustic emissions are a frequent finding. Patients with type 2 Stickler syndrome exhibit early-onset moderate SNHL affecting all frequencies with a sloping audiogram. Taking into account the visual impairment in many patients, we recommend regular auditory follow-up in patients with Stickler syndrome, especially in childhood. ",

DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals, including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing. Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography, and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants. RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately 28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding 95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive. It is less severe than that reported for types II and III Stickler syndrome linked to COL11A2 (OMIM 120290) and COL11A1 (OMIM 120280) mutations, respectively, or the closely related Marshall syndrome. This difference will be a useful discriminatory feature in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders.",

PATIENTS & METHODS: Ten patients from two different families with non-ocular Stickler syndrome (Stickler syndrome type 3) were included. Six members of the first family and four members of the second family participated in this study. Otorhinolaryngologic examinations were performed. Pure-tone and speech audiograms were obtained. Longitudinal analysis was performed. Psychophysical measurements, including loudness scaling, gap detection, difference limen for frequency and speech perception in noise were administered to assess cochlear function at a deeper level. RESULTS: Affected individuals in the first family were carriers of a heterozygous splice donor mutation in the COL11A2 gene. Affected individuals in the second family were carriers of a novel heterozygous missense mutation in COL11A2. Both families showed bilateral, non-progressive hearing impairment with childhood onset. The severity of the hearing impairment exhibited inter- and intrafamilial variability and was mostly mild to moderate. The results of the psychophysical measurements were similar to those previously published for DFNA8/12 (TECTA) and DFNA13 (COL11A2) patients and thus consistent with an intra-cochlear conductive hearing impairment. This is in line with the theory that mutations in COL11A2 affect tectorial membrane function. CONCLUSION: Hearing impairment in non-ocular Stickler syndrome is characterized by non-progressive hearing loss, present since childhood, and mostly mild to moderate in severity. Psychophysical measurements in non-ocular Stickler patients were suggestive of intra-cochlear conductive hearing impairment.",

So far, mutations at three collagen loci, COL2A1, COL11A1 and COL11A2, have been found in Stickler syndrome patients, with about two thirds of investigated familial cases found to be associated to COL2A1 gene mutations. We report on a three generation family in which a diagnosis of Stickler syndrome was made and linkage analysis suggested COL2A1 to be the causing gene.

DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twelve eyes of 191 patients 0 to 18 years of age undergoing surgical repair for RRD between 2001 and 2015 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months. METHODS: Patients were divided into 3 age groups (0-6 years, 7-12 years, and 13-18 years) and comparisons were made using bivariate and multivariate generalized estimating equation models. A mixed means model was used to examine visual acuity in each age group over time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete reattachment of the retina at final follow-up. RESULTS: Of 212 eyes, 166 (78%) achieved total reattachment at final follow-up. Mean follow-up was 36.3 months. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with Stickler syndrome was more likely to occur in the younger cohorts (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.91), whereas RRD associated with blunt trauma was more likely to occur in the oldest cohort (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4). Subtotal RRD was more likely to be repaired successfully than total RRD (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4; P = 0.0100), and eyes with previous vitreoretinal surgery were less likely to undergo successful repair (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.78; P = 0.0258). There was no significant difference between age groups in the rate of surgical success (P = 0.55). There was a significantly higher success rate with primary scleral buckle (SB; 63%; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) and combined SB plus pars plana vitrectomy (PPV; 68%; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1) compared with PPV alone (51%). CONCLUSIONS: Most pediatric patients with RRD achieved complete reattachment with surgery. Success was more common in patients with a subtotal RRD at presentation. Previous vitreoretinal surgery was a risk factor for failure. Younger patients were more likely to demonstrate RRD involving the macula, but there was no difference between age groups in successful reattachment at final follow-up. Primary PPV showed a lower rate of success than SB or combined SB plus PPV.",

DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional, two-arm study of a single pediatric vitreoretinal surgeon's patients from a quaternary referral center with syndromes with optically empty vitreous was performed to examine visual and anatomic outcomes of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and laser prophylaxis. SUBJECTS: Patients identified either through slit lamp examination (presence of an optically empty or void space in the vitreous gel structure) or genetic testing. 56 eyes of 49 patients were identified in the retinal detachment arm. 60 eyes of 48 patients were identified in the laser prophylaxis arm. METHODS: Comparison of initial retinal detachment (RD) surgical repair via PPV, SB, or PPV-SB with final anatomic success, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and number of surgical procedures. Secondary analysis was performed looking at eyes failing their initial SB, eyes with a GRT at presentation, eyes failing RD repair within specific time intervals, and eyes where hyaloid was elevated during initial vitrectomy. An additional study arm examined the outcomes of final BCVA and the presence and timing of developing a retinal tear or RD in eyes who received laser prophylaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, Surgical repair techniques (PPV, SB, PPV-SB), Number of Surgeries, Anatomical retinal reattachment success. RESULTS: Initial scleral buckle (SB) had statistically significant better final BCVA (p<0.01) and better final anatomic success (p<0.01). No statistical difference in the number of surgeries needed to achieve anatomic success between the initial SB versus initial PPV-SB/PPV. Hyaloidal elevation during the initial vitrectomy was associated with improved final BCVA and higher final anatomic success without the use of silicone oil (p <0.01 and 0.04 respectively). Lastly, eyes who developed RDs after laser prophylaxis had better final BCVA compared to untreated eyes (p 0.05). CONCLUSION: Initial SB yields better overall outcomes in SOEV presenting with RRD. Stickler Type-1 patients had similar outcomes compared to other SOEV, suggesting both populations should be treated with similar approaches.",

METHODS: A total of 14 patients, diagnosed by clinical criteria, were included. The following variables were evaluated: age, gender, ocular background, follow-up, initial and final visual acuity (VA), optical prescription, prophylactic treatment, surgery and techniques performed. The risk age to suffer a RD, as well as cataracts, was determined by using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 5 men and 9 women, the median initial VA was 0.35, which was the same as the final VA. The median optical prescription was -9.5 D myopia. The median of follow-up was 7 years. Ocular background was 4 RD cases and 2 Lasik surgeries. The operations performed were 8 RD, 12 cataract, 2 glaucoma, 2 macular hole, and one endotropia. The median age of RD was 20 years and cataract 34 years. As regards surgical tecnique, 4 scleral buckle cases, and 4 scleral buckle+pars plana vitrectomy cases were formed. The prophylactic treatments performed were: one scleral buckle case, 4 endolaser photocoagulation, and one cryotherapy. Two of which presented with RD. CONCLUSION: In the series presented, retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome mainly occurs in the second decade of life, with cataracts mainly developing in the fourth decade.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Patching has been a mainstay in treating unilateral congenital cataract. However, its efficacy has not been rigorously assessed. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between patching and visual acuity in a cohort of children treated for unilateral congenital cataract. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (Infant Aphakia Treatment Study) of infants born from August 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008, who were treated with 1 of 2 treatments for unilateral congenital cataract and followed up to 5 years of age. Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2013, to March 1, 2016. INTERVENTIONS: Cataract extraction and randomization to receipt of an intraocular lens vs being left aphakic for the first 5 years of life. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Caregivers reported patching in the previous 48 hours in quarterly semistructured telephone interviews. The mean number of hours of patching per day was calculated from surgery to the first birthday (n = 92) and between 12 and 48 months of age (n = 102). Monocular optotype acuity was assessed at 41/2 years of age by a traveling examiner using the Aphakia Treatment Study HOTV protocol. RESULTS: The Infant Aphakia Treatment Study enrolled 114 children; 57 were randomized to each treatment group. At 41/2 years of age, optotype visual acuity was assessed in 112 children. The current analyses exclude an additional 3 children (2 who had adverse events that limited visual potential and 1 who had Stickler syndrome), leaving 109 total children analyzed (59 female [54.1%] and 92 white [84.4%]). Caregivers reported patching their children a mean (SD) of 3.73 (1.47) hours per day in the first year of life and 3.43 (2.04) hours per day thereafter. An association between reported patching and treatment was not identified (mean difference in first year, -0.29 hours per day; 95% CI, -0.90 to 0.33 hours per day; mean difference between 12 and 48 months of age, -0.40 hours per day; 95% CI, -1.20 to 0.40 hours per day). Visual acuity was associated with reported hours of patching in the first year of life (r = -0.32; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.13) and between 12 and 48 months of age (r = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.18). However, patching accounted for less than 15% of the variance in logMAR acuity at 41/2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results support the association of occlusion throughout the preschool years with improved visual acuity in infants treated for unilateral congenital cataract. However, similar visual outcomes were achieved with varying amounts of patching. These conclusions should be interpreted in the context of limitations related to generalizability from incomplete data collected in a clinical trial.

Typically, mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes lead to the defective formation or quantity of type I collagen, the principle matrix in these tissues. Molecular genetic studies have now elucidated multiple genetic subtypes of the disorder but little literature exists on the risk of retinal tears and detachments in OI. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first case of a child with a rare recessive type of OI, subtype VIII, resulting from a P3H1 (also known as LEPRE1) gene mutation presenting with bilateral giant retinal tears and the surgical challenges encountered in performing retinal detachment repair due to scleral thinning. The P3H1 gene encodes for prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 which is involved in the post-translational modification of not only collagen type I but also types II and V which when mutated may result in pathological posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and giant retinal tear detachments. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic analyses are increasingly important in such cases and may guide patient monitoring and potential prophylactic treatment, known to significantly reduce the probability of giant retinal tear detachments in other high-risk collagenopathies such as Stickler Syndrome Type I.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Stickler Syndrome (SS) is an inherited collagenopathy characterized by heterogenous orofacial, ocular, auditory, and skeletal abnormalities. The orofacial manifestations are variable and some patients present with cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The incidence of VPI in SS is poorly studied and no studies have compared the incidence of VPI between Type I (COL2A1) and Type II (COL11A1) SS. The objective of this study is to compare the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes and discuss the surgical techniques used to treat them. DESIGN: Single-institution, retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three children were diagnosed with SS between January 2003 and December 2018. Genetic testing results, genetics notes, craniofacial clinic notes, and operative reports were reviewed. Patients without genetic testing or craniofacial/otolaryngologic evaluation were excluded. Thirty-one patients met criteria and were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was VPI incidence. RESULTS: There were 18 patients with Type I SS and 13 with Type II SS. Five (16%) patients had VPI, 2 (11%) with Type I SS compared to 3 (23%) with Type II SS (P > .05). All patients with VPI underwent surgery with either sphincter pharyngoplasty (3) or pharyngeal flap (2). Two patients with Type II SS underwent revision sphincter pharyngoplasty, with one conversion to pharyngeal flap. CONCLUSION: VPI is common for patients with SS. In this study, there was no significant difference in the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which could be important for patient counseling and treatment planning.",

Radiographic and tomographic analyses were organized. METHODS: From a series of Stickler syndrome patients followed from early life to late childhood. Ten patients (6 boys and four girls of different ethnic origins were consistent with the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome type I ). Phenotypic characterization was the baseline tool applied for all patients and genotypic correlation was performed on four families RESULTS: A constellation of axial abnormalities namely; anterolateral ossification of the anterior longitudinal spinal ligament with subsequent fusion of two cervical vertebrae, early onset Forestier disease (progressive spinal hyperostosis with subsequent vertebral fusion on top of bridging osteophytes and \"Bamboo-like spine\" resembling ankylosing spondylitis) and severe premature spine degeneration were evident. Appendicular abnormalities in connection with generalized epiphyseal dysplasia were the underlying aetiology in patients with Intoeing gait and femoral anteversion, early onset severe osteoarthritis of the weight bearing joint. Remarkable trochleo-patellar dysplasia secondary to severe osteoarthritis causing effectively the development of patellar instability was additional pathology. Mutation of COL2A1 has been confirmed as the causative gene for Stickler syndrome type I CONCLUSION: We concluded that conventional radiographs and the molecular determination of a COL2A1 in patients with (Stickler syndrome type I) are insufficient tools to explain the reasons behind the tremendous magnitude of axial and appendicular skeletal abnormalities. We were able to modify the criteria of the clinical phenotype as designated by Rose et al in accordance with the novel axial and appendicular criteria as emerged from within our current study.",

Why were the probands initially considered to have eoHM but not Stickler syndrome (STL)? Methods: Probands and family members with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 were followed up and reexamined based on the criteria for STL. Further comprehensive examinations were conducted for patients with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. We performed comparisons between probands, affected family members with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. Results: Twelve probands (8.91+-4.03 years) and 14 affected family members (37.00+-11.18 years) with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, as well as 30 controls with eoHM but without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, were recruited. Among them, 25.0% of probands and 50.0% of affected family members met the diagnostic criteria for STL after reexamination. Posterior vitreous detachment/foveal hypoplasia (PVD/FH), hypermobility of the elbow joint (HJ), and vitreous opacity were more frequent in patients with eoHM with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 than in the controls (p = 1.40 x 10-5, 3.72 x 10-4, 2.30x 10-3, respectively). HJ was more common in the probands than in the affected family members (11/12 versus 3/14; p = 3.42 x 10-4), suggesting age-dependent manifestation. EoHM presented in all the probands and in 11/14 affected family members, suggesting that it is a more common indicator of STL than the previously described vitreoretinal abnormalities, especially in children. The rate of STL diagnosis could increase from 25.0% to 66.7% for probands and from 50.0% to 92.9% for affected family members if eoHM, PVD/FH, and HJ are added to the diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: In summary, it is not easy to differentiate STL from eoHM with routine ocular examination in outpatient clinics. Awareness of atypical phenotypes and newly recognized signs may be of help in identifying atypical STL, especially in children at eye clinics.",

Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis. RESULTS: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis. CONCLUSION: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of the disease process and may allow for future growth.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To review a series of infants with Robin sequence (RS) who underwent mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) at the authors' institution and document changes in pre- and postoperative laryngoscopy grades. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with RS who underwent MDO from March 2005 to June 2017 were identified. Patients were included if they had a preoperative polysomnogram confirming obstructive sleep apnea, had failed nonoperative airway management, had undergone MDO by the senior author (C.M.R.), and had complete documentation. Patients were excluded if they did not have a laryngoscopy performed (ie, tracheostomy dependent) or if there was insufficient information in their medical record. Variables included demographic data, operative information, and laryngoscopic details at 3 time points: before MDO (T0), at device removal (T1), and at latest follow-up laryngoscopy (T2). Descriptive statistics were computed. Significance was set at a P value less than .05. RESULTS: Twenty-two infants with RS underwent MDO during the study period and 13 of these met criteria for inclusion. Mean age at MDO (T0) was 19.6 +- 38.8 weeks. Mean ages at device removal (T1) and latest follow-up laryngoscopy (T2) were 28.2 +- 41.5 and 62.7 +- 49.6 weeks, respectively. Three patients had Stickler syndrome; the others had nonsyndromic RS. Mean apnea-hypopnea index was 23.6 +- 16.6 preoperatively and 0.3 +- 0.7 after MDO (P = .011). At T0, a grade IIb laryngoscopic view was most common (46.1%) and only 3 patients (23.1%) had a grade I view. At T1, most patients (69.2%) had a grade I view and only 2 (14.4%) had a grade of IIb or worse (P = .011). At T2, all but 1 patient had a grade I view. CONCLUSION: In addition to resolving obstructive apnea, MDO is associated with an improvement in the grade of laryngoscopic view.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

METHODS: The clinical data of 6 CCA patients, 1 male and 5 female, aged 7.5 (5-14) were analyzed. All cases had kyphoscoliosis, 2 in the thoracic segments and 4 in the thoracolumbar segments. The average scoliosis Cobb angle was 88.6 degrees (85 degrees-117 degrees). The average kyphosis Cobb angle was 93.6 degrees (75 degrees-123 degrees). All of the cases underwent internal fixation with pedicle screw and lamina hooks instrumentation, in which 4 cases underwent posterior Smith-Petersen osteotomy. The diagnosis was based on a constellation of clinical findings. The clinical manifestations included marfanoid habitus, flexion contractures of multiple joints (elbow, knee, hip, and finger), kyphoscoliosis, muscular hypoplasia, and abnormal pinnae (\"crumpled\" outer helices). Molecular genetic testing showed mutation in the fibrillin-2 (FBN2) gene encoding the extracellular matrix microfibril. Four cases were followed up for 6-9 months. RESULTS: After operation the average Cobb angle of the scoliosis and kyphosis were 37.6 degrees (35 degrees-52 degrees) and 38.6 degrees (28 degrees-54 degrees) immediately, with 62.3% and 68.7% curve correction respectively. Three cases got excellent synostosis of posterior lamina, 1 case underwent revision with lamina hook because the distal screw was loose and hurt the nerve root, and the other 2 cases lost follow-up. The patients' body appearance and pulmonary function were obviously improved. CONCLUSION: The characteristic clinical manifestation include severe and stiff kyphoscoliosis, difficult to correct , and enhanced Cobb angle, and pedicle dysplasia of vertebral pedicle leading to difficulty in installing screws. Smith-Petersen osteotomy is often necessary. CCA should be differentiated with Marfan syndrome (MFS), Stickler syndrome, Homocystinuria, and distal arthrogryposis, especially MFS.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To review clinical and epidemiologic data of orofacial clefts and to evaluate the efficacy and the impact of prenatal diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based retrospective study was carried out on data from the Congenital Malformations of Alsace Registry (France) between 1995 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 321 orofacial clefts were recorded (overall prevalence, 2.1 per 1000), divided into cleft lip (CL) or cleft lip palate (CLP) (204 cases) and cleft palate (117 cases). The cleft lip and cleft lip palate CL+-P sex-ratio was 1.87, whereas the CP sex-ratio was 1. CLs were more often unilateral than CLPs (79% versus 59%). CLs were unilateral in 79% of the cases (60/76), bilateral in 20% of the cases (15/76), and median in 1% (1/76); 55% of the unilateral CLs were right and 45% were left. CLPs were unilateral in 59% of the cases (76/128), bilateral in 39% of the cases (50/128), and median in 2% (2/128); 45% of the unilateral CLPs were right and 55% were left. The 117 CPs were divided into 50 clefts of the total palate (43%) and 67 clefts of the posterior palate (57%); 25 cases (21%) of Pierre Robin sequence were collected. Sixty-six percent of CL+-P (134/204) were associated with other congenital anomalies, including chromosome abnormality in 31 cases and identified monogenic syndrome or association in 12 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormalities were 16 cases of trisomy 13 and 7 cases of trisomy 18. No cases of 22q11.2 microdeletion or duplication were detected among CL+-P. Monogenic syndromes were identified in 6% (12/204) of CL+-P cases: Van der Woude syndrome (2 cases); CHARGE syndrome (2 cases); ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft/lip palate (EEC) syndrome (2 cases); branchiooculofacial (BOF) syndrome (1 case); Treacher-Collins syndrome (1 case); Nager syndrome (1 case); Goldenhar syndrome (1 case); holoprosencephaly spectrum (1 case); and Meckel syndrome (1 case). Forty-two percent of CPs (49/117) were associated with other congenital anomalies; chromosome abnormality was identified in 12 cases and monogenic syndrome was diagnosed in 14 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormality was 22q11 microdeletion (5 cases). Monogenic syndromes were recognized in 12% of the CP cases (14/117): fragile X syndrome (2 cases), Meckel syndrome (2 cases), Orofaciodigital syndrome type I (OFD1) (1 case), Stickler syndrome (1 case), Larsen syndrome (1 case), Kniest syndrome (1 case), Cornelia de Lange syndrome (1 case), thanatophoric dysplasia (1 case), other unknown bone chondrodysplasia (1 case), Fryns syndrome (1 case), fetal akinesia sequence (1 case), and Silver-Russel syndrome (1 case). Fifty-two percent of CL cases (106/204) were prenatally diagnosed. An increasing tendency was observed between the 1995-2000 and 2001-2006 periods with a detection rate increasing from 47% to 56%. During the whole period, only 1 case of CP was prenatally diagnosed. Eighty-two percent of all cases (263/321) were livebirths; 8 stillbirths were reported (2%); 50 syndromic or associated cases (16%) led to medical abortion (no termination of pregnancy was performed for isolated cleft). CONCLUSION: Orofacial clefts are a frequent malformation with a total prevalence of 2.1 per 1000 total births. Sonbographic prenatal diagnosis of orofacial clefts remains difficult with a mean detection rate about 50% for CL+-P and is extremely rare for CP. Associated malformations and genetic syndromes are frequent and require a systematic survey. This study also highlights the different pathogenic background of CL+-P compared to CP, regarding the sex-ratio and the proportion and type of associated malformations.",

A chromosomal abnormality was present in 12 cases, including three copy-number variations diagnosed by array CGH. Monogenic disorders were identified in nine cases, most often after birth. Fetuses with family history of micrognathia or Pierre Robin sequence had a favorable outcome. Prognosis was good for the fetuses without associated findings and normal chromosomal analysis, with the exception of one case with a postnatal diagnosis of mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly. Prognostic was poor for the fetuses with additional ultrasound anomalies, as only 5 out of 28 children had a good outcome. Prenatal diagnosis of micrognathia is an indicator of a possible fetal pathology justifying multidisciplinary management. Our study confirms the necessity of performing prenatal array CGH. Use of high-throughput gene sequencing in prenatal period could improve diagnostic performance, prenatal counseling, and adequate postnatal care.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a collagen disorder that can affect multiple organ systems. It is characterized by ocular abnormalities, hearing loss, midfacial hypoplasia, hypermobility, and joint abnormalities. The phenotypic expression of Stickler syndrome can vary among those affected. Since Stickler syndrome is a collagen disorder, it is possible to expect pregnancy complications similar to those reported in other collagen disorders. To our knowledge, there is only one case report in the literature on the management of pregnancy and delivery of a patient with Stickler syndrome. METHODS/CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old primigravid woman with a diagnosis of Stickler syndrome presented at 9 weeks gestation for prenatal genetic consultation. At 26, the patient had prophylactic laser therapy for lattice degeneration of the retina. At 32, she was found to be heterozygous for the c.1527 G>T variant in the COL2A1 gene, which is associated with ocular abnormalities and autosomal dominant form of Stickler syndrome. Subsequently, she desired to pursue prenatal diagnostic testing for the familial variant. The patient voiced that the results would impact pregnancy management. Amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks gestation. Results were negative for the maternal COL2A1 variant. Karyotype was normal (46, XX). RESULTS: A multidisciplinary team using a patient-centered approach including obstetrics, ophthalmology, maternal-fetal medicine, and genetics determined that there were no contraindications for vaginal delivery. At 39 weeks, the patient underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of data available regarding the maternal outcomes of women affected with collagen disorders, especially Stickler Syndrome. This case highlights the importance of accurate genetic diagnosis in the prenatal period and provides information to physicians caring for patients with Stickler syndrome.",

It may be an isolated occurrence or part of a more complex syndrome and it is associated with long-term respiratory, nutritional, and developmental difficulties. Stickler syndrome (SS) is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder estimated to affect approximately 1/7500 newborns. It is diagnosed clinically and, at present, there is no consensus on a minimal clinical diagnostic criterion. The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler syndrome with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group of patients by members of the cleft team. The patient had an acute unilateral hydrops, with a monolateral keratoconus. The ocular abnormalities included: severe myopia, abnormalities of the vitreous, and high risk of retinal detachment (with subsequent blindness). We report two extremely rare cases of prenatal diagnosis of PRS and SS, prematurely identified by prenatal ultrasonography and successively managed by oculists ophthalmogists.",

Hereditary vitreoretinopathies are characterised by an abnormal-appearing vitreous gel with associated retinal changes. In most of these eyes further ocular abnormalities can be diagnosed. A group of hereditary disorders is associated with characteristic systemic abnormalities. Allied conditions should be considered in the clinical diagnosis. Vitreoretinopathies are the most common cause of inherited retinal detachment. In most eyes primary vitrectomy is necessary, and disease-specific surgical treatment is discussed. ",

One predisposing factor for development of paediatric retinal detachment is suffering from hereditary vitreoretinal degeneration (e.g., Stickler syndrome, Wagner syndrome, Kniest dysplasia, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, congenital X-linked retinoschisis, Knobloch syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti, Norrie disease). Hereditary vitreoretinopathies are characterised by an abnormal-appearing vitreous gel with associated retinal changes. In most of these eyes further ocular abnormalities can be diagnosed. A group of hereditary disorders is associated with characteristic systemic abnormalities. Allied conditions should be considered in the clinical diagnosis. Vitreoretinopathies are the most common cause of inherited retinal detachment. In most eyes primary vitrectomy is necessary, and disease-specific surgical treatment is discussed. ",

Patients were divided into two categories: isolated PRS (group 1) and PRS plus, i.e. PRS as part of a more complex syndrome (group 2). A total of 74 patients with PRS were found, 29 (39%) males and 45 (61%) females of whom 47 (63.5%) could be categorised as isolated PRS and 27 (36.8%) as PRS plus. The most frequent diagnoses in patients with PRS plus were Stickler syndrome and the velocardiofacial syndrome. Ophthalmological and fluorescent in situ hybridisation of chromosome 22 investigations should therefore be performed in all patients, as soon as the diagnosis of PRS is established. Some form of airway treatment was necessary in the majority of patients (52 of 74), most could be treated conservatively with prone/lateral positioning and close observation. Endotracheal intubation was necessary in one child from group 1 versus five from group 2. Tracheostomy was performed in three children from group 1 and two from group 2. Feeding problems occurred in about 25% of all PRS patients and stunted growth was seen especially in boys with isolated PRS before the age of 10 months. CONCLUSION: In our series, 33% of patients with Pierre Robin sequence plus had Stickler and velocardiofacial syndromes. Conservative airway management was a sufficient treatment for respiratory problems in the majority of patients. Feeding and growth need special attention in patients with Pierre Robin sequence.",

We evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol, a standardized retinal prophylactic treatment developed to prevent retinal detachment arising from giant retinal tears in type 1 Stickler syndrome. DESIGN: Retrospective comparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty seven patients with type 1 Stickler syndrome. METHODS: Time to retinal detachment was compared between patients who received bilateral prophylaxis and untreated controls, with and without individual patient matching. Patients receiving unilateral prophylaxis (after fellow eye retinal detachment) were similarly compared with an appropriate control subgroup. Individual patient matching ensured equal age and follow-up between groups and that an appropriate control (who had not suffered a retinal detachment before the age at which their individually matched treatment patient underwent prophylactic treatment) was selected. Matching was blinded to outcome events. Individual patient matching protocols purposely weighted bias against the effectiveness of treatment. All treatment side effects are reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to retinal detachment and side effects occurring after prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: The bilateral control group (n = 194) had a 7.4-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 229) (hazard ratio [HR], 7.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.53-12.08; P<0.001); the matched bilateral control group (n = 165) had a 5.0-fold increased risk compared to the matched bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 165) (HR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.82-8.78; P<0.001). The unilateral control group (n = 104) had a 10.3-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 64) (HR, 10.29; 95% CI, 4.96-21.36; P<0.001); the matched unilateral control group (n = 39) had a 8.4-fold increased risk compared to the matched unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 39) (HR, 8.36; 95% CI, 3.24-21.57; P<0.001). No significant long-term side effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest global cohort of type 1 Stickler syndrome patients published, all analyses indicate that the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol is safe and markedly reduces the risk of retinal detachment.",

The purpose of this study was to survey pediatric retinal surgeon preferences for prophylactic treatment of Stickler syndrome patients. STUDY DESIGN: A voluntary, anonymous 27-question survey was developed by RedCap and distributed to the Association of Pediatric Retinal Surgeons. The survey was distributed on March 17, 2021. Results were tabulated on April 12, 2021 in Microsoft Excel. All surveys returned were included. RESULTS: Thirty-four (76% response rate) respondents completed the survey. Twenty-six (76%) reported primarily using prophylactic laser retinopexy, four (12%) preferred use of cryotherapy, and 12% reported using prophylactic scleral buckle. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the United States. and international pediatric retinal surgeons use laser retinopexy as the primary method of prophylactic treatment.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a collagen disorder that can affect multiple organ systems. It is characterized by ocular abnormalities, hearing loss, midfacial hypoplasia, hypermobility, and joint abnormalities. The phenotypic expression of Stickler syndrome can vary among those affected. Since Stickler syndrome is a collagen disorder, it is possible to expect pregnancy complications similar to those reported in other collagen disorders. To our knowledge, there is only one case report in the literature on the management of pregnancy and delivery of a patient with Stickler syndrome. METHODS/CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old primigravid woman with a diagnosis of Stickler syndrome presented at 9 weeks gestation for prenatal genetic consultation. At 26, the patient had prophylactic laser therapy for lattice degeneration of the retina. At 32, she was found to be heterozygous for the c.1527 G>T variant in the COL2A1 gene, which is associated with ocular abnormalities and autosomal dominant form of Stickler syndrome. Subsequently, she desired to pursue prenatal diagnostic testing for the familial variant. The patient voiced that the results would impact pregnancy management. Amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks gestation. Results were negative for the maternal COL2A1 variant. Karyotype was normal (46, XX). RESULTS: A multidisciplinary team using a patient-centered approach including obstetrics, ophthalmology, maternal-fetal medicine, and genetics determined that there were no contraindications for vaginal delivery. At 39 weeks, the patient underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of data available regarding the maternal outcomes of women affected with collagen disorders, especially Stickler Syndrome. This case highlights the importance of accurate genetic diagnosis in the prenatal period and provides information to physicians caring for patients with Stickler syndrome.",

Also, infantile-onset glaucoma associated with Stickler syndrome has been rarely reported and no reports exist that examine outcomes after glaucoma surgery. This study describes the clinical and genetic associations and the long-term outcomes of retinal detachment repair or glaucoma surgery in patients with Stickler syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, case series of patients with Stickler syndrome. Demographics, clinical features, genetic mutations, and long-term surgical outcomes of eyes that experienced retinal detachment or diagnosed with infantile-onset glaucoma were assessed. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were identified with a mean age of 13 years at presentation and followed for a mean of 6 years. Two-thirds were male. Genetic analysis was performed as part of routine examination in nine patients from eight families. All were identified as having variants in COL2A1, three of which were novel. Six eyes of six patients experienced retinal detachment. Fifty percent of eyes without prophylactic laser treatment experienced retinal detachment, whereas only 5% of eyes that underwent prophylactic therapy detached. Despite surgical intervention for retinal detachment, five eyes became phthisical. Five eyes of three patients were diagnosed with infantile-onset glaucoma. All five eyes required multiple glaucoma surgeries, and three eyes became phthisical. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the surgical challenges encountered in patients with Stickler syndrome. Additionally, infantile-onset glaucoma may be more prevalent than previously reported and presents a challenge in terms of management. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to provide optimal care to these patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome, also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, is an inherited progressive disorder of the collagen connective tissues. Manifestations include short-sightedness, cataracts, retinal problems leading to retinal detachment and possible blindness. This is principally the case among individuals with type 1 Stickler Syndrome. It is the most commonly identified inherited cause of retinal detachment in childhood. However, there is no consensus regarding best practice and no current guidelines on prophylactic interventions for this population. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of primary prophylactic interventions for the prevention of retinal detachment in previously untreated eyes without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome. The primary outcome of interest was retinal detachment post prophylaxis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was made of 11 databases of published and unpublished literature, which included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library. There was no restriction by language or date. The references of all included studies were checked for further relevant citations and authors of studies with potentially relevant data were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers double-screened all titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the search to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Both reviewers also independently extracted and quality assessed all included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1444 unique citations, of which four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The two principal studies were both retrospective cohort studies with control groups in populations with type 1 Stickler syndrome. One study evaluated 360  cryotherapy (n = 204) and the other focal or circumferential laser treatment (n = 22). Both studies reported a statistically significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment per eye between the groups receiving prophylaxis and the controls. However, both studies were subject to a high risk of bias. The results of the two supporting studies of Wagner-Stickler patients were either relatively inconsistent or unreliable. No study reported any major or long-term complications associated with the interventions. Despite the weaknesses of the evidence, the rate of retinal detachment in the intervention groups, especially the cryotherapy group, was lower than the rate either experienced in the study control groups or reported in other studies of untreated Stickler syndrome populations not exposed to prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Only 360  cryotherapy and focal and circumferential laser treatment have been evaluated for the type 1 Stickler syndrome population, and then only by a single retrospective, controlled, cohort study in each case. Both of these studies report a significant difference between intervention and control groups (principally no treatment) and no major or long-term side effects or complications. However, there is a high risk of bias within these two studies, so the relative effectiveness of either intervention is uncertain. FUTURE WORK: A service priority is to determine reliably the prevalence of Stickler syndrome, i.e. how many individuals have type 1 or type 2 Stickler syndrome, and their risk of retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. A non-randomised, prospective cohort comparison study, in which eligible participants are treated, followed-up and analysed in one of three study arms, for no treatment, laser therapy or cryotherapy, would potentially offer further certainty in terms of the relative efficacy of both prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis and cryotherapy versus laser therapy than is possible with the currently available data. Alternatively, continued follow-up and analysis of existing study data, and data collection from relevant sample populations, are required to assess the long-term risks of blindness, retinal detachment and prophylaxis.

The purpose of this study was to survey pediatric retinal surgeon preferences for prophylactic treatment of Stickler syndrome patients. STUDY DESIGN: A voluntary, anonymous 27-question survey was developed by RedCap and distributed to the Association of Pediatric Retinal Surgeons. The survey was distributed on March 17, 2021. Results were tabulated on April 12, 2021 in Microsoft Excel. All surveys returned were included. RESULTS: Thirty-four (76% response rate) respondents completed the survey. Twenty-six (76%) reported primarily using prophylactic laser retinopexy, four (12%) preferred use of cryotherapy, and 12% reported using prophylactic scleral buckle. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the United States. and international pediatric retinal surgeons use laser retinopexy as the primary method of prophylactic treatment. These results may serve as a benchmark for retinal surgeons less familiar with prophylactic treatment approaches. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina 2023;54:102-107.].",

Typically, mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes lead to the defective formation or quantity of type I collagen, the principle matrix in these tissues. Molecular genetic studies have now elucidated multiple genetic subtypes of the disorder but little literature exists on the risk of retinal tears and detachments in OI. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first case of a child with a rare recessive type of OI, subtype VIII, resulting from a P3H1 (also known as LEPRE1) gene mutation presenting with bilateral giant retinal tears and the surgical challenges encountered in performing retinal detachment repair due to scleral thinning. The P3H1 gene encodes for prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 which is involved in the post-translational modification of not only collagen type I but also types II and V which when mutated may result in pathological posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and giant retinal tear detachments. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic analyses are increasingly important in such cases and may guide patient monitoring and potential prophylactic treatment, known to significantly reduce the probability of giant retinal tear detachments in other high-risk collagenopathies such as Stickler Syndrome Type I.",

We evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol, a standardized retinal prophylactic treatment developed to prevent retinal detachment arising from giant retinal tears in type 1 Stickler syndrome. DESIGN: Retrospective comparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty seven patients with type 1 Stickler syndrome. METHODS: Time to retinal detachment was compared between patients who received bilateral prophylaxis and untreated controls, with and without individual patient matching. Patients receiving unilateral prophylaxis (after fellow eye retinal detachment) were similarly compared with an appropriate control subgroup. Individual patient matching ensured equal age and follow-up between groups and that an appropriate control (who had not suffered a retinal detachment before the age at which their individually matched treatment patient underwent prophylactic treatment) was selected. Matching was blinded to outcome events. Individual patient matching protocols purposely weighted bias against the effectiveness of treatment. All treatment side effects are reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to retinal detachment and side effects occurring after prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: The bilateral control group (n = 194) had a 7.4-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 229) (hazard ratio [HR], 7.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.53-12.08; P<0.001); the matched bilateral control group (n = 165) had a 5.0-fold increased risk compared to the matched bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 165) (HR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.82-8.78; P<0.001). The unilateral control group (n = 104) had a 10.3-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 64) (HR, 10.29; 95% CI, 4.96-21.36; P<0.001); the matched unilateral control group (n = 39) had a 8.4-fold increased risk compared to the matched unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 39) (HR, 8.36; 95% CI, 3.24-21.57; P<0.001). No significant long-term side effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest global cohort of type 1 Stickler syndrome patients published, all analyses indicate that the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol is safe and markedly reduces the risk of retinal detachment.",

Affected patients manifest ocular, auditory, articular, and craniofacial manifestations in varying degrees. Ocular symptoms include myopia, retinal detachment, cataract, and glaucoma. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the prevalence of ocular manifestations and the outcome of prophylactic treatment on reducing the risk of retinal detachment. METHOD: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed database. Information on the cross-study prevalence of myopia, retinal detachment, cataract, glaucoma, visual impairment, severity and age of onset of myopia and retinal detachments. Studies that reported on the outcome of prophylactic treatment against a control group were explored. RESULTS: 37 articles with 2324 individual patients were included. Myopia was found in 83% of patients, mostly of a moderate to severe degree. Retinal detachments occurred in 45% of patients. Generally, the first detachment occurred in the second decade of life in STL1 patients and later in STL2. Cataracts were more common in STL2 patients, 59% versus 36% in STL1. Glaucoma (10%) and visual impairment (blind: 6%; vision loss in one eye: 10%) were rare. Three studies reported on the effect of prophylactic treatment being protective. CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestations are common in Stickler patients, but the comparison between studies was difficult because of inconsistencies in diagnostic and inclusion criteria by different studies. Sight-threatening complications such as retinal detachments are common but although prophylactic therapy is reported to be effective in retrospective studies, evidence from randomized trials is missing.",

PATIENTS & METHODS: Ten patients from two different families with non-ocular Stickler syndrome (Stickler syndrome type 3) were included. Six members of the first family and four members of the second family participated in this study. Otorhinolaryngologic examinations were performed. Pure-tone and speech audiograms were obtained. Longitudinal analysis was performed. Psychophysical measurements, including loudness scaling, gap detection, difference limen for frequency and speech perception in noise were administered to assess cochlear function at a deeper level. RESULTS: Affected individuals in the first family were carriers of a heterozygous splice donor mutation in the COL11A2 gene. Affected individuals in the second family were carriers of a novel heterozygous missense mutation in COL11A2. Both families showed bilateral, non-progressive hearing impairment with childhood onset. The severity of the hearing impairment exhibited inter- and intrafamilial variability and was mostly mild to moderate. The results of the psychophysical measurements were similar to those previously published for DFNA8/12 (TECTA) and DFNA13 (COL11A2) patients and thus consistent with an intra-cochlear conductive hearing impairment.

                    "abstract": "Hearing loss in Stickler syndrome has received little attention due to the often more disabling ocular, orofacial and skeletal manifestations. Estimates suggest a global prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) ranging from 50 % to about 100 % though, depending on the underlying Stickler genotype. By performing extensive audiometric analysis in Stickler patients, we aimed to further elucidate the auditory phenotype. Twenty molecularly confirmed Stickler patients (age 10-62 year), of whom sixteen with type 1 Stickler syndrome (COL2A1 mutation) and four with type 2 Stickler syndrome (COL11A1 mutation) underwent an otological questionnaire, clinical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry and otoacoustic emission testing. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis of the audiograms was performed to assess progression. In type 1 Stickler syndrome, 75 % demonstrated hearing loss, predominantly in the high frequencies. No significant progression beyond presbyacusis was observed. All type 2 Stickler patients exhibited mild-to-moderate low- and mid-frequency SNHL and moderate-to-severe high-frequency SNHL. In both types, hearing loss was observed in childhood. Otoacoustic emissions were only detectable in 7/40 ears and had very low amplitudes, even in frequency bands with normal hearing on pure tone audiometry. Type 1 Stickler syndrome is characterized by a mild high-frequency SNHL, emerging in childhood and non-progressive. Absent otoacoustic emissions are a frequent finding. Patients with type 2 Stickler syndrome exhibit early-onset moderate SNHL affecting all frequencies with a sloping audiogram. Taking into account the visual impairment in many patients, we recommend regular auditory follow-up in patients with Stickler syndrome, especially in childhood. ",

DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals, including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing. Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography, and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants. RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately 28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding 95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive. It is less severe than that reported for types II and III Stickler syndrome linked to COL11A2 (OMIM 120290) and COL11A1 (OMIM 120280) mutations, respectively, or the closely related Marshall syndrome. This difference will be a useful discriminatory feature in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders.",

A bone biopsy showed evidence of reduced bone mass and bone turnover, such as reduced BV/TV (-43%), TbTh (-29%), and OS/BS (-48%), Ob.S/BS (-27%), and Oc/BS (-47%) compared to \"age-matched\" controls. Moreover, there was evidence that the mineralization process was severely disturbed. Quantitative backscattered electron imaging revealed that the bone mineralization density distribution (BMDD) of cancellous (Cn) as well as cortical (Ct) bone was shifted toward lower mineralization compared to a young control reference cohort. BMDD parameters of mean degree of mineralization, Cn Ca (-9.8%) and Ct Ca (-18.0%), were dramatically decreased. To the best of our knowledge this is the first clinical report describing bone biopsy findings in a boy with Stickler syndrome. Such a severe undermineralization of bone matrix might essentially contribute to the compromised mechanical competence of the skeleton found in this patient.",

Radiographic and tomographic analyses were organized. METHODS: From a series of Stickler syndrome patients followed from early life to late childhood. Ten patients (6 boys and four girls of different ethnic origins were consistent with the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome type I ). Phenotypic characterization was the baseline tool applied for all patients and genotypic correlation was performed on four families RESULTS: A constellation of axial abnormalities namely; anterolateral ossification of the anterior longitudinal spinal ligament with subsequent fusion of two cervical vertebrae, early onset Forestier disease (progressive spinal hyperostosis with subsequent vertebral fusion on top of bridging osteophytes and \"Bamboo-like spine\" resembling ankylosing spondylitis) and severe premature spine degeneration were evident. Appendicular abnormalities in connection with generalized epiphyseal dysplasia were the underlying aetiology in patients with Intoeing gait and femoral anteversion, early onset severe osteoarthritis of the weight bearing joint. Remarkable trochleo-patellar dysplasia secondary to severe osteoarthritis causing effectively the development of patellar instability was additional pathology. Mutation of COL2A1 has been confirmed as the causative gene for Stickler syndrome type I CONCLUSION: We concluded that conventional radiographs and the molecular determination of a COL2A1 in patients with (Stickler syndrome type I) are insufficient tools to explain the reasons behind the tremendous magnitude of axial and appendicular skeletal abnormalities. We were able to modify the criteria of the clinical phenotype as designated by Rose et al in accordance with the novel axial and appendicular criteria as emerged from within our current study.",

METHODS: We identified a family with 2 adults with polyarticular OA and a child with generalized arthralgia. General, musculoskeletal, ocular, and auditory evaluations were undertaken. Investigations included radiographs of symptomatic joints, analysis of serum inflammatory markers and joint fluid, and mutational analyses of the COL11A2 gene. RESULTS: The 3 affected individuals had normal stature, mild mid-face hypoplasia, and hearing impairment, but normal eyes. Radiographs of the affected adults showed severe polyarticular OA but did not reveal diagnostic evidence of an underlying skeletal dysplasia. However, the child's radiographs showed enlarged epiphyses with an advanced bone age. The combination of skeletal, facial, and auditory features together with the absence of ocular features indicated that they had otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia, also known as Stickler syndrome type III. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a mutation in the COL11A2 gene that encodes the pre-pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen that is involved in type II collagen fibrillogenesis. CONCLUSION: Early-onset polyarticular OA may occur in adults without a known or obvious underlying skeletal dysplasia. This study provides an approach to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia in such individuals.",

It has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is caused by mutations in COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2. We describe a family of Moroccan origin that consists of four children with Stickler syndrome, six unaffected children, and two unaffected parents who are distant relatives (fifth degree). All family members were clinically investigated for ear, nose, and throat; ophthalmologic; and radiological abnormalities. Four children showed symptoms characteristic of Stickler syndrome, including moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, moderate-to-high myopia with vitreoretinopathy, and epiphyseal dysplasia. We considered the COL9A1 gene, located on chromosome 6q13, to be a candidate gene on the basis of the structural association with collagen types II and XI and because of the high expression in the human inner ear indicated by cDNA microarray. Mutation analysis of the coding region of the COL9A1 gene showed a homozygous R295X mutation in the four affected children. The parents and four unaffected children were heterozygous carriers of the R295X mutation. Two unaffected children were homozygous for the wild-type allele. None of the family members except the homozygous R295X carriers had any signs of Stickler syndrome. Therefore, COL9A1 is the fourth identified gene that can cause Stickler syndrome. In contrast to the three previously reported Stickler syndrome-causing genes, this gene causes a form of Stickler syndrome with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This finding will have a major impact on the genetic counseling of patients with Stickler syndrome and on the understanding of the pathophysiology of collagens. Mutation analysis of this gene is recommended in patients with Stickler syndrome with possible autosomal recessive inheritance.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: It is understood that the National Health Service (NHS) commissioned service at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK has the largest cohort of Stickler syndrome patients in the paediatric age group worldwide with 240 registered children. Fifty-nine were assessed radiologically and for their genotypes. These radiographs were reviewed and 74 knee, 45 pelvic, and 47 spinal examinations were evaluated. RESULTS: Radiological features were noted in 45.9% of knee radiographs, 11.1% of pelvic radiographs, and 42.6% of spinal radiographs. The findings were reviewed in the light of each patient's specific genetic Stickler syndrome subtype. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of orthopaedic abnormalities overall in the present series is substantially below those published in previous smaller case series. This would support the more recent findings of an array of ocular only phenotypes of Stickler syndrome described in the literature.",

It can arise from a mutation in the collagen associated gene. We present a case of Stickler syndrome with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. CASE: A 10-years-old boy was referred to us with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment of the right eye. His family history included eye disease and a cleft palate. He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge. His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did a reattachment of the retina in the right eye. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric retinal detachment may indicate the presence of Stickler syndrome and a complete examination of the eye as well as a full family history must be obtained in such cases.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dwarfism is a common severe growth disorder, but the etiology is unclear in the majority of cases. Recombinant human growth hormone may be a treatment option, but it has limited efficacy. The currently known laboratory assays do not meet the precision requirements for clinical diagnosis. Here, we have constructed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of selected genes that are suspected to be associated with dwarfism for genetic screening. METHODS: Genetic screening of 91 children with short stature of unknown etiology was performed with the help of the NGS panel. All the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of 166 genes were included in the panel. To clarify the pathogenicity of these mutations, their clinical data were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The assay identified p.A72G, p.I282V, and p.P491S variants of the PTPN11 gene and a p.I437T variant of the SOS1 gene in 4 cases with Noonan syndrome. A frameshift mutation (p.D2407fs) of the ACAN gene was identified in a case of idiopathic short stature with moderately advanced bone age. A p.R904C variant of the COL2A1 gene was found in a patient, who was accordingly diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Severe short stature without limb deformity was associated with a p.G11A variant of HOXD13. In addition, we evaluated evidence that a p.D401N variant of the COMP gene may cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that syndromes, particularly Noonan syndrome, may be overlooked due to atypical clinical features. This gene panel has been verified to be effective for the rapid screening of genetic etiologies associated with short stature and for guiding precision medicine-based clinical management.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler syndrome with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group of patients by members of the cleft team. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of Stickler syndrome among the author's group of patients with Robin sequence, and to investigate the visual outcome among paediatric patients with Robin sequence and Stickler syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children (six male and two female) with Stickler syndrome and Robin sequence were referred to be followed up every 6 months in the Ophthalmologic Department because of high myopia at less than 10 years of age. Three patients came from the author's study group and five were referred by other cleft surgeons. They were examined with repeat ophthalmic and indirect fundus examinations including cycloplegic refraction, and slit lamp biomicroscope examinations. Laser photocoagulation (2 cases) treatment for retinal degeneration or operation (3 cases) for retinal detachment was performed once evidence of significant ophthalmologic finding was noted. RESULTS: Of the 91 cases of newborns with isolated cleft palate treated by the first author, eight patients had Robin sequence, and among these, three had Stickler syndrome. The prevalence of Stickler syndrome among this subgroup of patients was 37.5% (3/8). Among these three patients and the additional five referred by other cleft surgeons, the average spherical equivalents of the first cycloplegic refraction for the 16 eyes was -12.39+/-2.72 diopter (D) (range -8.75 to -18.5D). Of the eight patients, five did not need any therapy, two children had retinal degeneration in the left eye and retinal detachment in the right eye while one child had retinal detachment in the right eye only. Laser photocoagulation was performed in the two left eyes with retinal degeneration and was successful. Surgery was performed on the three eyes with retinal detachment, one was successful while two failed and the patients developed total blindness at ages four and six respectively. Out of these three children with retinal complications, only one child remained free of visual deterioration in both eyes during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Early identification of Stickler syndrome in children with Robin sequence by cleft surgeons is necessary to insure early referral to an ophthalmologist for detection of myopia, monitoring for retinal detachment, and prevention of visual complications.",

METHODS: Refractions were performed at 1 month and every 3 months postoperatively until age 4 years and then at ages 4.25, 4.5, and 5 years. The change in refraction over time was estimated by linear mixed model analysis. RESULTS: Intraocular lens implantation was completed in 56 eyes; 43 were analyzed (median age, 2.4 months; range, 1.0-6.8 months). Exclusions included 11 patients with glaucoma, 1 patient with Stickler syndrome, and 1 patient with an IOL exchange at 8 months postoperatively. The mean rate of change in a myopic direction from 1 month after cataract surgery to age 1.5 years was 0.35 diopters (D)/month (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.40 D/month); after age 1.5 years, the mean rate of change in a myopic direction was 0.97 D/year (95% CI, 0.66-1.28 D/year). The mean refractive change was 8.97 D (95% CI, 7.25-10.68 D) at age 5 years for children 1 month of age at surgery and 7.22 D (95% CI, 5.54-8.91 D) for children 6 months of age at surgery. The mean refractive error at age 5 years was -2.53 D (95% CI, -4.05 to -1.02). CONCLUSIONS: After IOL implantation during infancy, the rate of myopic shift occurs most rapidly during the first 1.5 years of life. Myopic shift varies substantially among patients. If the goal is emmetropia at age 5 years, then the immediate postoperative hypermetropic targets should be +10.5 D at 4 to 6 weeks and +8.50 D from 7 weeks to 6 months. However, even using these targets, it is likely that many children will require additional refractive correction given the high variability of refractive outcomes.",

Estimates suggest a global prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) ranging from 50 % to about 100 % though, depending on the underlying Stickler genotype. By performing extensive audiometric analysis in Stickler patients, we aimed to further elucidate the auditory phenotype. Twenty molecularly confirmed Stickler patients (age 10-62 year), of whom sixteen with type 1 Stickler syndrome (COL2A1 mutation) and four with type 2 Stickler syndrome (COL11A1 mutation) underwent an otological questionnaire, clinical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry and otoacoustic emission testing. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis of the audiograms was performed to assess progression. In type 1 Stickler syndrome, 75 % demonstrated hearing loss, predominantly in the high frequencies. No significant progression beyond presbyacusis was observed. All type 2 Stickler patients exhibited mild-to-moderate low- and mid-frequency SNHL and moderate-to-severe high-frequency SNHL. In both types, hearing loss was observed in childhood. Otoacoustic emissions were only detectable in 7/40 ears and had very low amplitudes, even in frequency bands with normal hearing on pure tone audiometry. Type 1 Stickler syndrome is characterized by a mild high-frequency SNHL, emerging in childhood and non-progressive. Absent otoacoustic emissions are a frequent finding. Patients with type 2 Stickler syndrome exhibit early-onset moderate SNHL affecting all frequencies with a sloping audiogram. Taking into account the visual impairment in many patients, we recommend regular auditory follow-up in patients with Stickler syndrome, especially in childhood. ",

No previous study has examined hip pain or abnormalities in a large series of patients with Stickler syndrome. The purpose of this study was to describe hip abnormalities and their correlation with age and chronic hip pain in a cohort of 51 patients followed at the National Institutes of Health. Ten percent of patients had protrusio acetabuli, 21% coxa valga, and 34% of adults had hip osteoarthritis. Sixty-three percent of all patients and 79% of adults had chronic hip pain. In addition, 16% of adult patients had a history of femoral head failure during youth. Arthritic changes and adult age were associated with hip pain. In summary, hip abnormalities are commonly observed in Stickler syndrome. Young patients require careful evaluation of hip pain, and regular screening of children with Stickler syndrome may be indicated for early detection of hip complications.",

Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1. In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series of patients with Stickler syndrome undergoing RD repair from 1999 to 2017 at the Long Island Vitreoretinal Consultants, New York. Retinal attachment status and visual acuity (VA) at 1-year and last follow-up were assessed. RESULTS: Successful reattachment was achieved in 28 of 29 eyes (97%) with an average of 2.3 surgeries (including silicone oil removal surgeries). Redetachment after the first surgery occurred in 13 eyes (45%). Mean Snellen VA at initial presentation, 1-year follow-up, and last follow-up were 20/289, 20/118 (P = .012), and 20/103 (P = .022), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic success can be achieved in most eyes. However, redetachments are common, and multiple surgeries are often required. Reasonable visual recovery is possible in many eyes.

RESULTS: Of the 316 usable replies, 95% of persons had eye problems (retinal detachment occurred in 60% of patients, myopia in 90%, and blindness in 4%); 84% had problems with facial structures such as a flat face, small mandible, or cleft palate; 70%, hearing loss; and 90%, joint problems, primarily early joint pain from degenerative joint disease. Treatment included cryotherapy and laser therapy for retinal detachment, repair of cleft palate, use of hearing and mobility aids, and joint replacements. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations of symptoms and signs among affected persons, even within the same family. There are delays in diagnosis, lack of understanding among family members, denial about the risk of serious eye problems, and joint disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome (STL) is an inherited progressive connective tissue collagen disorder. STL is the most common hereditary cause of retinal complications, retinal tears, and the development of retinal detachment (RD) in childhood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term anatomical and functional results of surgical treatment of retinal complications in children and adolescents affected by STL. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study was performed a cohort of children with STL who underwent retinal surgery between 2004 and 2021. RESULTS: The study group consisted of nine children; the mean age at the time of the retinal tear with/without retinal detachment was 7.2 (2-10) years, and the mean follow-up period was 9.6 (5-16) years. Pathogenic variants COL2A1 (5 children) and COL11A1 (3 children) were confirmed in our cohort. In total, we operated on 13 eyes, 11 eyes with complicated RD and two eyes with multiple retinal defects, but without RD. At the end of the follow-up period, an attached retina was achieved 77% (10 eyes) with or without silicone oil tamponade: cryopexy alone was successful in one eye (10%), scleral buckling (EB) in five eyes (50%), and vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade combined with EB in four eyes (40%). The mean number of surgeries was 2.3 per eye. The resulting best corrected visual acuity ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 in one eye, from 0.16 to 0.4 in two eyes, and from 0.5 to 1.0 in 7 eyes. CONCLUSION: Repair of retinal tears with/without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome often requires multiple surgeries with combinations of cryopexy, scleral buckling, and/or vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade. Treatment of the ocular complications arising from STL requires long-term comprehensive care.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dwarfism is a common severe growth disorder, but the etiology is unclear in the majority of cases. Recombinant human growth hormone may be a treatment option, but it has limited efficacy. The currently known laboratory assays do not meet the precision requirements for clinical diagnosis. Here, we have constructed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of selected genes that are suspected to be associated with dwarfism for genetic screening. METHODS: Genetic screening of 91 children with short stature of unknown etiology was performed with the help of the NGS panel. All the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of 166 genes were included in the panel. To clarify the pathogenicity of these mutations, their clinical data were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The assay identified p.A72G, p.I282V, and p.P491S variants of the PTPN11 gene and a p.I437T variant of the SOS1 gene in 4 cases with Noonan syndrome. A frameshift mutation (p.D2407fs) of the ACAN gene was identified in a case of idiopathic short stature with moderately advanced bone age. A p.R904C variant of the COL2A1 gene was found in a patient, who was accordingly diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Severe short stature without limb deformity was associated with a p.G11A variant of HOXD13. In addition, we evaluated evidence that a p.D401N variant of the COMP gene may cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that syndromes, particularly Noonan syndrome, may be overlooked due to atypical clinical features. This gene panel has been verified to be effective for the rapid screening of genetic etiologies associated with short stature and for guiding precision medicine-based clinical management.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Stickler Syndrome (SS) is an inherited collagenopathy characterized by heterogenous orofacial, ocular, auditory, and skeletal abnormalities. The orofacial manifestations are variable and some patients present with cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The incidence of VPI in SS is poorly studied and no studies have compared the incidence of VPI between Type I (COL2A1) and Type II (COL11A1) SS. The objective of this study is to compare the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes and discuss the surgical techniques used to treat them. DESIGN: Single-institution, retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three children were diagnosed with SS between January 2003 and December 2018. Genetic testing results, genetics notes, craniofacial clinic notes, and operative reports were reviewed. Patients without genetic testing or craniofacial/otolaryngologic evaluation were excluded. Thirty-one patients met criteria and were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was VPI incidence. RESULTS: There were 18 patients with Type I SS and 13 with Type II SS. Five (16%) patients had VPI, 2 (11%) with Type I SS compared to 3 (23%) with Type II SS (P > .05). All patients with VPI underwent surgery with either sphincter pharyngoplasty (3) or pharyngeal flap (2). Two patients with Type II SS underwent revision sphincter pharyngoplasty, with one conversion to pharyngeal flap. CONCLUSION: VPI is common for patients with SS. In this study, there was no significant difference in the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which could be important for patient counseling and treatment planning.",

As a result, it has been recommended that all patients with Stickler syndrome undergo routine echocardiography and have antibiotic prophylaxis prior to surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in a large cohort of UK patients with Stickler syndrome in whom the clinical diagnosis has been confirmed by molecular genetic analysis. Probands and pedigrees were identified from the Vitreoretinal Service database according to previously published criteria. Ophthalmic, skeletal, audiometric, and orofacial features were assessed. Affected individuals underwent a full cardiological examination including auscultation and two-dimensional echocardiography. Mutation analysis of the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes was carried out. Seventy-eight patients from 25 pedigrees were studied. Mutation analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis in every pedigree. No patient was found to have clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease and no patient had significant mitral or other valvular prolapse on echocardiography. These data from a large cohort of UK patients with proven Stickler syndrome do not suggest an increased incidence of mitral valve prolapse over and above that found in the general population. Routine echocardiography screening and use of preoperative antibiotics are unnecessary and should be reserved for those individual cases where there is clear clinical indication.",

Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.",

                    "abstract": "Purpose: Stickler syndrome is associated with the development of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD), and often presents with ocular, auditory, skeletal, and orofacial abnormalities. Molecular analysis has proven effective in diagnosis, confirmation and classification of the disease. We aimed to describe the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in genetic analysis of four Indian families with suspected Stickler syndrome. Methods: The index cases presented with retinal detachment with family history. Genetic analysis in the index case was performed by next-generation sequencing of inherited retinal degeneration genes, and validated by Sanger sequencing followed by co-segregation analysis in the other family members. Results: Twenty patients were included for the genetic analysis (15 males and 5 females from four families). Clinical details were available for 15 patients (30 eyes). Fourteen eyes (11 patients) developed RRD. In the 16 eyes without RRD, 8 underwent barrage laser to lattice degeneration and 8 were under observation. Disease segregating heterozygous mutations with pathogenic/likely pathogenic effect was identified in COL2A1 (c.4318-1G>A, c.141G>A, c.1221+1G>A for 3 families) and COL11A1 (c.1737+1 G>A for 1 family) gene. In addition to the mutation in the COL2A1 gene, a pathogenic heterozygous variant associated with risk for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) was identified in one member. Conclusion: NGS testing confirmed the presence of the causative gene for Stickler syndrome in the index case followed by evaluation of family members and confirmation of genetic and ocular findings. We believe that this may be the first such report of families with RRD from India.",

METHODS: A total of 14 patients, diagnosed by clinical criteria, were included. The following variables were evaluated: age, gender, ocular background, follow-up, initial and final visual acuity (VA), optical prescription, prophylactic treatment, surgery and techniques performed. The risk age to suffer a RD, as well as cataracts, was determined by using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 5 men and 9 women, the median initial VA was 0.35, which was the same as the final VA. The median optical prescription was -9.5 D myopia. The median of follow-up was 7 years. Ocular background was 4 RD cases and 2 Lasik surgeries. The operations performed were 8 RD, 12 cataract, 2 glaucoma, 2 macular hole, and one endotropia. The median age of RD was 20 years and cataract 34 years. As regards surgical tecnique, 4 scleral buckle cases, and 4 scleral buckle+pars plana vitrectomy cases were formed. The prophylactic treatments performed were: one scleral buckle case, 4 endolaser photocoagulation, and one cryotherapy. Two of which presented with RD. CONCLUSION: In the series presented, retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome mainly occurs in the second decade of life, with cataracts mainly developing in the fourth decade.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare surgical outcomes for syndromes with optically empty vitreous (SOEV) associated rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional, two-arm study of a single pediatric vitreoretinal surgeon's patients from a quaternary referral center with syndromes with optically empty vitreous was performed to examine visual and anatomic outcomes of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and laser prophylaxis. SUBJECTS: Patients identified either through slit lamp examination (presence of an optically empty or void space in the vitreous gel structure) or genetic testing. 56 eyes of 49 patients were identified in the retinal detachment arm. 60 eyes of 48 patients were identified in the laser prophylaxis arm. METHODS: Comparison of initial retinal detachment (RD) surgical repair via PPV, SB, or PPV-SB with final anatomic success, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and number of surgical procedures. Secondary analysis was performed looking at eyes failing their initial SB, eyes with a GRT at presentation, eyes failing RD repair within specific time intervals, and eyes where hyaloid was elevated during initial vitrectomy. An additional study arm examined the outcomes of final BCVA and the presence and timing of developing a retinal tear or RD in eyes who received laser prophylaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, Surgical repair techniques (PPV, SB, PPV-SB), Number of Surgeries, Anatomical retinal reattachment success. RESULTS: Initial scleral buckle (SB) had statistically significant better final BCVA (p<0.01) and better final anatomic success (p<0.01). No statistical difference in the number of surgeries needed to achieve anatomic success between the initial SB versus initial PPV-SB/PPV. Hyaloidal elevation during the initial vitrectomy was associated with improved final BCVA and higher final anatomic success without the use of silicone oil (p <0.01 and 0.04 respectively). Lastly, eyes who developed RDs after laser prophylaxis had better final BCVA compared to untreated eyes (p 0.05). CONCLUSION: Initial SB yields better overall outcomes in SOEV presenting with RRD. Stickler Type-1 patients had similar outcomes compared to other SOEV, suggesting both populations should be treated with similar approaches.",

DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twelve eyes of 191 patients 0 to 18 years of age undergoing surgical repair for RRD between 2001 and 2015 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months. METHODS: Patients were divided into 3 age groups (0-6 years, 7-12 years, and 13-18 years) and comparisons were made using bivariate and multivariate generalized estimating equation models. A mixed means model was used to examine visual acuity in each age group over time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete reattachment of the retina at final follow-up. RESULTS: Of 212 eyes, 166 (78%) achieved total reattachment at final follow-up. Mean follow-up was 36.3 months. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with Stickler syndrome was more likely to occur in the younger cohorts (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.91), whereas RRD associated with blunt trauma was more likely to occur in the oldest cohort (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4). Subtotal RRD was more likely to be repaired successfully than total RRD (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4; P = 0.0100), and eyes with previous vitreoretinal surgery were less likely to undergo successful repair (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.78; P = 0.0258). There was no significant difference between age groups in the rate of surgical success (P = 0.55). There was a significantly higher success rate with primary scleral buckle (SB; 63%; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) and combined SB plus pars plana vitrectomy (PPV; 68%; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1) compared with PPV alone (51%). CONCLUSIONS: Most pediatric patients with RRD achieved complete reattachment with surgery. Success was more common in patients with a subtotal RRD at presentation. Previous vitreoretinal surgery was a risk factor for failure. Younger patients were more likely to demonstrate RRD involving the macula, but there was no difference between age groups in successful reattachment at final follow-up. Primary PPV showed a lower rate of success than SB or combined SB plus PPV.",

It can arise from a mutation in the collagen associated gene. We present a case of Stickler syndrome with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. CASE: A 10-years-old boy was referred to us with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment of the right eye. His family history included eye disease and a cleft palate. He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge. His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did a reattachment of the retina in the right eye. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric retinal detachment may indicate the presence of Stickler syndrome and a complete examination of the eye as well as a full family history must be obtained in such cases.",

METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series. One hundred and four eyes of 99 consecutive nonselected pediatric patients undergoing primary SB were identified. Baseline factors recorded were demographics, presenting clinical examination findings, previous ocular surgery, predisposing factors. Intraoperative factors recorded were the type of buckle, number and distribution of retinal breaks, number of retinal quadrants detached, macular status (involved vs. uninvolved), the use of subretinal fluid drainage, and surgical complications. Anatomical reattachment rate at last follow-up. Subgroup analysis was carried out to identify any predisposing factors for failure of primary surgery, effect of age on outcome, intraoperative pathology, effect of posterior versus anterior SB, and redetachment and secondary-procedure complications specific to SB. RESULTS: The initial surgery was segmental SB alone in 87 eyes (83.6%). Retinal reattachment was achieved with 1 operation in 73% (76 of 104 eyes). Of the 28 cases that redetached, 14 eyes underwent a repeat SB procedure (success rate of this second operation: 85.7% [12 of 14 eyes]), 13 eyes underwent vitrectomy (success rate of this second operation: 38.4% [5 of 13 eyes]), and 1 case was not reoperated. Overall, the final success rate was 94% (98 of 104 eyes). Factors associated with a statistically significant increased risk of failure included more than one break; three or more quadrants of detachment; horseshoe tears; no breaks seen on preoperative examination; Stickler syndrome. CONCLUSION: In selected cases, primary SB is an effective treatment for pediatric, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a hereditary oculo-systemic disorder where patients are predisposed to retinal detachments which are often complex and challenging to manage. Significant progress has been made regarding the molecular genetics of the condition; however, there is little recent literature on surgery for retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome. Our aim is to describe a population of Stickler patients presenting to Moorfields Eye Hospital with detachment from 1986 to 2003. We looked at patient characteristics, characteristics of detachment, management and anatomical and functional outcomes. We also aim to compare this group from 1986 to 2003 with a past group of Stickler patients treated at Moorfields between 1965 and 1985, reported by (Billington et al. in Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 104:875-879, 1985). This comparison of 20-year matched cohorts examined patient characteristics, features of detachment, management and anatomical outcome in the two groups using the same definitions as the earlier authors. RESULTS: In the Stickler group from 1986 to 2003, complete re-attachment rate was 67% for primary scleral-buckle surgery, 84.2% for primary vitrectomy and 78.57% for all surgery in 30 eyes of 23 patients. Overall in this group there was an average increase in Logmar visual acuity of 0.33 and 0.32 in patients undergoing primary cryo-buckle and primary vitrectomy surgery respectively. When comparing the two groups using Fisher's exact test, we found that the group from 1986 to 2003 had significant improvement in re-attachment for detachments with multiple tears and for vitrectomy surgery, compared with the group from 1965 to 1985. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that despite complicated surgery and often multiple procedures, good anatomical outcomes were achieved as well as useful functional visual results after retinal detachment surgery in Stickler patients. It would also appear that when comparing the group of Stickler patients from 1986 to 2003 with the group from 1965 to 1985 improvements were seen in outcome from vitrectomy surgery and surgery for multiple breaks probably due to advances in technique and technology in vitreoretinal surgery, over the past 4 decades.",

                    "abstract": "Establishing a simple and effective mutation screening method is one of the most compelling problems with applying genetic diagnosis to clinical use. Because there is no reliable and inexpensive screening system, amplifying by PCR and performing direct sequencing of every coding exon is the gold standard strategy even today. However, this approach is expensive and time consuming, especially when gene size or sample number is large. Previously, we developed CEL nuclease mediated heteroduplex incision with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (CHIPS) as an ideal simple mutation screening system constructed with only conventional apparatuses and commercially available reagents. In this study, we evaluated the utility of CHIPS technology for genetic diagnosis in clinical practice by applying this system to screening for the COL2A1, WRN and RPS6KA3 mutations in newly diagnosed patients with Stickler syndrome (autosomal dominant inheritance), Werner syndrome (autosomal recessive inheritance) and Coffin-Lowry syndrome (X-linked inheritance), respectively. In all three genes, CHIPS detected all DNA variations including disease causative mutations within a day. Direct sequencing of all coding exons of these genes confirmed 100% sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate high sensitivity, high cost performance and reliability of this simple system, with compatibility to all inheritance modes. Because of its low technology, CHIPS is ready to use and potentially disseminate to any laboratories in the world.",

These disorders range from simple refractive disorder to severe disease that can lead to disability. Hence the interest of early screening. This study aims to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary management and of the need for ophthalmological examination in each deaf child. We conducted a prospective monocentric data collection from medical records of 200 children followed for hypoacousia from January 2014 to January 2015. Each child underwent complete ophthalmological examination, ENT examination and clinical examination. Data from 155 medical records were collected. Ocular involvement was found in 47 patients, reflecting a rate of 30.4%. Bilateral involvement was found in 45 patients. The main syndromic causes were: Usher syndrome (8 casess), Waardenbourg syndrome (5 cases), Alport syndrome (3 cases), Wolfram syndrome (2 cases), Goldenhar syndrome (3 cases), Cogan syndrome (3 cases), Franceschetti-Kleinsyndrome (1 case), Charge syndrome(1 case), otomandibular syndrome (1 case), Stickler syndrome(1 case), Alstrom syndrome (1 case), Refsum disease (1 case), Susac syndrome (1 case) and KID Syndrome (1 case). Screening for ocular involvement allowed to shorten the average length of cochlear implantation from 9 months to 3 months. There are numerous ocular and auditory involvements because of the embryological and cellular similarities of these two organs, including the retina and the inner ear. The diagnosis of these involvements is facilitated by the presence of facial dysmorphism; on the other hand, diagnosis is difficult when there are visual and auditory sensorineural involvements. Early diagnosis of ocular and auditory involvements allows for best psychomotor development and optimal social inclusion. Therefore multidisciplinary management is necessary to allow for the best psychomotor, orthophonic and visual rehabilitation.",

DESIGN:   Prospective review of two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment. PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty-two family members from two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment were examined. METHODS:   A full ophthalmic history and examination were performed, and DNA was analysed by linkage analysis and mutation screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Characterization of a causative hereditary gene mutation in each family. RESULTS:   All affected family members of one pedigree carried a C192A COL2A1 exon 2 mutation. None of the affected family members had early-onset arthritis, hearing abnormalities, abnormal clefting or facial features characteristic of classical Stickler syndrome. All affected members of the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy pedigree carried a 957delG FZD4 mutation. CONCLUSIONS:   Patients with retinal detachment and a positive family history should be investigated for heritable conditions associated with retinal detachment such as Stickler syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The absence of non-ocular features of Stickler syndrome should raise the possibility of mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1. Similarly, late-onset familial exudative vitreoretinopathy may appear more like a rhegmatogenous detachment and not be correctly diagnosed. When a causative gene mutation is identified, cascade genetic screening of the family will facilitate genetic counselling and screening of high-risk relatives, allowing targeted management of the pre-detachment changes in affected patients.",

Reported rates of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) vary from 8% to 64%, and need for secondary VPI surgery from 23% to 64%, with few studies providing long-term follow-up. The purpose of this study was to describe our institutional long-term experience with syndromic patients undergoing cleft palatoplasty. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients with syndromic diagnoses undergoing primary Furlow palatoplasty from 1975 to 2011. Outcomes included postoperative oronasal fistula (ONF) and need for secondary VPI surgery. Speech scores for verbal patients 5 years or older were collected via the Pittsburgh scale for speech assessment. Aggregate scores categorized the velopharyngeal mechanism as competent, borderline, or incompetent. Outcomes were analyzed by patient and operative factors. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were included with average age at repair of 20.7 months. Cleft type was 9% submucosal, 16% Veau class I, 50% class II, 12% class III, and 13% class IV. Forty-five syndromes were recorded, most commonly Stickler syndrome (n = 32) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [22q11.2DS (n = 19)]. Forty-four patients also had associated Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). The overall ONF rate was 4.5% and was highest in Veau class IV clefts (P = 0.048). Seventy-six patients were included in speech analysis, with an average age at last assessment of 10.4 years. Overall, 60.5% of patients had a competent velopharyngeal mechanism, 23.7% borderline, and 15.8% incompetent mechanism. Fifty percent of 22q11.2DS patients had borderline speech and none had competent speech, compared to 73.3% with Stickler syndrome (P = 0.01) and 71.4% of patients with associated PRS (P = 0.02). Secondary VPI surgery was performed in 11.4% of patients overall. Patients with PRS (13.6%) and with Stickler syndrome (15.6%) had secondary VPI surgery, compared to 31.6% of patients with 22q11.2DS (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates low rates of postoperative ONF after modified Furlow palatoplasty in syndromic patients. Speech outcomes were comparable to nonsyndromic patients at our institution, but patients with 22q11.2DS consistently had borderline-incompetent speech and a 3-fold higher incidence of secondary VPI surgery.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to unravel the genetic cause of medical problems in a 21-year-old woman, whose phenotypic presentation extended beyond Stickler syndrome and included enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and persistent microhematuria. METHODS AND RESULTS: After sequencing of clinical exome, a known de novo COL2A1 pathogenic variant (c.1833+1G>A, p.?) causative for Stickler syndrome and one paternally inherited pathogenic change in COL4A5 (c.1871G>A, p.Gly624Asp) causative for X-linked Alport syndrome were found. No pathogenic variants, including those within the SLC26A4 5' region (Caucasian EVA haplotype), explaining the development of EVA, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals a multilocus genomic variation in one individual and provides a molecular diagnosis of two HL syndromes that co-occur in the proband independent of each other. For the third entity, EVA, no etiological factor was identified. Our data emphasize the relevance of detailed clinical phenotyping for accurate genotype interpretation. Focus on broadening the phenotypic spectrum of known genetic syndromes may actually obscure patients with multiple molecular diagnoses.",

It can arise from a mutation in the collagen associated gene. We present a case of Stickler syndrome with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. CASE: A 10-years-old boy was referred to us with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment of the right eye. His family history included eye disease and a cleft palate. He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge. His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did a reattachment of the retina in the right eye. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric retinal detachment may indicate the presence of Stickler syndrome and a complete examination of the eye as well as a full family history must be obtained in such cases.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler syndrome with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group of patients by members of the cleft team. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of Stickler syndrome among the author's group of patients with Robin sequence, and to investigate the visual outcome among paediatric patients with Robin sequence and Stickler syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children (six male and two female) with Stickler syndrome and Robin sequence were referred to be followed up every 6 months in the Ophthalmologic Department because of high myopia at less than 10 years of age. Three patients came from the author's study group and five were referred by other cleft surgeons. They were examined with repeat ophthalmic and indirect fundus examinations including cycloplegic refraction, and slit lamp biomicroscope examinations. Laser photocoagulation (2 cases) treatment for retinal degeneration or operation (3 cases) for retinal detachment was performed once evidence of significant ophthalmologic finding was noted. RESULTS: Of the 91 cases of newborns with isolated cleft palate treated by the first author, eight patients had Robin sequence, and among these, three had Stickler syndrome. The prevalence of Stickler syndrome among this subgroup of patients was 37.5% (3/8). Among these three patients and the additional five referred by other cleft surgeons, the average spherical equivalents of the first cycloplegic refraction for the 16 eyes was -12.39+/-2.72 diopter (D) (range -8.75 to -18.5D). Of the eight patients, five did not need any therapy, two children had retinal degeneration in the left eye and retinal detachment in the right eye while one child had retinal detachment in the right eye only. Laser photocoagulation was performed in the two left eyes with retinal degeneration and was successful. Surgery was performed on the three eyes with retinal detachment, one was successful while two failed and the patients developed total blindness at ages four and six respectively. Out of these three children with retinal complications, only one child remained free of visual deterioration in both eyes during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Early identification of Stickler syndrome in children with Robin sequence by cleft surgeons is necessary to insure early referral to an ophthalmologist for detection of myopia, monitoring for retinal detachment, and prevention of visual complications.",

                    "abstract": "As a reaction to widespread poverty, a system of coercive welfare developed in Switzerland during the 19th century. Poverty was often thought to result from an individual's misconduct rather than from structural, economic or political circumstances. People whose lifestyle deviated from the desired norm or who were unable to make a living for themselves were subjected to so-called administrative detention at institutions such as workhouses and poorhouses. The excavation of the cemetery of the correctional facility/workhouse and asylum <<Realta>> in Cazis offered the opportunity to gain insight into the living conditions of a marginalized group of people and to shed light on aspects of coercive welfare that have hardly been addressed in historical studies. A comprehensive study of pathological alterations was used to assess possible physical causes and effects of administrative detention. Skeletal samples from regular contemporaneous cemeteries provided data for the general population and thus allowed us to detect peculiarities in the <<Realta>> assemblage. Possible cases of Stickler Syndrome, microcephaly, congenital syphilis, endemic hypothyroidism and disabilities secondary to trauma may have been the reason for the affected individuals' institutionalisation. The high prevalence of tuberculosis was linked to the socioeconomic status and the living conditions at the facility. Several cases of scurvy and osteomalacia may have resulted from various risk factors such as poverty, alcoholism, mental illness or institutionalisation. The fracture rates, especially of ribs, were extremely high. A large proportion of the fractures were incompletely healed and most likely occurred during detention due to interpersonal violence. Underlying diseases further contributed to the high fracture rates. This first study on skeletons from an institution of administrative detention in Switzerland demonstrated how pre-existing health conditions and the socioeconomic background contributed to the chance of being detained, and how detention led to further deterioration of health.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To review clinical and epidemiologic data of orofacial clefts and to evaluate the efficacy and the impact of prenatal diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based retrospective study was carried out on data from the Congenital Malformations of Alsace Registry (France) between 1995 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 321 orofacial clefts were recorded (overall prevalence, 2.1 per 1000), divided into cleft lip (CL) or cleft lip palate (CLP) (204 cases) and cleft palate (117 cases). The cleft lip and cleft lip palate CL+-P sex-ratio was 1.87, whereas the CP sex-ratio was 1. CLs were more often unilateral than CLPs (79% versus 59%). CLs were unilateral in 79% of the cases (60/76), bilateral in 20% of the cases (15/76), and median in 1% (1/76); 55% of the unilateral CLs were right and 45% were left. CLPs were unilateral in 59% of the cases (76/128), bilateral in 39% of the cases (50/128), and median in 2% (2/128); 45% of the unilateral CLPs were right and 55% were left. The 117 CPs were divided into 50 clefts of the total palate (43%) and 67 clefts of the posterior palate (57%); 25 cases (21%) of Pierre Robin sequence were collected. Sixty-six percent of CL+-P (134/204) were associated with other congenital anomalies, including chromosome abnormality in 31 cases and identified monogenic syndrome or association in 12 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormalities were 16 cases of trisomy 13 and 7 cases of trisomy 18. No cases of 22q11.2 microdeletion or duplication were detected among CL+-P. Monogenic syndromes were identified in 6% (12/204) of CL+-P cases: Van der Woude syndrome (2 cases); CHARGE syndrome (2 cases); ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft/lip palate (EEC) syndrome (2 cases); branchiooculofacial (BOF) syndrome (1 case); Treacher-Collins syndrome (1 case); Nager syndrome (1 case); Goldenhar syndrome (1 case); holoprosencephaly spectrum (1 case); and Meckel syndrome (1 case). Forty-two percent of CPs (49/117) were associated with other congenital anomalies; chromosome abnormality was identified in 12 cases and monogenic syndrome was diagnosed in 14 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormality was 22q11 microdeletion (5 cases). Monogenic syndromes were recognized in 12% of the CP cases (14/117): fragile X syndrome (2 cases), Meckel syndrome (2 cases), Orofaciodigital syndrome type I (OFD1) (1 case), Stickler syndrome (1 case), Larsen syndrome (1 case), Kniest syndrome (1 case), Cornelia de Lange syndrome (1 case), thanatophoric dysplasia (1 case), other unknown bone chondrodysplasia (1 case), Fryns syndrome (1 case), fetal akinesia sequence (1 case), and Silver-Russel syndrome (1 case). Fifty-two percent of CL cases (106/204) were prenatally diagnosed. An increasing tendency was observed between the 1995-2000 and 2001-2006 periods with a detection rate increasing from 47% to 56%. During the whole period, only 1 case of CP was prenatally diagnosed. Eighty-two percent of all cases (263/321) were livebirths; 8 stillbirths were reported (2%); 50 syndromic or associated cases (16%) led to medical abortion (no termination of pregnancy was performed for isolated cleft). CONCLUSION: Orofacial clefts are a frequent malformation with a total prevalence of 2.1 per 1000 total births. Sonbographic prenatal diagnosis of orofacial clefts remains difficult with a mean detection rate about 50% for CL+-P and is extremely rare for CP. Associated malformations and genetic syndromes are frequent and require a systematic survey. This study also highlights the different pathogenic background of CL+-P compared to CP, regarding the sex-ratio and the proportion and type of associated malformations.",

INTRODUCTION: The Stickler syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, characterised by ocular, orofacial and skeletal anomalies and/or auditory loss. Patients with Robin sequence features and respiratory complications are frequently diagnosed with the Stickler syndrome. The heterogeneous phenotypic manifestations may present a challenge for early clinical diagnosis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of the 98 patients with the Stickler syndrome, between November 1995 and June 2009. The data were compared to investigate their ocular alterations and association with the Robin sequence. To be included, patients had to present with the following triad: cleft palate, facial features (hypoplastic midface, micrognathia and prominent eyes) and ocular anomalies (myopia and/or abnormalities of the retina). RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of the patients presenting with Robin sequence features had been diagnosed with the Stickler syndrome. Ocular alterations were found in 50% of the patients. DISCUSSION: The Robin sequence may appear as an isolated condition or associated with other features, or else as part of other known syndromes. Currently, the diagnosis of the Stickler syndrome is based on clinical signs. Affected individuals eventually develop hearing loss, retinal detachment and blindness. The ophthalmological complications associated are usually progressive and can lead to blindness. CONCLUSION: Robin sequence may be an indicative sign of the Stickler syndrome. Early diagnosis is essential for specialised treatment, which is critical for preventing irreversible consequences of this pathology.",

RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of the patients presenting with Robin sequence features had been diagnosed with the Stickler syndrome. Ocular alterations were found in 50% of the patients. DISCUSSION: The Robin sequence may appear as an isolated condition or associated with other features, or else as part of other known syndromes. Currently, the diagnosis of the Stickler syndrome is based on clinical signs. Affected individuals eventually develop hearing loss, retinal detachment and blindness. The ophthalmological complications associated are usually progressive and can lead to blindness. CONCLUSION: Robin sequence may be an indicative sign of the Stickler syndrome. Early diagnosis is essential for specialised treatment, which is critical for preventing irreversible consequences of this pathology.",

INTRODUCTION: The Stickler syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, characterised by ocular, orofacial and skeletal anomalies and/or auditory loss. Patients with Robin sequence features and respiratory complications are frequently diagnosed with the Stickler syndrome. The heterogeneous phenotypic manifestations may present a challenge for early clinical diagnosis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of the 98 patients with the Stickler syndrome, between November 1995 and June 2009. The data were compared to investigate their ocular alterations and association with the Robin sequence. To be included, patients had to present with the following triad: cleft palate, facial features (hypoplastic midface, micrognathia and prominent eyes) and ocular anomalies (myopia and/or abnormalities of the retina).

METHODS: Patients with genetically confirmed STL with axial length >= 26 mm and controls matched for axial length were included. The following data were obtained from SD-OCT scans and fundus photography: choroidal and retinal thickness (respectively, CT and RT), peripapillary atrophy area (PAA), presence of posterior staphyloma (PS). RESULTS: Twenty-six eyes of 17 patients with STL and 25 eyes of 19 controls were evaluated. Compared with controls, patients with STL showed a greater CT subfoveally, at 1000 mum from the fovea at both nasal and temporal location, and at 2000 and 3000 mum from the fovea in nasal location (respectively, 188.7+-72.8 vs 126.0+-88.7 mum, 172.5+-77.7 vs 119.3+-80.6 mum, 190.1+-71.9 vs 134.9+-79.7 mum, 141.3+-56.0 vs 98.1+-68.5 mum, and 110.9+-51.0 vs 67.6+-50.7 mum, always P< 0.05). Furthermore, patients with STL showed a lower prevalence of PS (11.5% vs 68%, P< 0.001) and a lower PAA (2.2+-2.1 vs 5.4+-5.8 mm2, P=0.03), compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that high myopic patients with STL show a greater CT, a lower PAA and a lower prevalence of PS, compared with controls matched for axial length. These findings could be relevant for the development and progression of myopic maculopathy in patients with STL.",

Reported rates of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) vary from 8% to 64%, and need for secondary VPI surgery from 23% to 64%, with few studies providing long-term follow-up. The purpose of this study was to describe our institutional long-term experience with syndromic patients undergoing cleft palatoplasty. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients with syndromic diagnoses undergoing primary Furlow palatoplasty from 1975 to 2011. Outcomes included postoperative oronasal fistula (ONF) and need for secondary VPI surgery. Speech scores for verbal patients 5 years or older were collected via the Pittsburgh scale for speech assessment. Aggregate scores categorized the velopharyngeal mechanism as competent, borderline, or incompetent. Outcomes were analyzed by patient and operative factors. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were included with average age at repair of 20.7 months. Cleft type was 9% submucosal, 16% Veau class I, 50% class II, 12% class III, and 13% class IV. Forty-five syndromes were recorded, most commonly Stickler syndrome (n = 32) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome [22q11.2DS (n = 19)]. Forty-four patients also had associated Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). The overall ONF rate was 4.5% and was highest in Veau class IV clefts (P = 0.048). Seventy-six patients were included in speech analysis, with an average age at last assessment of 10.4 years. Overall, 60.5% of patients had a competent velopharyngeal mechanism, 23.7% borderline, and 15.8% incompetent mechanism. Fifty percent of 22q11.2DS patients had borderline speech and none had competent speech, compared to 73.3% with Stickler syndrome (P = 0.01) and 71.4% of patients with associated PRS (P = 0.02). Secondary VPI surgery was performed in 11.4% of patients overall. Patients with PRS (13.6%) and with Stickler syndrome (15.6%) had secondary VPI surgery, compared to 31.6% of patients with 22q11.2DS (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates low rates of postoperative ONF after modified Furlow palatoplasty in syndromic patients. Speech outcomes were comparable to nonsyndromic patients at our institution, but patients with 22q11.2DS consistently had borderline-incompetent speech and a 3-fold higher incidence of secondary VPI surgery.",

DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals, including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing. Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography, and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants. RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately 28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding 95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive. It is less severe than that reported for types II and III Stickler syndrome linked to COL11A2 (OMIM 120290) and COL11A1 (OMIM 120280) mutations, respectively, or the closely related Marshall syndrome. This difference will be a useful discriminatory feature in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Stickler Syndrome (SS) is an inherited collagenopathy characterized by heterogenous orofacial, ocular, auditory, and skeletal abnormalities. The orofacial manifestations are variable and some patients present with cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The incidence of VPI in SS is poorly studied and no studies have compared the incidence of VPI between Type I (COL2A1) and Type II (COL11A1) SS. The objective of this study is to compare the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes and discuss the surgical techniques used to treat them. DESIGN: Single-institution, retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three children were diagnosed with SS between January 2003 and December 2018. Genetic testing results, genetics notes, craniofacial clinic notes, and operative reports were reviewed. Patients without genetic testing or craniofacial/otolaryngologic evaluation were excluded. Thirty-one patients met criteria and were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was VPI incidence. RESULTS: There were 18 patients with Type I SS and 13 with Type II SS. Five (16%) patients had VPI, 2 (11%) with Type I SS compared to 3 (23%) with Type II SS (P > .05). All patients with VPI underwent surgery with either sphincter pharyngoplasty (3) or pharyngeal flap (2). Two patients with Type II SS underwent revision sphincter pharyngoplasty, with one conversion to pharyngeal flap. CONCLUSION: VPI is common for patients with SS. In this study, there was no significant difference in the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which could be important for patient counseling and treatment planning.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a collagen disorder that can affect multiple organ systems. It is characterized by ocular abnormalities, hearing loss, midfacial hypoplasia, hypermobility, and joint abnormalities. The phenotypic expression of Stickler syndrome can vary among those affected. Since Stickler syndrome is a collagen disorder, it is possible to expect pregnancy complications similar to those reported in other collagen disorders. To our knowledge, there is only one case report in the literature on the management of pregnancy and delivery of a patient with Stickler syndrome. METHODS/CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old primigravid woman with a diagnosis of Stickler syndrome presented at 9 weeks gestation for prenatal genetic consultation. At 26, the patient had prophylactic laser therapy for lattice degeneration of the retina. At 32, she was found to be heterozygous for the c.1527 G>T variant in the COL2A1 gene, which is associated with ocular abnormalities and autosomal dominant form of Stickler syndrome. Subsequently, she desired to pursue prenatal diagnostic testing for the familial variant. The patient voiced that the results would impact pregnancy management. Amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks gestation. Results were negative for the maternal COL2A1 variant. Karyotype was normal (46, XX). RESULTS: A multidisciplinary team using a patient-centered approach including obstetrics, ophthalmology, maternal-fetal medicine, and genetics determined that there were no contraindications for vaginal delivery. At 39 weeks, the patient underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of data available regarding the maternal outcomes of women affected with collagen disorders, especially Stickler Syndrome. This case highlights the importance of accurate genetic diagnosis in the prenatal period and provides information to physicians caring for patients with Stickler syndrome.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tube implants can lead to long-term decompensation of the cornea after decades, in particular in complicated childhood glaucoma, because of a variety of causes including contact between the tube tip and the corneal endothelium. The augmentation of a XEN implant with a Baerveldt (250) tube implant, introduced 2016 by Mermoud et al for refractory glaucoma in adult patients, may reduce this risk in children. In our retrospective study, we report on the XEN-augmented Baerveldt (250) tube implant in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with refractory childhood glaucoma who underwent XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation by a single surgeon (F.G.) between January 2016 and August 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. In this technique, a XEN tube was inserted under a standard scleral flap from outside into the anterior chamber and its outer end was connected to the Baerveldt (250) tube. The follow-up consisted of regular anterior and posterior segment examination with intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements using a hand-held slit lamp and a Perkins applanation tonometer and/or rebound tonometer (Icare). RESULTS: Ten cases (6 female individuals, 4 male individuals, median age 6 years) were operated using a XEN-augmented Baerveldt implant [aphakic glaucoma, primary congenital glaucoma, secondary congenital glaucoma (Peters anomaly), ectropion uveae, and Stickler syndrome were 4, 3, 1, 1, and 1]. Before surgery (XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation), median IOP was 31 mm Hg. At the last postoperative follow-up, the mean IOP was 18.5 mm Hg with a median follow-up period of 13 months (range, 3 to 21 mo). No shallow or flat anterior chamber was observed. In all cases, this technique could be performed without intraoperative complications. In 3 cases, however, a surgical revision was necessary. There was no prolonged postoperative hypotony or short-term corneal alteration. By using an S-shaped loop the original Baerveldt tube length could be preserved for potential future use. In a total of 6 out of 10 cases, the procedure was a complete success (IOP, <=20 mm Hg without additional medication). CONCLUSIONS: XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation was used for refractory pediatric glaucoma in which conventional surgery had already failed. A new additional modification using an S-shaped loop was introduced. Short-term IOP control seems promising, but long-term results are still pending and the long-term efficacy and safety must still be proven before this technique can be generally recommended.",

METHODS: Case report with fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population.",

METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series. One hundred and four eyes of 99 consecutive nonselected pediatric patients undergoing primary SB were identified. Baseline factors recorded were demographics, presenting clinical examination findings, previous ocular surgery, predisposing factors. Intraoperative factors recorded were the type of buckle, number and distribution of retinal breaks, number of retinal quadrants detached, macular status (involved vs. uninvolved), the use of subretinal fluid drainage, and surgical complications. Anatomical reattachment rate at last follow-up. Subgroup analysis was carried out to identify any predisposing factors for failure of primary surgery, effect of age on outcome, intraoperative pathology, effect of posterior versus anterior SB, and redetachment and secondary-procedure complications specific to SB. RESULTS: The initial surgery was segmental SB alone in 87 eyes (83.6%). Retinal reattachment was achieved with 1 operation in 73% (76 of 104 eyes). Of the 28 cases that redetached, 14 eyes underwent a repeat SB procedure (success rate of this second operation: 85.7% [12 of 14 eyes]), 13 eyes underwent vitrectomy (success rate of this second operation: 38.4% [5 of 13 eyes]), and 1 case was not reoperated. Overall, the final success rate was 94% (98 of 104 eyes). Factors associated with a statistically significant increased risk of failure included more than one break; three or more quadrants of detachment; horseshoe tears; no breaks seen on preoperative examination; Stickler syndrome. CONCLUSION: In selected cases, primary SB is an effective treatment for pediatric, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.",

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a hereditary oculo-systemic disorder where patients are predisposed to retinal detachments which are often complex and challenging to manage. Significant progress has been made regarding the molecular genetics of the condition; however, there is little recent literature on surgery for retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome. Our aim is to describe a population of Stickler patients presenting to Moorfields Eye Hospital with detachment from 1986 to 2003. We looked at patient characteristics, characteristics of detachment, management and anatomical and functional outcomes. We also aim to compare this group from 1986 to 2003 with a past group of Stickler patients treated at Moorfields between 1965 and 1985, reported by (Billington et al. in Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 104:875-879, 1985). This comparison of 20-year matched cohorts examined patient characteristics, features of detachment, management and anatomical outcome in the two groups using the same definitions as the earlier authors. RESULTS: In the Stickler group from 1986 to 2003, complete re-attachment rate was 67% for primary scleral-buckle surgery, 84.2% for primary vitrectomy and 78.57% for all surgery in 30 eyes of 23 patients. Overall in this group there was an average increase in Logmar visual acuity of 0.33 and 0.32 in patients undergoing primary cryo-buckle and primary vitrectomy surgery respectively. When comparing the two groups using Fisher's exact test, we found that the group from 1986 to 2003 had significant improvement in re-attachment for detachments with multiple tears and for vitrectomy surgery, compared with the group from 1965 to 1985. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that despite complicated surgery and often multiple procedures, good anatomical outcomes were achieved as well as useful functional visual results after retinal detachment surgery in Stickler patients. It would also appear that when comparing the group of Stickler patients from 1986 to 2003 with the group from 1965 to 1985 improvements were seen in outcome from vitrectomy surgery and surgery for multiple breaks probably due to advances in technique and technology in vitreoretinal surgery, over the past 4 decades.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to characterize airway problems, speech outcomes, and facial growth in patients with Stickler syndrome undergoing cleft palate repair. METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study was performed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on 25 patients with Stickler syndrome and 53 nonsyndromic patients with clefts of the secondary palate repaired between 1977 and 2000. Airway problems were characterized by the incidence of Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) and the necessity for surgical airway management. Speech was analyzed using the Pittsburgh weighted values for speech symptoms associated with velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI). Longitudinal anthropometric measurements represented up to 12 years of longitudinal cephalofacial growth. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients with Stickler syndrome were diagnosed with PRS, 55.6% of whom required surgical airway management. Conversely, 20.8% of nonsyndromic patients were diagnosed with PRS (P < 0.0001), 18% of whom required surgical intervention (P < 0.05). Speech outcomes were poorer in patients with Stickler syndrome with 40% demonstrating borderline VPI and 13.3% demonstrating VPI, compared with 21.8% and 9.1%, respectively, in the nonsyndromic group. Both groups exhibited significantly shallower upper and mid facial depths and wider upper facial breadths when compared with normal standards of facial growth. Although there was a tendency toward decreased facial depths in patients with Stickler syndrome relative to nonsyndromic patients, the differences were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Stickler syndrome show significant potential for early airway compromise and a poorer prognosis for speech outcome after cleft palate repair. Their cephalofacial growth does not differ significantly from that of nonsyndromic cleft palate patients.",

Also, infantile-onset glaucoma associated with Stickler syndrome has been rarely reported and no reports exist that examine outcomes after glaucoma surgery. This study describes the clinical and genetic associations and the long-term outcomes of retinal detachment repair or glaucoma surgery in patients with Stickler syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, case series of patients with Stickler syndrome. Demographics, clinical features, genetic mutations, and long-term surgical outcomes of eyes that experienced retinal detachment or diagnosed with infantile-onset glaucoma were assessed. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were identified with a mean age of 13 years at presentation and followed for a mean of 6 years. Two-thirds were male. Genetic analysis was performed as part of routine examination in nine patients from eight families. All were identified as having variants in COL2A1, three of which were novel. Six eyes of six patients experienced retinal detachment. Fifty percent of eyes without prophylactic laser treatment experienced retinal detachment, whereas only 5% of eyes that underwent prophylactic therapy detached. Despite surgical intervention for retinal detachment, five eyes became phthisical. Five eyes of three patients were diagnosed with infantile-onset glaucoma. All five eyes required multiple glaucoma surgeries, and three eyes became phthisical. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the surgical challenges encountered in patients with Stickler syndrome. Additionally, infantile-onset glaucoma may be more prevalent than previously reported and presents a challenge in terms of management. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to provide optimal care to these patients.",

Typically, mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes lead to the defective formation or quantity of type I collagen, the principle matrix in these tissues. Molecular genetic studies have now elucidated multiple genetic subtypes of the disorder but little literature exists on the risk of retinal tears and detachments in OI. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first case of a child with a rare recessive type of OI, subtype VIII, resulting from a P3H1 (also known as LEPRE1) gene mutation presenting with bilateral giant retinal tears and the surgical challenges encountered in performing retinal detachment repair due to scleral thinning. The P3H1 gene encodes for prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 which is involved in the post-translational modification of not only collagen type I but also types II and V which when mutated may result in pathological posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and giant retinal tear detachments. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic analyses are increasingly important in such cases and may guide patient monitoring and potential prophylactic treatment, known to significantly reduce the probability of giant retinal tear detachments in other high-risk collagenopathies such as Stickler Syndrome Type I.",

The augmentation of a XEN implant with a Baerveldt (250) tube implant, introduced 2016 by Mermoud et al for refractory glaucoma in adult patients, may reduce this risk in children. In our retrospective study, we report on the XEN-augmented Baerveldt (250) tube implant in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with refractory childhood glaucoma who underwent XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation by a single surgeon (F.G.) between January 2016 and August 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. In this technique, a XEN tube was inserted under a standard scleral flap from outside into the anterior chamber and its outer end was connected to the Baerveldt (250) tube. The follow-up consisted of regular anterior and posterior segment examination with intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements using a hand-held slit lamp and a Perkins applanation tonometer and/or rebound tonometer (Icare). RESULTS: Ten cases (6 female individuals, 4 male individuals, median age 6 years) were operated using a XEN-augmented Baerveldt implant [aphakic glaucoma, primary congenital glaucoma, secondary congenital glaucoma (Peters anomaly), ectropion uveae, and Stickler syndrome were 4, 3, 1, 1, and 1]. Before surgery (XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation), median IOP was 31 mm Hg. At the last postoperative follow-up, the mean IOP was 18.5 mm Hg with a median follow-up period of 13 months (range, 3 to 21 mo). No shallow or flat anterior chamber was observed. In all cases, this technique could be performed without intraoperative complications. In 3 cases, however, a surgical revision was necessary. There was no prolonged postoperative hypotony or short-term corneal alteration. By using an S-shaped loop the original Baerveldt tube length could be preserved for potential future use. In a total of 6 out of 10 cases, the procedure was a complete success (IOP, <=20 mm Hg without additional medication). CONCLUSIONS: XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation was used for refractory pediatric glaucoma in which conventional surgery had already failed. A new additional modification using an S-shaped loop was introduced. Short-term IOP control seems promising, but long-term results are still pending and the long-term efficacy and safety must still be proven before this technique can be generally recommended.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

                    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinical and radiographic records of patients with Stickler syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To describe thoracolumbar spinal abnormalities and their correlation with age and back pain among patients with Stickler syndrome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Stickler syndrome (hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathy) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by skeletal, ocular, oral-facial, cardiac, and auditory manifestations. Prevalence is approximately 1 in 10,000 (similar to that of Marfan syndrome). No one has investigated spinal abnormalities in a large series of patients. METHODS: A single-center evaluation of 53 patients from 24 families with Stickler syndrome (age range, 1-70 years) in a multidisciplinary genetics clinic. Thoracolumbar radiographs were analyzed for spinal abnormalities and correlation with age and back pain. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of patients had scoliosis, 74% endplate abnormalities, 64% Schmorl's nodes, 43% platyspondylia, and 43% Scheuermann-like kyphosis. Sixty-seven percent of patients and 85% of adults reported chronic back pain. Endplate abnormalities and Schmorl's nodes were associated with adult age; endplate abnormalities, Schmorl's nodes, and adult age were associated with back pain. Only one adult patient was free of spinal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal abnormalities are nearly uniformly observed in Stickler syndrome, progress with age, and are associated with back pain. Although common, scoliosis is generally self-limited (only one patient needed surgical treatment). Correct diagnosis of this syndrome facilitates early identification and management of other potentially severe systemic manifestations and genetic counseling for affected families. Moreover, recognition of Stickler syndrome allows accurate prognosis for skeletal abnormalities and anticipation of potential surgical complications.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To discuss the clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment of congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA). METHODS: The clinical data of 6 CCA patients, 1 male and 5 female, aged 7.5 (5-14) were analyzed. All cases had kyphoscoliosis, 2 in the thoracic segments and 4 in the thoracolumbar segments. The average scoliosis Cobb angle was 88.6 degrees (85 degrees-117 degrees). The average kyphosis Cobb angle was 93.6 degrees (75 degrees-123 degrees). All of the cases underwent internal fixation with pedicle screw and lamina hooks instrumentation, in which 4 cases underwent posterior Smith-Petersen osteotomy. The diagnosis was based on a constellation of clinical findings. The clinical manifestations included marfanoid habitus, flexion contractures of multiple joints (elbow, knee, hip, and finger), kyphoscoliosis, muscular hypoplasia, and abnormal pinnae (\"crumpled\" outer helices). Molecular genetic testing showed mutation in the fibrillin-2 (FBN2) gene encoding the extracellular matrix microfibril. Four cases were followed up for 6-9 months. RESULTS: After operation the average Cobb angle of the scoliosis and kyphosis were 37.6 degrees (35 degrees-52 degrees) and 38.6 degrees (28 degrees-54 degrees) immediately, with 62.3% and 68.7% curve correction respectively. Three cases got excellent synostosis of posterior lamina, 1 case underwent revision with lamina hook because the distal screw was loose and hurt the nerve root, and the other 2 cases lost follow-up. The patients' body appearance and pulmonary function were obviously improved. CONCLUSION: The characteristic clinical manifestation include severe and stiff kyphoscoliosis, difficult to correct , and enhanced Cobb angle, and pedicle dysplasia of vertebral pedicle leading to difficulty in installing screws. Smith-Petersen osteotomy is often necessary. CCA should be differentiated with Marfan syndrome (MFS), Stickler syndrome, Homocystinuria, and distal arthrogryposis, especially MFS.",

DESIGN: Retrospective case series study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 39 eyes of 25 patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome were studied. METHODS: All of the patients had mutations in the COL2A1 gene and were diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Cross-sectional OCT images, OCT angiography (OCTA), and en face OCT images were assessed. The ratio of the foveal inner retinal layer (fIRL) thickness to the parafoveal inner retinal layer (pIRL) thickness, the ratio of the foveal outer retinal layer (fORL) thickness to the parafoveal outer retinal layer (pORL) thickness, and the size of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) were determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The degree of foveal hypoplasia and the best-corrected visual acuity in patients with Stickler syndrome. RESULTS: A persistence of the inner retinal layers in the fovea with an fIRL/pIRL ratio >0.2 was present in 32 of the 39 eyes (82%). Optical coherence tomography angiography showed that the FAZ was smaller, 0 to 0.19 mm2, than that of normal eyes, in 25 eyes of 17 patients who underwent OCTA. There was no significant correlation between the visual acuities and the fIRL/pIRL ratios. CONCLUSIONS: A mild foveal hypoplasia with a persistence of the IRL is characteristic of eyes with Stickler syndrome. The visual acuities were not correlated with the fIRL/pIRL ratios.",

METHODS: Forty-six eyes of 26 patients with mutations in the COL2A1 gene underwent ultra-widefield FAF imaging. The eyes were categorized into three types; no signs of abnormal AF, predominantly hyperfluorescent AF (hyper-AF), and predominantly hypofluorescent AF (hypo-AF). Goldmann perimetry was performed on 34 eyes, and line-scan images of the abnormal AF lesions were obtained by swept-source optical coherence tomography in 4 eyes. RESULTS: Abnormal AF lesions were found in 37 eyes of 21 (80.7%) of the 26 patients. Hyper-AF was found in 15 eyes and hypo-AF was found in 22 eyes. The FAF changes corresponded with the funduscopically observed radial paravascular retinal degeneration. The average age at the examination was significantly younger in patients who had eyes with hyper-AF or no abnormal AF than in those with hypo-AF (12.8 vs. 28.4 years; P = 0.009). Abnormal AF-associated visual field defects were found in 5/10 (50%) eyes with hyper-AF and 17/18 (94%) eyes with hypo-AF.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the characteristics of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images and visual functions in eyes with Stickler syndrome using ultra-widefield FAF images. METHODS: Forty-six eyes of 26 patients with mutations in the COL2A1 gene underwent ultra-widefield FAF imaging. The eyes were categorized into three types; no signs of abnormal AF, predominantly hyperfluorescent AF (hyper-AF), and predominantly hypofluorescent AF (hypo-AF). Goldmann perimetry was performed on 34 eyes, and line-scan images of the abnormal AF lesions were obtained by swept-source optical coherence tomography in 4 eyes. RESULTS: Abnormal AF lesions were found in 37 eyes of 21 (80.7%) of the 26 patients. Hyper-AF was found in 15 eyes and hypo-AF was found in 22 eyes. The FAF changes corresponded with the funduscopically observed radial paravascular retinal degeneration. The average age at the examination was significantly younger in patients who had eyes with hyper-AF or no abnormal AF than in those with hypo-AF (12.8 vs. 28.4 years; P = 0.009). Abnormal AF-associated visual field defects were found in 5/10 (50%) eyes with hyper-AF and 17/18 (94%) eyes with hypo-AF. Hyper-AF changes tended to appear before retinal changes were detectable by fluorescein angiography. An absence of the ellipsoid zone and the outer nuclear layer and a thinning of the overall retinal thickness were found corresponding to the hypo-AF lesions in the swept source optical coherence tomography images. CONCLUSION: Abnormal FAF is characteristic of eyes with Stickler syndrome. Age-related alterations of the FAF was associated with visual field defects and disruption of the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To review clinical and epidemiologic data of orofacial clefts and to evaluate the efficacy and the impact of prenatal diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based retrospective study was carried out on data from the Congenital Malformations of Alsace Registry (France) between 1995 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 321 orofacial clefts were recorded (overall prevalence, 2.1 per 1000), divided into cleft lip (CL) or cleft lip palate (CLP) (204 cases) and cleft palate (117 cases). The cleft lip and cleft lip palate CL+-P sex-ratio was 1.87, whereas the CP sex-ratio was 1. CLs were more often unilateral than CLPs (79% versus 59%). CLs were unilateral in 79% of the cases (60/76), bilateral in 20% of the cases (15/76), and median in 1% (1/76); 55% of the unilateral CLs were right and 45% were left. CLPs were unilateral in 59% of the cases (76/128), bilateral in 39% of the cases (50/128), and median in 2% (2/128); 45% of the unilateral CLPs were right and 55% were left. The 117 CPs were divided into 50 clefts of the total palate (43%) and 67 clefts of the posterior palate (57%); 25 cases (21%) of Pierre Robin sequence were collected. Sixty-six percent of CL+-P (134/204) were associated with other congenital anomalies, including chromosome abnormality in 31 cases and identified monogenic syndrome or association in 12 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormalities were 16 cases of trisomy 13 and 7 cases of trisomy 18. No cases of 22q11.2 microdeletion or duplication were detected among CL+-P. Monogenic syndromes were identified in 6% (12/204) of CL+-P cases: Van der Woude syndrome (2 cases); CHARGE syndrome (2 cases); ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft/lip palate (EEC) syndrome (2 cases); branchiooculofacial (BOF) syndrome (1 case); Treacher-Collins syndrome (1 case); Nager syndrome (1 case); Goldenhar syndrome (1 case); holoprosencephaly spectrum (1 case); and Meckel syndrome (1 case). Forty-two percent of CPs (49/117) were associated with other congenital anomalies; chromosome abnormality was identified in 12 cases and monogenic syndrome was diagnosed in 14 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormality was 22q11 microdeletion (5 cases). Monogenic syndromes were recognized in 12% of the CP cases (14/117): fragile X syndrome (2 cases), Meckel syndrome (2 cases), Orofaciodigital syndrome type I (OFD1) (1 case), Stickler syndrome (1 case), Larsen syndrome (1 case), Kniest syndrome (1 case), Cornelia de Lange syndrome (1 case), thanatophoric dysplasia (1 case), other unknown bone chondrodysplasia (1 case), Fryns syndrome (1 case), fetal akinesia sequence (1 case), and Silver-Russel syndrome (1 case). Fifty-two percent of CL cases (106/204) were prenatally diagnosed. An increasing tendency was observed between the 1995-2000 and 2001-2006 periods with a detection rate increasing from 47% to 56%. During the whole period, only 1 case of CP was prenatally diagnosed. Eighty-two percent of all cases (263/321) were livebirths; 8 stillbirths were reported (2%); 50 syndromic or associated cases (16%) led to medical abortion (no termination of pregnancy was performed for isolated cleft). CONCLUSION: Orofacial clefts are a frequent malformation with a total prevalence of 2.1 per 1000 total births. Sonbographic prenatal diagnosis of orofacial clefts remains difficult with a mean detection rate about 50% for CL+-P and is extremely rare for CP. Associated malformations and genetic syndromes are frequent and require a systematic survey. This study also highlights the different pathogenic background of CL+-P compared to CP, regarding the sex-ratio and the proportion and type of associated malformations.",

METHODS: Case report with fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A giant retinal tear is defined as a full thickness break in the neurosensory retina that extends circumferentially for 3 or more clock hours around the retina in the presence of a posterior vitreous detachment. It is one of the more complex surgical scenarios that a retina surgeon can face. There is no consensus on the ideal surgical technique; however, the \"traditional\" approach has been to perform a combined procedure including lensectomy, scleral buckle and vitrectomy. OBJECTIVE: To report the outcome over 2 years of five patients with giant retinal tears managed with lens sparing, bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with giant retinal tears managed with lens sparing, bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle. Included in the analysis were age, lens status, etiology and size of the tear, pre- and postoperative visual acuity, anatomic success, tamponade used, laser or criopexy where recorded. RESULTS: Three patients had high myopia, one secondary to blunt trauma and one with Wagner-Stickler syndrome were included in the analysis. The size of the tear varied from 120-280 . Anatomic success was achieved in all patients. One patient developed proliferative vitreoretinopathy and was re-operated and the retina remained attached. CONCLUSIONS: In this group of selected patients, lens-sparing bimanual 23-gauge vitrectomy without scleral buckle seems a safe and effective option in the management of retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tears. Further prospective and comparative studies are warranted to establish the role of this technique in the treatment of patients with this complex pathology.",

DESIGN:   Prospective review of two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment. PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty-two family members from two extended Australian pedigrees with high rates of retinal detachment were examined. METHODS:   A full ophthalmic history and examination were performed, and DNA was analysed by linkage analysis and mutation screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:   Characterization of a causative hereditary gene mutation in each family. RESULTS:   All affected family members of one pedigree carried a C192A COL2A1 exon 2 mutation. None of the affected family members had early-onset arthritis, hearing abnormalities, abnormal clefting or facial features characteristic of classical Stickler syndrome. All affected members of the familial exudative vitreoretinopathy pedigree carried a 957delG FZD4 mutation. CONCLUSIONS:   Patients with retinal detachment and a positive family history should be investigated for heritable conditions associated with retinal detachment such as Stickler syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The absence of non-ocular features of Stickler syndrome should raise the possibility of mutations in exon 2 of COL2A1. Similarly, late-onset familial exudative vitreoretinopathy may appear more like a rhegmatogenous detachment and not be correctly diagnosed. When a causative gene mutation is identified, cascade genetic screening of the family will facilitate genetic counselling and screening of high-risk relatives, allowing targeted management of the pre-detachment changes in affected patients.",

DESIGN: Multifamily study. SETTING: Outpatient audiology and otolaryngology clinics at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Md. SUBJECTS: Forty-six affected individuals from 29 different families segregating Stickler syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical audiologic and otolaryngological examinations were performed on all individuals, including pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and middle ear immittance testing. Otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response, infrared video electronystagmography, and temporal bone computed tomography were performed on a subset of participants. RESULTS: The hearing loss was most often sensorineural in adults, and approximately 28 (60%) of the 46 adult patients had 2 or more thresholds greater than the corresponding 95th percentile values for an age-matched, otologically normal population. The hearing loss most often affected high frequencies (4000-8000 Hz) and was generally no more progressive than that due to age-related hearing loss. Type A(D) tympanograms (classification using the Jerger model), indicating hypermobile middle ear systems, were observed in 21 (46%) of the 46 affected individuals. Computed tomography of the temporal bones revealed no inner ear malformations in 19 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The hypermobile middle ear systems observed in ears with normal-appearing tympanic membranes represent a novel finding for Stickler syndrome and are likely to be a useful diagnostic feature for this disorder. The overall sensorineural hearing loss in type I Stickler syndrome is typically mild and not significantly progressive. It is less severe than that reported for types II and III Stickler syndrome linked to COL11A2 (OMIM 120290) and COL11A1 (OMIM 120280) mutations, respectively, or the closely related Marshall syndrome. This difference will be a useful discriminatory feature in the differential diagnosis of this group of disorders.",

Radiographic and tomographic analyses were organized. METHODS: From a series of Stickler syndrome patients followed from early life to late childhood. Ten patients (6 boys and four girls of different ethnic origins were consistent with the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome type I ). Phenotypic characterization was the baseline tool applied for all patients and genotypic correlation was performed on four families RESULTS: A constellation of axial abnormalities namely; anterolateral ossification of the anterior longitudinal spinal ligament with subsequent fusion of two cervical vertebrae, early onset Forestier disease (progressive spinal hyperostosis with subsequent vertebral fusion on top of bridging osteophytes and \"Bamboo-like spine\" resembling ankylosing spondylitis) and severe premature spine degeneration were evident. Appendicular abnormalities in connection with generalized epiphyseal dysplasia were the underlying aetiology in patients with Intoeing gait and femoral anteversion, early onset severe osteoarthritis of the weight bearing joint. Remarkable trochleo-patellar dysplasia secondary to severe osteoarthritis causing effectively the development of patellar instability was additional pathology. Mutation of COL2A1 has been confirmed as the causative gene for Stickler syndrome type I CONCLUSION: We concluded that conventional radiographs and the molecular determination of a COL2A1 in patients with (Stickler syndrome type I) are insufficient tools to explain the reasons behind the tremendous magnitude of axial and appendicular skeletal abnormalities. We were able to modify the criteria of the clinical phenotype as designated by Rose et al in accordance with the novel axial and appendicular criteria as emerged from within our current study.",

                    "abstract": "Procedures to relieve airway obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) include glossopexy, mandibular distraction, and tracheostomy. Previously, it has been suggested that the imbalance of the genioglossus insertion on the mandible could be responsible for the micrognathia, tongue elevation, and glossoptosis seen in PRS. We performed a retrospective study to determine the usefulness of subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth in PRS with airway problems. Between 1991 and 2005, 14 consecutive patients with PRS were treated with subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth performed at the British Columbia's Children's Hospital. There were 8 boys and 6 girls. Mean age at surgery was 15 weeks (range, 1-68 weeks). Postoperative follow-up ranged from 8 months to 13 years. Seven patients (4 boys and 3 girls) were successfully treated, and a tracheostomy was prevented. Fifty-five percent of the syndromic patients needed a tracheostomy, whereas 1 patient (33%) with isolated PRS needed a tracheostomy. The most common syndrome associated with PRS was Stickler syndrome. Five (72%) of the 7 patients who required a tracheostomy were boys. If conservative measures fail to relieve supraglottic airway obstruction seen in patients with PRS, a subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth can be an effective intervention in certain patients. It is a simple intervention with few complications and little morbidity. More investigations are mandatory to precisely define patient characteristics ideal for this intervention.",

                    "abstract": "The Stickler syndrome (SS) has been described as a \"hereditary progressive arthro-ophtalmopathy\" by Stickler in 1965, due to mutations on the collagen genes. Currently about 40 different genes have been identified which encode for at least 27 different collagens. The majority of mutations occur in the COL2A1 gene on chromosome 12q13 (SS type I). Mutations in COL11A1 are less frequent (SS type II). More recently, mutations in COL11A2 and in the COL9A1 gene have been reported with particular phenotypes. The main features of this autosomal inherited disease are ocular, auditory with orofacial abnormalities and early-onset osteoarthritis. We report the clinical presentation of an adult and his son, with a particular focus on the bone status of the father, radiography, bone densitometry and transiliac bone biopsy showing that he was suffering from osteoporosis. The lumbar bone mineral density was low with a Z-score at -2.9. Transiliac bone biopsy showed a dramatic decrease of trabecular bone volume (8.6%; Nl: 19.5+-4.9%), thin trabeculae and a disorganized trabecular network. A slight increase of osteoid parameters was observed. Bone resorption was markedly increased with an excessive number of active (TRAcP+) osteoclasts. The cortical width was normal, but a slight increase of cortical porosity was found. Osteoporosis has been rarely described in the SS. It might be useful to systematically perform a bone densitometry in all patients with SS and to discuss the indication of a transiliac bone biopsy in severe cases.",

Estimates suggest a global prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) ranging from 50 % to about 100 % though, depending on the underlying Stickler genotype. By performing extensive audiometric analysis in Stickler patients, we aimed to further elucidate the auditory phenotype. Twenty molecularly confirmed Stickler patients (age 10-62 year), of whom sixteen with type 1 Stickler syndrome (COL2A1 mutation) and four with type 2 Stickler syndrome (COL11A1 mutation) underwent an otological questionnaire, clinical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry and otoacoustic emission testing. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis of the audiograms was performed to assess progression. In type 1 Stickler syndrome, 75 % demonstrated hearing loss, predominantly in the high frequencies. No significant progression beyond presbyacusis was observed. All type 2 Stickler patients exhibited mild-to-moderate low- and mid-frequency SNHL and moderate-to-severe high-frequency SNHL. In both types, hearing loss was observed in childhood. Otoacoustic emissions were only detectable in 7/40 ears and had very low amplitudes, even in frequency bands with normal hearing on pure tone audiometry. Type 1 Stickler syndrome is characterized by a mild high-frequency SNHL, emerging in childhood and non-progressive. Absent otoacoustic emissions are a frequent finding. Patients with type 2 Stickler syndrome exhibit early-onset moderate SNHL affecting all frequencies with a sloping audiogram. Taking into account the visual impairment in many patients, we recommend regular auditory follow-up in patients with Stickler syndrome, especially in childhood. ",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the characteristics of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images and visual functions in eyes with Stickler syndrome using ultra-widefield FAF images. METHODS: Forty-six eyes of 26 patients with mutations in the COL2A1 gene underwent ultra-widefield FAF imaging. The eyes were categorized into three types; no signs of abnormal AF, predominantly hyperfluorescent AF (hyper-AF), and predominantly hypofluorescent AF (hypo-AF). Goldmann perimetry was performed on 34 eyes, and line-scan images of the abnormal AF lesions were obtained by swept-source optical coherence tomography in 4 eyes. RESULTS: Abnormal AF lesions were found in 37 eyes of 21 (80.7%) of the 26 patients. Hyper-AF was found in 15 eyes and hypo-AF was found in 22 eyes. The FAF changes corresponded with the funduscopically observed radial paravascular retinal degeneration. The average age at the examination was significantly younger in patients who had eyes with hyper-AF or no abnormal AF than in those with hypo-AF (12.8 vs. 28.4 years; P = 0.009). Abnormal AF-associated visual field defects were found in 5/10 (50%) eyes with hyper-AF and 17/18 (94%) eyes with hypo-AF. Hyper-AF changes tended to appear before retinal changes were detectable by fluorescein angiography. An absence of the ellipsoid zone and the outer nuclear layer and a thinning of the overall retinal thickness were found corresponding to the hypo-AF lesions in the swept source optical coherence tomography images. CONCLUSION: Abnormal FAF is characteristic of eyes with Stickler syndrome. Age-related alterations of the FAF was associated with visual field defects and disruption of the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells.",

We evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol, a standardized retinal prophylactic treatment developed to prevent retinal detachment arising from giant retinal tears in type 1 Stickler syndrome. DESIGN: Retrospective comparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty seven patients with type 1 Stickler syndrome. METHODS: Time to retinal detachment was compared between patients who received bilateral prophylaxis and untreated controls, with and without individual patient matching. Patients receiving unilateral prophylaxis (after fellow eye retinal detachment) were similarly compared with an appropriate control subgroup. Individual patient matching ensured equal age and follow-up between groups and that an appropriate control (who had not suffered a retinal detachment before the age at which their individually matched treatment patient underwent prophylactic treatment) was selected. Matching was blinded to outcome events. Individual patient matching protocols purposely weighted bias against the effectiveness of treatment. All treatment side effects are reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to retinal detachment and side effects occurring after prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: The bilateral control group (n = 194) had a 7.4-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 229) (hazard ratio [HR], 7.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.53-12.08; P<0.001); the matched bilateral control group (n = 165) had a 5.0-fold increased risk compared to the matched bilateral prophylaxis group (n = 165) (HR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.82-8.78; P<0.001). The unilateral control group (n = 104) had a 10.3-fold increased risk of retinal detachment compared to the unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 64) (HR, 10.29; 95% CI, 4.96-21.36; P<0.001); the matched unilateral control group (n = 39) had a 8.4-fold increased risk compared to the matched unilateral prophylaxis group (n = 39) (HR, 8.36; 95% CI, 3.24-21.57; P<0.001). No significant long-term side effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest global cohort of type 1 Stickler syndrome patients published, all analyses indicate that the Cambridge prophylactic cryotherapy protocol is safe and markedly reduces the risk of retinal detachment.",

The purpose of this study was to survey pediatric retinal surgeon preferences for prophylactic treatment of Stickler syndrome patients. STUDY DESIGN: A voluntary, anonymous 27-question survey was developed by RedCap and distributed to the Association of Pediatric Retinal Surgeons. The survey was distributed on March 17, 2021. Results were tabulated on April 12, 2021 in Microsoft Excel. All surveys returned were included. RESULTS: Thirty-four (76% response rate) respondents completed the survey. Twenty-six (76%) reported primarily using prophylactic laser retinopexy, four (12%) preferred use of cryotherapy, and 12% reported using prophylactic scleral buckle. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the United States. and international pediatric retinal surgeons use laser retinopexy as the primary method of prophylactic treatment. These results may serve as a benchmark for retinal surgeons less familiar with prophylactic treatment approaches. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina 2023;54:102-107.].",

Treatment included cryotherapy and laser therapy for retinal detachment, repair of cleft palate, use of hearing and mobility aids, and joint replacements. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations of symptoms and signs among affected persons, even within the same family. There are delays in diagnosis, lack of understanding among family members, denial about the risk of serious eye problems, and joint disease.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

Ocular abnormalities include: retinal detachment, glaucoma, premature cataracts, high myopia, optically empty vitreous cavities, and retinal pigmentary changes. Systemic signs include premature osteoarthritis and hearing loss, as well as numerous skeletal and facial malformations, such as maxillofacial hypoplasia and cleft palate. While many affected patients are diagnosed as children who exhibit obvious skeletal abnormalities, diagnosis can be delayed due to variable expressivity. In some cases, systemic problems may be mild or nonexistent. Thus, Stickler syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient who manifests a strong family history of premature cataracts, glaucoma, or retinal detachment. CASE REPORTS: Three patients representing three different generations within the same family manifested severe ocular manifestations of Stickler syndrome, and minimal systemic involvement: a 56-year-old woman, her 25-year-old son, and the first patient's 8-year-old grandson. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases highlight the need for appropriate vigilance in examining patients with a strong family history of common ocular disorders such as cataract, glaucoma, and retinal detachment.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare surgical outcomes for syndromes with optically empty vitreous (SOEV) associated rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional, two-arm study of a single pediatric vitreoretinal surgeon's patients from a quaternary referral center with syndromes with optically empty vitreous was performed to examine visual and anatomic outcomes of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and laser prophylaxis. SUBJECTS: Patients identified either through slit lamp examination (presence of an optically empty or void space in the vitreous gel structure) or genetic testing. 56 eyes of 49 patients were identified in the retinal detachment arm. 60 eyes of 48 patients were identified in the laser prophylaxis arm. METHODS: Comparison of initial retinal detachment (RD) surgical repair via PPV, SB, or PPV-SB with final anatomic success, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and number of surgical procedures. Secondary analysis was performed looking at eyes failing their initial SB, eyes with a GRT at presentation, eyes failing RD repair within specific time intervals, and eyes where hyaloid was elevated during initial vitrectomy. An additional study arm examined the outcomes of final BCVA and the presence and timing of developing a retinal tear or RD in eyes who received laser prophylaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, Surgical repair techniques (PPV, SB, PPV-SB), Number of Surgeries, Anatomical retinal reattachment success. RESULTS: Initial scleral buckle (SB) had statistically significant better final BCVA (p<0.01) and better final anatomic success (p<0.01). No statistical difference in the number of surgeries needed to achieve anatomic success between the initial SB versus initial PPV-SB/PPV. Hyaloidal elevation during the initial vitrectomy was associated with improved final BCVA and higher final anatomic success without the use of silicone oil (p <0.01 and 0.04 respectively). Lastly, eyes who developed RDs after laser prophylaxis had better final BCVA compared to untreated eyes (p 0.05). CONCLUSION: Initial SB yields better overall outcomes in SOEV presenting with RRD. Stickler Type-1 patients had similar outcomes compared to other SOEV, suggesting both populations should be treated with similar approaches.",

To date three genes, COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2, encoding the heterotypic type II/XI collagen fibrils present in vitreous and cartilage have been shown to have mutations that result in Stickler syndrome. As systemic features in this disorder are variable we have used an ophthalmic examination to differentiate those patients with a membranous vitreous phenotype associated with mutations in COL2A1, from other patients who may have mutations in other genes. Gene amplification and exon sequencing was used to screen 50 families or sporadic cases with this membranous phenotype, for mutations in COL2A1. Mutations were detected in 47 (94%) cases consisting of 166 affected and 78 unaffected individuals. We also demonstrate that the predominantly ocular form of type 1 Stickler syndrome is not confined to mutations in the alternatively spliced exon 2. Using splicing reporter constructs we demonstrate that a mutant GC donor splice site in intron 51 can be spliced normally; this contributed to the predominantly ocular phenotype in the family in which it occurred.",

In case 1, the proposita had Albright hereditary osteodystrophy which was inherited from her mother and type 1 Stickler syndrome which was a new mutation. The combination of manifestations from the two syndromes had resulted in initial diagnostic confusion. Diagnosis of the latter syndrome was made only following ophthalmic examination which documented the presence of a membranous vitreous anomaly characteristic of type 1 Stickler syndrome. Subsequent confirmation was achieved by mutation analysis of the COL2A1 gene. The propositus in case 2 inherited Treacher Collins syndrome paternally and type 2 Stickler syndrome maternally. The overlap of facial anomalies may have resulted in a more severe phenotype for the patient. The diagnosis of Stickler syndrome in the propositus was confirmed initially by vitreous assessment and later by demonstration of mutation in the COL11A1 gene. These two patients highlight the key role of vitreous examination and vitreoretinal phenotyping in the differential diagnosis of Stickler syndrome and its subtypes in cases where the clinical picture is complicated by double heterozygosity.",

METHODS: Nine members of the family agreed to be examined. All had complete clinical eye examinations. The proband and selected patients underwent color fundus photography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), automatic static white-on-white computerized perimetry, and electrophysiology assessment (flash ERG, multifocal(mf) ERG and dark adaptometry). A pedigree was constructed based on interviews with known affected subjects. Genomic DNA samples derived from venous blood were collected from all affected family members examined. RESULTS: Twenty-eight family members are affected. This family has the typical features of Wagner Syndrome, namely an empty vitreous cavity with veils, mild myopia and cataract. Four examined patients underwent vitreoretinal surgery due to abnormal peripheral vitreoretinal adhesions with peripheral retinal traction (n = 3). Retinal detachment was observed in 5 of the examined subjects. Four of them occurred between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Chorioretinal atrophy is also a frequent finding which results in moderate to severe visual field and advanced rod-cone dystrophy from younger ages, also confirmed by absence of scotopic function on dark adaptation. The macular dysfunction on mfERG was profound and of early onset. A heterozygous mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (c.4004-1G > A) was found.

In case 1, the proposita had Albright hereditary osteodystrophy which was inherited from her mother and type 1 Stickler syndrome which was a new mutation. The combination of manifestations from the two syndromes had resulted in initial diagnostic confusion. Diagnosis of the latter syndrome was made only following ophthalmic examination which documented the presence of a membranous vitreous anomaly characteristic of type 1 Stickler syndrome. Subsequent confirmation was achieved by mutation analysis of the COL2A1 gene. The propositus in case 2 inherited Treacher Collins syndrome paternally and type 2 Stickler syndrome maternally. The overlap of facial anomalies may have resulted in a more severe phenotype for the patient. The diagnosis of Stickler syndrome in the propositus was confirmed initially by vitreous assessment and later by demonstration of mutation in the COL11A1 gene. These two patients highlight the key role of vitreous examination and vitreoretinal phenotyping in the differential diagnosis of Stickler syndrome and its subtypes in cases where the clinical picture is complicated by double heterozygosity.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The aim of this study was to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2. RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5 years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation. At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del; p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.",

We evaluated the son of a consanguineous couple who presented with profound hypotonia and global developmental delay. Other features included sensorineural hearing loss, asymmetric astigmatism, and high myopia. Clinical whole-exome sequence analysis identified a homozygous missense variant in AMPD2 (NM_001257360.1:c.2201C > T, p.[Pro734Leu]) that has not been previously reported. Given the strong phenotypic overlap with PCH9, including the identification of the typical \"Figure 8\" appearance of the brainstem on neuroimaging, we suspect this variant was causative of the neurodevelopmental disability in this individual. An additional homozygous nonsense variant in COL11A1 (NM_001854.4:c.1168G > T, p.[Glu390Ter]) was identified. Variants in this alternatively spliced region of COL11A1 have been identified to cause an autosomal recessive form of Stickler syndrome type 2 characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and eye abnormalities, but without musculoskeletal abnormalities. The COL11A1 variant likely also contributed to the individual's phenotype, suggesting two potentially relevant genetic findings.

The augmentation of a XEN implant with a Baerveldt (250) tube implant, introduced 2016 by Mermoud et al for refractory glaucoma in adult patients, may reduce this risk in children. In our retrospective study, we report on the XEN-augmented Baerveldt (250) tube implant in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with refractory childhood glaucoma who underwent XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation by a single surgeon (F.G.) between January 2016 and August 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. In this technique, a XEN tube was inserted under a standard scleral flap from outside into the anterior chamber and its outer end was connected to the Baerveldt (250) tube. The follow-up consisted of regular anterior and posterior segment examination with intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements using a hand-held slit lamp and a Perkins applanation tonometer and/or rebound tonometer (Icare). RESULTS: Ten cases (6 female individuals, 4 male individuals, median age 6 years) were operated using a XEN-augmented Baerveldt implant [aphakic glaucoma, primary congenital glaucoma, secondary congenital glaucoma (Peters anomaly), ectropion uveae, and Stickler syndrome were 4, 3, 1, 1, and 1]. Before surgery (XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation), median IOP was 31 mm Hg. At the last postoperative follow-up, the mean IOP was 18.5 mm Hg with a median follow-up period of 13 months (range, 3 to 21 mo). No shallow or flat anterior chamber was observed. In all cases, this technique could be performed without intraoperative complications. In 3 cases, however, a surgical revision was necessary. There was no prolonged postoperative hypotony or short-term corneal alteration. By using an S-shaped loop the original Baerveldt tube length could be preserved for potential future use. In a total of 6 out of 10 cases, the procedure was a complete success (IOP, <=20 mm Hg without additional medication). CONCLUSIONS: XEN-augmented Baerveldt implantation was used for refractory pediatric glaucoma in which conventional surgery had already failed. A new additional modification using an S-shaped loop was introduced. Short-term IOP control seems promising, but long-term results are still pending and the long-term efficacy and safety must still be proven before this technique can be generally recommended.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Stickler Syndrome (SS) is an inherited collagenopathy characterized by heterogenous orofacial, ocular, auditory, and skeletal abnormalities. The orofacial manifestations are variable and some patients present with cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). The incidence of VPI in SS is poorly studied and no studies have compared the incidence of VPI between Type I (COL2A1) and Type II (COL11A1) SS. The objective of this study is to compare the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes and discuss the surgical techniques used to treat them. DESIGN: Single-institution, retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three children were diagnosed with SS between January 2003 and December 2018. Genetic testing results, genetics notes, craniofacial clinic notes, and operative reports were reviewed. Patients without genetic testing or craniofacial/otolaryngologic evaluation were excluded. Thirty-one patients met criteria and were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was VPI incidence. RESULTS: There were 18 patients with Type I SS and 13 with Type II SS. Five (16%) patients had VPI, 2 (11%) with Type I SS compared to 3 (23%) with Type II SS (P > .05). All patients with VPI underwent surgery with either sphincter pharyngoplasty (3) or pharyngeal flap (2). Two patients with Type II SS underwent revision sphincter pharyngoplasty, with one conversion to pharyngeal flap. CONCLUSION: VPI is common for patients with SS. In this study, there was no significant difference in the incidence of VPI between SS subtypes. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, which could be important for patient counseling and treatment planning.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most frequent diagnosis in patients with syndromic Pierre Robin sequence is Stickler syndrome, which may be complicated by congenital high myopia and substantial risk of retinal detachment. However, cases of Stickler syndrome with probable visual complications are rarely identified among this group of patients by members of the cleft team. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of Stickler syndrome among the author's group of patients with Robin sequence, and to investigate the visual outcome among paediatric patients with Robin sequence and Stickler syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children (six male and two female) with Stickler syndrome and Robin sequence were referred to be followed up every 6 months in the Ophthalmologic Department because of high myopia at less than 10 years of age. Three patients came from the author's study group and five were referred by other cleft surgeons. They were examined with repeat ophthalmic and indirect fundus examinations including cycloplegic refraction, and slit lamp biomicroscope examinations. Laser photocoagulation (2 cases) treatment for retinal degeneration or operation (3 cases) for retinal detachment was performed once evidence of significant ophthalmologic finding was noted. RESULTS: Of the 91 cases of newborns with isolated cleft palate treated by the first author, eight patients had Robin sequence, and among these, three had Stickler syndrome. The prevalence of Stickler syndrome among this subgroup of patients was 37.5% (3/8). Among these three patients and the additional five referred by other cleft surgeons, the average spherical equivalents of the first cycloplegic refraction for the 16 eyes was -12.39+/-2.72 diopter (D) (range -8.75 to -18.5D). Of the eight patients, five did not need any therapy, two children had retinal degeneration in the left eye and retinal detachment in the right eye while one child had retinal detachment in the right eye only. Laser photocoagulation was performed in the two left eyes with retinal degeneration and was successful. Surgery was performed on the three eyes with retinal detachment, one was successful while two failed and the patients developed total blindness at ages four and six respectively. Out of these three children with retinal complications, only one child remained free of visual deterioration in both eyes during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Early identification of Stickler syndrome in children with Robin sequence by cleft surgeons is necessary to insure early referral to an ophthalmologist for detection of myopia, monitoring for retinal detachment, and prevention of visual complications.",

                    "abstract": "Stickler syndrome is characterized by ophthalmic, articular, orofacial, and auditory manifestations. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is caused by mutations in COL2A1, COL11A1, and COL11A2. We describe a family of Moroccan origin that consists of four children with Stickler syndrome, six unaffected children, and two unaffected parents who are distant relatives (fifth degree). All family members were clinically investigated for ear, nose, and throat; ophthalmologic; and radiological abnormalities. Four children showed symptoms characteristic of Stickler syndrome, including moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss, moderate-to-high myopia with vitreoretinopathy, and epiphyseal dysplasia. We considered the COL9A1 gene, located on chromosome 6q13, to be a candidate gene on the basis of the structural association with collagen types II and XI and because of the high expression in the human inner ear indicated by cDNA microarray. Mutation analysis of the coding region of the COL9A1 gene showed a homozygous R295X mutation in the four affected children. The parents and four unaffected children were heterozygous carriers of the R295X mutation. Two unaffected children were homozygous for the wild-type allele. None of the family members except the homozygous R295X carriers had any signs of Stickler syndrome. Therefore, COL9A1 is the fourth identified gene that can cause Stickler syndrome. In contrast to the three previously reported Stickler syndrome-causing genes, this gene causes a form of Stickler syndrome with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This finding will have a major impact on the genetic counseling of patients with Stickler syndrome and on the understanding of the pathophysiology of collagens. Mutation analysis of this gene is recommended in patients with Stickler syndrome with possible autosomal recessive inheritance.",

                    "abstract": "Purpose: Stickler syndrome is associated with the development of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD), and often presents with ocular, auditory, skeletal, and orofacial abnormalities. Molecular analysis has proven effective in diagnosis, confirmation and classification of the disease. We aimed to describe the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in genetic analysis of four Indian families with suspected Stickler syndrome. Methods: The index cases presented with retinal detachment with family history. Genetic analysis in the index case was performed by next-generation sequencing of inherited retinal degeneration genes, and validated by Sanger sequencing followed by co-segregation analysis in the other family members. Results: Twenty patients were included for the genetic analysis (15 males and 5 females from four families). Clinical details were available for 15 patients (30 eyes). Fourteen eyes (11 patients) developed RRD. In the 16 eyes without RRD, 8 underwent barrage laser to lattice degeneration and 8 were under observation. Disease segregating heterozygous mutations with pathogenic/likely pathogenic effect was identified in COL2A1 (c.4318-1G>A, c.141G>A, c.1221+1G>A for 3 families) and COL11A1 (c.1737+1 G>A for 1 family) gene. In addition to the mutation in the COL2A1 gene, a pathogenic heterozygous variant associated with risk for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) was identified in one member. Conclusion: NGS testing confirmed the presence of the causative gene for Stickler syndrome in the index case followed by evaluation of family members and confirmation of genetic and ocular findings. We believe that this may be the first such report of families with RRD from India.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to unravel the genetic cause of medical problems in a 21-year-old woman, whose phenotypic presentation extended beyond Stickler syndrome and included enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and persistent microhematuria. METHODS AND RESULTS: After sequencing of clinical exome, a known de novo COL2A1 pathogenic variant (c.1833+1G>A, p.?) causative for Stickler syndrome and one paternally inherited pathogenic change in COL4A5 (c.1871G>A, p.Gly624Asp) causative for X-linked Alport syndrome were found. No pathogenic variants, including those within the SLC26A4 5' region (Caucasian EVA haplotype), explaining the development of EVA, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals a multilocus genomic variation in one individual and provides a molecular diagnosis of two HL syndromes that co-occur in the proband independent of each other. For the third entity, EVA, no etiological factor was identified. Our data emphasize the relevance of detailed clinical phenotyping for accurate genotype interpretation. Focus on broadening the phenotypic spectrum of known genetic syndromes may actually obscure patients with multiple molecular diagnoses.",

                    "abstract": "Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is an important craniofacial anomaly that can be seen as an isolated finding or manifestation of multiple syndromes. 22q11.2 deletion and Stickler syndrome are cited as the two most common conditions associated with PRS, but their frequencies are debated. We performed a retrospective study of 66 patients with PRS and reviewed their genetic testing, diagnoses, and clinical findings. The case series is complemented by a comprehensive literature review of the nature and frequency of genetic diagnosis in PRS. In our cohort 65% of patients had associated anomalies; of these, a genetic diagnosis was established in 56%. Stickler syndrome was the most common diagnosis, comprising approximately 11% of all cases, followed by Treacher Collins syndrome (9%). The frequency of 22q11.2 deletion was 1.5%. Chromosome arrays, performed for 72% of idiopathic PRS with associated anomalies, revealed two cases of 18q22 qter deletion, a region not previously reported in association with PRS. A review of the cytogenetic anomalies identified in this population supports an association between the 4q33-qter, 17q24.3, 2q33.1, and 11q23 chromosomal loci and PRS. We found a low frequency of 22q11.2 deletion in PRS, suggesting it is less commonly implicated in this malformation. Our data also indicate a higher frequency of cytogenetic anomalies in PRS patients with associated anomalies, and a potential new link with the 18q22 qter locus. The present findings underscore the utility of chromosomal microarrays in cases of PRS with associated anomalies and suggest that delaying testing for apparently isolated cases should be considered.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Stickler syndrome is a collagenopathy that is typically COL2A1-related (autosomal dominant) and less commonly related to other collagen gene mutations. Diagnosis is straightforward when a child has myopia or retinal detachment in the setting of classic diagnostic criteria such as hearing impairment, midfacial hypoplasia, and arthropathy. However, some children have primarily ocular disease with mild or no extraocular features. Such children can remain undiagnosed unless suspicion is raised by the ophthalmologist. METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series (2014-2016) of children (<12 years old) suspected to have Stickler syndrome type collagenopathy by a single ophthalmologist and able to complete genetic testing for this possibility. Suspicion was based on vitreous abnormalities and myopia or lens opacities in the setting of prior retinal detachment, hearing impairment, or facial flatness. RESULTS: Average age of the 12 identified children was 8 years old (range 3-11; five boys). Average spherical equivalent for phakic eyes was -13 (range -3.5 to -30). Nine children had lens opacities or aphakia; two with aphakia also had lens subluxation or iridodonesis. Other recurrent clinical features included flat facies (12/12), hearing impairment (5/12), and prior retinal detachment (4/12). Pathogenic variants for collagenopathy were uncovered in 10/12 children: COL11A1 (heterozygous) in six, COL2A1 (heterozygous) in two, and COL9A1 (homozygous) in two. One child was homozygous for pathogenic variation in LRPAP1. One child had no detectable gene mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these clinical features (particularly vitreous abnormality, myopia, and lens opacity) had a high molecular yield for collagen gene mutation. Ophthalmologists who see such children should suspect Stickler syndrome, even in the absence of overt systemic disease. COL11A1-related rather than COL2A1-related autosomal dominant disease may be more common when undiagnosed children are identified based on ocular examination. Biallelic mutations in LRPAP1 can result in a phenotype that may resemble Stickler syndrome.",

METHODS: Histological and electron microscopic examinations were performed on the enucleated globe from the proband of a pedigree with type 1 Stickler syndrome. Linkage analysis was carried out using polymorphic markers flanking the COL2A1 gene and the mutation was identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The significant retinal abnormality was incarceration of vitreous collagen within glial strands on the inner surface of an atrophic and gliotic detached retina. The incarcerated collagenous layers contained glial cells and extended from the retina to form strands, some of which contributed to a retrolental membrane. Mutation screening detected a C to T mutation in exon 47 that inserted a premature termination codon into the reading frame of the mRNA. Sequence analysis of three of the four affected children confirmed that they were also heterozygous for the base change. The youngest child's DNA was not analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The study represents the first evidence of abnormal interactions between pathological vitreous collagen and the inner retina in a patient with type 1 Stickler syndrome with a confirmed mutation in the COL2A1 gene.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report the myopic shift at 5 years of age after cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation for infants enrolled in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS). METHODS: Refractions were performed at 1 month and every 3 months postoperatively until age 4 years and then at ages 4.25, 4.5, and 5 years. The change in refraction over time was estimated by linear mixed model analysis. RESULTS: Intraocular lens implantation was completed in 56 eyes; 43 were analyzed (median age, 2.4 months; range, 1.0-6.8 months). Exclusions included 11 patients with glaucoma, 1 patient with Stickler syndrome, and 1 patient with an IOL exchange at 8 months postoperatively. The mean rate of change in a myopic direction from 1 month after cataract surgery to age 1.5 years was 0.35 diopters (D)/month (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.40 D/month); after age 1.5 years, the mean rate of change in a myopic direction was 0.97 D/year (95% CI, 0.66-1.28 D/year). The mean refractive change was 8.97 D (95% CI, 7.25-10.68 D) at age 5 years for children 1 month of age at surgery and 7.22 D (95% CI, 5.54-8.91 D) for children 6 months of age at surgery. The mean refractive error at age 5 years was -2.53 D (95% CI, -4.05 to -1.02). CONCLUSIONS: After IOL implantation during infancy, the rate of myopic shift occurs most rapidly during the first 1.5 years of life. Myopic shift varies substantially among patients. If the goal is emmetropia at age 5 years, then the immediate postoperative hypermetropic targets should be +10.5 D at 4 to 6 weeks and +8.50 D from 7 weeks to 6 months. However, even using these targets, it is likely that many children will require additional refractive correction given the high variability of refractive outcomes.",

Here, we report the clinical associations and short-term outcomes in 2 patients with Stickler syndrome who presented with acute angle closure at a single tertiary referral center. OBSERVATIONS: A 36-year-old female with Stickler syndrome presented with acute onset of red and painful left eye with cloudy vision. Initial intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured to be 54 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed no angle structures or peripheral anterior synechiae in the left eye. Two laser peripheral iridotomies were created 5 days apart without adequate IOP lowering. Left eye cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and Ahmed glaucoma drainage device implantation were performed with resolution of ocular hypertension.A 35-year-old male with Stickler syndrome presented with intermittent right eye pain and blurry vision. IOP was 42 mm Hg and gonioscopy revealed 270 degrees of angle closure in the right eye. The patient underwent laser peripheral iridotomy in the right eye with resolution of ocular hypertension by the next day. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing angle closure as a potential feature of Stickler syndrome can help providers adequately screen and manage patients with Stickler syndrome presenting with acutely elevated IOP.",

Patients were divided into two categories: isolated PRS (group 1) and PRS plus, i.e. PRS as part of a more complex syndrome (group 2). A total of 74 patients with PRS were found, 29 (39%) males and 45 (61%) females of whom 47 (63.5%) could be categorised as isolated PRS and 27 (36.8%) as PRS plus. The most frequent diagnoses in patients with PRS plus were Stickler syndrome and the velocardiofacial syndrome. Ophthalmological and fluorescent in situ hybridisation of chromosome 22 investigations should therefore be performed in all patients, as soon as the diagnosis of PRS is established. Some form of airway treatment was necessary in the majority of patients (52 of 74), most could be treated conservatively with prone/lateral positioning and close observation. Endotracheal intubation was necessary in one child from group 1 versus five from group 2. Tracheostomy was performed in three children from group 1 and two from group 2. Feeding problems occurred in about 25% of all PRS patients and stunted growth was seen especially in boys with isolated PRS before the age of 10 months. CONCLUSION: In our series, 33% of patients with Pierre Robin sequence plus had Stickler and velocardiofacial syndromes. Conservative airway management was a sufficient treatment for respiratory problems in the majority of patients. Feeding and growth need special attention in patients with Pierre Robin sequence.",

Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1. In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.",

Ophthalmological and fluorescent in situ hybridisation of chromosome 22 investigations should therefore be performed in all patients, as soon as the diagnosis of PRS is established. Some form of airway treatment was necessary in the majority of patients (52 of 74), most could be treated conservatively with prone/lateral positioning and close observation. Endotracheal intubation was necessary in one child from group 1 versus five from group 2. Tracheostomy was performed in three children from group 1 and two from group 2. Feeding problems occurred in about 25% of all PRS patients and stunted growth was seen especially in boys with isolated PRS before the age of 10 months. CONCLUSION: In our series, 33% of patients with Pierre Robin sequence plus had Stickler and velocardiofacial syndromes. Conservative airway management was a sufficient treatment for respiratory problems in the majority of patients. Feeding and growth need special attention in patients with Pierre Robin sequence.",

                    "abstract": "Hearing loss in Stickler syndrome has received little attention due to the often more disabling ocular, orofacial and skeletal manifestations. Estimates suggest a global prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) ranging from 50 % to about 100 % though, depending on the underlying Stickler genotype. By performing extensive audiometric analysis in Stickler patients, we aimed to further elucidate the auditory phenotype. Twenty molecularly confirmed Stickler patients (age 10-62 year), of whom sixteen with type 1 Stickler syndrome (COL2A1 mutation) and four with type 2 Stickler syndrome (COL11A1 mutation) underwent an otological questionnaire, clinical examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry and otoacoustic emission testing. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analysis of the audiograms was performed to assess progression. In type 1 Stickler syndrome, 75 % demonstrated hearing loss, predominantly in the high frequencies. No significant progression beyond presbyacusis was observed. All type 2 Stickler patients exhibited mild-to-moderate low- and mid-frequency SNHL and moderate-to-severe high-frequency SNHL. In both types, hearing loss was observed in childhood. Otoacoustic emissions were only detectable in 7/40 ears and had very low amplitudes, even in frequency bands with normal hearing on pure tone audiometry. Type 1 Stickler syndrome is characterized by a mild high-frequency SNHL, emerging in childhood and non-progressive. Absent otoacoustic emissions are a frequent finding. Patients with type 2 Stickler syndrome exhibit early-onset moderate SNHL affecting all frequencies with a sloping audiogram. Taking into account the visual impairment in many patients, we recommend regular auditory follow-up in patients with Stickler syndrome, especially in childhood. ",

METHODS: The clinical data of 6 CCA patients, 1 male and 5 female, aged 7.5 (5-14) were analyzed. All cases had kyphoscoliosis, 2 in the thoracic segments and 4 in the thoracolumbar segments. The average scoliosis Cobb angle was 88.6 degrees (85 degrees-117 degrees). The average kyphosis Cobb angle was 93.6 degrees (75 degrees-123 degrees). All of the cases underwent internal fixation with pedicle screw and lamina hooks instrumentation, in which 4 cases underwent posterior Smith-Petersen osteotomy. The diagnosis was based on a constellation of clinical findings. The clinical manifestations included marfanoid habitus, flexion contractures of multiple joints (elbow, knee, hip, and finger), kyphoscoliosis, muscular hypoplasia, and abnormal pinnae (\"crumpled\" outer helices). Molecular genetic testing showed mutation in the fibrillin-2 (FBN2) gene encoding the extracellular matrix microfibril. Four cases were followed up for 6-9 months. RESULTS: After operation the average Cobb angle of the scoliosis and kyphosis were 37.6 degrees (35 degrees-52 degrees) and 38.6 degrees (28 degrees-54 degrees) immediately, with 62.3% and 68.7% curve correction respectively. Three cases got excellent synostosis of posterior lamina, 1 case underwent revision with lamina hook because the distal screw was loose and hurt the nerve root, and the other 2 cases lost follow-up. The patients' body appearance and pulmonary function were obviously improved. CONCLUSION: The characteristic clinical manifestation include severe and stiff kyphoscoliosis, difficult to correct , and enhanced Cobb angle, and pedicle dysplasia of vertebral pedicle leading to difficulty in installing screws. Smith-Petersen osteotomy is often necessary. CCA should be differentiated with Marfan syndrome (MFS), Stickler syndrome, Homocystinuria, and distal arthrogryposis, especially MFS.",

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors.

RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001).

There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

                    "abstract": "Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is an important craniofacial anomaly that can be seen as an isolated finding or manifestation of multiple syndromes. 22q11.2 deletion and Stickler syndrome are cited as the two most common conditions associated with PRS, but their frequencies are debated. We performed a retrospective study of 66 patients with PRS and reviewed their genetic testing, diagnoses, and clinical findings. The case series is complemented by a comprehensive literature review of the nature and frequency of genetic diagnosis in PRS. In our cohort 65% of patients had associated anomalies; of these, a genetic diagnosis was established in 56%. Stickler syndrome was the most common diagnosis, comprising approximately 11% of all cases, followed by Treacher Collins syndrome (9%). The frequency of 22q11.2 deletion was 1.5%. Chromosome arrays, performed for 72% of idiopathic PRS with associated anomalies, revealed two cases of 18q22 qter deletion, a region not previously reported in association with PRS. A review of the cytogenetic anomalies identified in this population supports an association between the 4q33-qter, 17q24.3, 2q33.1, and 11q23 chromosomal loci and PRS. We found a low frequency of 22q11.2 deletion in PRS, suggesting it is less commonly implicated in this malformation. Our data also indicate a higher frequency of cytogenetic anomalies in PRS patients with associated anomalies, and a potential new link with the 18q22 qter locus. The present findings underscore the utility of chromosomal microarrays in cases of PRS with associated anomalies and suggest that delaying testing for apparently isolated cases should be considered.",

The estimated prevalence is 1:10,000. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a girl with the salient features of Stickler syndrome. Based on a literature search on Medline, we present an overview of this disorder. RESULTS: The patient presented at birth with Pierre Robin sequence and bilateral exophtalmus. Serial ophthalmological investigations have revealed a non-progressive myopia of high degree and abnormalities of the vitreous gel architecture. From the age of three, she had joint hypermobility and joint pain. Her intelligence is normal, but she requires speech therapy because of problems with articulation. INTERPRETATION: Recent research has provided a better understanding of the molecular genetic background of this condition. According to mutations in three genes encoding type II- and/or type XI-collagen, Stickler's syndrome can be subclassified into type 1, 2 and 3, but there is a considerable clinical overlap in symptoms. Patients with mild symptoms may be undiagnosed. Once the diagnosis is established, a coordinated multidisciplinary follow-up approach is recommended.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To report posterior chorioretinal atrophy (PCRA) and correlate the vitreous phenotype with inheritance of the disease mutation in a family with vitreoretinal dystrophy. DESIGN: Prospective observational case series. METHODS: Twenty-four members of a family with 14 affected individuals were examined, and genetic linkage analysis was performed at the COL2A1, COL11A1, and Wagner disease loci. The vitreous phenotype was prospectively graded as optically empty with retrolenticular membrane, fibrillar, or normal. Ocular ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed on selected individuals to study the vitreous structure and vitreoretinal interface. RESULTS: The 6-year-old proband had PCRA and optically empty vitreous without systemic features, suggestive of Wagner disease. The family history was negative for systemic disease, except for one cousin with cleft palate. However, when examined, clinical features of the 14 affected subjects included 5 with small chin, 4 with at least submucosal cleft palate, and 9 with a myopic refractive error greater than 5 diopters. Lens opacity or previous cataract extraction was found in 13 family members. All affected individuals in whom the vitreous could be examined had an optically empty vitreous with retrolental membrane. Posterior chorioretinal atrophy was found in eight of the affected subjects. The finding was not limited to highly myopic subjects, nor did all the high myopes have PCRA. Ultrasonography and OCT revealed vitreous adherent to the retina, but without apparent retinal distortion or edema of the macula. Significant linkage was established to the COL2A1 locus; the other loci were excluded. A single nucleotide insertion mutation (c.2012 2013insC) was identified in exon 34, leading to a downstream premature stop codon in the COL2A1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Although posterior chorioretinal atrophy and vitreoretinal degeneration have been classically associated with Wagner disease, we demonstrate its presence in a family with typical Stickler syndrome. On the basis of clinical, ultrasonographic, and OCT studies, the etiology of PCRA in this family does not seem to be attributable to vitreomacular traction or myopia. The vitreous findings in this large family confirm reports that mutations in the COL2A1 gene lead to the optically empty vitreous with retrolenticular membrane phenotype.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the anatomical outcomes of primary scleral buckling (SB) procedures for pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series. One hundred and four eyes of 99 consecutive nonselected pediatric patients undergoing primary SB were identified. Baseline factors recorded were demographics, presenting clinical examination findings, previous ocular surgery, predisposing factors. Intraoperative factors recorded were the type of buckle, number and distribution of retinal breaks, number of retinal quadrants detached, macular status (involved vs. uninvolved), the use of subretinal fluid drainage, and surgical complications. Anatomical reattachment rate at last follow-up. Subgroup analysis was carried out to identify any predisposing factors for failure of primary surgery, effect of age on outcome, intraoperative pathology, effect of posterior versus anterior SB, and redetachment and secondary-procedure complications specific to SB. RESULTS: The initial surgery was segmental SB alone in 87 eyes (83.6%). Retinal reattachment was achieved with 1 operation in 73% (76 of 104 eyes). Of the 28 cases that redetached, 14 eyes underwent a repeat SB procedure (success rate of this second operation: 85.7% [12 of 14 eyes]), 13 eyes underwent vitrectomy (success rate of this second operation: 38.4% [5 of 13 eyes]), and 1 case was not reoperated. Overall, the final success rate was 94% (98 of 104 eyes). Factors associated with a statistically significant increased risk of failure included more than one break; three or more quadrants of detachment; horseshoe tears; no breaks seen on preoperative examination; Stickler syndrome. CONCLUSION: In selected cases, primary SB is an effective treatment for pediatric, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome is a hereditary oculo-systemic disorder where patients are predisposed to retinal detachments which are often complex and challenging to manage. Significant progress has been made regarding the molecular genetics of the condition; however, there is little recent literature on surgery for retinal detachment in Stickler syndrome. Our aim is to describe a population of Stickler patients presenting to Moorfields Eye Hospital with detachment from 1986 to 2003. We looked at patient characteristics, characteristics of detachment, management and anatomical and functional outcomes. We also aim to compare this group from 1986 to 2003 with a past group of Stickler patients treated at Moorfields between 1965 and 1985, reported by (Billington et al. in Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 104:875-879, 1985). This comparison of 20-year matched cohorts examined patient characteristics, features of detachment, management and anatomical outcome in the two groups using the same definitions as the earlier authors. RESULTS: In the Stickler group from 1986 to 2003, complete re-attachment rate was 67% for primary scleral-buckle surgery, 84.2% for primary vitrectomy and 78.57% for all surgery in 30 eyes of 23 patients. Overall in this group there was an average increase in Logmar visual acuity of 0.33 and 0.32 in patients undergoing primary cryo-buckle and primary vitrectomy surgery respectively. When comparing the two groups using Fisher's exact test, we found that the group from 1986 to 2003 had significant improvement in re-attachment for detachments with multiple tears and for vitrectomy surgery, compared with the group from 1965 to 1985. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that despite complicated surgery and often multiple procedures, good anatomical outcomes were achieved as well as useful functional visual results after retinal detachment surgery in Stickler patients. It would also appear that when comparing the group of Stickler patients from 1986 to 2003 with the group from 1965 to 1985 improvements were seen in outcome from vitrectomy surgery and surgery for multiple breaks probably due to advances in technique and technology in vitreoretinal surgery, over the past 4 decades.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome (STL) is an inherited progressive connective tissue collagen disorder. STL is the most common hereditary cause of retinal complications, retinal tears, and the development of retinal detachment (RD) in childhood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term anatomical and functional results of surgical treatment of retinal complications in children and adolescents affected by STL. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study was performed a cohort of children with STL who underwent retinal surgery between 2004 and 2021. RESULTS: The study group consisted of nine children; the mean age at the time of the retinal tear with/without retinal detachment was 7.2 (2-10) years, and the mean follow-up period was 9.6 (5-16) years. Pathogenic variants COL2A1 (5 children) and COL11A1 (3 children) were confirmed in our cohort. In total, we operated on 13 eyes, 11 eyes with complicated RD and two eyes with multiple retinal defects, but without RD. At the end of the follow-up period, an attached retina was achieved 77% (10 eyes) with or without silicone oil tamponade: cryopexy alone was successful in one eye (10%), scleral buckling (EB) in five eyes (50%), and vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade combined with EB in four eyes (40%). The mean number of surgeries was 2.3 per eye. The resulting best corrected visual acuity ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 in one eye, from 0.16 to 0.4 in two eyes, and from 0.5 to 1.0 in 7 eyes. CONCLUSION: Repair of retinal tears with/without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome often requires multiple surgeries with combinations of cryopexy, scleral buckling, and/or vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade. Treatment of the ocular complications arising from STL requires long-term comprehensive care.",

He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge. His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did a reattachment of the retina in the right eye.

This study was designed to determine the prevalence of Stickler syndrome among the author's group of patients with Robin sequence, and to investigate the visual outcome among paediatric patients with Robin sequence and Stickler syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children (six male and two female) with Stickler syndrome and Robin sequence were referred to be followed up every 6 months in the Ophthalmologic Department because of high myopia at less than 10 years of age. Three patients came from the author's study group and five were referred by other cleft surgeons. They were examined with repeat ophthalmic and indirect fundus examinations including cycloplegic refraction, and slit lamp biomicroscope examinations. Laser photocoagulation (2 cases) treatment for retinal degeneration or operation (3 cases) for retinal detachment was performed once evidence of significant ophthalmologic finding was noted. RESULTS: Of the 91 cases of newborns with isolated cleft palate treated by the first author, eight patients had Robin sequence, and among these, three had Stickler syndrome. The prevalence of Stickler syndrome among this subgroup of patients was 37.5% (3/8). Among these three patients and the additional five referred by other cleft surgeons, the average spherical equivalents of the first cycloplegic refraction for the 16 eyes was -12.39+/-2.72 diopter (D) (range -8.75 to -18.5D). Of the eight patients, five did not need any therapy, two children had retinal degeneration in the left eye and retinal detachment in the right eye while one child had retinal detachment in the right eye only. Laser photocoagulation was performed in the two left eyes with retinal degeneration and was successful. Surgery was performed on the three eyes with retinal detachment, one was successful while two failed and the patients developed total blindness at ages four and six respectively. Out of these three children with retinal complications, only one child remained free of visual deterioration in both eyes during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Early identification of Stickler syndrome in children with Robin sequence by cleft surgeons is necessary to insure early referral to an ophthalmologist for detection of myopia, monitoring for retinal detachment, and prevention of visual complications.",

Among these three patients and the additional five referred by other cleft surgeons, the average spherical equivalents of the first cycloplegic refraction for the 16 eyes was -12.39+/-2.72 diopter (D) (range -8.75 to -18.5D). Of the eight patients, five did not need any therapy, two children had retinal degeneration in the left eye and retinal detachment in the right eye while one child had retinal detachment in the right eye only. Laser photocoagulation was performed in the two left eyes with retinal degeneration and was successful. Surgery was performed on the three eyes with retinal detachment, one was successful while two failed and the patients developed total blindness at ages four and six respectively. Out of these three children with retinal complications, only one child remained free of visual deterioration in both eyes during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Early identification of Stickler syndrome in children with Robin sequence by cleft surgeons is necessary to insure early referral to an ophthalmologist for detection of myopia, monitoring for retinal detachment, and prevention of visual complications.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To review a series of infants with Robin sequence (RS) who underwent mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) at the authors' institution and document changes in pre- and postoperative laryngoscopy grades. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with RS who underwent MDO from March 2005 to June 2017 were identified. Patients were included if they had a preoperative polysomnogram confirming obstructive sleep apnea, had failed nonoperative airway management, had undergone MDO by the senior author (C.M.R.), and had complete documentation. Patients were excluded if they did not have a laryngoscopy performed (ie, tracheostomy dependent) or if there was insufficient information in their medical record. Variables included demographic data, operative information, and laryngoscopic details at 3 time points: before MDO (T0), at device removal (T1), and at latest follow-up laryngoscopy (T2). Descriptive statistics were computed. Significance was set at a P value less than .05. RESULTS: Twenty-two infants with RS underwent MDO during the study period and 13 of these met criteria for inclusion. Mean age at MDO (T0) was 19.6 +- 38.8 weeks. Mean ages at device removal (T1) and latest follow-up laryngoscopy (T2) were 28.2 +- 41.5 and 62.7 +- 49.6 weeks, respectively. Three patients had Stickler syndrome; the others had nonsyndromic RS. Mean apnea-hypopnea index was 23.6 +- 16.6 preoperatively and 0.3 +- 0.7 after MDO (P = .011). At T0, a grade IIb laryngoscopic view was most common (46.1%) and only 3 patients (23.1%) had a grade I view. At T1, most patients (69.2%) had a grade I view and only 2 (14.4%) had a grade of IIb or worse (P = .011). At T2, all but 1 patient had a grade I view. CONCLUSION: In addition to resolving obstructive apnea, MDO is associated with an improvement in the grade of laryngoscopic view. This could increase airway safety at home and improve ease of intubation for future operations.",

Subsequent investigation identified low molecular weight proteinuria as part of their syndrome. Exome sequencing of one of the probands revealed a new non-synonymous variant in the LRP2 gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation and segregation in the family. No mutation was identified in COL9A1/2, COL11A1/2, or COL2A1 genes. The variant (c.11483A>G; p.Asp3828Gly) is predicted to be damaging and is conserved among vertebrate species. Mutations in LRP2 have been shown to cause the Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) or facio-oculo-acoustico-renal (FOAR) syndrome, a syndrome associated with facial dysmorphism, ocular anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss, low molecular weight proteinuria, and diaphragmatic hernia and absent corpus callosum, although there is variability in the expression of some features. This family shows a milder phenotype with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome and only a few features of the DBS, including microglobulinuria. The presence of microglobulinuria was only detected after molecular results were known. In conclusion, with the identification of a new mutation in LRP2 associated with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome, we have broadened the phenotypic spectrum of LRP2 mutations.

METHODS: Case report with fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Pediatric retinal detachments (RDs) are unique in etiology, anatomy, and prognosis compared with the adult population. The mechanisms of pediatric RD include tractional (TRD), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, traumatic, and other types, such as exudative or hemorrhagic. This study examined visual and anatomical outcomes of pediatric RD undergoing surgical repair at a single university referral center. METHODS: A retrospective consecutive case series of patients clinically diagnosed and undergoing surgery for RD between birth and 15 years of age from 2002 to 2013 at a single academic institution. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients (231 eyes) were included in this study, of which 25 (12%) had bilateral RD. Of those patients, 67 (29%) had TRD (retinopathy of prematurity, persistent fetal vasculature, or familial exudative vitreoretinopathy), 51 (22%) had rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (myopia, X-linked retinoschisis, or Stickler syndrome), 60 (26%) had traumatic RD, and 53 (23%) were due to other types of RD, such as Coats disease or coloboma. Presenting best-corrected visual acuity better than 20/200 correlated with better final best-corrected visual acuity (P < 0.0001). Anatomical success was strongly correlated with visual acuity outcome (P < 0.00001) and was significantly more likely in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment versus TRD (78% vs. 39%, P < 0.05). The rates of obtaining a final best-corrected visual acuity > 20/200 were poorer in TRD (10%) compared with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (39%, P < 0.01) or traumatic RD (28%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Visual and anatomical outcomes varied among categories of RD. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments were associated with the best outcomes (anatomical success and globe conservation), whereas TRDs generally had poorer visual and anatomical outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe presenting clinical features and surgical techniques that are associated with successful surgical repair of pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twelve eyes of 191 patients 0 to 18 years of age undergoing surgical repair for RRD between 2001 and 2015 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months. METHODS: Patients were divided into 3 age groups (0-6 years, 7-12 years, and 13-18 years) and comparisons were made using bivariate and multivariate generalized estimating equation models. A mixed means model was used to examine visual acuity in each age group over time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete reattachment of the retina at final follow-up. RESULTS: Of 212 eyes, 166 (78%) achieved total reattachment at final follow-up. Mean follow-up was 36.3 months. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with Stickler syndrome was more likely to occur in the younger cohorts (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.91), whereas RRD associated with blunt trauma was more likely to occur in the oldest cohort (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4). Subtotal RRD was more likely to be repaired successfully than total RRD (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4; P = 0.0100), and eyes with previous vitreoretinal surgery were less likely to undergo successful repair (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.78; P = 0.0258). There was no significant difference between age groups in the rate of surgical success (P = 0.55). There was a significantly higher success rate with primary scleral buckle (SB; 63%; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) and combined SB plus pars plana vitrectomy (PPV; 68%; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1) compared with PPV alone (51%). CONCLUSIONS: Most pediatric patients with RRD achieved complete reattachment with surgery. Success was more common in patients with a subtotal RRD at presentation. Previous vitreoretinal surgery was a risk factor for failure. Younger patients were more likely to demonstrate RRD involving the macula, but there was no difference between age groups in successful reattachment at final follow-up. Primary PPV showed a lower rate of success than SB or combined SB plus PPV.",
