                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Computed tomographic (CT) scans are often obtained before mandibular distraction osteogenesis in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

This retrospective consecutive case series included 149 patients with inherited eye diseases, seen by a single pediatric ophthalmologist, who underwent genetic testing between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018. Variants were detected using a target enrichment panel of 429 genes and known deep intronic variants associated with inherited eye disease. Among 149 patients, 38 (25.5%) had a family history, and this cohort includes heterogeneous phenotype including anterior segment dysgenesis, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus syndrome, optic atrophy, and retinal dystrophy. Overall, 90 patients (60.4%) received a definite molecular diagnosis. Overall, NGS-guided precision care was provided to 8 patients (5.4%). The precision care included cryotherapy to prevent retinal detachment in COL2A1 Stickler syndrome, osteoporosis management in patients with LRP5-associated familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and avoidance of unnecessary phlebotomy in hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. A revision of the initial clinical diagnosis was made in 22 patients (14.8%). Unexpected multi-gene deletions and dual diagnosis were noted in 4 patients (2.7%).

There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

This retrospective consecutive case series included 149 patients with inherited eye diseases, seen by a single pediatric ophthalmologist, who underwent genetic testing between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018. Variants were detected using a target enrichment panel of 429 genes and known deep intronic variants associated with inherited eye disease. Among 149 patients, 38 (25.5%) had a family history, and this cohort includes heterogeneous phenotype including anterior segment dysgenesis, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus syndrome, optic atrophy, and retinal dystrophy. Overall, 90 patients (60.4%) received a definite molecular diagnosis. Overall, NGS-guided precision care was provided to 8 patients (5.4%). The precision care included cryotherapy to prevent retinal detachment in COL2A1 Stickler syndrome, osteoporosis management in patients with LRP5-associated familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and avoidance of unnecessary phlebotomy in hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. A revision of the initial clinical diagnosis was made in 22 patients (14.8%). Unexpected multi-gene deletions and dual diagnosis were noted in 4 patients (2.7%). We found that precision medical or surgical managements were provided for 8 of 149 patients (5.4%), and multiple locus variants were found in 2.7% of cases. These findings are important because individualized management of inherited eye diseases can be achieved through genetic testing.",

The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation.

                    "title": "The clinical effectiveness and safety of prophylactic retinal interventions to reduce the risk of retinal detachment and subsequent vision loss in adults and children with Stickler syndrome: a systematic review.",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome, also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, is an inherited progressive disorder of the collagen connective tissues. Manifestations include short-sightedness, cataracts, retinal problems leading to retinal detachment and possible blindness. This is principally the case among individuals with type 1 Stickler Syndrome. It is the most commonly identified inherited cause of retinal detachment in childhood. However, there is no consensus regarding best practice and no current guidelines on prophylactic interventions for this population. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of primary prophylactic interventions for the prevention of retinal detachment in previously untreated eyes without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome. The primary outcome of interest was retinal detachment post prophylaxis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was made of 11 databases of published and unpublished literature, which included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library. There was no restriction by language or date. The references of all included studies were checked for further relevant citations and authors of studies with potentially relevant data were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers double-screened all titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the search to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Both reviewers also independently extracted and quality assessed all included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1444 unique citations, of which four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The two principal studies were both retrospective cohort studies with control groups in populations with type 1 Stickler syndrome. One study evaluated 360  cryotherapy (n = 204) and the other focal or circumferential laser treatment (n = 22). Both studies reported a statistically significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment per eye between the groups receiving prophylaxis and the controls. However, both studies were subject to a high risk of bias. The results of the two supporting studies of Wagner-Stickler patients were either relatively inconsistent or unreliable. No study reported any major or long-term complications associated with the interventions. Despite the weaknesses of the evidence, the rate of retinal detachment in the intervention groups, especially the cryotherapy group, was lower than the rate either experienced in the study control groups or reported in other studies of untreated Stickler syndrome populations not exposed to prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Only 360  cryotherapy and focal and circumferential laser treatment have been evaluated for the type 1 Stickler syndrome population, and then only by a single retrospective, controlled, cohort study in each case. Both of these studies report a significant difference between intervention and control groups (principally no treatment) and no major or long-term side effects or complications. However, there is a high risk of bias within these two studies, so the relative effectiveness of either intervention is uncertain. FUTURE WORK: A service priority is to determine reliably the prevalence of Stickler syndrome, i.e. how many individuals have type 1 or type 2 Stickler syndrome, and their risk of retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. A non-randomised, prospective cohort comparison study, in which eligible participants are treated, followed-up and analysed in one of three study arms, for no treatment, laser therapy or cryotherapy, would potentially offer further certainty in terms of the relative efficacy of both prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis and cryotherapy versus laser therapy than is possible with the currently available data. Alternatively, continued follow-up and analysis of existing study data, and data collection from relevant sample populations, are required to assess the long-term risks of blindness, retinal detachment and prophylaxis.

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Computed tomographic (CT) scans are often obtained before mandibular distraction osteogenesis in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

METHODS: Retrospective case-review of 115 patients with Robin sequence managed between 1962 and 2002 at two tertiary-care teaching hospitals for evaluation of demographic information, clinical findings, and treatment interventions. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent (N=63) of patients were nonsyndromic. Syndromic patients included: Stickler syndrome (18%), velocardiofacial syndrome (7%), Treacher-Collins (5%), facial and hemifacial microsomia (3%), and other defined (3.5%) and undefined (9%) disorders. There was no statistical difference between the syndromic and nonsyndromic patients with regard to need for operative airway management (Fisher's exact test, p=0.264). Forty-two percent of patients required a feeding gastrostomy tube to correct feeding difficulties. Patients with a syndromic diagnosis were more likely to be developmentally delayed. Fifty-one (44%) patients underwent operative airway management: 61% underwent tongue-lip adhesion and 39% underwent tracheotomy. Fifteen percent of patients initially had tongue-lip adhesion subsequently required tracheotomy. While the preferred treatment for respiratory compromise differed between the two institutions, the percentage of patients requiring operative intervention was similar. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of Robin sequence is multifactorial and syndromic in nearly half of the patients. Operative treatment of respiratory failure was required in 44% of infants; the rate was similar in both hospitals. The operative approach differed significantly between the institutions, however, based on the philosophy and training of the managing surgical specialty. Co-morbid factors such as baseline cardiopulmonary and neurologic status did not play a significant role in surgical decision making.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome, also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, is an inherited progressive disorder of the collagen connective tissues. Manifestations include short-sightedness, cataracts, retinal problems leading to retinal detachment and possible blindness. This is principally the case among individuals with type 1 Stickler Syndrome. It is the most commonly identified inherited cause of retinal detachment in childhood. However, there is no consensus regarding best practice and no current guidelines on prophylactic interventions for this population. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of primary prophylactic interventions for the prevention of retinal detachment in previously untreated eyes without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome. The primary outcome of interest was retinal detachment post prophylaxis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was made of 11 databases of published and unpublished literature, which included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library. There was no restriction by language or date. The references of all included studies were checked for further relevant citations and authors of studies with potentially relevant data were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers double-screened all titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the search to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Both reviewers also independently extracted and quality assessed all included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1444 unique citations, of which four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The two principal studies were both retrospective cohort studies with control groups in populations with type 1 Stickler syndrome. One study evaluated 360  cryotherapy (n = 204) and the other focal or circumferential laser treatment (n = 22). Both studies reported a statistically significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment per eye between the groups receiving prophylaxis and the controls. However, both studies were subject to a high risk of bias. The results of the two supporting studies of Wagner-Stickler patients were either relatively inconsistent or unreliable. No study reported any major or long-term complications associated with the interventions. Despite the weaknesses of the evidence, the rate of retinal detachment in the intervention groups, especially the cryotherapy group, was lower than the rate either experienced in the study control groups or reported in other studies of untreated Stickler syndrome populations not exposed to prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Only 360  cryotherapy and focal and circumferential laser treatment have been evaluated for the type 1 Stickler syndrome population, and then only by a single retrospective, controlled, cohort study in each case. Both of these studies report a significant difference between intervention and control groups (principally no treatment) and no major or long-term side effects or complications. However, there is a high risk of bias within these two studies, so the relative effectiveness of either intervention is uncertain. FUTURE WORK: A service priority is to determine reliably the prevalence of Stickler syndrome, i.e. how many individuals have type 1 or type 2 Stickler syndrome, and their risk of retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. A non-randomised, prospective cohort comparison study, in which eligible participants are treated, followed-up and analysed in one of three study arms, for no treatment, laser therapy or cryotherapy, would potentially offer further certainty in terms of the relative efficacy of both prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis and cryotherapy versus laser therapy than is possible with the currently available data. Alternatively, continued follow-up and analysis of existing study data, and data collection from relevant sample populations, are required to assess the long-term risks of blindness, retinal detachment and prophylaxis. FUNDING: This study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Stickler syndrome often require emergency surgery and are often anesthetized in nonspecialist units, typically for retinal detachment repair. Despite the occurrence of cleft palate and Pierre-Robin sequence, there is little published literature on airway complications. Our aim was to describe anesthetic practice and complications in a nonselected series of Stickler syndrome cases. To our knowledge, this is the largest such series in the published literature. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with genetically confirmed Stickler syndrome who had undergone general anesthesia in a major teaching hospital, seeking to identify factors that predicted patients who would require more than 1 attempt to correctly site an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SAD). Patient demographics, associated factors, and anesthetic complications were collected. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression modeling were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twoanesthetic events were analyzed. Three hundred ninety-five (92.7%) type 1 Stickler and 63 (96.9%) type 2 Stickler patients could be managed with a single attempt of passing an ETT or SAD. Advanced airway techniques were required on 4 occasions, and we report no major complications. On logistic regression, modeling receding mandible (P = .0004) and history of cleft palate (P = .0004) were significantly associated with the need for more than 1 attempt at airway manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of Stickler patients can be anesthetized safely with standard management. If patients have a receding mandible or history of cleft, an experienced anesthetist familiar with Stickler syndrome should manage the patient. We recommend that patients identified to have a difficult airway wear an alert bracelet.",

                    "abstract": "Procedures to relieve airway obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) include glossopexy, mandibular distraction, and tracheostomy. Previously, it has been suggested that the imbalance of the genioglossus insertion on the mandible could be responsible for the micrognathia, tongue elevation, and glossoptosis seen in PRS. We performed a retrospective study to determine the usefulness of subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth in PRS with airway problems. Between 1991 and 2005, 14 consecutive patients with PRS were treated with subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth performed at the British Columbia's Children's Hospital. There were 8 boys and 6 girls. Mean age at surgery was 15 weeks (range, 1-68 weeks). Postoperative follow-up ranged from 8 months to 13 years. Seven patients (4 boys and 3 girls) were successfully treated, and a tracheostomy was prevented. Fifty-five percent of the syndromic patients needed a tracheostomy, whereas 1 patient (33%) with isolated PRS needed a tracheostomy. The most common syndrome associated with PRS was Stickler syndrome. Five (72%) of the 7 patients who required a tracheostomy were boys. If conservative measures fail to relieve supraglottic airway obstruction seen in patients with PRS, a subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth can be an effective intervention in certain patients. It is a simple intervention with few complications and little morbidity. More investigations are mandatory to precisely define patient characteristics ideal for this intervention.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

The aim of this study was to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2. RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5 years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation. At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del; p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.",

There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors.

RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001).

                    "abstract": "Procedures to relieve airway obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) include glossopexy, mandibular distraction, and tracheostomy. Previously, it has been suggested that the imbalance of the genioglossus insertion on the mandible could be responsible for the micrognathia, tongue elevation, and glossoptosis seen in PRS. We performed a retrospective study to determine the usefulness of subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth in PRS with airway problems. Between 1991 and 2005, 14 consecutive patients with PRS were treated with subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth performed at the British Columbia's Children's Hospital. There were 8 boys and 6 girls. Mean age at surgery was 15 weeks (range, 1-68 weeks). Postoperative follow-up ranged from 8 months to 13 years. Seven patients (4 boys and 3 girls) were successfully treated, and a tracheostomy was prevented. Fifty-five percent of the syndromic patients needed a tracheostomy, whereas 1 patient (33%) with isolated PRS needed a tracheostomy. The most common syndrome associated with PRS was Stickler syndrome. Five (72%) of the 7 patients who required a tracheostomy were boys. If conservative measures fail to relieve supraglottic airway obstruction seen in patients with PRS, a subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth can be an effective intervention in certain patients. It is a simple intervention with few complications and little morbidity. More investigations are mandatory to precisely define patient characteristics ideal for this intervention.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1. In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.",

Forty-two family members with Stickler syndrome were retrospectively reviewed; 22 had ocular abnormalities, 22 had myopia and 16 had high myopia. Ten patients had developed retinal detachment and 9 of them were blind in one or both eyes because of irreparable detachment. Only 2 eyes had been operated on successfully. Ten eyes were lasered prophylactically. In eyes with extensive vitreoretinopathy laser burns were applied 360 degrees around the peripheral retina at the border between the pathological and normal retina. Eyes with isolated lesions received focal treatment around the pathological areas. Four eyes received 360 degrees laser photocoagulation and 6 eyes received focal treatment. Of the treated cases, 9 retinas remained attached for a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 15 years. One patient was lost to follow-up, and 5 years later developed retinal detachment in one eye from a new non-lasered lesion. In conclusion, in this particular family the incidence of retinal detachment was significantly higher in non-lasered eyes than in lasered eyes (p < 0.025).",

METHODS: Retrospective case-review of 115 patients with Robin sequence managed between 1962 and 2002 at two tertiary-care teaching hospitals for evaluation of demographic information, clinical findings, and treatment interventions. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent (N=63) of patients were nonsyndromic. Syndromic patients included: Stickler syndrome (18%), velocardiofacial syndrome (7%), Treacher-Collins (5%), facial and hemifacial microsomia (3%), and other defined (3.5%) and undefined (9%) disorders. There was no statistical difference between the syndromic and nonsyndromic patients with regard to need for operative airway management (Fisher's exact test, p=0.264). Forty-two percent of patients required a feeding gastrostomy tube to correct feeding difficulties. Patients with a syndromic diagnosis were more likely to be developmentally delayed. Fifty-one (44%) patients underwent operative airway management: 61% underwent tongue-lip adhesion and 39% underwent tracheotomy. Fifteen percent of patients initially had tongue-lip adhesion subsequently required tracheotomy. While the preferred treatment for respiratory compromise differed between the two institutions, the percentage of patients requiring operative intervention was similar. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of Robin sequence is multifactorial and syndromic in nearly half of the patients. Operative treatment of respiratory failure was required in 44% of infants; the rate was similar in both hospitals. The operative approach differed significantly between the institutions, however, based on the philosophy and training of the managing surgical specialty.

This retrospective consecutive case series included 149 patients with inherited eye diseases, seen by a single pediatric ophthalmologist, who underwent genetic testing between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018. Variants were detected using a target enrichment panel of 429 genes and known deep intronic variants associated with inherited eye disease. Among 149 patients, 38 (25.5%) had a family history, and this cohort includes heterogeneous phenotype including anterior segment dysgenesis, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus syndrome, optic atrophy, and retinal dystrophy. Overall, 90 patients (60.4%) received a definite molecular diagnosis. Overall, NGS-guided precision care was provided to 8 patients (5.4%). The precision care included cryotherapy to prevent retinal detachment in COL2A1 Stickler syndrome, osteoporosis management in patients with LRP5-associated familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and avoidance of unnecessary phlebotomy in hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. A revision of the initial clinical diagnosis was made in 22 patients (14.8%). Unexpected multi-gene deletions and dual diagnosis were noted in 4 patients (2.7%). We found that precision medical or surgical managements were provided for 8 of 149 patients (5.4%), and multiple locus variants were found in 2.7% of cases. These findings are important because individualized management of inherited eye diseases can be achieved through genetic testing.",

Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1. In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

DESIGN: Retrospective comparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty seven patients with type 1 Stickler syndrome. METHODS: Time to retinal detachment was compared between patients who received bilateral prophylaxis and untreated controls, with and without individual patient matching. Patients receiving unilateral prophylaxis (after fellow eye retinal detachment) were similarly compared with an appropriate control subgroup. Individual patient matching ensured equal age and follow-up between groups and that an appropriate control (who had not suffered a retinal detachment before the age at which their individually matched treatment patient underwent prophylactic treatment) was selected.

Forty-two family members with Stickler syndrome were retrospectively reviewed; 22 had ocular abnormalities, 22 had myopia and 16 had high myopia. Ten patients had developed retinal detachment and 9 of them were blind in one or both eyes because of irreparable detachment. Only 2 eyes had been operated on successfully. Ten eyes were lasered prophylactically. In eyes with extensive vitreoretinopathy laser burns were applied 360 degrees around the peripheral retina at the border between the pathological and normal retina. Eyes with isolated lesions received focal treatment around the pathological areas. Four eyes received 360 degrees laser photocoagulation and 6 eyes received focal treatment. Of the treated cases, 9 retinas remained attached for a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 15 years. One patient was lost to follow-up, and 5 years later developed retinal detachment in one eye from a new non-lasered lesion. In conclusion, in this particular family the incidence of retinal detachment was significantly higher in non-lasered eyes than in lasered eyes (p < 0.025).",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stickler syndrome, also known as hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy, is an inherited progressive disorder of the collagen connective tissues. Manifestations include short-sightedness, cataracts, retinal problems leading to retinal detachment and possible blindness. This is principally the case among individuals with type 1 Stickler Syndrome. It is the most commonly identified inherited cause of retinal detachment in childhood. However, there is no consensus regarding best practice and no current guidelines on prophylactic interventions for this population. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of primary prophylactic interventions for the prevention of retinal detachment in previously untreated eyes without retinal detachment in patients with Stickler syndrome. The primary outcome of interest was retinal detachment post prophylaxis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was made of 11 databases of published and unpublished literature, which included MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and The Cochrane Library. There was no restriction by language or date. The references of all included studies were checked for further relevant citations and authors of studies with potentially relevant data were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers double-screened all titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the search to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Both reviewers also independently extracted and quality assessed all included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1444 unique citations, of which four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. The two principal studies were both retrospective cohort studies with control groups in populations with type 1 Stickler syndrome. One study evaluated 360  cryotherapy (n = 204) and the other focal or circumferential laser treatment (n = 22). Both studies reported a statistically significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment per eye between the groups receiving prophylaxis and the controls. However, both studies were subject to a high risk of bias. The results of the two supporting studies of Wagner-Stickler patients were either relatively inconsistent or unreliable. No study reported any major or long-term complications associated with the interventions. Despite the weaknesses of the evidence, the rate of retinal detachment in the intervention groups, especially the cryotherapy group, was lower than the rate either experienced in the study control groups or reported in other studies of untreated Stickler syndrome populations not exposed to prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Only 360  cryotherapy and focal and circumferential laser treatment have been evaluated for the type 1 Stickler syndrome population, and then only by a single retrospective, controlled, cohort study in each case. Both of these studies report a significant difference between intervention and control groups (principally no treatment) and no major or long-term side effects or complications. However, there is a high risk of bias within these two studies, so the relative effectiveness of either intervention is uncertain. FUTURE WORK: A service priority is to determine reliably the prevalence of Stickler syndrome, i.e. how many individuals have type 1 or type 2 Stickler syndrome, and their risk of retinal detachment and subsequent blindness. A non-randomised, prospective cohort comparison study, in which eligible participants are treated, followed-up and analysed in one of three study arms, for no treatment, laser therapy or cryotherapy, would potentially offer further certainty in terms of the relative efficacy of both prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis and cryotherapy versus laser therapy than is possible with the currently available data. Alternatively, continued follow-up and analysis of existing study data, and data collection from relevant sample populations, are required to assess the long-term risks of blindness, retinal detachment and prophylaxis.

Affected patients manifest ocular, auditory, articular, and craniofacial manifestations in varying degrees. Ocular symptoms include myopia, retinal detachment, cataract, and glaucoma. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the prevalence of ocular manifestations and the outcome of prophylactic treatment on reducing the risk of retinal detachment. METHOD: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed database. Information on the cross-study prevalence of myopia, retinal detachment, cataract, glaucoma, visual impairment, severity and age of onset of myopia and retinal detachments. Studies that reported on the outcome of prophylactic treatment against a control group were explored. RESULTS: 37 articles with 2324 individual patients were included. Myopia was found in 83% of patients, mostly of a moderate to severe degree. Retinal detachments occurred in 45% of patients. Generally, the first detachment occurred in the second decade of life in STL1 patients and later in STL2. Cataracts were more common in STL2 patients, 59% versus 36% in STL1. Glaucoma (10%) and visual impairment (blind: 6%; vision loss in one eye: 10%) were rare. Three studies reported on the effect of prophylactic treatment being protective. CONCLUSION: Ocular manifestations are common in Stickler patients, but the comparison between studies was difficult because of inconsistencies in diagnostic and inclusion criteria by different studies. Sight-threatening complications such as retinal detachments are common but although prophylactic therapy is reported to be effective in retrospective studies, evidence from randomized trials is missing.",

He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge. His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did a reattachment of the retina in the right eye.

The aim of this study was to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2. RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5 years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation. At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del; p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.",

Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1. In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.",

METHODS: Case report with fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the course and prognosis of airway obstruction, feeding difficulties and hearing abnormalities in patients with Pierre Robin sequence (PRS). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

METHODS: Case report with fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The aim of this study was to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2. RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5 years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation. At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del; p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.",

METHODS: Retrospective case-review of 115 patients with Robin sequence managed between 1962 and 2002 at two tertiary-care teaching hospitals for evaluation of demographic information, clinical findings, and treatment interventions. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent (N=63) of patients were nonsyndromic. Syndromic patients included: Stickler syndrome (18%), velocardiofacial syndrome (7%), Treacher-Collins (5%), facial and hemifacial microsomia (3%), and other defined (3.5%) and undefined (9%) disorders. There was no statistical difference between the syndromic and nonsyndromic patients with regard to need for operative airway management (Fisher's exact test, p=0.264). Forty-two percent of patients required a feeding gastrostomy tube to correct feeding difficulties. Patients with a syndromic diagnosis were more likely to be developmentally delayed. Fifty-one (44%) patients underwent operative airway management: 61% underwent tongue-lip adhesion and 39% underwent tracheotomy. Fifteen percent of patients initially had tongue-lip adhesion subsequently required tracheotomy. While the preferred treatment for respiratory compromise differed between the two institutions, the percentage of patients requiring operative intervention was similar. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of Robin sequence is multifactorial and syndromic in nearly half of the patients. Operative treatment of respiratory failure was required in 44% of infants; the rate was similar in both hospitals. The operative approach differed significantly between the institutions, however, based on the philosophy and training of the managing surgical specialty. Co-morbid factors such as baseline cardiopulmonary and neurologic status did not play a significant role in surgical decision making.",

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more.

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Computed tomographic (CT) scans are often obtained before mandibular distraction osteogenesis in patients with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. There is concern regarding the risk of radiation exposure from CT in children. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether preoperative CT is necessary for adequate airway, feeding, and aesthetic outcomes following mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective review of medical records, infants who underwent mandibular distraction between January 1, 1998, and September 30, 2014, at 2 tertiary children's hospitals were identified using procedure codes. Data analysis was conducted December 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. Fifty-two patients fit the inclusion criteria of isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome, of being younger than 9 months at the time of distraction, and of use of external distractors. Forty-two of these infants did not receive preoperative CT imaging. EXPOSURE: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of infants who were able to avoid tracheostomy or achieve decannulation, who were able to avoid placement or achieve removal of a gastrostomy tube, and in whom there were no intraoperative complications, no open-bite deformity, no malocclusion, no asymmetry, and no postoperative complications. RESULTS: In comparison with the 10 infants who underwent preoperative CT, all 42 of the infants (100%) who did not receive preoperative CT imaging successfully avoided tracheostomy or achieved decannulation (P = .04) and 40 patients (95%) did not require placement of a gastrostomy tube or were able to undergo gastrostomy tube removal postoperatively (P < .001). There were no significant differences between the CT and non-CT groups in the other 5 outcome measures. Two patients (5%) required postoperative gastrostomy tube placement, 2 patients (5%) had minor intraoperative complications that might have been anticipated with CT, 2 patients (5%) demonstrated malocclusion, and 1 infant (2%) had asymmetry at the end of the distraction phase. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This series suggests that the absence of preoperative CT does not compromise functional or aesthetic outcomes in mandibular distraction with external distraction devices in infants with isolated Pierre Robin sequence or Stickler syndrome. This finding has implications for cost containment and reduction of radiation exposure to a vulnerable population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, of 69 patients with PRS, attending between 1991 and 2010 at the Children's University Hospital in Dublin. Data regarding airway management, nutritional status and hearing difficulties was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Airway obstruction requiring intervention other than positional therapy was seen in 39% (27) patients. Fifty nine percent (16/27) of these patients, who failed positional therapy, were successfully managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Following failed intervention with nasopharyngeal airways, two patients had airway maintenance achieved with a successful glossopexy procedure. One patient had an adequate airway achieved with nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Eight patients (12%) required a surgical tracheostomy. Of those who required a tracheostomy, six patients had isolated PRS, one patient had PRS in association with Stickler syndrome and one patient had Nager acro-facial dystosis. Duration of tracheostomy tube ranged from 10 to 19 months, mean 13 months. Seventy percent (48 patients) required supplementary feeding in the form of nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube. Forty-four patients were successfully managed with a temporary NG tube. One patient required a prolonged NG tube, and three required a gastrostomy tube. Twenty-one (30%) patients were successfully managed with a specialised Haberman bottle. Twenty-four patients (35%) who had their airway managed successfully by positional therapy, still required supplemental feeding. Thirty-one patients (45%) demonstrated a conductive hearing loss at some stage, which affected their speech and language development. Twenty-four patients (35%) required tympanostomy tube insertion once, while 7 (10%) of patients required ventilation tube insertion twice or more. CONCLUSION: Airway management in the majority of PRS can be successfully achieved by conservative methods. Even in the presence of an adequate airway, many patients will require supplemental feeding. Early audiological assessment is necessary as many patients will need tympanostomy tube placement to ensure adequate speech and language development.",

The aim of this study was to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2. RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5 years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation. At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del; p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.",

METHODS: Case report with fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: We describe a case of an asymptomatic, 11-year-old male with a chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multiple peripheral macrocysts. The patient had count fingers visual acuity upon presentation. The detachment was successfully surgically repaired with scleral buckling, subretinal fluid drainage, cryotherapy, with a SF6 tamponade. At the 12-month follow-up, the retina remained attached with improvement of visual acuity to 20/100 with resolution of the cysts. Optical coherence tomography revealed loss of macular ellipsoid zone. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous dominant COL11A1 mutation. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of chronic retinal detachment presenting with multiple peripheral macrocysts in a pediatric patient with Stickler's Syndrome. More research is needed into the cause and significance of retinal macrocysts, particularly in the pediatric population.",

METHODS: Retrospective case-review of 115 patients with Robin sequence managed between 1962 and 2002 at two tertiary-care teaching hospitals for evaluation of demographic information, clinical findings, and treatment interventions. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent (N=63) of patients were nonsyndromic. Syndromic patients included: Stickler syndrome (18%), velocardiofacial syndrome (7%), Treacher-Collins (5%), facial and hemifacial microsomia (3%), and other defined (3.5%) and undefined (9%) disorders. There was no statistical difference between the syndromic and nonsyndromic patients with regard to need for operative airway management (Fisher's exact test, p=0.264). Forty-two percent of patients required a feeding gastrostomy tube to correct feeding difficulties. Patients with a syndromic diagnosis were more likely to be developmentally delayed. Fifty-one (44%) patients underwent operative airway management: 61% underwent tongue-lip adhesion and 39% underwent tracheotomy. Fifteen percent of patients initially had tongue-lip adhesion subsequently required tracheotomy. While the preferred treatment for respiratory compromise differed between the two institutions, the percentage of patients requiring operative intervention was similar. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of Robin sequence is multifactorial and syndromic in nearly half of the patients. Operative treatment of respiratory failure was required in 44% of infants; the rate was similar in both hospitals. The operative approach differed significantly between the institutions, however, based on the philosophy and training of the managing surgical specialty. Co-morbid factors such as baseline cardiopulmonary and neurologic status did not play a significant role in surgical decision making.",

Infants suffering from severe upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties due to glossoptosis are the candidates for this procedure and are predicted to demonstrate difficult airway and difficult intubation. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the perioperative management of 19 infants undergoing glossopexy procedure at our institution from 1992 to 2010. RESULTS: Out of 19 patients, Pierre Robin sequence was diagnosed in 17, Treacher Collins syndrome in 1, and Stickler syndrome in 1. In all of them, inhalation anesthesia was induced with a nasopharyngeal tube in place. Nine patients underwent fiberoptic intubation. After surgery, 12 patients were extubated in the operating room and 11 of them required a nasopharyngeal tube to keep the airway open. Seven patients left the operating room with the trachea intubated. Two patients received tracheostomy at the age of 2 months. Seventeen patients underwent release of tongue-lip adhesion coincidentally with the palate repair at 7-14 months of age. For this surgery, no one required fiberoptic intubation. CONCLUSIONS: The airway of these patients should be managed carefully not only before but also after the operation. A nasopharyngeal tube was effective in maintaining the upper airway patency during anesthesia induction and before and after operation.",

                    "abstract": "Procedures to relieve airway obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) include glossopexy, mandibular distraction, and tracheostomy. Previously, it has been suggested that the imbalance of the genioglossus insertion on the mandible could be responsible for the micrognathia, tongue elevation, and glossoptosis seen in PRS. We performed a retrospective study to determine the usefulness of subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth in PRS with airway problems. Between 1991 and 2005, 14 consecutive patients with PRS were treated with subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth performed at the British Columbia's Children's Hospital. There were 8 boys and 6 girls. Mean age at surgery was 15 weeks (range, 1-68 weeks). Postoperative follow-up ranged from 8 months to 13 years. Seven patients (4 boys and 3 girls) were successfully treated, and a tracheostomy was prevented. Fifty-five percent of the syndromic patients needed a tracheostomy, whereas 1 patient (33%) with isolated PRS needed a tracheostomy. The most common syndrome associated with PRS was Stickler syndrome. Five (72%) of the 7 patients who required a tracheostomy were boys. If conservative measures fail to relieve supraglottic airway obstruction seen in patients with PRS, a subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth can be an effective intervention in certain patients. It is a simple intervention with few complications and little morbidity. More investigations are mandatory to precisely define patient characteristics ideal for this intervention.",

It can arise from a mutation in the collagen associated gene. We present a case of Stickler syndrome with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. CASE: A 10-years-old boy was referred to us with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment of the right eye. His family history included eye disease and a cleft palate. He had high myopia, vitreous liquefaction and lattice degeneration in the both eye. He also had a cleft palate and a broad nasal bridge. His condition was diagnosed as Stickler syndrome. We performed vitrectomy, scleral buckling and encircling, and silicone oil injection in the right eye. We also did a reattachment of the retina in the right eye. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric retinal detachment may indicate the presence of Stickler syndrome and a complete examination of the eye as well as a full family history must be obtained in such cases.",

                    "abstract": "AIMS: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The aim of this study was to review ZNF469 mutations associated with BCS type 1 to date and to describe an additional case of Czech/Polish background. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was undertaken to identify the molecular genetic cause of disease in the proband. Sequence variants in ZNF469 previously reported as BCS type 1-causing were searched in the literature, manually curated and aligned to the reference sequence NM_001127464.2. RESULTS: The proband has been reviewed since childhood with progressive myopia and hearing loss. Aged 13 years had been diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Aged 16.5 years, he developed acute hydrops in the left eye managed by corneal transplantation. At the age of 26, he experienced right corneal rupture after blunt trauma, also managed by grafting. He had a number of secondary complications and despite regular follow-up and timely management, the right eye became totally blind and the left eye had light perception at the last follow-up visit, aged 42. He was found to be a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations c.1705C>T; p.(Gln569*) and c.1402_1411del; p.(Pro468Alafs*31) in ZNF469. In total 22 disease-causing variants in ZNF469 have been identified, mainly in consanguineous families or endogamous populations. Only four probands, including the case described in the current study, harboured compound heterozygous mutations. CONCLUSION: BCS occurs very rarely in outbred populations which may cause diagnostic errors due to poor awareness of the disease. Investigation into the underlying molecular genetic cause in patients with connective tissue disorders may lead to a re-evaluation of their clinical diagnosis.",
