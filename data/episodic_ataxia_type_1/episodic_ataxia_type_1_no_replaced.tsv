15474044	An episodic ataxia type-1 mutation in the S1 segment sensitises the hKv1.1 potassium channel to extracellular Zn2+.	Episodic ataxia type-1 (EA1) is a human neurological syndrome characterized by attacks of generalized ataxia and by continuous myokymia that has been associated with point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNA1. Although important advancement has been made in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of EA1, several disease-causing mechanisms remain poorly understood. F184C is an EA1 mutation that is located within the S1 segment of the human Kv1.1 subunit. Here, we show that the F184C mutation increases approximately 4.5-fold the sensitivity of the channel to extracellular Zn2+. Both Zn2+and Cd2+ markedly alter the activation kinetics of F184C channel. In addition, the mutated channel reacts with several methane thiosulfonate reagents which specifically affected channel function. The results provide structural implications and indicate that sensitisation of hKv1.1 to Zn2+ is likely to contribute to the EA1 symptoms in patients harboring the F184C mutation.
18926884	A novel KCNA1 mutation identified in an Italian family affected by episodic ataxia type 1.	Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a rare human neurological syndrome characterized by continuous myokymia and attacks of generalized ataxia that can be triggered by abrupt movements, emotional stress and fatigue. An Italian family has been identified where related members displayed continuous myokymia, episodes of ataxia, attacks characterized by myokymia only, and neuromyotonia. A novel missense mutation (F414C), in the C-terminal region of the K(+) channel Kv1.1, was identified in the affected individuals. The mutant homotetrameric channels were non-functional in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In addition, heteromeric channels resulting from the co-expression of wild-type Kv1.1 and Kv1.1(F414C), or wild-type Kv1.2 and Kv1.1(F414C) subunits displayed reduced current amplitudes and altered gating properties. This indicates that the pathogenic effect of this KCNA1 mutation is likely to be related to the defective functional properties we have identified.
32331416	Kv1.1 Channelopathies: Pathophysiological Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches.	Kv1.1 belongs to the Shaker subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels and acts as a critical regulator of neuronal excitability in the central and peripheral nervous systems. KCNA1 is the only gene that has been associated with episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ataxia and myokymia and for which different and variable phenotypes have now been reported. The iterative characterization of channel defects at the molecular, network, and organismal levels contributed to elucidating the functional consequences of KCNA1 mutations and to demonstrate that ataxic attacks and neuromyotonia result from cerebellum and motor nerve alterations. Dysfunctions of the Kv1.1 channel have been also associated with epilepsy and kcna1 knock-out mouse is considered a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The tissue-specific association of Kv1.1 with other Kv1 members, auxiliary and interacting subunits amplifies Kv1.1 physiological roles and expands the pathogenesis of Kv1.1-associated diseases. In line with the current knowledge, Kv1.1 has been proposed as a novel and promising target for the treatment of brain disorders characterized by hyperexcitability, in the attempt to overcome limited response and side effects of available therapies. This review recounts past and current studies clarifying the roles of Kv1.1 in and beyond the nervous system and its contribution to EA1 and seizure susceptibility as well as its wide pharmacological potential.

35655106	Episodic Ataxia Type 1: Natural History and Effect on Quality of Life.	Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a rare autosomal potassium channelopathy, due to mutations in KCNA1. Patients have childhood onset of intermittent attacks of ataxia, dizziness or imbalance. In order to quantify the natural history of EA1, its effect on quality of life and in preparation for future clinical trials, we set up an international multi-centre study of EA1. We recruited thirty-three participants with EA1: twenty-three completed 1-year follow-up and eighteen completed 2-year follow-up. There was very little accumulation of disability or impairment over the course of the 2 years of the study. The outcome measures of ataxia (SARA and functional rating of ataxia) and the activities of daily living scale were largely stable over time. Self-reported health-related quality of life (SF-36) scores were lower across all domains than controls, in keeping with a chronic condition. Physical subdomain scores appeared to deteriorate over time, which seems to be driven by the female participants in the study. This is an interesting finding and warrants further study. Attacks of EA1 reported by participants in real time via an interactive voice response system showed that symptoms were not stereotyped; however, attack duration and frequency was stable between individuals. This large prospective study is the first ever completed in subjects with EA1. We document the natural history of the disorder over 2 years. These data will enable the development of outcome measures for clinical trials of treatment.
