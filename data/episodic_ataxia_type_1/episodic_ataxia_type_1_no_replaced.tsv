15843481	Involvement of kv1 potassium channels in spreading acidification and depression in the cerebellar cortex. Spreading acidification and depression (SAD) is a form of propagated activity in the cerebellar cortex characterized by acidification and a transient depression in excitability. This study investigated the role of Kv1 potassium channels in SAD using neutral red, flavoprotein autofluorescence, and voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging in the mouse cerebellar cortex, in vivo. The probability of evoking SAD was greatly increased by blocking Kv1.1 as well as Kv1.2 potassium channels by their specific blockers dendrotoxin K (DTX-K) and tityustoxin (TsTX), respectively. DTX-K not only greatly lowered the threshold for evoking SAD but also resulted in multiple cycles of spread and spontaneous SAD. The occurrence of spontaneous SAD originating from spontaneous parallel fiber-like beams of activity suggests that blocking Kv1 channels increased parallel fiber excitability. This was confirmed by the generation of parallel fiber-like beams with the microinjection of glutamate into the upper molecular layer in the presence of DTX-K. The dramatic effects of DTX-K suggest a possible connection between SAD and episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), a Kv1.1 potassium channelopathy. The threshold for evoking SAD was significantly lowered in the Kv1.1 heterozygous knockout mouse compared with wild-type littermates. Carbamazepine and acetazolamide, both effective in the treatment of EA1, significantly decreased the likelihood of evoking SAD. Blocking GABAergic neurotransmission did not alter the effectiveness of DTX-K. The cyclin D2 null mouse, which lacks cerebellar stellate cells, also exhibited SAD. Therefore blocking Kv1 potassium channels establishes the conditions needed to generate SAD. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that SAD may underlie the transient attacks of ataxia characterizing EA1.
28193892	Kv1.1 channelopathy abolishes presynaptic spike width modulation by subthreshold somatic depolarization. Although action potentials propagate along axons in an all-or-none manner, subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations at the soma affect neurotransmitter release from synaptic boutons. An important mechanism underlying analog-digital modulation is depolarization-mediated inactivation of presynaptic Kv1-family potassium channels, leading to action potential broadening and increased calcium influx. Previous studies have relied heavily on recordings from blebs formed after axon transection, which may exaggerate the passive propagation of somatic depolarization. We recorded instead from small boutons supplied by intact axons identified with scanning ion conductance microscopy in primary hippocampal cultures and asked how distinct potassium channels interact in determining the basal spike width and its modulation by subthreshold somatic depolarization. Pharmacological or genetic deletion of Kv1.1 broadened presynaptic spikes without preventing further prolongation by brief depolarizing somatic prepulses. A heterozygous mouse model of episodic ataxia type 1 harboring a dominant Kv1.1 mutation had a similar broadening effect on basal spike shape as deletion of Kv1.1; however, spike modulation by somatic prepulses was abolished. These results argue that the Kv1.1 subunit is not necessary for subthreshold modulation of spike width. However, a disease-associated mutant subunit prevents the interplay of analog and digital transmission, possibly by disrupting the normal stoichiometry of presynaptic potassium channels.
25659636	Whole-exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool in a family with episodic ataxia type 1. Complex neurologic phenotypes are inherently difficult to diagnose. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is a new tool in the neurologist's diagnostic armamentarium. Whole-exome sequencing can be applied to investigate the "diagnostic odyssey" cases. These cases involve patients with rare diseases that likely have a genetic etiology but have failed to be diagnosed by clinical evaluation and targeted gene testing. We describe such a case, a 22-year-old man who had mild intellectual developmental disability and episodes of jerking ataxic movements that affected his whole body. He underwent numerous multidisciplinary and multicentric evaluations throughout his life that failed to establish a clear diagnosis. Following his visit to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, WES was applied for genetic determination of the unknown disorder in the proband and his biological parents and sister. Additional clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance neuroimaging, electromyography, and electroencephalography of the proband were performed to verify the phenotype after the WES results were available. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the application of WES to facilitate the diagnosis of episodic ataxia type 1. This case illustrates that WES supported by clinical data is a useful and time-saving tool in the evaluation of patients with rare and complex hereditary disorders.
15474044	An episodic ataxia type-1 mutation in the S1 segment sensitises the hKv1.1 potassium channel to extracellular Zn2+. Episodic ataxia type-1 (EA1) is a human neurological syndrome characterized by attacks of generalized ataxia and by continuous myokymia that has been associated with point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNA1. Although important advancement has been made in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of EA1, several disease-causing mechanisms remain poorly understood. F184C is an EA1 mutation that is located within the S1 segment of the human Kv1.1 subunit. Here, we show that the F184C mutation increases approximately 4.5-fold the sensitivity of the channel to extracellular Zn2+. Both Zn2+and Cd2+ markedly alter the activation kinetics of F184C channel. In addition, the mutated channel reacts with several methane thiosulfonate reagents which specifically affected channel function. The results provide structural implications and indicate that sensitisation of hKv1.1 to Zn2+ is likely to contribute to the EA1 symptoms in patients harboring the F184C mutation.
27381274	Action potential broadening in a presynaptic channelopathy. Brain development and interictal function are unaffected in many paroxysmal neurological channelopathies, possibly explained by homoeostatic plasticity of synaptic transmission. Episodic ataxia type 1 is caused by missense mutations of the potassium channel Kv1.1, which is abundantly expressed in the terminals of cerebellar basket cells. Presynaptic action potentials of small inhibitory terminals have not been characterized, and it is not known whether developmental plasticity compensates for the effects of Kv1.1 dysfunction. Here we use visually targeted patch-clamp recordings from basket cell terminals of mice harbouring an ataxia-associated mutation and their wild-type littermates. Presynaptic spikes are followed by a pronounced afterdepolarization, and are broadened by pharmacological blockade of Kv1.1 or by a dominant ataxia-associated mutation. Somatic recordings fail to detect such changes. Spike broadening leads to increased Ca(2+) influx and GABA release, and decreased spontaneous Purkinje cell firing. We find no evidence for developmental compensation for inherited Kv1.1 dysfunction.
9183251	Acetazolamide-responsive episodic ataxia in an Italian family refines gene mapping on chromosome 19p13. Episodic ataxia type 2 is an autosomal dominant disorder with attacks of vertigo and ataxia which respond to acetazolamide treatment. The gene, distinct from the KCNA1 responsible for episodic ataxia type 1, has been mapped on chromosome 19p13 in a 11-12 cM region. A large Italian kindred affected with acetazolamide-responsive episodic ataxia is reported, with onset in adulthood, a strong vestibular component during attacks and a high frequency of cerebellar vermis degeneration. The genetic analysis (i) showed strong linkage between the disease and the 19p13 microsatellite markers in a region which widely overlaps that previously reported and (ii) set a new distal boundary of the gene-containing region. Combining present and previous mapping data, the gene of episodic etaxia type 2 is most probably located in an interval approximately 1.5 Mb between markers D19S221 and D19S226.
18926884	A novel KCNA1 mutation identified in an Italian family affected by episodic ataxia type 1. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a rare human neurological syndrome characterized by continuous myokymia and attacks of generalized ataxia that can be triggered by abrupt movements, emotional stress and fatigue. An Italian family has been identified where related members displayed continuous myokymia, episodes of ataxia, attacks characterized by myokymia only, and neuromyotonia. A novel missense mutation (F414C), in the C-terminal region of the K(+) channel Kv1.1, was identified in the affected individuals. The mutant homotetrameric channels were non-functional in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In addition, heteromeric channels resulting from the co-expression of wild-type Kv1.1 and Kv1.1(F414C), or wild-type Kv1.2 and Kv1.1(F414C) subunits displayed reduced current amplitudes and altered gating properties. This indicates that the pathogenic effect of this KCNA1 mutation is likely to be related to the defective functional properties we have identified.
19205071	A novel KCNA1 mutation associated with global delay and persistent cerebellar dysfunction. Episodic Ataxia Type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by episodes of ataxia and myokymia. It is associated with mutations in the KCNA1 voltage-gated potassium channel gene. In the present study, we describe a family with novel clinical features including persistent cerebellar dysfunction, cerebellar atrophy, and cognitive delay. All affected family members have myokymia and epilepsy, but only one individual has episodes of vertigo. Additional features include postural abnormalities, episodic stiffness and weakness. A novel KCNA1 mutation (c.1222G>T) which replaces a highly conserved valine with leucine at position 408 (p.Val408Leu) was identified in affected family members, and was found to augment the ability of the channel to inactivate. Together, our data suggests that KCNA1 mutations are associated with a broader clinical phenotype, which may include persistent cerebellar dysfunction and cognitive delay.
23457223	Ion channel disorders: still a fascinating topic--news on episodic ataxia type 1. 
23677664	Acetazolamide-responsive ataxia. Acetazolamide-responsive ataxia represents a unique collection of genetically distinct episodic ataxia (EA) disorders associated with paroxysmal cerebellar symptoms many of which are responsive to medical treatment with acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Among all of the subtypes of episodic ataxia, types 2 (EA2), 3 (EA3), and 5 (EA5) are thought be the most medication responsive. Some patients with episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) will also describe improvement with acetazolamide. Each of these individual genetic syndromes is characterized by its own unique mechanism and clinical presentation. In this review, the author provides an overview of the pathophysiology of acetazolamide-responsive ataxia, its natural history, and its clinical management.
22206926	Kcna1-mutant rats dominantly display myokymia, neuromyotonia and spontaneous epileptic seizures. Mutations in the KCNA1 gene, which encodes for the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1, cause episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1). EA1 is a dominant human neurological disorder characterized by variable phenotypes of brief episodes of ataxia, myokymia, neuromyotonia, and associated epilepsy. Animal models for EA1 include Kcna1-deficient mice, which recessively display severe seizures and die prematurely, and V408A-knock-in mice, which dominantly exhibit stress-induced loss of motor coordination. In the present study, we have identified an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized rat, named autosomal dominant myokymia and seizures (ADMS), with a missense mutation (S309T) in the voltage-sensor domain, S4, of the Kcna1 gene. ADMS rats dominantly exhibited myokymia, neuromyotonia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. They also showed cold stress-induced tremor, neuromyotonia, and motor incoordination. Expression studies of homomeric and heteromeric Kv1.1 channels in HEK cells and Xenopus oocytes, showed that, although S309T channels are transferred to the cell membrane surface, they remained non-functional in terms of their biophysical properties, suggesting a dominant-negative effect of the S309T mutation on potassium channel function. ADMS rats provide a new model, distinct from previously reported mouse models, for studying the diverse functions of Kv1.1 in vivo, as well as for understanding the pathology of EA1.
32331416	Kv1.1 Channelopathies: Pathophysiological Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches. Kv1.1 belongs to the Shaker subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels and acts as a critical regulator of neuronal excitability in the central and peripheral nervous systems. KCNA1 is the only gene that has been associated with episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ataxia and myokymia and for which different and variable phenotypes have now been reported. The iterative characterization of channel defects at the molecular, network, and organismal levels contributed to elucidating the functional consequences of KCNA1 mutations and to demonstrate that ataxic attacks and neuromyotonia result from cerebellum and motor nerve alterations. Dysfunctions of the Kv1.1 channel have been also associated with epilepsy and kcna1 knock-out mouse is considered a model of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The tissue-specific association of Kv1.1 with other Kv1 members, auxiliary and interacting subunits amplifies Kv1.1 physiological roles and expands the pathogenesis of Kv1.1-associated diseases. In line with the current knowledge, Kv1.1 has been proposed as a novel and promising target for the treatment of brain disorders characterized by hyperexcitability, in the attempt to overcome limited response and side effects of available therapies. This review recounts past and current studies clarifying the roles of Kv1.1 in and beyond the nervous system and its contribution to EA1 and seizure susceptibility as well as its wide pharmacological potential.
15800194	Kv1.1 deletion augments the afferent hypoxic chemosensory pathway and respiration. Mutations in the potassium channel gene Kv1.1 are associated with human episodic ataxia type 1 (EA-1) syndrome characterized by movement disorders and epilepsy. Ataxic episodes in EA-1 patients are often associated with exercise or emotional stress, which suggests a prominent role for the autonomic nervous system. Many of these alterations are reproduced in the Kv1.1-null mouse. Kv1.1 also regulates excitability of sensory neurons essential in cardiovascular and respiratory reflexes. We examined the neural control of the respiratory system of littermate wild-type (control) and Kv1.1-null mice during low O2 (hypoxia). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated Kv1.1 in the afferent limb of the carotid body chemoreflex (the major regulator in the response to hypoxia), consisting of the carotid body, petrosal ganglion, and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Respiration was examined by plethysmography. Null mice exhibited a greater increase in respiration during hypoxia compared with controls. In vitro carotid body sensory discharge during hypoxia was greater in null than control mice. In the caudal NTS, evoked EPSCs in brainstem slices were similar between control and null mice. However, the frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs was greater in null mice. Null mice also exhibited more asynchronous release after a stimulus train. These results demonstrate the important role of Kv1.1 in afferent chemosensory activity and suggest that mutations in the human Kv1.1 gene have functional consequences during stress responses that involve respiratory reflexes.

11233674	Pathophysiology of epilepsy. This work reviews the current knowledge on epileptogenesis and pathophysiology of epilepsy. Recently, gene defects underlying four monogenic epilepsies (generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures, autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, benign familial neonatal convulsions and episodic ataxia type 1 with partial seizures) have been identified, shedding new light on the pathophysiology of epilepsy as these diseases are caused by ion channel mutations. Although epileptic syndromes differ pathophysiologically, common ictogenesis-related characteristics as increased neuronal excitability and synchronicity are shared as well as mechanisms involved in interictal-ictal transition. Emerging insights point to alterations of synaptic functions and intrinsic properties of neurons as common mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability. This work also reviews the neurochemical mechanisms of epilepsy. An imbalance between glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter systems can lead to hyperexcitability but catecholaminergic neurotransmitter systems and opioid peptides were shown to play a role in epileptogenesis as well. An overview of currently available anti-epileptic drugs and their presumed mechanisms of action is given as an illustration of the neurochemistry of epileptogenesis. Most anti-epileptic drugs exert their anti-epileptic properties through only a few neurochemical mechanisms that are meanwhile basic pathophysiological mechanisms thought to cause seizures.
28676720	A channelopathy mutation in the voltage-sensor discloses contributions of a conserved phenylalanine to gating properties of Kv1.1 channels and ataxia. Channelopathy mutations prove informative on disease causing mechanisms and channel gating dynamics. We have identified a novel heterozygous mutation in the KCNA1 gene of a young proband displaying typical signs and symptoms of Episodic Ataxia type 1 (EA1). This mutation is in the S4 helix of the voltage-sensing domain and results in the substitution of the highly conserved phenylalanine 303 by valine (p.F303V). The contributions of F303 towards K+ channel voltage gating are unclear and here have been assessed biophysically and by performing structural analysis using rat Kv1.2 coordinates. We observed significant positive shifts of voltage-dependence, changes in the activation, deactivation and slow inactivation kinetics, reduced window currents, and decreased current amplitudes of both Kv1.1 and Kv1.1/1.2 channels. Structural analysis revealed altered interactions between F303V and L339 and I335 of the S5 helix of a neighboring subunit. The substitution of an aromatic phenylalanine with an aliphatic valine within the voltage-sensor destabilizes the open state of the channel. Thus, F303 fine-tunes the Kv1.1 gating properties and contributes to the interactions between the S4 segment and neighboring alpha helices. The resulting channel's loss of function validates the clinical relevance of the mutation for EA1 pathogenesis.
10355668	A novel mutation in the human voltage-gated potassium channel gene (Kv1.1) associates with episodic ataxia type 1 and sometimes with partial epilepsy. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by brief episodes of ataxia associated with continuous interattack myokymia. Point mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv1.1) gene on chromosome 12p13 have recently been shown to associate with EA1. A Scottish family with EA1 harbouring a novel mutation in this gene is reported. Of the five affected individuals over three generations, two had partial epilepsy in addition to EA1. The detailed clinical, electrophysiological and molecular genetic findings are presented. The heterozygous point mutation is located at nucleotide position 677 and results in a radical amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position in the second transmembrane domain of the potassium channel. Functional studies indicated that mutant subunits exhibited a dominant negative effect on potassium channel function and would be predicted to impair neuronal repolarization. Potassium channels determine the excitability of neurons and blocking drugs are proconvulsant. A critical review of previously reported EA1 families shows an over-representation of epilepsy in family members with EA1 compared with unaffected members. These observations indicate that this mutation is pathogenic and suggest that the epilepsy in EA1 may be caused by the dysfunctional potassium channel. It is possible that such dysfunction may be relevant to other epilepsies in man.
22609489	Kv1.1 knock-in ataxic mice exhibit spontaneous myokymic activity exacerbated by fatigue, ischemia and low temperature. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder characterized by myokymia and attacks of ataxic gait often precipitated by stress. Several genetic mutations have been identified in the Shaker-like K(+) channel Kv1.1 (KCNA1) of EA1 individuals, including V408A, which result in remarkable channel dysfunction. By inserting the heterozygous V408A, mutation in one Kv1.1 allele, a mouse model of EA1 has been generated (Kv1.1(V408A/+)). Here, we investigated the neuromuscular transmission of Kv1.1(V408A/+) ataxic mice and their susceptibility to physiologically relevant stressors. By using in vivo preparations of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) nerve-muscle from Kv1.1(+/+) and Kv1.1(V408A/+) mice, we show that the mutant animals exhibit spontaneous myokymic discharges consisting of repeated singlets, duplets or multiplets, despite motor nerve axotomy. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy from the motor nerve, ex vivo, revealed spontaneous Ca(2+) signals that occurred abnormally only in preparations dissected from Kv1.1(V408A/+) mice. Spontaneous bursting activity, as well as that evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation, was exacerbated by muscle fatigue, ischemia and low temperatures. These stressors also increased the amplitude of compound muscle action potential. Such abnormal neuromuscular transmission did not alter fiber type composition, neuromuscular junction and vascularization of LG muscle, analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Taken together these findings provide direct evidence that identifies the motor nerve as an important generator of myokymic activity, that dysfunction of Kv1.1 channels alters Ca(2+) homeostasis in motor axons, and also strongly suggest that muscle fatigue contributes more than PNS fatigue to exacerbate the myokymia/neuromyotonia phenotype. More broadly, this study points out that juxtaparanodal K(+) channels composed of Kv1.1 subunits exert an important role in dampening the excitability of motor nerve axons during fatigue or ischemic insult.

15351427	Expanding the phenotype of potassium channelopathy: severe neuromyotonia and skeletal deformities without prominent Episodic Ataxia. We report an unusual family in which the same point mutation in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNA1 resulted in markedly different clinical phenotypes. The propositus presented in infancy with marked muscle stiffness, motor developmental delay, short stature, skeletal deformities, muscle hypertrophy and muscle rippling on percussion. He did not experience episodic ataxia. His mother presented some years later with typical features of Episodic Ataxia type 1 (EA1), with episodes of ataxia lasting a few minutes provoked by exercise. On examination she had myokymia, joint contractures and mild skeletal deformities. A heterozygous point mutation in the voltage-gated K(+) channel (KCNA1) gene (ACG-AGG, Thr226Arg) was found in both. We conclude that mutations in the potassium channel gene (KCNA1) can cause severe neuromyotonia resulting in marked skeletal deformities even if episodic ataxia is not prominent.
35655106	Episodic Ataxia Type 1: Natural History and Effect on Quality of Life. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a rare autosomal potassium channelopathy, due to mutations in KCNA1. Patients have childhood onset of intermittent attacks of ataxia, dizziness or imbalance. In order to quantify the natural history of EA1, its effect on quality of life and in preparation for future clinical trials, we set up an international multi-centre study of EA1. We recruited thirty-three participants with EA1: twenty-three completed 1-year follow-up and eighteen completed 2-year follow-up. There was very little accumulation of disability or impairment over the course of the 2 years of the study. The outcome measures of ataxia (SARA and functional rating of ataxia) and the activities of daily living scale were largely stable over time. Self-reported health-related quality of life (SF-36) scores were lower across all domains than controls, in keeping with a chronic condition. Physical subdomain scores appeared to deteriorate over time, which seems to be driven by the female participants in the study. This is an interesting finding and warrants further study. Attacks of EA1 reported by participants in real time via an interactive voice response system showed that symptoms were not stereotyped; however, attack duration and frequency was stable between individuals. This large prospective study is the first ever completed in subjects with EA1. We document the natural history of the disorder over 2 years. These data will enable the development of outcome measures for clinical trials of treatment.
16208529	Diagnosis and management of acute movement disorders. Most movement disorders, reflecting degenerative disorders, develop in a slowly progressive fashion. Some movement disorders, however, manifest with an acute onset. We wish to give an overview of the management and therapy of those acute-onset movement disorders.Drug-induced movement disorders are mainly caused by dopamine-receptor blockers (DRB) as used as antipsychotics (neuroleptics) and antiemetics. Acute dystonic reactions usually occur within the first four days of treatment. Typically, cranial pharyngeal and cervical muscles are affected. Anticholinergics produce a prompt relief. Akathisia is characterized by an often exceedingly bothersome feeling of restlessness and the inability to remain still. It is a common side effect of DRB and occurs within few days after their initiation. It subsides when DRB are ceased. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is a rare, but life-threatening adverse reaction to DRB which may occur at any time during DRB application. It is characterised by hyperthermia, rigidity, reduced consciousness and autonomic failure. Therapeutically immediate DRB withdrawal is crucial. Additional dantrolene or bromocriptine application together with symptomatic treatment may be necessary. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are childhood onset disorders characterised by dystonic postures, chorea, athetosis and ballism occurring at irregular intervals. In Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia they are triggered by rapid movements, startle reactions or hyperventilation. They last up to 5 minutes, occur up to 100 times per day and are highly sensitive to anticonvulsants. In Paroxysmal Non-Kinesiogenic Dyskinesia they cannot be triggered, occur less frequently and last longer. Other paroxysmal dyskinesias include hypnogenic paroxysmal dyskinesias, paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia, infantile paroxysmal dystonias, Sandifer's syndrome and symptomatic paroxysmal dyskinesias. In Hereditary Episodic Ataxia Type 1 attacks of ataxia last for up to two minutes, may be accompanied by dysarthria and dystonia and usually respond to phenytoin. In Type 2 they can last for several hours, may be accompanied by vertigo, headache and malaise and usually respond to acetazolamide. Symptomatic episodic ataxias can occur in a number of metabolic disorders, but also in multiple sclerosis and Behcet's disease.
17145502	The microtubule plus-end tracking protein EB1 is required for Kv1 voltage-gated K+ channel axonal targeting. Axonal Kv1 channels regulate action potential propagation-an evolutionarily conserved function important for the control of motor behavior as evidenced from the linkage of human Kv1 channel mutations to myokymia/episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) and the Shaker mutant phenotype in Drosophila. To search for the machinery that mediates axonal targeting of Kv1 channels composed of both alpha and beta subunits, we first demonstrate that Kvbeta2 is responsible for targeting Kv1 channels to the axon. Next, we show that Kvbeta2 axonal targeting depends on its ability to associate with the microtubule (MT) plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) EB1. Not only do Kvbeta2 and EB1 move in unison down the axon, Brefeldin A-sensitive Kv1-containing vesicles can also be found at microtubule ends near the cell membrane. In addition, we found that Kvbeta2 associates with KIF3/kinesin II as well. Indeed, Kv1 channels rely on both KIF3/kinesin II and EB1 for their axonal targeting.
23349320	Clinical, genetic, neurophysiological and functional study of new mutations in episodic ataxia type 1. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Heterozygous mutations in KCNA1 cause episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), an ion channel disorder characterised by brief paroxysms of cerebellar dysfunction and persistent neuromyotonia. This paper describes four previously unreported families with EA1, with the aim of understanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with different mutations. METHODS: 15 affected individuals from four families underwent clinical, genetic and neurophysiological evaluation. The functional impact of new mutations identified in the KCNA1 gene was investigated with in vitro electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Detailed clinical documentation, dating back to 1928 in one family, indicates that all patients manifested episodic ataxia of varying severity. Four subjects from three families reported hearing impairment, which has not previously been reported in association with EA1. New mutations (R167M, C185W and I407M) were identified in three out of the four families. When expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, all three new mutations resulted in a loss of K(v)1.1 channel function. The fourth family harboured a previously reported A242P mutation, which has not been previously described in association with ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic basis of EA1 in four families is established and this report presents the earliest documented case from 1928. All three new mutations caused a loss of K(v)1.1 channel function. The finding of deafness in four individuals raises the possibility of a link between K(v)1.1 dysfunction and hearing impairment. Our findings broaden the phenotypic range associated with mutations in KCNA1.
