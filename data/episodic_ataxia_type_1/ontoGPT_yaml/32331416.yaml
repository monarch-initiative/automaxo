input_text: 'Kv1.1 Channelopathies: Pathophysiological Mechanisms and Therapeutic
  Approaches. Kv1.1 belongs to the Shaker subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels
  and acts as a critical regulator of neuronal excitability in the central and peripheral
  nervous systems. KCNA1 is the only gene that has been associated with episodic ataxia
  type 1 (EA1), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by ataxia and myokymia
  and for which different and variable phenotypes have now been reported. The iterative
  characterization of channel defects at the molecular, network, and organismal levels
  contributed to elucidating the functional consequences of KCNA1 mutations and to
  demonstrate that ataxic attacks and neuromyotonia result from cerebellum and motor
  nerve alterations. Dysfunctions of the Kv1.1 channel have been also associated with
  epilepsy and kcna1 knock-out mouse is considered a model of sudden unexpected death
  in epilepsy. The tissue-specific association of Kv1.1 with other Kv1 members, auxiliary
  and interacting subunits amplifies Kv1.1 physiological roles and expands the pathogenesis
  of Kv1.1-associated diseases. In line with the current knowledge, Kv1.1 has been
  proposed as a novel and promising target for the treatment of brain disorders characterized
  by hyperexcitability, in the attempt to overcome limited response and side effects
  of available therapies. This review recounts past and current studies clarifying
  the roles of Kv1.1 in and beyond the nervous system and its contribution to EA1
  and seizure susceptibility as well as its wide pharmacological potential.'
