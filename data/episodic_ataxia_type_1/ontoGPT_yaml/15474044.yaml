input_text: An episodic ataxia type-1 mutation in the S1 segment sensitises the hKv1.1
  potassium channel to extracellular Zn2+. Episodic ataxia type-1 (EA1) is a human
  neurological syndrome characterized by attacks of generalized ataxia and by continuous
  myokymia that has been associated with point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium
  channel gene KCNA1. Although important advancement has been made in understanding
  the molecular pathophysiology of EA1, several disease-causing mechanisms remain
  poorly understood. F184C is an EA1 mutation that is located within the S1 segment
  of the human Kv1.1 subunit. Here, we show that the F184C mutation increases approximately
  4.5-fold the sensitivity of the channel to extracellular Zn2+. Both Zn2+and Cd2+
  markedly alter the activation kinetics of F184C channel. In addition, the mutated
  channel reacts with several methane thiosulfonate reagents which specifically affected
  channel function. The results provide structural implications and indicate that
  sensitisation of hKv1.1 to Zn2+ is likely to contribute to the EA1 symptoms in patients
  harboring the F184C mutation.
