input_text: Kcna1-mutant rats dominantly display myokymia, neuromyotonia and spontaneous
  epileptic seizures. Mutations in the KCNA1 gene, which encodes for the alpha subunit
  of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1, cause episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1).
  EA1 is a dominant human neurological disorder characterized by variable phenotypes
  of brief episodes of ataxia, myokymia, neuromyotonia, and associated epilepsy. Animal
  models for EA1 include Kcna1-deficient mice, which recessively display severe seizures
  and die prematurely, and V408A-knock-in mice, which dominantly exhibit stress-induced
  loss of motor coordination. In the present study, we have identified an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized
  rat, named autosomal dominant myokymia and seizures (ADMS), with a missense mutation
  (S309T) in the voltage-sensor domain, S4, of the Kcna1 gene. ADMS rats dominantly
  exhibited myokymia, neuromyotonia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. They also
  showed cold stress-induced tremor, neuromyotonia, and motor incoordination. Expression
  studies of homomeric and heteromeric Kv1.1 channels in HEK cells and Xenopus oocytes,
  showed that, although S309T channels are transferred to the cell membrane surface,
  they remained non-functional in terms of their biophysical properties, suggesting
  a dominant-negative effect of the S309T mutation on potassium channel function.
  ADMS rats provide a new model, distinct from previously reported mouse models, for
  studying the diverse functions of Kv1.1 in vivo, as well as for understanding the
  pathology of EA1.
