input_text: Whole-exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool in a family with episodic
  ataxia type 1. Complex neurologic phenotypes are inherently difficult to diagnose.
  Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is a new tool in the neurologist's diagnostic armamentarium.
  Whole-exome sequencing can be applied to investigate the "diagnostic odyssey" cases.
  These cases involve patients with rare diseases that likely have a genetic etiology
  but have failed to be diagnosed by clinical evaluation and targeted gene testing.
  We describe such a case, a 22-year-old man who had mild intellectual developmental
  disability and episodes of jerking ataxic movements that affected his whole body.
  He underwent numerous multidisciplinary and multicentric evaluations throughout
  his life that failed to establish a clear diagnosis. Following his visit to Mayo
  Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, WES was applied for genetic determination of the
  unknown disorder in the proband and his biological parents and sister. Additional
  clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance neuroimaging, electromyography, and electroencephalography
  of the proband were performed to verify the phenotype after the WES results were
  available. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the application of WES
  to facilitate the diagnosis of episodic ataxia type 1. This case illustrates that
  WES supported by clinical data is a useful and time-saving tool in the evaluation
  of patients with rare and complex hereditary disorders.
