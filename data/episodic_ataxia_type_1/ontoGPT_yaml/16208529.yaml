input_text: Diagnosis and management of acute movement disorders. Most movement disorders,
  reflecting degenerative disorders, develop in a slowly progressive fashion. Some
  movement disorders, however, manifest with an acute onset. We wish to give an overview
  of the management and therapy of those acute-onset movement disorders.Drug-induced
  movement disorders are mainly caused by dopamine-receptor blockers (DRB) as used
  as antipsychotics (neuroleptics) and antiemetics. Acute dystonic reactions usually
  occur within the first four days of treatment. Typically, cranial pharyngeal and
  cervical muscles are affected. Anticholinergics produce a prompt relief. Akathisia
  is characterized by an often exceedingly bothersome feeling of restlessness and
  the inability to remain still. It is a common side effect of DRB and occurs within
  few days after their initiation. It subsides when DRB are ceased. Neuroleptic Malignant
  Syndrome is a rare, but life-threatening adverse reaction to DRB which may occur
  at any time during DRB application. It is characterised by hyperthermia, rigidity,
  reduced consciousness and autonomic failure. Therapeutically immediate DRB withdrawal
  is crucial. Additional dantrolene or bromocriptine application together with symptomatic
  treatment may be necessary. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are childhood onset disorders
  characterised by dystonic postures, chorea, athetosis and ballism occurring at irregular
  intervals. In Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia they are triggered by rapid movements,
  startle reactions or hyperventilation. They last up to 5 minutes, occur up to 100
  times per day and are highly sensitive to anticonvulsants. In Paroxysmal Non-Kinesiogenic
  Dyskinesia they cannot be triggered, occur less frequently and last longer. Other
  paroxysmal dyskinesias include hypnogenic paroxysmal dyskinesias, paroxysmal exertional
  dyskinesia, infantile paroxysmal dystonias, Sandifer's syndrome and symptomatic
  paroxysmal dyskinesias. In Hereditary Episodic Ataxia Type 1 attacks of ataxia last
  for up to two minutes, may be accompanied by dysarthria and dystonia and usually
  respond to phenytoin. In Type 2 they can last for several hours, may be accompanied
  by vertigo, headache and malaise and usually respond to acetazolamide. Symptomatic
  episodic ataxias can occur in a number of metabolic disorders, but also in multiple
  sclerosis and Behcet's disease.
