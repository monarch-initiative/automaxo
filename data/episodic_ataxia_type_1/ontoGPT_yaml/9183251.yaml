input_text: Acetazolamide-responsive episodic ataxia in an Italian family refines
  gene mapping on chromosome 19p13. Episodic ataxia type 2 is an autosomal dominant
  disorder with attacks of vertigo and ataxia which respond to acetazolamide treatment.
  The gene, distinct from the KCNA1 responsible for episodic ataxia type 1, has been
  mapped on chromosome 19p13 in a 11-12 cM region. A large Italian kindred affected
  with acetazolamide-responsive episodic ataxia is reported, with onset in adulthood,
  a strong vestibular component during attacks and a high frequency of cerebellar
  vermis degeneration. The genetic analysis (i) showed strong linkage between the
  disease and the 19p13 microsatellite markers in a region which widely overlaps that
  previously reported and (ii) set a new distal boundary of the gene-containing region.
  Combining present and previous mapping data, the gene of episodic etaxia type 2
  is most probably located in an interval approximately 1.5 Mb between markers D19S221
  and D19S226.
