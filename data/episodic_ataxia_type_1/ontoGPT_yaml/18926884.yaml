input_text: A novel KCNA1 mutation identified in an Italian family affected by episodic
  ataxia type 1. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a rare human neurological syndrome
  characterized by continuous myokymia and attacks of generalized ataxia that can
  be triggered by abrupt movements, emotional stress and fatigue. An Italian family
  has been identified where related members displayed continuous myokymia, episodes
  of ataxia, attacks characterized by myokymia only, and neuromyotonia. A novel missense
  mutation (F414C), in the C-terminal region of the K(+) channel Kv1.1, was identified
  in the affected individuals. The mutant homotetrameric channels were non-functional
  in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In addition, heteromeric channels resulting from the
  co-expression of wild-type Kv1.1 and Kv1.1(F414C), or wild-type Kv1.2 and Kv1.1(F414C)
  subunits displayed reduced current amplitudes and altered gating properties. This
  indicates that the pathogenic effect of this KCNA1 mutation is likely to be related
  to the defective functional properties we have identified.
