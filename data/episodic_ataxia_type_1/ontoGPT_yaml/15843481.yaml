input_text: Involvement of kv1 potassium channels in spreading acidification and depression
  in the cerebellar cortex. Spreading acidification and depression (SAD) is a form
  of propagated activity in the cerebellar cortex characterized by acidification and
  a transient depression in excitability. This study investigated the role of Kv1
  potassium channels in SAD using neutral red, flavoprotein autofluorescence, and
  voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging in the mouse cerebellar cortex, in vivo. The
  probability of evoking SAD was greatly increased by blocking Kv1.1 as well as Kv1.2
  potassium channels by their specific blockers dendrotoxin K (DTX-K) and tityustoxin
  (TsTX), respectively. DTX-K not only greatly lowered the threshold for evoking SAD
  but also resulted in multiple cycles of spread and spontaneous SAD. The occurrence
  of spontaneous SAD originating from spontaneous parallel fiber-like beams of activity
  suggests that blocking Kv1 channels increased parallel fiber excitability. This
  was confirmed by the generation of parallel fiber-like beams with the microinjection
  of glutamate into the upper molecular layer in the presence of DTX-K. The dramatic
  effects of DTX-K suggest a possible connection between SAD and episodic ataxia type
  1 (EA1), a Kv1.1 potassium channelopathy. The threshold for evoking SAD was significantly
  lowered in the Kv1.1 heterozygous knockout mouse compared with wild-type littermates.
  Carbamazepine and acetazolamide, both effective in the treatment of EA1, significantly
  decreased the likelihood of evoking SAD. Blocking GABAergic neurotransmission did
  not alter the effectiveness of DTX-K. The cyclin D2 null mouse, which lacks cerebellar
  stellate cells, also exhibited SAD. Therefore blocking Kv1 potassium channels establishes
  the conditions needed to generate SAD. Furthermore, the results are consistent with
  the hypothesis that SAD may underlie the transient attacks of ataxia characterizing
  EA1.
