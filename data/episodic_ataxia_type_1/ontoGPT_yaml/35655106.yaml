input_text: 'Episodic Ataxia Type 1: Natural History and Effect on Quality of Life.
  Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a rare autosomal potassium channelopathy, due to
  mutations in KCNA1. Patients have childhood onset of intermittent attacks of ataxia,
  dizziness or imbalance. In order to quantify the natural history of EA1, its effect
  on quality of life and in preparation for future clinical trials, we set up an international
  multi-centre study of EA1. We recruited thirty-three participants with EA1: twenty-three
  completed 1-year follow-up and eighteen completed 2-year follow-up. There was very
  little accumulation of disability or impairment over the course of the 2 years of
  the study. The outcome measures of ataxia (SARA and functional rating of ataxia)
  and the activities of daily living scale were largely stable over time. Self-reported
  health-related quality of life (SF-36) scores were lower across all domains than
  controls, in keeping with a chronic condition. Physical subdomain scores appeared
  to deteriorate over time, which seems to be driven by the female participants in
  the study. This is an interesting finding and warrants further study. Attacks of
  EA1 reported by participants in real time via an interactive voice response system
  showed that symptoms were not stereotyped; however, attack duration and frequency
  was stable between individuals. This large prospective study is the first ever completed
  in subjects with EA1. We document the natural history of the disorder over 2 years.
  These data will enable the development of outcome measures for clinical trials of
  treatment.'
