input_text: A novel mutation in the human voltage-gated potassium channel gene (Kv1.1)
  associates with episodic ataxia type 1 and sometimes with partial epilepsy. Episodic
  ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by brief
  episodes of ataxia associated with continuous interattack myokymia. Point mutations
  in the human voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv1.1) gene on chromosome 12p13 have
  recently been shown to associate with EA1. A Scottish family with EA1 harbouring
  a novel mutation in this gene is reported. Of the five affected individuals over
  three generations, two had partial epilepsy in addition to EA1. The detailed clinical,
  electrophysiological and molecular genetic findings are presented. The heterozygous
  point mutation is located at nucleotide position 677 and results in a radical amino
  acid substitution at a highly conserved position in the second transmembrane domain
  of the potassium channel. Functional studies indicated that mutant subunits exhibited
  a dominant negative effect on potassium channel function and would be predicted
  to impair neuronal repolarization. Potassium channels determine the excitability
  of neurons and blocking drugs are proconvulsant. A critical review of previously
  reported EA1 families shows an over-representation of epilepsy in family members
  with EA1 compared with unaffected members. These observations indicate that this
  mutation is pathogenic and suggest that the epilepsy in EA1 may be caused by the
  dysfunctional potassium channel. It is possible that such dysfunction may be relevant
  to other epilepsies in man.
