Although important advancement has been made in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of EA1, several disease-causing mechanisms remain poorly understood. F184C is an EA1 mutation that is located within the S1 segment of the human Kv1.1 subunit. Here, we show that the F184C mutation increases approximately 4.5-fold the sensitivity of the channel to extracellular Zn2+. Both Zn2+and Cd2+ markedly alter the activation kinetics of F184C channel. In addition, the mutated channel reacts with several methane thiosulfonate reagents which specifically affected channel function. The results provide structural implications and indicate that sensitisation of hKv1.1 to Zn2+ is likely to contribute to the EA1 symptoms in patients harboring the F184C mutation.",
