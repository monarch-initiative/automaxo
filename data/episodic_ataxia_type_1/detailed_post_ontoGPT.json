Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is a rare, but life-threatening adverse reaction to DRB which may occur at any time during DRB application. It is characterised by hyperthermia, rigidity, reduced consciousness and autonomic failure. Therapeutically immediate DRB withdrawal is crucial. Additional dantrolene or bromocriptine application together with symptomatic treatment may be necessary. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are childhood onset disorders characterised by dystonic postures, chorea, athetosis and ballism occurring at irregular intervals. In Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia they are triggered by rapid movements, startle reactions or hyperventilation. They last up to 5 minutes, occur up to 100 times per day and are highly sensitive to anticonvulsants. In Paroxysmal Non-Kinesiogenic Dyskinesia they cannot be triggered, occur less frequently and last longer. Other paroxysmal dyskinesias include hypnogenic paroxysmal dyskinesias, paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia, infantile paroxysmal dystonias, Sandifer's syndrome and symptomatic paroxysmal dyskinesias. In Hereditary Episodic Ataxia Type 1 attacks of ataxia last for up to two minutes, may be accompanied by dysarthria and dystonia and usually respond to phenytoin.

We have identified a novel heterozygous mutation in the KCNA1 gene of a young proband displaying typical signs and symptoms of Episodic Ataxia type 1 (EA1). This mutation is in the S4 helix of the voltage-sensing domain and results in the substitution of the highly conserved phenylalanine 303 by valine (p.F303V). The contributions of F303 towards K+ channel voltage gating are unclear and here have been assessed biophysically and by performing structural analysis using rat Kv1.2 coordinates. We observed significant positive shifts of voltage-dependence, changes in the activation, deactivation and slow inactivation kinetics, reduced window currents, and decreased current amplitudes of both Kv1.1 and Kv1.1/1.2 channels. Structural analysis revealed altered interactions between F303V and L339 and I335 of the S5 helix of a neighboring subunit. The substitution of an aromatic phenylalanine with an aliphatic valine within the voltage-sensor destabilizes the open state of the channel. Thus, F303 fine-tunes the Kv1.1 gating properties and contributes to the interactions between the S4 segment and neighboring alpha helices. The resulting channel's loss of function validates the clinical relevance of the mutation for EA1 pathogenesis.",

Point mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv1.1) gene on chromosome 12p13 have recently been shown to associate with EA1. A Scottish family with EA1 harbouring a novel mutation in this gene is reported. Of the five affected individuals over three generations, two had partial epilepsy in addition to EA1. The detailed clinical, electrophysiological and molecular genetic findings are presented. The heterozygous point mutation is located at nucleotide position 677 and results in a radical amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position in the second transmembrane domain of the potassium channel. Functional studies indicated that mutant subunits exhibited a dominant negative effect on potassium channel function and would be predicted to impair neuronal repolarization. Potassium channels determine the excitability of neurons and blocking drugs are proconvulsant. A critical review of previously reported EA1 families shows an over-representation of epilepsy in family members with EA1 compared with unaffected members. These observations indicate that this mutation is pathogenic and suggest that the epilepsy in EA1 may be caused by the dysfunctional potassium channel. It is possible that such dysfunction may be relevant to other epilepsies in man.",

                    "abstract": "Spreading acidification and depression (SAD) is a form of propagated activity in the cerebellar cortex characterized by acidification and a transient depression in excitability. This study investigated the role of Kv1 potassium channels in SAD using neutral red, flavoprotein autofluorescence, and voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging in the mouse cerebellar cortex, in vivo. The probability of evoking SAD was greatly increased by blocking Kv1.1 as well as Kv1.2 potassium channels by their specific blockers dendrotoxin K (DTX-K) and tityustoxin (TsTX), respectively. DTX-K not only greatly lowered the threshold for evoking SAD but also resulted in multiple cycles of spread and spontaneous SAD. The occurrence of spontaneous SAD originating from spontaneous parallel fiber-like beams of activity suggests that blocking Kv1 channels increased parallel fiber excitability. This was confirmed by the generation of parallel fiber-like beams with the microinjection of glutamate into the upper molecular layer in the presence of DTX-K. The dramatic effects of DTX-K suggest a possible connection between SAD and episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), a Kv1.1 potassium channelopathy. The threshold for evoking SAD was significantly lowered in the Kv1.1 heterozygous knockout mouse compared with wild-type littermates. Carbamazepine and acetazolamide, both effective in the treatment of EA1, significantly decreased the likelihood of evoking SAD. Blocking GABAergic neurotransmission did not alter the effectiveness of DTX-K. The cyclin D2 null mouse, which lacks cerebellar stellate cells, also exhibited SAD. Therefore blocking Kv1 potassium channels establishes the conditions needed to generate SAD. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that SAD may underlie the transient attacks of ataxia characterizing EA1.",

                    "abstract": "Most movement disorders, reflecting degenerative disorders, develop in a slowly progressive fashion. Some movement disorders, however, manifest with an acute onset. We wish to give an overview of the management and therapy of those acute-onset movement disorders.Drug-induced movement disorders are mainly caused by dopamine-receptor blockers (DRB) as used as antipsychotics (neuroleptics) and antiemetics. Acute dystonic reactions usually occur within the first four days of treatment. Typically, cranial pharyngeal and cervical muscles are affected. Anticholinergics produce a prompt relief. Akathisia is characterized by an often exceedingly bothersome feeling of restlessness and the inability to remain still. It is a common side effect of DRB and occurs within few days after their initiation. It subsides when DRB are ceased. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is a rare, but life-threatening adverse reaction to DRB which may occur at any time during DRB application. It is characterised by hyperthermia, rigidity, reduced consciousness and autonomic failure. Therapeutically immediate DRB withdrawal is crucial. Additional dantrolene or bromocriptine application together with symptomatic treatment may be necessary. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are childhood onset disorders characterised by dystonic postures, chorea, athetosis and ballism occurring at irregular intervals. In Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia they are triggered by rapid movements, startle reactions or hyperventilation. They last up to 5 minutes, occur up to 100 times per day and are highly sensitive to anticonvulsants. In Paroxysmal Non-Kinesiogenic Dyskinesia they cannot be triggered, occur less frequently and last longer. Other paroxysmal dyskinesias include hypnogenic paroxysmal dyskinesias, paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia, infantile paroxysmal dystonias, Sandifer's syndrome and symptomatic paroxysmal dyskinesias. In Hereditary Episodic Ataxia Type 1 attacks of ataxia last for up to two minutes, may be accompanied by dysarthria and dystonia and usually respond to phenytoin. In Type 2 they can last for several hours, may be accompanied by vertigo, headache and malaise and usually respond to acetazolamide. Symptomatic episodic ataxias can occur in a number of metabolic disorders, but also in multiple sclerosis and Behcet's disease.",

It is associated with mutations in the KCNA1 voltage-gated potassium channel gene. In the present study, we describe a family with novel clinical features including persistent cerebellar dysfunction, cerebellar atrophy, and cognitive delay. All affected family members have myokymia and epilepsy, but only one individual has episodes of vertigo. Additional features include postural abnormalities, episodic stiffness and weakness. A novel KCNA1 mutation (c.1222G>T) which replaces a highly conserved valine with leucine at position 408 (p.Val408Leu) was identified in affected family members, and was found to augment the ability of the channel to inactivate. Together, our data suggests that KCNA1 mutations are associated with a broader clinical phenotype, which may include persistent cerebellar dysfunction and cognitive delay.",

Ataxic episodes in EA-1 patients are often associated with exercise or emotional stress, which suggests a prominent role for the autonomic nervous system. Many of these alterations are reproduced in the Kv1.1-null mouse. Kv1.1 also regulates excitability of sensory neurons essential in cardiovascular and respiratory reflexes. We examined the neural control of the respiratory system of littermate wild-type (control) and Kv1.1-null mice during low O2 (hypoxia). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated Kv1.1 in the afferent limb of the carotid body chemoreflex (the major regulator in the response to hypoxia), consisting of the carotid body, petrosal ganglion, and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Respiration was examined by plethysmography. Null mice exhibited a greater increase in respiration during hypoxia compared with controls. In vitro carotid body sensory discharge during hypoxia was greater in null than control mice. In the caudal NTS, evoked EPSCs in brainstem slices were similar between control and null mice. However, the frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs was greater in null mice. Null mice also exhibited more asynchronous release after a stimulus train. These results demonstrate the important role of Kv1.1 in afferent chemosensory activity and suggest that mutations in the human Kv1.1 gene have functional consequences during stress responses that involve respiratory reflexes.",

Point mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv1.1) gene on chromosome 12p13 have recently been shown to associate with EA1. A Scottish family with EA1 harbouring a novel mutation in this gene is reported. Of the five affected individuals over three generations, two had partial epilepsy in addition to EA1. The detailed clinical, electrophysiological and molecular genetic findings are presented. The heterozygous point mutation is located at nucleotide position 677 and results in a radical amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position in the second transmembrane domain of the potassium channel. Functional studies indicated that mutant subunits exhibited a dominant negative effect on potassium channel function and would be predicted to impair neuronal repolarization. Potassium channels determine the excitability of neurons and blocking drugs are proconvulsant. A critical review of previously reported EA1 families shows an over-representation of epilepsy in family members with EA1 compared with unaffected members. These observations indicate that this mutation is pathogenic and suggest that the epilepsy in EA1 may be caused by the dysfunctional potassium channel. It is possible that such dysfunction may be relevant to other epilepsies in man.",

An important mechanism underlying analog-digital modulation is depolarization-mediated inactivation of presynaptic Kv1-family potassium channels, leading to action potential broadening and increased calcium influx. Previous studies have relied heavily on recordings from blebs formed after axon transection, which may exaggerate the passive propagation of somatic depolarization. We recorded instead from small boutons supplied by intact axons identified with scanning ion conductance microscopy in primary hippocampal cultures and asked how distinct potassium channels interact in determining the basal spike width and its modulation by subthreshold somatic depolarization. Pharmacological or genetic deletion of Kv1.1 broadened presynaptic spikes without preventing further prolongation by brief depolarizing somatic prepulses. A heterozygous mouse model of episodic ataxia type 1 harboring a dominant Kv1.1 mutation had a similar broadening effect on basal spike shape as deletion of Kv1.1; however, spike modulation by somatic prepulses was abolished. These results argue that the Kv1.1 subunit is not necessary for subthreshold modulation of spike width. However, a disease-associated mutant subunit prevents the interplay of analog and digital transmission, possibly by disrupting the normal stoichiometry of presynaptic potassium channels.",

Ataxic episodes in EA-1 patients are often associated with exercise or emotional stress, which suggests a prominent role for the autonomic nervous system. Many of these alterations are reproduced in the Kv1.1-null mouse. Kv1.1 also regulates excitability of sensory neurons essential in cardiovascular and respiratory reflexes. We examined the neural control of the respiratory system of littermate wild-type (control) and Kv1.1-null mice during low O2 (hypoxia). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated Kv1.1 in the afferent limb of the carotid body chemoreflex (the major regulator in the response to hypoxia), consisting of the carotid body, petrosal ganglion, and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Respiration was examined by plethysmography. Null mice exhibited a greater increase in respiration during hypoxia compared with controls. In vitro carotid body sensory discharge during hypoxia was greater in null than control mice. In the caudal NTS, evoked EPSCs in brainstem slices were similar between control and null mice. However, the frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs was greater in null mice. Null mice also exhibited more asynchronous release after a stimulus train. These results demonstrate the important role of Kv1.1 in afferent chemosensory activity and suggest that mutations in the human Kv1.1 gene have functional consequences during stress responses that involve respiratory reflexes.",

                    "abstract": "Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder characterized by myokymia and attacks of ataxic gait often precipitated by stress. Several genetic mutations have been identified in the Shaker-like K(+) channel Kv1.1 (KCNA1) of EA1 individuals, including V408A, which result in remarkable channel dysfunction. By inserting the heterozygous V408A, mutation in one Kv1.1 allele, a mouse model of EA1 has been generated (Kv1.1(V408A/+)). Here, we investigated the neuromuscular transmission of Kv1.1(V408A/+) ataxic mice and their susceptibility to physiologically relevant stressors. By using in vivo preparations of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) nerve-muscle from Kv1.1(+/+) and Kv1.1(V408A/+) mice, we show that the mutant animals exhibit spontaneous myokymic discharges consisting of repeated singlets, duplets or multiplets, despite motor nerve axotomy. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy from the motor nerve, ex vivo, revealed spontaneous Ca(2+) signals that occurred abnormally only in preparations dissected from Kv1.1(V408A/+) mice. Spontaneous bursting activity, as well as that evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation, was exacerbated by muscle fatigue, ischemia and low temperatures. These stressors also increased the amplitude of compound muscle action potential. Such abnormal neuromuscular transmission did not alter fiber type composition, neuromuscular junction and vascularization of LG muscle, analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Taken together these findings provide direct evidence that identifies the motor nerve as an important generator of myokymic activity, that dysfunction of Kv1.1 channels alters Ca(2+) homeostasis in motor axons, and also strongly suggest that muscle fatigue contributes more than PNS fatigue to exacerbate the myokymia/neuromyotonia phenotype. More broadly, this study points out that juxtaparanodal K(+) channels composed of Kv1.1 subunits exert an important role in dampening the excitability of motor nerve axons during fatigue or ischemic insult.",

Whole-exome sequencing can be applied to investigate the \"diagnostic odyssey\" cases. These cases involve patients with rare diseases that likely have a genetic etiology but have failed to be diagnosed by clinical evaluation and targeted gene testing. We describe such a case, a 22-year-old man who had mild intellectual developmental disability and episodes of jerking ataxic movements that affected his whole body. He underwent numerous multidisciplinary and multicentric evaluations throughout his life that failed to establish a clear diagnosis. Following his visit to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, WES was applied for genetic determination of the unknown disorder in the proband and his biological parents and sister. Additional clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance neuroimaging, electromyography, and electroencephalography of the proband were performed to verify the phenotype after the WES results were available. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the application of WES to facilitate the diagnosis of episodic ataxia type 1. This case illustrates that WES supported by clinical data is a useful and time-saving tool in the evaluation of patients with rare and complex hereditary disorders.",

This study investigated the role of Kv1 potassium channels in SAD using neutral red, flavoprotein autofluorescence, and voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging in the mouse cerebellar cortex, in vivo. The probability of evoking SAD was greatly increased by blocking Kv1.1 as well as Kv1.2 potassium channels by their specific blockers dendrotoxin K (DTX-K) and tityustoxin (TsTX), respectively. DTX-K not only greatly lowered the threshold for evoking SAD but also resulted in multiple cycles of spread and spontaneous SAD. The occurrence of spontaneous SAD originating from spontaneous parallel fiber-like beams of activity suggests that blocking Kv1 channels increased parallel fiber excitability. This was confirmed by the generation of parallel fiber-like beams with the microinjection of glutamate into the upper molecular layer in the presence of DTX-K. The dramatic effects of DTX-K suggest a possible connection between SAD and episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), a Kv1.1 potassium channelopathy. The threshold for evoking SAD was significantly lowered in the Kv1.1 heterozygous knockout mouse compared with wild-type littermates. Carbamazepine and acetazolamide, both effective in the treatment of EA1, significantly decreased the likelihood of evoking SAD. Blocking GABAergic neurotransmission did not alter the effectiveness of DTX-K. The cyclin D2 null mouse, which lacks cerebellar stellate cells, also exhibited SAD. Therefore blocking Kv1 potassium channels establishes the conditions needed to generate SAD. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that SAD may underlie the transient attacks of ataxia characterizing EA1.",

                    "abstract": "Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder characterized by myokymia and attacks of ataxic gait often precipitated by stress. Several genetic mutations have been identified in the Shaker-like K(+) channel Kv1.1 (KCNA1) of EA1 individuals, including V408A, which result in remarkable channel dysfunction. By inserting the heterozygous V408A, mutation in one Kv1.1 allele, a mouse model of EA1 has been generated (Kv1.1(V408A/+)). Here, we investigated the neuromuscular transmission of Kv1.1(V408A/+) ataxic mice and their susceptibility to physiologically relevant stressors. By using in vivo preparations of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) nerve-muscle from Kv1.1(+/+) and Kv1.1(V408A/+) mice, we show that the mutant animals exhibit spontaneous myokymic discharges consisting of repeated singlets, duplets or multiplets, despite motor nerve axotomy. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy from the motor nerve, ex vivo, revealed spontaneous Ca(2+) signals that occurred abnormally only in preparations dissected from Kv1.1(V408A/+) mice. Spontaneous bursting activity, as well as that evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation, was exacerbated by muscle fatigue, ischemia and low temperatures. These stressors also increased the amplitude of compound muscle action potential. Such abnormal neuromuscular transmission did not alter fiber type composition, neuromuscular junction and vascularization of LG muscle, analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Taken together these findings provide direct evidence that identifies the motor nerve as an important generator of myokymic activity, that dysfunction of Kv1.1 channels alters Ca(2+) homeostasis in motor axons, and also strongly suggest that muscle fatigue contributes more than PNS fatigue to exacerbate the myokymia/neuromyotonia phenotype. More broadly, this study points out that juxtaparanodal K(+) channels composed of Kv1.1 subunits exert an important role in dampening the excitability of motor nerve axons during fatigue or ischemic insult.",

We have identified a novel heterozygous mutation in the KCNA1 gene of a young proband displaying typical signs and symptoms of Episodic Ataxia type 1 (EA1). This mutation is in the S4 helix of the voltage-sensing domain and results in the substitution of the highly conserved phenylalanine 303 by valine (p.F303V). The contributions of F303 towards K+ channel voltage gating are unclear and here have been assessed biophysically and by performing structural analysis using rat Kv1.2 coordinates. We observed significant positive shifts of voltage-dependence, changes in the activation, deactivation and slow inactivation kinetics, reduced window currents, and decreased current amplitudes of both Kv1.1 and Kv1.1/1.2 channels. Structural analysis revealed altered interactions between F303V and L339 and I335 of the S5 helix of a neighboring subunit. The substitution of an aromatic phenylalanine with an aliphatic valine within the voltage-sensor destabilizes the open state of the channel. Thus, F303 fine-tunes the Kv1.1 gating properties and contributes to the interactions between the S4 segment and neighboring alpha helices. The resulting channel's loss of function validates the clinical relevance of the mutation for EA1 pathogenesis.",

An important mechanism underlying analog-digital modulation is depolarization-mediated inactivation of presynaptic Kv1-family potassium channels, leading to action potential broadening and increased calcium influx. Previous studies have relied heavily on recordings from blebs formed after axon transection, which may exaggerate the passive propagation of somatic depolarization. We recorded instead from small boutons supplied by intact axons identified with scanning ion conductance microscopy in primary hippocampal cultures and asked how distinct potassium channels interact in determining the basal spike width and its modulation by subthreshold somatic depolarization. Pharmacological or genetic deletion of Kv1.1 broadened presynaptic spikes without preventing further prolongation by brief depolarizing somatic prepulses. A heterozygous mouse model of episodic ataxia type 1 harboring a dominant Kv1.1 mutation had a similar broadening effect on basal spike shape as deletion of Kv1.1; however, spike modulation by somatic prepulses was abolished. These results argue that the Kv1.1 subunit is not necessary for subthreshold modulation of spike width. However, a disease-associated mutant subunit prevents the interplay of analog and digital transmission, possibly by disrupting the normal stoichiometry of presynaptic potassium channels.",

                    "abstract": "Mutations in the potassium channel gene Kv1.1 are associated with human episodic ataxia type 1 (EA-1) syndrome characterized by movement disorders and epilepsy. Ataxic episodes in EA-1 patients are often associated with exercise or emotional stress, which suggests a prominent role for the autonomic nervous system. Many of these alterations are reproduced in the Kv1.1-null mouse. Kv1.1 also regulates excitability of sensory neurons essential in cardiovascular and respiratory reflexes. We examined the neural control of the respiratory system of littermate wild-type (control) and Kv1.1-null mice during low O2 (hypoxia). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated Kv1.1 in the afferent limb of the carotid body chemoreflex (the major regulator in the response to hypoxia), consisting of the carotid body, petrosal ganglion, and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Respiration was examined by plethysmography. Null mice exhibited a greater increase in respiration during hypoxia compared with controls. In vitro carotid body sensory discharge during hypoxia was greater in null than control mice. In the caudal NTS, evoked EPSCs in brainstem slices were similar between control and null mice. However, the frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs was greater in null mice. Null mice also exhibited more asynchronous release after a stimulus train. These results demonstrate the important role of Kv1.1 in afferent chemosensory activity and suggest that mutations in the human Kv1.1 gene have functional consequences during stress responses that involve respiratory reflexes.",

We have identified a novel heterozygous mutation in the KCNA1 gene of a young proband displaying typical signs and symptoms of Episodic Ataxia type 1 (EA1). This mutation is in the S4 helix of the voltage-sensing domain and results in the substitution of the highly conserved phenylalanine 303 by valine (p.F303V). The contributions of F303 towards K+ channel voltage gating are unclear and here have been assessed biophysically and by performing structural analysis using rat Kv1.2 coordinates. We observed significant positive shifts of voltage-dependence, changes in the activation, deactivation and slow inactivation kinetics, reduced window currents, and decreased current amplitudes of both Kv1.1 and Kv1.1/1.2 channels. Structural analysis revealed altered interactions between F303V and L339 and I335 of the S5 helix of a neighboring subunit. The substitution of an aromatic phenylalanine with an aliphatic valine within the voltage-sensor destabilizes the open state of the channel. Thus, F303 fine-tunes the Kv1.1 gating properties and contributes to the interactions between the S4 segment and neighboring alpha helices. The resulting channel's loss of function validates the clinical relevance of the mutation for EA1 pathogenesis.",

                    "abstract": "Most movement disorders, reflecting degenerative disorders, develop in a slowly progressive fashion. Some movement disorders, however, manifest with an acute onset. We wish to give an overview of the management and therapy of those acute-onset movement disorders.Drug-induced movement disorders are mainly caused by dopamine-receptor blockers (DRB) as used as antipsychotics (neuroleptics) and antiemetics. Acute dystonic reactions usually occur within the first four days of treatment. Typically, cranial pharyngeal and cervical muscles are affected. Anticholinergics produce a prompt relief. Akathisia is characterized by an often exceedingly bothersome feeling of restlessness and the inability to remain still. It is a common side effect of DRB and occurs within few days after their initiation. It subsides when DRB are ceased. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is a rare, but life-threatening adverse reaction to DRB which may occur at any time during DRB application. It is characterised by hyperthermia, rigidity, reduced consciousness and autonomic failure. Therapeutically immediate DRB withdrawal is crucial. Additional dantrolene or bromocriptine application together with symptomatic treatment may be necessary. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are childhood onset disorders characterised by dystonic postures, chorea, athetosis and ballism occurring at irregular intervals. In Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia they are triggered by rapid movements, startle reactions or hyperventilation. They last up to 5 minutes, occur up to 100 times per day and are highly sensitive to anticonvulsants. In Paroxysmal Non-Kinesiogenic Dyskinesia they cannot be triggered, occur less frequently and last longer. Other paroxysmal dyskinesias include hypnogenic paroxysmal dyskinesias, paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia, infantile paroxysmal dystonias, Sandifer's syndrome and symptomatic paroxysmal dyskinesias. In Hereditary Episodic Ataxia Type 1 attacks of ataxia last for up to two minutes, may be accompanied by dysarthria and dystonia and usually respond to phenytoin. In Type 2 they can last for several hours, may be accompanied by vertigo, headache and malaise and usually respond to acetazolamide. Symptomatic episodic ataxias can occur in a number of metabolic disorders, but also in multiple sclerosis and Behcet's disease.",

This study investigated the role of Kv1 potassium channels in SAD using neutral red, flavoprotein autofluorescence, and voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging in the mouse cerebellar cortex, in vivo. The probability of evoking SAD was greatly increased by blocking Kv1.1 as well as Kv1.2 potassium channels by their specific blockers dendrotoxin K (DTX-K) and tityustoxin (TsTX), respectively. DTX-K not only greatly lowered the threshold for evoking SAD but also resulted in multiple cycles of spread and spontaneous SAD. The occurrence of spontaneous SAD originating from spontaneous parallel fiber-like beams of activity suggests that blocking Kv1 channels increased parallel fiber excitability. This was confirmed by the generation of parallel fiber-like beams with the microinjection of glutamate into the upper molecular layer in the presence of DTX-K. The dramatic effects of DTX-K suggest a possible connection between SAD and episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1), a Kv1.1 potassium channelopathy. The threshold for evoking SAD was significantly lowered in the Kv1.1 heterozygous knockout mouse compared with wild-type littermates. Carbamazepine and acetazolamide, both effective in the treatment of EA1, significantly decreased the likelihood of evoking SAD. Blocking GABAergic neurotransmission did not alter the effectiveness of DTX-K. The cyclin D2 null mouse, which lacks cerebellar stellate cells, also exhibited SAD. Therefore blocking Kv1 potassium channels establishes the conditions needed to generate SAD.

                    "abstract": "Brain development and interictal function are unaffected in many paroxysmal neurological channelopathies, possibly explained by homoeostatic plasticity of synaptic transmission. Episodic ataxia type 1 is caused by missense mutations of the potassium channel Kv1.1, which is abundantly expressed in the terminals of cerebellar basket cells. Presynaptic action potentials of small inhibitory terminals have not been characterized, and it is not known whether developmental plasticity compensates for the effects of Kv1.1 dysfunction. Here we use visually targeted patch-clamp recordings from basket cell terminals of mice harbouring an ataxia-associated mutation and their wild-type littermates. Presynaptic spikes are followed by a pronounced afterdepolarization, and are broadened by pharmacological blockade of Kv1.1 or by a dominant ataxia-associated mutation. Somatic recordings fail to detect such changes. Spike broadening leads to increased Ca(2+) influx and GABA release, and decreased spontaneous Purkinje cell firing. We find no evidence for developmental compensation for inherited Kv1.1 dysfunction.",

                    "abstract": "Most movement disorders, reflecting degenerative disorders, develop in a slowly progressive fashion. Some movement disorders, however, manifest with an acute onset. We wish to give an overview of the management and therapy of those acute-onset movement disorders.Drug-induced movement disorders are mainly caused by dopamine-receptor blockers (DRB) as used as antipsychotics (neuroleptics) and antiemetics. Acute dystonic reactions usually occur within the first four days of treatment. Typically, cranial pharyngeal and cervical muscles are affected. Anticholinergics produce a prompt relief. Akathisia is characterized by an often exceedingly bothersome feeling of restlessness and the inability to remain still. It is a common side effect of DRB and occurs within few days after their initiation. It subsides when DRB are ceased. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is a rare, but life-threatening adverse reaction to DRB which may occur at any time during DRB application. It is characterised by hyperthermia, rigidity, reduced consciousness and autonomic failure. Therapeutically immediate DRB withdrawal is crucial. Additional dantrolene or bromocriptine application together with symptomatic treatment may be necessary. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are childhood onset disorders characterised by dystonic postures, chorea, athetosis and ballism occurring at irregular intervals. In Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia they are triggered by rapid movements, startle reactions or hyperventilation. They last up to 5 minutes, occur up to 100 times per day and are highly sensitive to anticonvulsants. In Paroxysmal Non-Kinesiogenic Dyskinesia they cannot be triggered, occur less frequently and last longer. Other paroxysmal dyskinesias include hypnogenic paroxysmal dyskinesias, paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia, infantile paroxysmal dystonias, Sandifer's syndrome and symptomatic paroxysmal dyskinesias. In Hereditary Episodic Ataxia Type 1 attacks of ataxia last for up to two minutes, may be accompanied by dysarthria and dystonia and usually respond to phenytoin. In Type 2 they can last for several hours, may be accompanied by vertigo, headache and malaise and usually respond to acetazolamide. Symptomatic episodic ataxias can occur in a number of metabolic disorders, but also in multiple sclerosis and Behcet's disease.",
