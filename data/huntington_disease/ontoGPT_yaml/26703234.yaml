input_text: 'Spermidine ameliorates 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced striatal
  toxicity: Possible role of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurotransmitters.
  AIM AND BACKGROUND: Spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine, is involved in
  various internal biological functions, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
  properties. A decreased level of polyamines is associated with aging and neurodegenerative
  disorders including Huntington disease (HD). 3-Nitropropanoic acid (3-NP) induces
  a spectrum of HD-like neuropathologies in rat striatum and thus serves as a good
  experimental model of HD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate
  whether spermidine confers neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced striatal toxicity
  and to explore its possible mechanism. METHODS: Rats were administered 3-NP (10mg/kg/day,
  i.p.) for 21 days. Spermidine (5 and 10mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered once a
  day 1h before 3-NP treatment for 21 days. Body weight and behavioral observations
  were recorded at weekly intervals after continuous 3-NP treatment. On the 22nd day,
  the animals were sacrificed, and the rat striatum was isolated for the estimation
  of biochemical parameters (lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH), and nitrite),
  determination of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha
  and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta), and neurochemical analysis (gamma-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA), glutamate, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), 5-HT, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
  acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), adenosine,
  inosine, and hypoxanthine). RESULTS: The findings of the present study demonstrate
  significant alterations in motor coordination, oxidative defense, and the levels
  of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) and striatal neurotransmitters
  upon 3-NP treatment. Pretreatment with spermidine significantly attenuated 3-NP-induced
  alterations in motor coordination, oxidative stress, and the levels of neuroinflammatory
  markers and striatal neurotransmitters. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that
  spermidine exerted a potential neuroprotective effect in a 3-NP model of HD, which
  may provide insight into the therapeutic potential of spermidine for HD.'
