input_text: C9orf72 expansion as a possible genetic cause of Huntington disease phenocopy
  syndrome. Huntington disease (HD), the most common inherited cause of chorea, is
  an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat (>39)
  in the HTT gene on chromosome 4p16.3. Among patients diagnosed as HD solely on clinical
  grounds, a certain number was negative on genetic testing for HD. Therefore, HD-like
  disorders comprised a number of genetic causes of chorea, that may be indistinguishable
  from HD (e.g. HD phenocopy syndrome). Recent data suggested that the C9orf72 expansion
  may be the most common genetic cause of HD phenocopy presentations. In continuation
  with this observation, we analyzed a small cohort of 39 patients with HD phenocopy
  syndrome and detected the C9orf72 expansion in one female patient (2.6%) with two-year
  lasting mild generalized chorea and severe oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia, who complained
  on forgetfullness (neuropsychological testing revealed dysexecutive syndrome with
  preserved episodic memory and recognition), unexplainable fears and increased appetite.
  Our results confirmed a possible role of the C9orf72 expansion in the genetic background
  of HD phenocopy syndrome.
