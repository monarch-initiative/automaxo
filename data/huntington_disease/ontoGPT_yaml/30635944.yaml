input_text: 'Cerebellar degeneration correlates with motor symptoms in Huntington
  disease. OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative
  disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioral symptoms attributed to major
  neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the
  cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology
  has been controversial. This study utilizes postmortem human brain tissue to investigate
  whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how
  this relates to disease symptom profiles. METHODS: Unbiased stereological counting
  methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases
  and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms,
  the HD cases were categorized into 2 groups: "motor" or "mood." RESULTS: The results
  demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly
  motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There
  was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological
  grade, postmortem delay, CAG repeat in the IT15 gene, or age at death. INTERPRETATION:
  This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD
  neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous
  human brain studies on the same HD cases, provides novel perspectives interrelating
  and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia, and neocortical neuropathology
  with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain. ANN NEUROL
