input_text: 'American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Standards and Guidelines
  for Clinical Genetics Laboratories, 2014 edition: technical standards and guidelines
  for Huntington disease. Huntington disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative
  disease of mid-life onset caused by expansion of a polymorphic trinucleotide (CAG)
  repeat. Variable penetrance for alleles carrying 36-39 repeats has been noted, but
  the disease appears fully penetrant when the repeat numbers are >40. An abnormal
  CAG repeat may expand, contract, or be stably transmitted when passed from parent
  to child. Assays used to diagnose Huntington disease must be optimized to ensure
  the accurate and unambiguous quantitation of CAG repeat length. This document provides
  an overview of Huntington disease and methodological considerations for Huntington
  disease testing. Examples of laboratory reports are also included.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
  object_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the object of the statement, e.g. "severe" or "with additional complications">
