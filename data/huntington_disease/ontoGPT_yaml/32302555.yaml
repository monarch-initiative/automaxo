input_text: Stem Cell-Derived Human Striatal Progenitors Innervate Striatal Targets
  and Alleviate Sensorimotor Deficit in a Rat Model of Huntington Disease.Huntington
  disease (HD) is an inherited late-onset neurological disorder characterized by progressive
  neuronal loss and disruption of cortical and basal ganglia circuits. Cell replacement
  using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged
  circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated
  human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon
  intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific
  immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology,
  we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures,
  including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra,
  and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs
  cell per transplanted neuron. We have also shown that transplants elicited a significant
  improvement in sensory-motor tasks up to 2 months post-transplant further supporting
  the therapeutic potential of this approach.
