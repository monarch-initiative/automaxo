input_text: Fetal striatal allografts reverse cognitive deficits in a primate model
  of Huntington disease. Substitutive therapy using fetal striatal grafts in animal
  models of Huntington disease (HD) have already demonstrated obvious beneficial effects
  on motor indices. Using a new phenotypic model of HD recently designed in primates,
  we demonstrate here complete and persistent recovery in a frontal-type cognitive
  task two to five months after intrastriatal allografting. The striatal allografts
  also reduce the occurrence of dystonia, a major abnormal movement associated with
  HD. These results show the capacity of fetal neurons to provide a renewed substrate
  for both cognitive and motor systems in the lesioned adult brain. They also support
  the use of neural transplantation as a potential therapy for HD.
