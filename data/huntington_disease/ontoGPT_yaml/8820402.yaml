input_text: 'Neurogenetic diseases: molecular diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.
  A neurogenetic disorder is defined as a clinical disease caused by a defect in one
  or more genes which affect the differentiation and function of the neuroectoderm
  and its derivatives. Genetic findings in various neurogenetic disorders are discussed.
  Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the autosomal dominant cerebellar
  ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant disorders caused by the expansion of
  trinucleotides (CAG) within disease genes. The CAG expansions appear to result in
  a gain of gene function. Prenatal, presymptomatic, and differential diagnostic tests
  are based on the detection of the repeat expansions. Point mutations within disease
  genes result in many additional neurogenetic disorders. An autosomal dominant form
  of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various types of craniosynostotic syndromes
  are described. The mutations in the disease genes also appear to result in a gain
  of gene function. Molecular diagnosis in these disorders is based on the direct
  examination of the mutated gene by methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism
  analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing. In
  many neurogenetic disorders the disease gene has not yet been identified. Here molecular
  diagnosis relies on indirect approaches based on methods such as the analysis of
  linkage and of allelic association. Hereditary forms of dystonia are presented as
  examples. Common sporadic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson
  diseases frequently have multifactorial causes. Investigations into the molecular
  basis and the development of diagnostic tests in these two important diseases are
  discussed. At present no curative therapies exist in neurogenetic disorders. Gene
  therapeutic approaches, however, provide promise for a cure in at least some of
  these diseases. Basic principles of gene therapy are explained and attempts at gene
  therapy in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are described. Finally, some of the
  many obstacles are summarized that must be overcome before gene therapy becomes
  feasible in most monogenic neurological diseases.'
