input_text: 'A worldwide assessment of the frequency of suicide, suicide attempts,
  or psychiatric hospitalization after predictive testing for Huntington disease.
  Prior to the implementation of predictive-testing programs for Huntington disease
  (HD), significant concern was raised concerning the likelihood of catastrophic events
  (CEs), particularly in those persons receiving an increased-risk result. We have
  investigated the frequency of CEs-that is, suicide, suicide attempt, and psychiatric
  hospitalization-after an HD predictive-testing result, through questionnaires sent
  to predictive-testing centers worldwide. A total of 44 persons (0.97%) in a cohort
  of 4,527 test participants had a CE: 5 successful suicides, 21 suicide attempts,
  and 18 hospitalizations for psychiatric reasons. All persons committing suicide
  had signs of HD, whereas 11 (52.4%) of 21 persons attempting suicide and 8 (44.4%)
  of 18 who had a psychiatric hospitalization were symptomatic. A total of 11 (84.6%)
  of 13 asymptomatic persons who experienced a CE during the first year after HD predictive
  testing received an increased-risk result. Factors associated with an increased
  risk of a CE included (a) a psychiatric history </=5 years prior to testing and
  (b) unemployed status. The frequency of CEs did not differ between those persons
  receiving results of predictive testing through linkage analysis in whom there was
  only changes in direction of risk and those persons receiving definitive results
  after analysis for the mutation underlying HD. These findings provide insights into
  the frequency, associated factors, and timing of CEs in a worldwide cohort of persons
  receiving predictive-testing results and, as such, highlight persons for whom ongoing
  support may be beneficial.'
