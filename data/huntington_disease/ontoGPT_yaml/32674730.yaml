input_text: "Gene Therapy, A Novel Therapeutic Tool for Neurological Disorders: Current
  Progress, Challenges and Future Prospective. Neurological disorders are one of the
  major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All
  aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms
  of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available
  pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in
  most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular
  etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic
  makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins
  and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy
  has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease
  by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier
  genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted
  gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy
  has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's
  disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations
  such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective
  biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been
  made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review
  article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders
  along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective."
