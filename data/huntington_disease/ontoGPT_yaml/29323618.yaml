input_text: 'Measuring attitudes towards the dying process: A systematic review of
  tools. BACKGROUND: At the end of life, anxious attitudes concerning the dying process
  are common in patients in Palliative Care. Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities,
  resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support
  well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards
  dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological
  quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review
  according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized
  review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and
  Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS:
  A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44
  tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g.
  projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g.
  anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items (
  n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others (
  n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools
  reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical
  sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability
  to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes
  towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as
  decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application,
  only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential
  alternative methods in various populations is needed.'

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
