input_text: "Music Therapy and Music-Based Interventions for Movement Disorders. PURPOSE
  OF REVIEW: There is emerging evidence that music therapy and other methods using
  music and rhythm may meaningfully improve a broad range of symptoms in neurological
  and non-neurological disorders. This review highlights the findings of recent studies
  utilizing music and rhythm-based interventions for gait impairment, other motor
  symptoms, and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) and other movement disorders.
  Limitations of current studies as well as future research directions are discussed.
  RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple studies have demonstrated short-term benefits of rhythmic
  auditory stimulation on gait parameters including gait freezing in PD, with recent
  studies indicating that it may reduce falls. Demonstration of benefits for gait
  in both dopaminergic \"on\" and \"off\" states suggests that this intervention can
  be a valuable addition to the current armamentarium of PD therapies. There is also
  emerging evidence of motor and non-motor benefits from group dancing, singing, and
  instrumental music performance in PD. Preliminary evidence for music therapy and
  music-based interventions in movement disorders other than PD (such as Huntington
  disease, Tourette syndrome, and progressive supranuclear palsy) is limited but promising.
  Music therapy and other music and rhythm-based interventions may offer a range of
  symptomatic benefits to patients with PD and other movement disorders. Studies investigating
  the potential mechanisms of music's effects and well-controlled multicenter trials
  of these interventions are urgently needed."
