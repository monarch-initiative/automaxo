input_text: The phasor FLIM method reveals a link between a change in energy metabolism
  and mHtt protein spread in healthy Mammalian cells when co-cultured with Huntington
  diseased cells.Huntington Disease (HD) is a late-onset autosomal neurodegenerative
  disease characterized by the aggregations of mutant Huntingtin proteins (mHTT).
  A glutamine stretch (PolyQ) at the N-terminal of the Huntingtin protein is generated
  by the abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in exon 1 of the HTT gene.
  While the resulting polyQ aggregates are the predominate feature of HD, the intercellular
  spread of the expanded protein and the effect upon this transfer inside healthy
  cells have not yet fully understood. Here, we have employed the phasor Fluorescence
  Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) method to measure NADH fluorescence lifetime
  change after the internalization of the PolyQ protein. Based on our analysis, we
  have found a significant decrease in the fraction of bound NADH in both cytoplasmic
  and nucleus regions when cells are co-cultured or when healthy cells uptake the
  supernatant containing polyQ proteins and aggregates. Overall, our FLIM study combined
  with confocal fluorescence imaging visualizes the absorption of the mutant Htt protein
  aggregates which results in a distinct NADH fluorescence lifetime between control
  cells and acceptor cells. These studies show, for the first time, the influence
  of how neighboring cells expressing the expanded Htt protein can regulate energy
  metabolism in healthy cells.
