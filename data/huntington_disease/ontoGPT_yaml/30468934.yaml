input_text: "Body composition and bone mineral density in Huntington's disease. OBJECTIVE:
  Understanding the body composition (BC) of patients with Huntington's disease (HD)
  could help to delay disease progression and improve treatment efficacy. The aim
  of this study was to assess BC parameters, including bone mineral density (BMD),
  and to find new biomarkers that can be early indicators for weight loss in patients
  with HD. METHODS: Twenty-one age- and sex-matched patients with HD and 29 healthy
  controls (CT) were enrolled. For each patient, body weight (BW), height, and body
  mass index (BMI) were evaluated. BC and BMD were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.
  Subsamples were created according to sex and percent fat mass (FM) (obese and nonobese).
  All analyses were carried out using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: In all comparisons,
  BMD and T-score were lower in the HD group, but were not correlated with lean body
  mass (LBM) or FM. In the HD group, LBM and truncal fat were mostly reduced, except
  in women with HD whose BC appeared to be less affected by the disease than men.
  Furthermore, LBM (r = 0.80) and truncal fat (r = 0.68) were better correlated with
  BW than BMI (r = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Complete BC assessment can be crucial for preventive
  interventions and prognosis definition in patients with HD. New biomarkers such
  as BMD, LBM, and truncal fat can be early indicators of weight loss in patients
  with HD."
