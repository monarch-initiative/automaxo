input_text: '[Dietetic management of patients with impaired swallowing]. Swallowing
  deficits may be present in patients with neurological, otolaryngoiatric or internal
  medicine diseases. These deficits impair their feeding capability, thus inducing
  malnutrition. Diet therapy in these conditions involves specific instructions for
  properly choosing, handling and eating food, in order to allow patients to preserve
  their autonomy and safety while eating, thus preventing malnutrition. We refer paradigmatically
  to patients with Huntington disease, which is the main neurologic cause of swallowing
  deficits, although these guidelines may be conveniently extended to other patients
  with impaired transit of food.'
