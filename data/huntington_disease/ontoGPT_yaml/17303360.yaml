input_text: Genetically engineered human neural stem cells for brain repair in neurological
  diseases. Neural stem cells (NSCs)of the central nervous system (CNS) have recently
  received a great deal of attention and interest for their therapeutic potential
  for neurological disorders. NSCs are defined as CNS progenitor cells that have the
  capacity for self-renewal and multipotent potential to become neurons or glial cells.
  Recent studies have shown that NSCs isolated from mammalian CNS including human
  can be propagated in vitro and then implanted into the brain of animal models of
  human neurological disorders. Recently, we have generated clonally derived immortalized
  human NSC cell lines via a retroviral vector encoded with v-myc oncogene. One of
  the human NSC lines, HB1.F3, was utilized in stem-cell based therapy in animal models
  of human neurological disorders. When F3 human NSCs were implanted into the brain
  of murine models of lysosomal storage diseases, stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington
  disease or stroke, implanted F3 NSCs were found to migrate to the lesion sites,
  differentiate into neurons and glial cells, and restore functional deficits found
  in these neurological disorders. In animal models of brain tumors, F3 NSCs could
  deliver a bioactive therapeutically relevant molecules to effect a significant anti-tumor
  response intracranial tumor mass. Since these genetically engineered human NSCs
  are immortalized and continuously multiplying, there would be limitless supply of
  human neurons for treatment for patients suffering from neurological disorders including
  stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis and spinal
  cord injury. The promising field of stem cell research as it applies to regenerative
  medicine is still in infancy, but its potential appears limitless, and we are blessed
  to be involved in this exciting realm of research.
