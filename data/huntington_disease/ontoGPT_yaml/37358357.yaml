input_text: Microglial cytokines poison neuronal autophagy via CCR5, a druggable target.
  In the prodromal phase of neurodegenerative diseases, microglia switch to an activated
  state resulting in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. We reported
  that C - C chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), C - C chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) and C - C
  chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) contained in the secretome of activated microglia inhibit
  neuronal autophagy via a non-cell autonomous mechanism. These chemokines bind and
  activate neuronal C - C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), which, in turn, promotes
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT) - mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway activation, which inhibits autophagy, thus
  causing the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins in the cytoplasm of neurons.
  The levels of CCR5 and its chemokine ligands are increased in the brains of pre-manifesting
  Huntington disease (HD) and tauopathy mouse models. CCR5 accumulation might be due
  to a self-amplifying mechanism, since CCR5 is a substrate of autophagy and CCL5-CCR5-mediated
  autophagy inhibition impairs CCR5 degradation. Furthermore, pharmacological, or
  genetic inhibition of CCR5 rescues mTORC1-autophagy dysfunction and improves neurodegeneration
  in HD and tauopathy mouse models, suggesting that CCR5 hyperactivation is a pathogenic
  signal driving the progression of these diseases.
