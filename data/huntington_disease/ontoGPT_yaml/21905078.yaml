input_text: Stem cell technology for neurodegenerative diseases. Over the past 20
  years, stem cell technologies have become an increasingly attractive option to investigate
  and treat neurodegenerative diseases. In the current review, we discuss the process
  of extending basic stem cell research into translational therapies for patients
  suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. We begin with a discussion of the burden
  of these diseases on society, emphasizing the need for increased attention toward
  advancing stem cell therapies. We then explain the various types of stem cells utilized
  in neurodegenerative disease research, and outline important issues to consider
  in the transition of stem cell therapy from bench to bedside. Finally, we detail
  the current progress regarding the applications of stem cell therapies to specific
  neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer
  disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. With a greater
  understanding of the capacity of stem cell technologies, there is growing public
  hope that stem cell therapies will continue to progress into realistic and efficacious
  treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.
