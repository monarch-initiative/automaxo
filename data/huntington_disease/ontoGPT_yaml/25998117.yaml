input_text: Genetic testing and counseling in the diagnosis and management of young-onset
  dementias. Young-onset dementia is hereditary, multifactorial, or sporadic. The
  most common hereditary dementias include Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal degeneration,
  Huntington disease, prion diseases, and cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy
  with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. Careful attainment of family
  history assists with diagnosis and determining the likelihood of a genetic cause,
  and can direct genetic testing. The type of genetic testing depends on confidence
  of the diagnosis, patient's and affected relatives' symptoms, and the number of
  disease genes. Single gene, disease-specific gene panels, and large dementia panels
  are available. Genetic counseling should be given and informed consent obtained.
  Predictive testing follows the Huntington disease protocol.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
  object_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the object of the statement, e.g. "severe" or "with additional complications">
