input_text: 'A mobile, high-throughput semi-automated system for testing cognition
  in large non-primate animal models of Huntington disease. BACKGROUND: For reasons
  of cost and ethical concerns, models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington
  disease (HD) are currently being developed in farm animals, as an alternative to
  non-human primates. Developing reliable methods of testing cognitive function is
  essential to determining the usefulness of such models. Nevertheless, cognitive
  testing of farm animal species presents a unique set of challenges. The primary
  aims of this study were to develop and validate a mobile operant system suitable
  for high throughput cognitive testing of sheep. NEW METHOD: We designed a semi-automated
  testing system with the capability of presenting stimuli (visual, auditory) and
  reward at six spatial locations. Fourteen normal sheep were used to validate the
  system using a two-choice visual discrimination task. Four stages of training devised
  to acclimatise animals to the system are also presented. RESULTS: All sheep progressed
  rapidly through the training stages, over eight sessions. All sheep learned the
  2CVDT and performed at least one reversal stage. The mean number of trials the sheep
  took to reach criterion in the first acquisition learning was 13.9+-1.5 and for
  the reversal learning was 19.1+-1.8. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): This is
  the first mobile semi-automated operant system developed for testing cognitive function
  in sheep. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed and validated an automated operant behavioural
  testing system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing in sheep and other
  medium-sized quadrupeds, such as pigs and dogs. Sheep performance in the two-choice
  visual discrimination task was very similar to that reported for non-human primates
  and strongly supports the use of farm animals as pre-clinical models for the study
  of neurodegenerative diseases.'
