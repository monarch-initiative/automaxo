input_text: Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration by means of
  coenzyme Q10 and its analogues. Coenzyme Q10 is a small electron carrier of the
  respiratory chain with antioxidant properties, widely used for the treatment of
  mitochondrial disorders. Mitochondrial diseases are neuromuscular disorders caused
  by impairment of the respiratory chain and increased generation of reactive oxygen
  species. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation is fundamental in patients with primary coenzyme
  Q10 deficiency. Furthermore, coenzyme Q10 and its analogues, idebenone and mitoquinone
  (or MitoQ), have been also used in the treatment of other neurogenetic/neurodegenerative
  disorders. In Friedreich ataxia idebenone may reduce cardiac hypertrophy and, at
  higher doses, also improve neurological function. These compounds may also play
  a potential role in other conditions which have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction,
  such as Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and
  Alzheimer disease. This review introduces mitochondrial disorders and Friedreich
  ataxia as two paradigms of the tight links existing between oxidative stress, respiratory
  chain dysfunction and neurodegeneration, and focuses on current and emerging therapeutic
  uses of coenzyme Q10 and idebenone in neurology.
