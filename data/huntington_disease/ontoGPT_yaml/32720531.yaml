input_text: "Gene therapy and immunotherapy as promising strategies to combat Huntington's
  disease-associated neurodegeneration: emphasis on recent updates and future perspectives.INTRODUCTION:
  Modulation of gene expression using gene therapy as well as modulation of immune
  activation using immunotherapy has attracted considerable attention as rapidly emerging
  potential therapeutic intervention for the treatment of HD. Several preclinical
  and clinical trials for gene-based therapy and immunotherapy/antibody-based have
  been conducted. AREAS COVERED: This review focused on the potential use of gene
  therapy and immuno-based therapies to treat HD, including the current status, the
  rationale for these approaches as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting
  it. Growing knowledge of HD pathogenesis has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic
  targets, some of which are now in clinical trials. Focus has been allocated to RNA
  and DNA-based gene therapies for the reduction of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), using
  Immuno/antibody-based therapies. EXPERT OPINION: While safety and efficacy of gene
  therapy and immunotherapy has been well demonstrated for HD, therefore much focus
  has now been shifted to disease-modifying therapies. This review defines the current
  status and future directions of gene therapy and immunotherapies. The review summarizes
  by what means HD genetic root cause modification and functional restoration of mHtt
  protein could be achieved by using targeted multimodality gene therapy and immunotherapy
  to target intracellular and extracellular mHtt."
