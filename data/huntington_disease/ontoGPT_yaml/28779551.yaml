input_text: Body weight is a robust predictor of clinical progression in Huntington
  disease. Unintended weight loss is a hallmark of Huntington disease (HD), but it
  is unknown to what extent weight loss impacts the rate of disease progression. Therefore,
  using longitudinal data from the Enroll-HD study, we assessed the association between
  baseline body mass index (BMI) and the rate of clinical progression in 5,821 HD
  mutation carriers. We found that high baseline BMI was associated with a significantly
  slower rate of functional, motor, and cognitive deterioration (all p < 0.001), independent
  of mutant HTT CAG repeat size. Our findings provide strong rationale for exploration
  of systemic metabolism as a therapeutic target in HD. Ann Neurol 2017;82:479-483.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
