input_text: "Response inhibition subprocesses and dopaminergic pathways: basal ganglia
  disease effects. Response inhibition is a component of executive functions, which
  can be divided into distinct subprocesses by means of event-related potentials (ERPs).
  These subprocesses are (pre)-motor inhibition and inhibition monitoring, which are
  probably reflected by the Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3, respectively. Here we ask, if these
  subprocesses may depend on distinct basal ganglia subsystems. We examined response
  inhibition processes in an extended sample of young and elderly subjects, patients
  with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington' disease (HD). This combination of
  groups also allow us to study whether, and to what degree, pathological basal ganglia
  changes and healthy aging have similar and/or different effects on these processes.
  We show that subprocesses of response inhibition are differentially modulated by
  distinct basal ganglia circuits. Processes related to (pre)-motor inhibition appear
  to be modulated by the nigrostriatal system, and are sensitive to aging and age-related
  basal ganglia diseases (i.e. PD). Parkinson's disease induces additive effects of
  aging and pathology. In contrast, inhibition monitoring is most likely modulated
  by the mesocortico-limbic dopamine system. These processes are equally affected
  in healthy aging and both basal ganglia diseases (i.e. PD, HD)."
