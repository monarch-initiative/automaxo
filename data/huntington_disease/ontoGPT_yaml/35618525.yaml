input_text: 'In vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenetic
  diseases versus unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis for Huntington disease:
  a cost-effectiveness analysis.OBJECTIVE: To investigate if in vitro fertilization
  (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease is cost effective
  for heterozygous individuals with Huntington disease vs. unassisted conception with
  prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a theoretical cohort
  of 3,851 couples, where one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. SETTING:
  N/A. PATIENTS/ANIMALS: None. INTERVENTION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation
  genetic testing for couples attempting conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes
  included cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both parents in addition
  to secondary outcomes of procedure-related loss, spontaneous abortion, termination
  of pregnancy, and early/normal/late-onset Huntington disease. A willingness-to-pay
  threshold was set at $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In vitro fertilization preimplantation
  genetic testing is lower in cost and higher in effectiveness compared to unassisted
  conception with prenatal diagnosis among couples with one heterozygous Huntington
  disease individual, making it the dominant strategy. In vitro fertilization preimplantation
  genetic testing was associated with 77 more QALYs and a cost savings of $46,394,268.
  All measured outcomes were lower in the IVF preimplantation genetic testing strategy,
  including 39 fewer procedure-related losses, 39 fewer spontaneous abortions, and
  462 fewer terminations of pregnancy. Most notably, in our theoretical cohort of
  couples, IVF preimplantation genetic testing resulted in 1,079 fewer Huntington
  disease-affected offspring. Our results were robust over a wide range of assumptions.
  CONCLUSION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is a cost-effective
  conception strategy compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis when
  one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. Not only can morbidity and
  mortality incurred by Huntington disease be mitigated for the offspring with the
  use of IVF preimplantation genetic testing, but this study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness
  of using IVF preimplantation genetic testing for those with Huntington disease.'
