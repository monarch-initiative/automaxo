input_text: 'Experience over fifteen years with a protocol for predictive testing
  for Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To compile a comprehensive profile of the participants
  who had predictive testing from Huntington disease (HD) between 1994 and 2008 in
  Montreal, Canada. METHOD: This is a retrospective cohort study. The predictive testing
  protocol consisted of a telephone interview to give information about predictive
  testing and collect demographic data; a psychological assessment and counseling
  session; a session focused on medical and family history of HD; a session reserved
  for genetic counseling; a session where results were given to participants; and
  a follow-up telephone interview. RESULTS: A total of 181 applicants requested presymptomatic
  testing. 135 applicants (77 women and 58 men) completed the protocol and received
  test results while 40 withdrew. Of the latter, 3 manifested symptoms of the disease
  and were referred to a neurologist or psychiatrist, and 3 had previously been tested
  by linkage analysis. Participants usually mentioned more than one reason for requesting
  predictive testing but the most frequent was to put an end to uncertainty concerning
  their risk of illness. The proportion of positive and negatives test results was
  40% and 54.1% respectively, significantly different from the expected 50% (p<0.01).
  Prenatal testing was not frequently requested. CONCLUSION: All the participants
  expressed satisfaction regarding their decision to be tested. None to our knowledge
  had a catastrophic reaction (major depressive disorder or psychiatric hospitalization,
  declared suicide attempt or suicide). Our study highlights that preparation for
  receiving test results is a psychologically complex process for which appropriate
  support in a timely fashion is critical. We feel that a cautious and ethical case
  by case approach remains essential and that high standards of testing should be
  maintained because of the far reaching impact of test results.'
