input_text: Behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological evidence for presymptomatic
  alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in the transgenic rat model for huntington
  disease. Cognitive decline precedes motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD). A
  transgenic rat model for HD carrying only 51 CAG repeats recapitulates the late-onset
  HD phenotype. Here, we assessed prefrontostriatal function in this model through
  both behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Behavioral examination consisted
  in a temporal bisection task within a supra-second range (2 vs.8 s), which is thought
  to involve prefrontostriatal networks. In two independent experiments, the behavioral
  analysis revealed poorer temporal sensitivity as early as 4 months of age, well
  before detection of overt motor deficits. At a later symptomatic age, animals were
  impaired in their temporal discriminative behavior. In vivo recording of field potentials
  in the dorsomedial striatum evoked by stimulation of the prelimbic cortex were studied
  in 4- to 5-month-old rats. Input/output curves, paired-pulse function, and plasticity
  induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were assessed. Results showed an altered
  plasticity, with higher paired-pulse facilitation, enhanced short-term depression,
  as well as stronger long-term potentiation after TBS in homozygous transgenic rats.
  Results from the heterozygous animals mostly fell between wild-type and homozygous
  transgenic rats. Our results suggest that normal plasticity in prefrontostriatal
  circuits may be necessary for reliable and precise timing behavior. Furthermore,
  the present study provides the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence
  of a presymptomatic alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in an animal model
  for Huntington disease and suggests that supra-second timing may be the earliest
  cognitive dysfunction in HD.
