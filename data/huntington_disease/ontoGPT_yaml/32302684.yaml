input_text: "CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB might be important biomarkers in
  kidney transplant rejection.BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant rejection is considered
  as a vital factor of kidney transplant failure. Therefore, it's necessary to search
  for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study,
  we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney
  transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression
  network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days
  post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential
  kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment
  analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING
  database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and
  the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of
  organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with
  the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB
  in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network
  analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We reported several potential genes may be associated with
  the kidney transplant rejection, which should provide novel biomarkers for kidney
  transplant surveillance."
