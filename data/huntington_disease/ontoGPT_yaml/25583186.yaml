input_text: 'Partial rescue of some features of Huntington Disease in the genetic
  absence of caspase-6 in YAC128 mice. Huntington Disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
  disease caused by an elongated CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes
  a polyglutamine tract in the HTT protein. Proteolysis of the mutant HTT protein
  (mHTT) has been detected in human and murine HD brains and is implicated in the
  pathogenesis of HD. Of particular importance is the site at amino acid (aa) 586
  that contains a caspase-6 (Casp6) recognition motif. Activation of Casp6 occurs
  presymptomatically in human HD patients and the inhibition of mHTT proteolysis at
  aa586 in the YAC128 mouse model results in the full rescue of HD-like phenotypes.
  Surprisingly, Casp6 ablation in two different HD mouse models did not completely
  prevent the generation of this fragment, and therapeutic benefits were limited,
  questioning the role of Casp6 in the disease. We have evaluated the impact of the
  loss of Casp6 in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. Levels of the mHTT-586 fragment are
  reduced but not absent in the absence of Casp6 and we identify caspase 8 as an alternate
  enzyme that can generate this fragment. In vivo, the ablation of Casp6 results in
  a partial rescue of body weight gain, normalized IGF-1 levels, a reversal of the
  depression-like phenotype and decreased HTT levels. In the YAC128/Casp6-/- striatum
  there is a concomitant reduction in p62 levels, a marker of autophagic activity,
  suggesting increased autophagic clearance. These results implicate the HTT-586 fragment
  as a key contributor to certain features of HD, irrespective of the enzyme involved
  in its generation. '
