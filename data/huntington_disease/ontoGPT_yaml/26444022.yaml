input_text: 'Practice Effects and Stability of Neuropsychological and UHDRS Tests
  Over Short Retest Intervals in Huntington Disease. BACKGROUND: In Huntington disease
  (HD), cognitive changes due to disease-progression or treatment are potentially
  confounded by "practice effects" (PE)--performance improvement from prior exposure
  to test materials. OBJECTIVE: A practice run-in ("dual baseline") was used in an
  HD cognitive trial to determine if PE could be minimized and evaluate performance
  trajectories over multiple visits. METHODS: Non-depressed adults (N = 36) with mild
  to moderate HD-related cognitive deficits participated in a clinical trial to examine
  the efficacy of citalopram to enhance cognition. Cognitive tests were administered
  at three visits (2 weeks separating each visit), before active treatment randomization.
  Some tests were also administered at screening. Therefore 3-4 pre-treatment repetitions
  were available. We examined test improvement using repeated-measures ANOVAs with
  planned pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Despite the practice run-in and use of alternate
  test forms, results indicated ongoing improvements over at least three test sessions
  on all three UHDRS cognitive tests. Trails A and B showed improvements between the
  third and fourth session, which suggests that one pre-baseline visit may not be
  effective in reducing practice on this important and commonly used test. CONCLUSIONS:
  Overall, 7 out of 13 variables showed some degree of short-term PE, even after multiple
  sessions and alternate forms. Tests assessing processing speed and memory may be
  particularly confounded by ongoing PE across at least 2-3 sessions. Practice run-in
  periods and alternate forms may help minimize the impact of such effects in HD clinical
  trials but awareness of which tests are most susceptible to PE is important in clinical
  trial design.'
