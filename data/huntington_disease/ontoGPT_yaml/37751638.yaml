input_text: "The shape of things to come. Mapping spatiotemporal progression of striatal
  morphology in Huntington disease: The IMAGE-HD study. Mapping the spatiotemporal
  progression of neuroanatomical change in Huntington's Disease (HD) is fundamental
  to the development of bio-measures for prognostication. Statistical shape analysis
  to measure the striatum has been performed in HD, however there have been a limited
  number of longitudinal studies. To address these limitations, we utilised the Spherical
  Harmonic Point Distribution Method (SPHARM-PDM) to generate point distribution models
  of the striatum in individuals, and used linear mixed models to test for localised
  shape change over time in pre-manifest HD (pre-HD), symp-HD (symp-HD) and control
  individuals. Longitudinal MRI scans from the IMAGE-HD study were used (baseline,
  18 and 30 months). We found significant differences in the shape of the striatum
  between groups. Significant group-by-time interaction was observed for the putamen
  bilaterally, but not for caudate. A differential rate of shape change between groups
  over time was observed, with more significant deflation in the symp-HD group in
  comparison with the pre-HD and control groups. CAG repeats were correlated with
  bilateral striatal shape in pre-HD and symp-HD. Robust statistical analysis of the
  correlates of striatal shape change in HD has confirmed the suitability of striatal
  morphology as a potential biomarker correlated with CAG-repeat length, and potentially,
  an endophenotype."
