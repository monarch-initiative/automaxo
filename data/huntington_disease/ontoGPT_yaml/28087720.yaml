input_text: "A liminal stage after predictive testing for Huntington disease. BACKGROUND:
  Following predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD), knowledge of one's carrier
  status may have consequences on disease onset. Our study aimed to address two questions.
  First, does knowledge of being a carrier of the pathological HD mutation trigger
  onset of the disease? Second, does this knowledge influence self-awareness and allow
  carriers to identify signs and symptoms of disease onset? METHODS: Between 2012
  and 2015, 75 HD mutation carriers were examined using the Unified Huntington's Disease
  Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score. Onset estimation made with the disease burden
  score was compared with UHDRS findings. We collected qualitative data with questionnaires
  and semistructured interviews. RESULTS: 38 women and 37 men, aged 43.7 years+-10.5
  (20-68), were interviewed after a mean delay between test and study interview of
  10.5 years+-4.7 (from 4 to 21 years). Estimation of age at onset was 4.5+-8.5 years
  earlier than data-derived age at onset. Participants were categorised according
  to their motor score: scores <5 were premanifest (n=35), and scores >5 were manifest
  carriers (n=40). Self-observation was a major preoccupation for all, independent
  of their clinical status (82% vs 74%, p=0.57). Among manifest carriers, 56% thought
  they showed symptoms, but only 33% felt ill. Interestingly, this was also observed
  in those without motor signs (20% and 9%). Being a mutation carrier did not significantly
  facilitate recognition of motor signs. Interviews with premanifest carriers allowed
  the burden of self-observation to be illustrated despite lack of motor signs. CONCLUSIONS:
  Estimating age at onset based on disease burden score may not be accurate. The transition
  to disease was experienced as an ambiguous or liminal experience. The view of mutation
  carriers is not always concordant with medical onset estimation, highlighting the
  difficulties involved in the concept of onset and its use as an outcome in future
  disease-modifying trials."
