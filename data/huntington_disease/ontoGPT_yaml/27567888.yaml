input_text: "Therapeutic Effects of Anthocyanins and Environmental Enrichment in R6/1
  Huntington's Disease Mice. BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive
  neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment or cure. Environmental enrichment
  has been used to slow processes leading to ageing and neurodegenerative diseases
  including HD. Phenolic phytochemicals including anthocyanins have also been shown
  to improve brain function in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: This
  study examined the effects of anthocyanin dietary supplementation and environmental
  enrichment on behavioural phenotypes and brain cholesterol metabolic alterations
  in the R6/1 mouse model of HD. METHODS: R6/1 HD mice and their wild-type littermate
  controls were randomised into the different experimental conditions, involving either
  environmentally enriched versus standard housing conditions, or anthocyanin versus
  control diet. Motor dysfunction was assessed from 6 to 26 weeks using the RotaRod
  and the hind-paw clasping tests. Gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry was
  used to quantify a broad range of sterols in the striatum and cortex of R6/1 HD
  mice. RESULTS: Anthocyanin dietary supplementation delayed the onset of motor dysfunction
  in female HD mice. Environmental enrichment improved motor function and the hind
  paw clasping phenotype in male HD mice only. These mice also had lower levels of
  cholesterol oxidation products in the cortex compared to standard-housed mice. CONCLUSION:
  Both anthocyanin supplementation and environmental enrichment are able to improve
  the motor dysfunction phenotype of R6/1 mice, however the effectiveness of these
  interventions was different between the two sexes. The interventions examined did
  not alter brain cholesterol metabolic deficits that have been reported previously
  in this mouse model of HD."
