input_text: YAC128 mouse model of Huntington disease is protected against subtle chronic
  manganese (Mn)-induced behavioral and neuropathological changes. Manganese (Mn)
  is an essential micronutrient but excessive levels induce neurotoxic effects. Increasing
  evidence suggests a deficit of bioavailable Mn in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited
  neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and cognitive disturbances. Previous
  studies have shown rescue of some molecular HD phenotypes by acute Mn exposure.
  This study simultaneously examined the potential for chronic Mn exposure to attenuate
  HD behavioral phenotypes, and for the HD genotype to offer protection against detrimental
  effects of chronic Mn exposure. In two independent studies a chronic Mn exposure
  paradigm was implemented in the YAC128 mouse model of HD and behavior was assessed
  at several timepoints. Study 1 exposed WT and YAC128 mice to twice weekly subcutaneous
  injections of 0, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 32 weeks of
  age. A promising protective effect against motor coordination decline in 5 mg/kg
  MnCl[2] tetrahydrate-treated YAC128 mice was detected. Study 2 thus exposed WT and
  YAC128 mice to either 0 or 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 52 weeks of age
  (with a partial randomized treatment crossover at 31 weeks). The same protective
  effect was not observed under these conditions at higher statistical power. We report
  subtle toxicological changes in exploratory behavior and total activity induced
  by chronic Mn exposure in WT mice only, despite similar total increases in brain
  Mn in WT and YAC128 mice. Further, chronic Mn treatment resulted in a 10-12 % decrease
  in striatal NeuN positive cell density in WT mice but not YAC128 mice, despite vehicle
  cell counts already being reduced compared to WT mice as expected for the HD genotype.
  The subtle changes observed in specific outcome measures, but not others, following
  long-term low-level Mn exposure in WT mice delineate the neurobehavioral and neuropathological
  effects at the threshold of chronic Mn toxicity. We conclude that these chronic
  low-dose Mn exposures do not significantly rescue behavioral HD phenotypes, but
  YAC2128 mice are protected against the subtle Mn-induced behavioral changes and
  decreased striatal neuron density observed in Mn-exposed WT mice.
