input_text: Characteristics of individuals with Huntington disease in long-term care.
  This is a retrospective review of 97 Huntington disease (HD) patients living in
  long-term care facilities in the Twin Cities. The purpose of the study was to describe
  the demographic features, patterns of behavior, weight change, nursing issues, medication
  use, and hospitalization in this population. On admission to the nursing home, the
  "average" HD patient was of either sex, 45 years old, previously employed, a high
  school graduate, and not married. One third had severe behavior problems. Half gained
  and half lost weight; weight loss was not a predictor of death. Almost all used
  central nervous system-active drugs, most commonly neuroleptics. Eighty-four percent
  were ambulatory on admission, but 88% of those who died were nonambulatory at the
  time of death. We concluded that (a) HD patients are demographically different from
  other residents of long-term care facilities, (b) weight gain can occur in some
  late-stage patients, (c) negative behavior is a significant problem but is restricted
  to a subset of patients, and (d) adapting creatively to increasing multifaceted
  disability is the greatest challenge to the staff in facilities caring for HD patients.
