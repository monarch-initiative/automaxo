input_text: "Cognition-oriented treatments and physical exercise on cognitive function
  in Huntington's disease: a systematic review.Cognitive impairment is prevalent in
  Huntington's disease (HD), with no treatments currently available. While cognition-oriented
  treatments and physical exercise have shown efficacy in improving cognition in other
  populations, they have not been systematically reviewed in HD. This systematic review
  aims to examine the effects of cognitive and exercise interventions on cognition
  in HD, along with effects on psychosocial function, functional independence, and
  neuroimaging outcomes. Seventeen studies (three cognitive, seven exercise, seven
  combining cognitive and physical exercise) were included. While there was generally
  low certainty of evidence, interventions that included cognitive training appeared
  to have larger effect sizes on cognition, while physical exercise (alone or combined
  with cognitive rehabilitation or stimulation) showed negligible effect sizes. On
  the other hand, combined interventions had larger effects on psychosocial function.
  Finally, effects on functional independence appeared negligible following exercise
  and combined interventions, and effects on neuroimaging outcomes were inconclusive.
  Larger studies should seek to confirm the benefits of cognitive and physical interventions,
  and further explore changes in functional independence and neural outcomes."
