input_text: "The Impact of Huntington Disease on Family Carers: a Literature Overview.
  Caring for a person with chronic disease often rests on the patient's family. Nevertheless,
  most studies on the needs, quality of life and caregiver burden focus on different
  types of dementia, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke, cancer
  or mental illnesses. Less attention has been paid to informal caregivers of patients
  with Huntington's disease (HD). Meanwhile, psychosocial implications of HD are much
  more serious and wide-ranging. Thus, this paper aims to review the literature on
  the costs of caring for a person with HD (pHD). The review identifies the aspects
  of caregiving that are the most burdensome to family caregivers: negative experience
  with health and social care services, dissatisfaction with caregiving role, concern
  over children, loss of meaningful relationship with pHD, family breakdown and loss
  of social contacts and decrease in health. It also describes strategies of coping
  with HD. While the analysis points to the many similarities between taking care
  of HD patients and those suffering from other neurodegenerative disorders, it also
  emphasizes the factors associated with HD that are not present in other diseases:
  early onset, severity of symptoms, prolonged trajectory, its genetic, i.e. hereditary
  character and social ignorance of HD. It concludes that while in medical setting
  the HD patient is the one who draws professional attention, it is often the unaffected
  family caregiver who needs the most attention, support and help. "
