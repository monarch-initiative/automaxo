input_text: 'Efficacy of ethyl-EPA as a treatment for Huntington disease: a systematic
  review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: After MRI studies suggested the efficacy of
  ethyl-EPA in reducing the progressive brain atrophy in Huntington disease (HD),
  trials were conducted to test its efficacy as a treatment for HD. Trials that continued
  for 6 months did not find any significant improvement, urging discontinuation of
  the drug. However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of
  motor functions in these patients. METHODS: We searched 12 electronic databases
  to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening,
  only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to
  compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality
  effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months.
  FINDINGS: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no
  significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested
  significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score-4 in both
  fixed and quality effect models [MD = -2.720, 95% CI (-4.76, -.68), p = 0.009; MD
  = -2.225, 95% CI (-3.842, -0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score
  showed significant results [MD = -1.013, 95% CI (-1.793, -0.233), p = 0.011] in
  only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming
  test or symbol digit modality. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis indicated a significant
  improvement of motor scores only after 12 months. These results should be interpreted
  cautiously because only two studies had assessed the efficacy of ethyl-EPA after
  12 months with one of them having a 6-month open-label phase.'
