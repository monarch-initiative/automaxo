input_text: rAAV-mediated shRNA ameliorated neuropathology in Huntington disease model
  mouse. Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder
  associated with expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the gene coding the
  protein huntingtin (htt). Although the feasibility of RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated
  reduction of htt expression to attenuate HD-associated symptoms is suggested, the
  effects of post-symptomatic RNAi treatment in the HD model mice have not yet been
  certified. Here we show the effects of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated
  delivery of RNAi into the HD model mouse striatum after the onset of disease. Neuropathological
  abnormalities associated with HD, such as insoluble protein accumulation and down-regulation
  of DARPP-32 expression, were successfully ameliorated by the RNAi transduction.
  Importantly, neuronal aggregates in the striatum were reduced after RNAi transduction
  in the animals comparing to those at the time point of RNAi transduction. These
  results suggest that the direct inhibition of mutant gene expression by rAVV would
  be promising for post-symptomatic HD therapy.
