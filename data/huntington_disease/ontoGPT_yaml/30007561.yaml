input_text: AAV5-miHTT Gene Therapy Demonstrates Broad Distribution and Strong Human
  Mutant Huntingtin Lowering in a Huntington's Disease Minipig Model. Huntington's
  disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide
  repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Previously, we showed strong huntingtin
  reduction and prevention of neuronal dysfunction in HD rodents using an engineered
  microRNA targeting human huntingtin, delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV)
  serotype 5 vector with a transgene encoding an engineered miRNA against HTT mRNA
  (AAV5-miHTT). One of the challenges of rodents as a model of neurodegenerative diseases
  is their relatively small brain, making successful translation to the HD patient
  difficult. This is particularly relevant for gene therapy approaches, where distribution
  achieved upon local administration into the parenchyma is likely dependent on brain
  size and structure. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the translation of huntingtin-lowering
  gene therapy to a large-animal brain. We investigated the feasibility, efficacy,
  and tolerability of one-time intracranial administration of AAV5-miHTT in the transgenic
  HD (tgHD) minipig model. We detected widespread dose-dependent distribution of AAV5-miHTT
  throughout the tgHD minipig brain that correlated with the engineered microRNA expression.
  Both human mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in all
  brain regions transduced by AAV5-miHTT. The combination of widespread vector distribution
  and extensive huntingtin lowering observed with AAV5-miHTT supports the translation
  of a huntingtin-lowering gene therapy for HD from preclinical studies into the clinic.
