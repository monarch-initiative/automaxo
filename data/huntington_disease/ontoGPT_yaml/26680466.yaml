input_text: 'Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping Suggests Altered Brain Iron in Premanifest
  Huntington Disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with premanifest (nonsymptomatic)
  and advanced Huntington disease, changes in brain iron levels in the basal ganglia
  have been previously reported, especially in the striatum. Quantitative susceptibility
  mapping by using MR phase imaging allows in vivo measurements of tissue magnetic
  susceptibility, which has been shown to correlate well with iron levels in brain
  gray matter and is believed to be more specific than other imaging-based iron measures.
  The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of magnetic susceptibility
  as a biomarker of disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen subjects with
  premanifest Huntington disease and 16 age-matched healthy controls were scanned
  at 7T. Magnetic susceptibility, effective relaxation, and tissue volume in deep
  gray matter structures were quantified and compared with genetic and clinical measures.
  RESULTS: Subjects with premanifest Huntington disease showed significantly higher
  susceptibility values in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus, indicating
  increased iron levels in these structures. Significant decreases in magnetic susceptibility
  were found in the substantia nigra and hippocampus. In addition, significant volume
  loss (atrophy) and an increase effective relaxation were observed in the caudate
  nucleus and putamen. Susceptibility values in the caudate nucleus and putamen were
  found to be inversely correlated with structure volumes and directly correlated
  with the genetic burdens, represented by cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat age-product-scaled
  scores. CONCLUSIONS: The significant magnetic susceptibility differences between
  subjects with premanifest Huntington disease and controls and their correlation
  with genetic burden scores indicate the potential use of magnetic susceptibility
  as a biomarker of disease progression in premanifest Huntington disease.'
