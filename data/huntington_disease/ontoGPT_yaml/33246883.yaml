input_text: 'Induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the developing striatum as
  a potential donor source for cell replacement therapy for Huntington disease.BACKGROUND:
  Cell replacement therapy (CRT) for Huntington disease (HD) requires a source of
  striatal (STR) progenitors capable of restoring the function lost due to STR degeneration.
  Authentic STR progenitors can be collected from the fetal putative striatum, or
  whole ganglionic eminence (WGE), but these tissues remain impractical for widespread
  clinical application, and alternative donor sources are required. Here we begin
  exploring the possibility that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from
  WGE may retain an epigenetic memory of their tissue of origin, which could enhance
  their ability to differentiate into STR cells. RESULTS: We generate four iPSC lines
  from human WGE (hWGE) and establish that they have a capacity similar to human embryonic
  stem cells with regard to their ability to differentiate toward an STR phenotype,
  as measured by expression and demethylation of key STR genes, while maintaining
  an overall different methylome. Finally, we demonstrate that these STR-differentiated
  hWGE iPSCs share characteristics with hWGE (i.e., authentic STR tissues) both in
  vitro and following transplantation into an HD model. Overall, iPSCs derived from
  human WGE show promise as a donor source for CRT for HD.'
