input_text: Targeting Hsp70 facilitated protein quality control for treatment of polyglutamine
  diseases. The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of nine fatal, adult-onset
  neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of mutant
  proteins containing toxic expansions of CAG/polyQ tracts. The heat shock protein
  90 and 70 (Hsp90/Hsp70) chaperone machinery is a key component of cellular protein
  quality control, playing a role in the regulation of folding, aggregation, and degradation
  of polyQ proteins. The ability of Hsp70 to facilitate disaggregation and degradation
  of misfolded proteins makes it an attractive therapeutic target in polyQ diseases.
  Genetic studies have demonstrated that manipulation of Hsp70 and related co-chaperones
  can enhance the disaggregation and/or degradation of misfolded proteins in models
  of polyQ disease. Therefore, the development of small molecules that enhance Hsp70
  activity is of great interest. However, it is still unclear if currently available
  Hsp70 modulators can selectively enhance disaggregation or degradation of misfolded
  proteins without perturbing other Hsp70 functions essential for cellular homeostasis.
  This review discusses the multifaceted role of Hsp70 in protein quality control
  and the opportunities and challenges Hsp70 poses as a potential therapeutic target
  in polyQ disease.
