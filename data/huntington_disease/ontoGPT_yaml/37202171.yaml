input_text: 'Pearls and Oy-sters: Huntington Disease Presenting as Primary Progressive
  Aphasia: A Case of Semantics. We present a case of semantic variant primary progressive
  aphasia (PPA) as the presenting feature in a patient with Huntington disease (HD).
  The patient initially developed progressive language impairment including impaired
  naming, object knowledge and single word comprehension and then developed chorea
  and behavioural changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed left
  anterior temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy. A neurological FDG PET/CT showed
  reduced metabolism in the head of the left caudate nucleus. Huntingtin gene testing
  revealed an expansion of 39 CAG repeats in one allele. This case outlines the substantial
  overlap between the clinical presentation of HD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration
  (FTLD) syndromes and provides commentary on the investigation of these neurodegenerative
  diseases.'
