input_text: 'Pearls and Oy-sters: Huntington Disease Presenting as Primary Progressive
  Aphasia: A Case of Semantics.We present a case of semantic variant primary progressive
  aphasia (PPA) as the presenting feature in a patient with Huntington disease (HD).
  The patient initially developed progressive language impairment including impaired
  naming, object knowledge and single word comprehension and then developed chorea
  and behavioural changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed left
  anterior temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy. A neurological FDG PET/CT showed
  reduced metabolism in the head of the left caudate nucleus. Huntingtin gene testing
  revealed an expansion of 39 CAG repeats in one allele. This case outlines the substantial
  overlap between the clinical presentation of HD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration
  (FTLD) syndromes and provides commentary on the investigation of these neurodegenerative
  diseases.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
