  disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease
  (HD) is a degeneration of the brain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical
  activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals
  with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references
  and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from
  MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception
  to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The
  primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as
  a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality
  strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were
  finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait
  endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004),
  the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p =
  0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50
  to 3.16; p = 0.007). No benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL,
  balance and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of programs PA were observed
  for walking endurance lower limb functionality strenght and cognition function in
  low and moderate stage of HD. However, no benefits were found for motor function,
  gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. All authors included aerobic exercises in
  their programs but is unclear if vigorous and intensive PA is optimal for individuals
  with HD."
