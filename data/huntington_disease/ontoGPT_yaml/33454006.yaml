input_text: "AggreCount: an unbiased image analysis tool for identifying and quantifying
  cellular aggregates in a spatially defined manner.Protein quality control is maintained
  by a number of integrated cellular pathways that monitor the folding and functionality
  of the cellular proteome. Defects in these pathways lead to the accumulation of
  misfolded or faulty proteins that may become insoluble and aggregate over time.
  Protein aggregates significantly contribute to the development of a number of human
  diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's
  disease. In vitro, imaging-based, cellular studies have defined key biomolecular
  components that recognize and clear aggregates; however, no unifying method is available
  to quantify cellular aggregates, limiting our ability to reproducibly and accurately
  quantify these structures. Here we describe an ImageJ macro called AggreCount to
  identify and measure protein aggregates in cells. AggreCount is designed to be intuitive,
  easy to use, and customizable for different types of aggregates observed in cells.
  Minimal experience in coding is required to utilize the script. Based on a user-defined
  image, AggreCount will report a number of metrics: (i) total number of cellular
  aggregates, (ii) percentage of cells with aggregates, (iii) aggregates per cell,
  (iv) area of aggregates, and (v) localization of aggregates (cytosol, perinuclear,
  or nuclear). A data table of aggregate information on a per cell basis, as well
  as a summary table, is provided for further data analysis. We demonstrate the versatility
  of AggreCount by analyzing a number of different cellular aggregates including aggresomes,
  stress granules, and inclusion bodies caused by huntingtin polyglutamine expansion."
