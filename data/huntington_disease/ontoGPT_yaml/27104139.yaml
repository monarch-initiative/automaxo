input_text: 'Linking white matter and deep gray matter alterations in premanifest
  Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative
  disorder for which only symptomatic treatment is available. A better understanding
  of the pathology, and identification of biomarkers will facilitate the development
  of disease-modifying treatments. HD is potentially a good model of a neurodegenerative
  disease for development of biomarkers because it is an autosomal-dominant disease
  with complete penetrance, caused by a single gene mutation, in which the neurodegenerative
  process can be assessed many years before onset of signs and symptoms of manifest
  disease. Previous MRI studies have detected abnormalities in gray and white matter
  starting in premanifest stages. However, the understanding of how these abnormalities
  are related, both in time and space, is still incomplete. In this study, we combined
  deep gray matter shape diffeomorphometry and white matter DTI analysis in order
  to provide a better mapping of pathology in the deep gray matter and subcortical
  white matter in premanifest HD. We used 296 MRI scans from the PREDICT-HD database.
  Atrophy in the deep gray matter, thalamus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens was
  analyzed by surface based morphometry, and while white matter abnormalities were
  analyzed in (i) regions of interest surrounding these structures, using (ii) tractography-based
  analysis, and using (iii) whole brain atlas-based analysis. We detected atrophy
  in the deep gray matter, particularly in putamen, from early premanifest stages.
  The atrophy was greater both in extent and effect size in cases with longer exposure
  to the effects of the CAG expansion mutation (as assessed by greater CAP-scores),
  and preceded detectible abnormalities in the white matter. Near the predicted onset
  of manifest HD, the MD increase was widespread, with highest indices in the deep
  and posterior white matter. This type of in-vivo macroscopic mapping of HD brain
  abnormalities can potentially indicate when and where therapeutics could be targeted
  to delay the onset or slow the disease progression. '
