input_text: "Recent Synergy of Nanodiamonds: Role in Brain-Targeted Drug Delivery
  for the Management of Neurological Disorders.The aim of the present review article
  is to summarize the role of nanodiamonds in various neurological diseases. We have
  taken related literature of making this review article from ScienceDirect, springer,
  Research gate, PubMed, Sci-finder, etc. The current approaches for treating neurological
  conditions such as glioblastoma includes chemotherapy or combination anti-retro
  viral therapy for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or use of anti-Alzheimer drugs
  during cognitive impairment. These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief
  as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate
  the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation
  in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting
  of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease,
  Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis,
  Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia,
  epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to
  their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent
  surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization,
  multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted
  drug delivery with minimal side effects."
