input_text: CRISPR-Based Gene Editing Techniques in Pediatric Neurological Disorders.The
  emergence of gene editing technologies offers a unique opportunity to develop mutation-specific
  treatments for pediatric neurological disorders. Gene editing systems can potentially
  alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically
  altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
  (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments
  because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many
  such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts
  to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate
  pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies,
  it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding
  of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such
  therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals
  of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen,
  and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.
