input_text: "The Appointment of a Huntington's Disease Nurse Specialist has Reduced
  Admission Rate and Improved Admission Quality. We aimed to determine if the appointment
  of a Huntington's disease (HD) nurse specialist has influenced inpatient admission
  rates and admission quality at Auckland Hospital. We collated HD inpatient admission
  data for the 32 months before and after her appointment and compared the quality
  of cognition, mood, speech/swallowing and safety assessments between admissions
  where the nurse was and was not involved. After the appointment of the HD nurse
  there was a 51% reduction in average monthly HD admission rates (p = 0.0009). HD
  admissions specifically related to HD decreased by 54% (p = 0.005). There was also
  an improvement in the quality of admissions. "
