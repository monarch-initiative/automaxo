input_text: "Neurophysiological study of facial chorea in patients with Huntington's
  disease. OBJECTIVE: Choreic movements of patients with Huntington's disease (HD)
  may result from an abnormal control of sensory inputs. In order to further examine
  the pathophysiology of facial choreic movements (FCM), we carried out a neurophysiological
  study, including prepulse inhibition of the blink reflex (BR), in HD patients with
  and without FCM. METHODS: The study was conducted in 20 genetically proven HD patients
  with Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores of FCM ranging between
  0 and 3, and in 12 age-matched healthy volunteers who served as control subjects.
  We counted the number of spontaneous blinks, recorded the electromyographic activity
  underlying FCM, and analyzed latency, amplitude, and duration of the BR responses
  to electrical and auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition was studied by comparing
  the responses to test trials with those to control trials. In control trials BRs
  were obtained to either a single supraorbital nerve electrical stimulus (EBR) or
  to a 90dB auditory stimulus (ABR). In test trials, the same stimuli were preceded
  by the prepulse, which was either a weak acoustic tone or a weak electrical stimulus
  to the third finger, delivered 30-150 ms before. RESULTS: Spontaneous blinking rate
  was abnormally low in 3 patients, and abnormally high in 9 patients. Mean duration
  of the BR was longer in patients than in control subjects. In prepulse trials, the
  percentage inhibition of the BR was abnormally reduced in 15 patients to at least
  one sensory modality, and significantly correlated with the score of FCM. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our results suggest that the severity of FCM in patients with HD might be an expression
  of a disturbance in motor control partly related to an abnormal processing of sensory
  inputs. Such abnormality involves circuits used in prepulse inhibition of the BR."
