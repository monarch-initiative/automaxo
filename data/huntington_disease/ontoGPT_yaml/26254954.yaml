input_text: 'Observational Gait Assessments in People With Neurological Disorders:
  A Systematic Review. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical and psychometric properties
  of observational gait assessment scales in people with neurological disorders. DATA
  SOURCES: The databases used for the literature search were MEDLINE, the Cochrane
  Central Register of Controlled Trial, Web of Science, and the Cumulative Index to
  Nursing and Allied Health. The search was conducted between September 15 and November
  30, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that investigate and validate observational gait
  assessment scales in people with central nervous system disorders. DATA EXTRACTION:
  General characteristics of the studies, including number of patients and observational
  gait assessment scales analyzed and their psychometric properties, were extracted.
  DATA SYNTHESIS: After the literature search, 15 articles were included in this review.
  Seven of the 15 articles studied the Tinetti Gait Scale (TGS), 2 studied the Rivermead
  Visual Gait Assessment (RVGA), 1 studied the Gait Assessment and Intervention Tool
  (G.A.I.T.), 3 studied the Wisconsin Gait Scale, and one of them compared the TGS
  and the G.A.I.T. CONCLUSIONS: The scale that appears to be the most suitable for
  both clinical practice and research is the G.A.I.T. because it has shown to be valid,
  reliable, and sensitive to change, homogeneous, and comprehensive, containing a
  large number of items that assess most components of the gait pattern. The RVGA
  was studied in those with diverse neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis.
  For those with Parkinson disease, the TGS showed sensitivity and the Tinetti Performance-Oriented
  Mobility Assessment (POMA) showed predictive capability for falls and mortality
  as well as intra- and interrater reliability. The Tinetti POMA was also studied
  in those with normal pressure hydrocephalus, showing sensitivity and in those with
  Huntington disease, showing reliability and validity. More research is needed to
  more comprehensively analyze the psychometric properties of the RVGA, Wisconsin
  Gait Scale, TGS, and G.A.I.T. in patients with diverse neurological disorders, other
  than stroke.'
