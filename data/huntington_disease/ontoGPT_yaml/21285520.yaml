input_text: The importance of integrating basic and clinical research toward the development
  of new therapies for Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a dominantly
  inherited neurodegenerative disorder that results from expansion of the polyglutamine
  repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. There are currently no effective treatments
  for this devastating disease. Given its monogenic nature, disease modification therapies
  for HD should be theoretically feasible. Currently, pharmacological therapies aimed
  at disease modification by altering levels of HTT protein are in late-stage preclinical
  development. Here, we review current efforts to develop new treatments for HD based
  on our current understanding of HTT function and the main pathological mechanisms.
  We emphasize the need to enhance translational efforts and highlight the importance
  of aligning the clinical and basic research communities to validate existing hypotheses
  in clinical studies. Human and animal therapeutic trials are presented with an emphasis
  on cellular and molecular mechanisms relevant to disease progression.
