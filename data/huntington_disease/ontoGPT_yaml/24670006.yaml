input_text: 'Curvature enhances binding and aggregation of huntingtin at lipid membranes.
  Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded
  polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in the first exon of the huntingtin (Htt) protein,
  facilitating its aggregation. Htt interacts with a variety of membraneous structures
  within the cell, and the first 17 amino acids (Nt17) of Htt directly flanking the
  polyQ domain comprise an amphiphathic alpha-helix (AH) lipid-binding domain. AHs
  are also known to detect membrane curvature. To determine if Htt exon 1 preferentially
  binds curved membranes, in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies were performed.
  Supported lipid bilayers are commonly used as model membranes for AFM studies of
  protein aggregation. However, these supported bilayers usually lack curvature. By
  forming a bilayer on top of silica nanobeads (50 +- 10 nm) deposited on a silicon
  substrate, model supported lipid bilayers with flat and curved regions were developed
  for AFM studies. The presence of the bilayer over the beads was validated by continual
  imaging of the formation of the bilayer, height measurements, and spatially resolved
  mechanical measurements of the resulting bilayer using scanning probe acceleration
  microscopy. Interpretation of this data was facilitated by numerical simulations
  of the entire imaging process. The curved supported bilayers associated with the
  beads were found to be more compliant than flat supported bilayers, consistent with
  the altered packing density of lipids caused by the induced curvature. This model
  bilayer system was exposed to a synthetic truncated Htt exon 1 peptide (Nt17Q35P10KK),
  and this peptide preferentially accumulated on curved membranes, consistent with
  the ability of AHs to sense membrane curvature. '
