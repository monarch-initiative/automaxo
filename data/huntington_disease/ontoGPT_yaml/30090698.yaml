input_text: Complex spatial and temporally defined myelin and axonal degeneration
  in Huntington disease. Although much prior work has focused on the basal ganglia
  and cortical pathology that defines Huntington's disease (HD), recent studies have
  also begun to characterize cerebral white matter damage (Rosas et al., 2006; Dumas
  et al., 2012; Poudel et al., 2014). In this study, we investigated differences in
  the large fascicular bundles of the cerebral white matter of gene-positive HD carriers,
  including pre-manifest individuals and early symptomatic patients, using recently
  developed diffusion tractography procedures. We examined eighteen major fiber bundles
  in 37 patients with early HD (average age 55.2 +- 11.5, 14 male, 23 female), 31
  gene-positive, motor negative pre-symptomatic HD (PHD) (average age 48.1 +- 11.5,
  13 male, 18 female), and 38 healthy age-matched controls (average age 55.7 +- 8.6,
  14 male, 24 female), using the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA)
  procedure available as part of the FreeSurfer image processing software package.
  We calculated the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean radial (RD) and axial
  diffusivities (AD) for each fiber bundle. We also evaluated the relationships between
  diffusion measures, cognition and regional cortical thinning. We found that early
  changes in RD of select tracts in PHD subjects were associated with impaired performance
  on neuropsychological tests, suggesting that early changes in myelin might underlie
  early cognitive dysfunction. Finally, we found that increases in AD of select tracts
  were associated with regionally select cortical thinning of areas known to atrophy
  in HD, including the sensorimotor, supramarginal and fusiform gyrus, suggesting
  that AD may be reflecting pyramidal cell degeneration in HD. Together, these results
  suggest that white matter microstructural changes in HD reflect a complex, clinically
  relevant and dynamic process.
