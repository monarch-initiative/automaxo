input_text: "Measures of postural control and mobility during dual-tasking as candidate
  markers of instability in Huntington's disease.BACKGROUND: Individuals with Huntington's
  disease (HD) have impairments in performing dual-tasks, however, there is limited
  information about the effects of changing postural and cognitive demands as well
  as which measures are best suited as markers of underlying motor-cognitive interference.
  METHODS: Forty-three individuals with HD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed
  single tasks of walking (Timed Up & Go (TUG), 7 m walk), standing (feet together,
  feet apart and foam surface) and seated cognitive performance (Stroop, Symbol Digit
  Modalities Test (SDMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting test)
  and dual cognitive-motor tasks while standing (+ Stroop) and walking (+ DKEFS, TUG
  cognitive). APDM Opal sensors recorded measures of postural sway and time to complete
  motor tasks. RESULTS: Individuals with HD had a greater increase in standing postural
  sway compared to HC from single to dual-tasks and with changes to support surface.
  Both groups demonstrated a decrease in gait performance during the TUG cognitive,
  however, this difference was greater in people with HD compared to HC. While those
  with HD showed a greater dual-task motor cost compared to HC, both groups behaved
  similarly as condition complexity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Standing postural sway
  is a more sensitive marker of instability than change in standard gait speed, particularly
  under dual-task conditions. The more complex TUG cognitive is a sensitive measure
  of walking dual-task performance. The results of this study provide insights about
  the nature of motor-cognitive impairments in HD and provide support for a distinction
  between static and dynamic postural control mechanisms during performance of dual-tasks."
