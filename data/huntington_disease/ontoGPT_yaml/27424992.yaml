input_text: Bone marrow cells differentiation into organ cells using stem cell therapy.
  Bone marrow cells (BMC) are progenitors of bone, cartilage, skeletal tissue, the
  hematopoiesis-supporting stroma and adipocyte cells. BMCs have the potential to
  differentiate into neural cells, cardiac myocytes, liver hepatocytes, chondrocytes,
  renal, corneal, blood, and myogenic cells. The bone marrow cell cultures from stromal
  and mesenchymal cells are called multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs). MAPCs
  can differentiate into mesenchymal cells, visceral mesoderm, neuroectoderm and endoderm
  in vitro. It has been shown that the stem cells derived from bone marrow cells (BMCs)
  can regenerate cardiac myocytes after myocardial infarction (MI). Adult bone marrow
  mesenchymal stem cells have the ability to regenerate neural cells. Neural stem/progenitor
  cells (NS/PC) are ideal for treating central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such
  as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington disease. However, there are important
  ethical issues about the therapeutic use of stem cells. Neurons, cardiac myocytes,
  hepatocytes, renal cells, blood cells, chondrocytes and adipocytes regeneration
  from BMCs are very important in disease control. It is known that limbal epithelial
  stem cells in the cornea can repair the eye sight and remove symptoms of blindness.
  Stem cell therapy (SCT) is progressing well in animal models, but the use of SCT
  in human remains to be explored further.
