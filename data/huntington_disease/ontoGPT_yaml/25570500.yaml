input_text: 'Assessment of gait direction changes during straight-ahead walking in
  healthy elderly and Huntington disease patients using a shank worn MIMU. The aim
  of this study was to propose and comparatively evaluate four methods for assessing
  stride-by-stride changes of direction of progression, during straight walking using
  measurements of a magnetic and inertial unit placed above the malleolus. The four
  methods were evaluated by comparing their estimate of the gait changes of direction
  of progression with that obtained from an instrumented gait mat used as a gold standard.
  The methods were applied to the data obtained from the gait of both healthy subjects
  and patients with Huntington Disease, the latter characterized by a jerky swing
  phase. The results showed that the errors associated to the best estimates of the
  gait direction changes were about 10% of its range of variability for the healthy
  subjects and increased to about 30% for the patients, both walking at comfortable
  speed when the range of variability is the largest. Additional testing on gait at
  various radius of curvature should be carried out to fully validate the MIMU-based
  estimates. '
