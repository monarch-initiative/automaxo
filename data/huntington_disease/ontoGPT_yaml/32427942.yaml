input_text: Hyperpolarization of the subthalamic nucleus alleviates hyperkinetic movement
  disorders.Modulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) firing patterns with injections
  of depolarizing currents into the STN is an important advance for the treatment
  of hypokinetic movement disorders, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). Chorea,
  ballism and dystonia are prototypical examples of hyperkinetic movement disorders.
  In our previous study, normal rats without nigro-striatal lesion were rendered hypokinetic
  with hyperpolarizing currents injected into the STN. Therefore, modulation of the
  firing pattern by injection of a hyperpolarizing current into the STN could be an
  effective treatment for hyperkinetic movement disorders. We investigated the effect
  of injecting a hyperpolarizing current into the STNs of two different types of hyperkinetic
  animal models and a patient with an otherwise uncontrollable hyperkinetic disorder.
  The two animal models included levodopa-induced hyperkinetic movement in parkinsonian
  rats (L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia model) and hyperkinesia induced by an intrastriatal
  injection of 3-nitropropionic acid (Huntington disease model), covering neurodegeneration-related
  as well as neurotoxin-induced derangement in the cortico-subcortical re-entrant
  loops. Delivering hyperpolarizing currents into the STN readily alleviated the hyperkinetic
  behaviors in the two animal models and in the clinical case, with an evident increase
  in subthalamic burst discharges in electrophysiological recordings. Application
  of a hyperpolarizing current into the STN via a Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode
  could be an effective general therapy for a wide spectrum of hyperkinetic movement
  disorders.
