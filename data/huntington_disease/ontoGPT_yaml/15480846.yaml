input_text: Novel bifunctional drugs targeting monoamine oxidase inhibition and iron
  chelation as an approach to neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative
  diseases. Iron has been shown to accumulates at site where neurons degenerate in
  neurodegenerative diseases of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington
  disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Friedreich ataxia. Iron is thought to
  participate or initiate oxidative stress via generation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), such as hydroxyl radical. Iron chelators are neuroprotective and prevent
  6-hydroxydoapmine and MPTP dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rats and mice. However,
  their action on monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B have not been determined previously
  since MAO-B inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in cellular and animal
  models of Parkinson's disease. The chelators 8-hydroxyquinoline, O-phenanthroline,
  2,2'-dipyridyl, U74500A and U74600F showed a preference for inhibition of rat brain
  mitochondrial MAO-A over MAO-B. Their IC(50) ranged from 10(-3) M to 10(-6) M, with
  21-amino steroids (U74500A and U74006F) showing a greater selectivity and potency
  for MAO-A. Desferrioxamine (desferal), a prototype potent iron chelator, exhibited
  relatively poor MAO inhibitory. The inhibitions of MAO-A and B by 21-amino steroids
  (Lazaroids) were time dependent and irreversible. Those initiated by 8-hydroxyquinoline,
  2,2'-dipyridyl and O-phenanthroline were fully reversible by enzyme dilution experiments.
  Both Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) reverse the MAO-A and B inhibition induced by the latter
  chelators, but not those initiated by 21-amino steroids. The data infer that either
  the inhibition of MAO by 21-amino steroids is either the resultant of their conversion
  to an irreversible covalently bound ligand or that the iron chelation moiety and
  MAO inhibitory activity in these compounds are not mutually shared. The results
  suggest that bifunctional brain penetrable drugs with iron chelating property and
  MAO inhibitory activity in could be the most feasible approach for neuroprotection
  in neurodegenerative diseases. Such drug would prevent participation of elevated
  iron in oxidative stress and formation of reactive hydroxyl radical, via its interaction
  with H(2)O2 (Fenton chemistry), generated as a consequence MAO and other oxidative
  enzyme reactions to generative cytotoxic reactive hydroxyl radical. We have now
  developed several of these compounds with neuroprotective, MAO inhibitory and iron
  chelating properties from our prototype iron chelators, VK-28 possessing propargylamine
  moiety of our anti-parkinson drug, rasagiline.
