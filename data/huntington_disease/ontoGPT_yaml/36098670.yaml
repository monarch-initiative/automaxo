input_text: Evaluation of Deutetrabenazine's Potential to Delay Cardiac Repolarization
  Using Concentration-QTc Analysis.Deutetrabenazine (Austedo) is indicated in adults
  for chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. Escalating
  deutetrabenazine doses were administered to healthy volunteers who were cytochrome
  P450 2D6 extensive/intermediate metabolizers (EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs) to
  determine pharmacokinetic exposure of parent drug and active metabolites (alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine
  [alpha-HTBZ] and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine [beta-HTBZ]), and collect corresponding
  electrocardiograms (ECGs) for evaluation of the cardiodynamic effect using concentration-QTc
  (C-QTc) modeling. Participants (12 EMs, 24 PMs) received placebo or single doses
  of deutetrabenazine (24, 48, and 72 mg) to achieve plasma concentrations exceeding
  therapeutic range in both cohorts. Pharmacokinetic samples were obtained over 72
  hours after dosing and were time matched with 12-lead ECGs extracted from continuous
  ECG recordings. C-QTc analysis, using linear mixed-effects modeling and model selection
  procedure, characterized the relationship between plasma concentrations of deutetrabenazine,
  deuterated alpha-HTBZ and beta-HTBZ, and the change from baseline in QT interval
  corrected using Fridericia's formula. Deutetrabenazine exhibited linear kinetics,
  and a C-QTc model with deuterated alpha-HTBZ and beta-HTBZ was selected to best
  describe the C-QTc relationship in pooled EM and PM data. This model predicted a
  placebo-corrected Fridericia corrected QT interval prolongation higher than 10 milliseconds
  can be excluded at concentrations associated with the maximum recommended doses
  in both populations. Adverse events increased with higher exposure as reflected
  by the higher event number in the PM cohort receiving 48 and 72 mg doses. No subject
  discontinued due to cardiac-related adverse events and no clinically relevant ECG
  findings were reported. Thus, this study found that deutetrabenazine does not have
  a clinically relevant effect on QT prolongation at maximum recommended doses in
  either cytochrome P450 2D6 EMs or PMs.
