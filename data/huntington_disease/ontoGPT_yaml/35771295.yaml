input_text: "Huntington's disease and neurovascular structure of retina.BACKGROUND:
  Retinal biomarkers in neurodegenerative disorders have attracted much attention
  in recent years. Recent studies have reported visual dysfunction in Huntington's
  disease (HD). However, little is known about retinal structural changes in HD. METHODS:
  A total of 50 subjects, including 25 motor-manifest HD patients and 25 gender- and
  age-matched controls, were enrolled. Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Score-Motor
  part was assessed in HD patients. Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)
  was used to evaluate the macular thickness and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber
  layer (pRNFL). Superficial and deep capillary plexus densities were measured using
  OCT angiography (OCTA). To account for inter-eye correlation, generalized estimating
  equation (GEE) model was used. RESULTS: HD patients had a significant reduction
  in macular thickness in both inner and outer superior sectors and the inferior outer
  sector. Inferior pRNFLs were significantly decreased in thickness. There was no
  significant difference in retinal capillary plexus density between the two groups.
  Age and disease duration were negatively correlated with macular thickness in HD
  patients. However, the severity of motor involvement was not correlated with SD-OCT
  or OCTA parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We observed attenuated pRNFL and macular retinal
  thickness in patients with HD, independent of macular capillary plexus parameters.
  It can support the hypothesis that the retina may be a potential biomarker for monitoring
  the neurodegenerative process in HD."
