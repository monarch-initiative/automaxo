input_text: "Factors Associated with the Place of Death in Huntington Disease: Analysis
  of Enroll-HD.Background: Most people prefer to die at home. Hospice is the standard
  in end-of-life care for people with Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative
  genetic disorder that affects people in middle adulthood. Yet, we have little knowledge
  regarding the place of death for people with HD. Therefore, the current state of
  knowledge limits HD clinicians' ability to conduct high-quality goals of care conversations.
  Objectives: We sought to determine the factors associated with the place of death
  in people with HD. Design: We obtained cross-sectional data from Enroll-HD and included
  participants with a positive HD mutation of 36 or more CAG repeats. Results: Out
  of 16,120 participants in the Enroll-HD study, 536 were reported as deceased. The
  mean age at death was 60. The leading place of death was home (29%), followed by
  the hospital (23%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of dying at a skilled nursing
  facility was significantly lower for those partnered (aOR: 0.48, confidence interval
  [95% CI]: 0.26-0.86). The aOR for dying on hospice compared to home was increased
  in a person with some college and above (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.21-4.75). Conclusions:
  Our data further suggest that models that predict the place of death for serious
  illnesses do not appear to generalize to HD. The distribution in the places of death
  within HD was not uniform. Our findings may assist HD clinicians in communication
  during goals of care conversations."
