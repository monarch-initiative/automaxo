input_text: 'hiPSCs for predictive modelling of neurodegenerative diseases: dreaming
  the possible.Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were first generated
  in 2007, but the full translational potential of this valuable tool has yet to be
  realized. The potential applications of hiPSCs are especially relevant to neurology,
  as brain cells from patients are rarely available for research. hiPSCs from individuals
  with neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases have facilitated biological
  and multi-omics studies as well as large-scale screening of chemical libraries.
  However, researchers are struggling to improve the scalability, reproducibility
  and quality of this descriptive disease modelling. Addressing these limitations
  will be the first step towards a new era in hiPSC research - that of predictive
  disease modelling - involving the correlation and integration of in vitro experimental
  data with longitudinal clinical data. This approach is a key element of the emerging
  precision medicine paradigm, in which hiPSCs could become a powerful diagnostic
  and prognostic tool. Here, we consider the steps necessary to achieve predictive
  modelling of neurodegenerative disease with hiPSCs, using Huntington disease as
  an example.'
