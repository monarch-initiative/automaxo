input_text: Progress and challenges in RNA interference therapy for Huntington disease.
  Huntington disease is an incurable, dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by
  polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein. Reducing mutant huntingtin
  expression may offer a treatment for Huntington disease. RNA interference has emerged
  as a powerful method to silence dominant disease genes. As such, it is being developed
  as a prospective Huntington disease therapy. Here I discuss the current progress
  and important remaining challenges of RNA interference therapy for Huntington disease.
