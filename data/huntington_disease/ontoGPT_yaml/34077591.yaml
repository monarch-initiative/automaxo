input_text: "Clinical predictors and neural correlates for compromised swallowing
  safety in Huntington disease.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dysphagia is one of the most
  common and important complications in Huntington disease (HD), frequently leading
  to aspiration pneumonia and mortality. Objective estimates of prevalence using instrumental
  diagnostics and data on neural correlates of dysphagia in HD are scarce or lacking
  entirely. Similarly, its correlation with other clinical markers is still not fully
  known. We aimed at defining clinical risk factors and neural correlates for compromised
  swallowing safety in HD more precisely. METHODS: Thirty-four HD subjects (16 female,
  Shoulson & Fahn Stage I-IV, two premanifest) underwent a full clinical-neurological
  examination including the cranial nerves, the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating
  Scale total motor score, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Fiberoptic endoscopic
  evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was performed by a trained speech and language therapist.
  Twenty-six subjects additionally underwent a high-resolution anatomical magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) scan (T1, 3-T Siemens Prisma). Moreover, we correlated clinical
  and atrophy (MRI) measures with swallowing safety levels as judged by the validated
  Penetration-Aspiration Scale. RESULTS: FEES showed penetration or aspiration in
  70.6%. Using partial correlation, no significant correlations were found between
  swallowing safety and any of the clinical markers after correcting for disease duration
  and CAG repeat length. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated atrophy associated with
  compromised swallowing safety in a network of parietothalamocerebellar areas related
  to sensorimotor communication, notably excluding striatum. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
  characterise dysphagia in HD as a disorder of communication between sensory and
  motor networks involved in swallowing. This finding and high rates of silent aspiration
  argue in favor of instrumental swallowing evaluation early in the disease."
