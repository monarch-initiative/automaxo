input_text: 'Long-term cortical atrophy after excitotoxic striatal lesion: effects
  of intrastriatal fetal-striatum grafts and implications for Huntington disease.
  It is not currently clear whether the cortical atrophy observed in Huntington disease
  (HD) is entirely a direct consequence of the disease or at least partially a secondary
  consequence of striatal atrophy. This is of major importance for evaluating the
  possible therapeutic value of intrastriatal fetal-striatum grafts in HD. Cresyl
  violet-stained sections from rats that had received striatal excitotoxic lesions
  1 wk or 4 wk previously showed small and statistically nonsignificant decreases
  in the thickness of cortical layers V and VI, while series from rats lesioned 12
  months previously showed marked decreases in the thickness of the whole cortex (approximately
  35% decrease), layer V (approximately 45%-50%) and layer VI (approximately 45%-50%),
  together with marked neuron loss in these layers. In deep layer V and layer VI,
  Fluoro-Jade staining showed labeled neurons in animals lesioned 1 wk previously,
  labeled neurons and astrocytes in animals lesioned 4 wk previously, and practically
  no labeling in animals lesioned 12 months previously. Intracortical injection of
  Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin revealed that corticostriatal fibers were practically
  absent from the lesioned area of striata lesioned 12 months previously. However,
  rats that received intrastriatal fetal-striatum grafts shortly after the lesion
  and were killed 12 months later showed a significant reduction in cortical atrophy,
  and a large number of labeled corticostriatal fibers surrounding and innervating
  the graft. In addition, a reduction in the number of Fluoro-Jade-labeled cells in
  the cortex was already apparent at 3 wk post-grafting. Regardless of whether HD
  has a primary effect on the cortex, the present results suggest that the striatal
  degeneration caused by HD contributes markedly to the cortical atrophy, and that
  intrastriatal grafts may ameliorate this secondary component of the cortical degeneration.'
