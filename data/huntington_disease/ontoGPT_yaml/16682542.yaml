input_text: 'Testosterone therapy in men with Parkinson disease: results of the TEST-PD
  Study. BACKGROUND: Testosterone deficiency has been reported in patients with Parkinson
  disease (PD), Alzheimer disease, and Huntington disease. It is not known whether
  testosterone therapy (TT) in men with borderline hypogonadism and neurodegenerative
  diseases will be of substantial benefit. Previously, we reported that testosterone
  deficiency is more common in patients with PD compared with age-matched control
  subjects, and we also reported in 2 small open-label studies that some nonmotor
  symptoms responded favorably to TT. OBJECTIVE: To define the effects of TT on nonmotor
  and motor symptoms in men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. DESIGN:
  Double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center trial. PATIENTS:
  Two experimental groups: patients with PD who were receiving either TT or placebo.
  INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either the study drug by intramuscular injection
  (200 mg/mL of testosterone enanthate every 2 weeks for 8 weeks) or placebo (isotonic
  sodium chloride solution injections). In patients in each group, the testosterone
  serum concentration was obtained at each study visit. During 2 study visits, testosterone
  levels were blindly evaluated and the intramuscular testosterone dose was increased
  by 200 mg/mL if the free testosterone value failed to double from the baseline value.
  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was the St Louis Testosterone
  Deficiency Questionnaire, and secondary outcome measures included measures of mood,
  cognition, fatigue, motor function, and frequency of adverse events. At the end
  of the double-blind phase, all patients were offered open-label TT and were followed
  up after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Fifteen patients in the placebo group (mean age,
  69.9 years), receiving a mean total levodopa equivalent dose of 924 mg/d, had a
  baseline free testosterone level of 47.91 pg/mL, compared with 15 patients in the
  TT group (mean age, 66.7 years), receiving an average total levodopa equivalent
  dose of 734 mg/d, who had a baseline free testosterone level of 63.49 pg/mL. Testosterone
  was generally well tolerated. More subjects in the TT group experienced lower extremity
  edema (40% vs 20%). In 2 patients, 1 in each group, prostate-specific antigen levels
  were elevated from baseline. The improvement in the TT group compared with the placebo
  group (1.7 vs 1.1) on the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Scale was not statistically
  significant. In addition, there were no significant differences in motor and nonmotor
  features of PD between the 2 groups, although a few subscales showed improvements
  (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, P<.04; and Backward Visual Span subtrial, P<.03).
  However, long-term open-label TT resulted in delayed but sustained improvement in
  subjects in the TT group who continued to receive treatment (n = 6) compared with
  subjects in the placebo group who elected not to receive TT (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS:
  Testosterone therapy was generally well tolerated in elderly men with PD and probable
  testosterone deficiency. While there was no significant difference in the motor
  and nonmotor scales between the TT and placebo groups at the end of 8 weeks compared
  with baseline, this may be due to several study limitations, including small sample
  size, a strong placebo effect with intramuscular therapy, and short follow-up that
  did not allow measurement of delayed effects of TT in some subjects. Until more
  definitive studies are reported, practitioners should be particularly cautious in
  treatment of low testosterone concentrations in men with PD and borderline testosterone
  deficiency, and careful consideration should be given to the risks vs the benefits
  of TT.'
