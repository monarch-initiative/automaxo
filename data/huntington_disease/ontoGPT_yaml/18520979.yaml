input_text: 'A study of chorea after tetrabenazine withdrawal in patients with Huntington
  disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess tetrabenazine (TBZ) efficacy by evaluating the change
  in Huntington disease-associated chorea resulting from TBZ treatment withdrawal.
  METHODS: Thirty patients treated in the long term were randomized to 1 of 3 groups
  assigned to withdraw from TBZ in a double-blind, staggered fashion during a 5-day
  period. RESULTS: The chorea scores of subjects withdrawn from TBZ treatment increased
  by 5.3 units from days 1 to 3, whereas the scores of the group with partial or no
  withdrawal of TBZ treatment increased by 3.0 units (P = 0.0773). A post hoc analysis
  of the linear trend was positive for reemergent chorea (P = 0.0486). No serious
  adverse events were reported after abrupt withdrawal of TBZ treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
  The trend for reemergence of chorea in patients with Huntington disease who were
  withdrawn from TBZ treatment is consistent with the findings from previous studies,
  thus showing the effectiveness of TBZ in reducing chorea.'
