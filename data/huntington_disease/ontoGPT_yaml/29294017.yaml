input_text: 'The Italian National Rare Diseases Registry: a model of comparison and
  integration with Hospital Discharge Data. BACKGROUND: Italy has been the first country
  at European level to implement a population-based public health registry dedicated
  to rare diseases. This study describes the current situation of the Italian National
  Rare Diseases Registry (NRDR) and compares its data with those from the National
  Hospital Discharge Database (HDD). METHODS: Three rare diseases were analysed: Huntington
  disease (HD), Hereditary Haemorragic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Prader-Willi Syndrome
  (PWS), selected for their different characteristics. The two sources (NRDR and HDD)
  were linked: incidence rate ratio (IRR), sensitivity and predictive positive value
  (PPV) were calculated. RESULTS: Incidence rates from NRDR and from HDD were compared
  by age groups, and IRR calculated: 1.08 for HD, 1.41 for HHT, 1.21 for PSW. For
  HD, sensitivity was 0.52 and PPV 0.48; for HHT sensitivity was 0.71 and PPV 0.52;
  for PWS the sensitivity was 0.71 and PPV 0.58. We found a strong regional variability
  in the results. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated use of the two sources helps tracking
  those cases that are not captured by the Registry; further, it is a precious tool
  to accurately describe clinical histories of rare disease affected individuals,
  in terms of concomitant pathologies and medical procedures performed during hospitalization.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
