input_text: "[Which interventions are recommended in the last phase of Huntington
  disease?]Huntington Disease is a chronically progressive and neurodegenerative disease,
  which leads to death after 10 to 30 years of suffering and worsening. When suffering
  Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological
  issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in
  the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the
  patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted.
  In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency.
  The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's
  why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning
  to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making
  regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by
  themselves."
