input_text: 'Early decrease of type 1 cannabinoid receptor binding and phosphodiesterase
  10A activity in vivo in R6/2 Huntington mice. Several lines of evidence imply early
  alterations in endocannabinoid and phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) signaling in Huntington
  disease (HD). Using [(18)F]MK-9470 and [(18)F]JNJ42259152 small-animal positron
  emission tomography (PET), we investigated for the first time cerebral changes in
  type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor binding and PDE10A levels in vivo in presymptomatic,
  early symptomatic, and late symptomatic HD (R6/2) mice, in relation to glucose metabolism
  ([(18)F]FDG PET), brain morphology (magnetic resonance imaging) and motor function.
  Ten R6/2 and 16 wild-type (WT) mice were investigated at 3 different time points
  between the age of 4 and 13 weeks. Parametric CB1 receptor and PDE10A images were
  anatomically standardized to Paxinos space and analyzed voxelwise. Volumetric microMRI
  imaging was performed to assess HD pathology. In R6/2 mice, CB1 receptor binding
  was decreased in comparison with WT in a cluster comprising the bilateral caudate-putamen,
  globus pallidus, and thalamic nucleus at week 5 (-8.1% +- 2.6%, p = 1.7 x 10(-5)).
  Longitudinal follow-up showed further progressive decline compared with controls
  in a cluster comprising the bilateral hippocampus, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus,
  superior colliculus, thalamic nucleus, and cerebellum (late vs. presymptomatic age:
  -13.7% +- 3.1% for R6/2 and +1.5% +- 4.0% for WT, p = 1.9 x 10(-5)). In R6/2 mice,
  PDE10A binding potential also decreased over time to reach significance at early
  and late symptomatic HD (late vs. presymptomatic age: -79.1% +- 1.9% for R6/2 and
  +2.1% +- 2.7% for WT, p = 1.5 x 10(-4)). The observed changes in CB1 receptor and
  PDE10A binding were correlated to anomalies exhibited by R6/2 animals in motor function,
  whereas no correlation was found with magnetic resonance imaging-based striatal
  volume. Our findings point to early regional dysfunctions in endocannabinoid and
  PDE10A signaling, involving the caudate-putamen and lateral globus pallidus, which
  may play a role in the progression of the disease in R6/2 animals. PET quantification
  of in vivo CB1 and/or PDE10A binding may thus be useful early biomarkers for HD.
  Our results also provide evidence of subtle motor deficits at earlier stages than
  previously described. '
