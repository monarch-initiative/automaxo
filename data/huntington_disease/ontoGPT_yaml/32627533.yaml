input_text: Strategies for the Molecular Imaging of Amyloid and the Value of a Multimodal
  Approach.Protein aggregation has been widely implicated in neurodegenerative diseases
  such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington
  disease, as well as in systemic amyloidoses and conditions associated with localized
  amyloid deposits, such as type-II diabetes. The pressing need for a better understanding
  of the factors governing protein assembly has driven research for the development
  of molecular sensors for amyloidogenic proteins. To date, a number of sensors have
  been developed that report on the presence of protein aggregates utilizing various
  modalities, and their utility demonstrated for imaging protein aggregation in vitro
  and in vivo. Analysis of these sensors highlights the various advantages and disadvantages
  of the different imaging modalities and makes clear that multimodal sensors with
  properties amenable to more than one imaging technique need to be developed. This
  critical review highlights the key molecular scaffolds reported for molecular imaging
  modalities such as fluorescence, positron emission tomography, single photon emission
  computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging and includes discussion of the
  advantages and disadvantages of each modality, and future directions for the design
  of amyloid sensors. We also discuss the recent efforts focused on the design and
  development of multimodal sensors and the value of cross-validation across multiple
  modalities.
