input_text: Therapeutic gene silencing delivered by a chemically modified small interfering
  RNA against mutant SOD1 slows amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progression. Inherited
  neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington disease and subset of Alzheimer disease,
  Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are caused by the mutant genes
  that have gained undefined properties that harm cells in the nervous system, causing
  neurodegeneration and clinical phenotypes. Lowering the mutant gene expression is
  predicted to slow the disease progression and produce clinical benefit. Administration
  of small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence specific genes. However, long term
  delivery of siRNA to silence the mutant genes, a requirement for treatment of these
  chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases, remains a critical unsolved issue.
  Here we designed and tested a chemically stabilized siRNA against human Cu,Zn-superoxide
  dismutase (SOD1) in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We show that
  the modified siRNA has enhanced stability and retains siRNA activity. Administration
  of this siRNA at the disease onset by long term infusion into the CNS resulted in
  widespread distribution of this siRNA, knocked down the mutant SOD1 expression,
  slowed the disease progression, and extended the survival. These results bring RNA
  interference therapy one step closer to its clinical application for treatment of
  chronic, devastating, and fatal CNS disorders.
