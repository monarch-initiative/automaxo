input_text: 'Exploring supportive care for individuals affected by Huntington disease
  and their family caregivers in a community setting. AIM: The aim of this research
  was to identify the needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease
  and their family members/carers and to ascertain the extent to which they were supported
  by the type of specialised service provided in this unit. BACKGROUND: The duration
  of the illness may be up to 30 years and there are far reaching implications for
  the affected person, family members and carers. Services for families need to provide
  expert psychological and practical support, whilst remaining planned and flexible.
  The aim of this research was to identify needs and coping strategies of individuals
  with Huntington disease and their carers and ascertain the extent to which they
  were supported by a specialised community service. METHODS: Five focus groups and
  three individual interviews were used to gather data from affected individuals,
  family, carers and staff of the unit (n = 33). A semi-structured discussion guide
  was used in every case. Data were analysed using an inductive coding technique.
  RESULTS: Three main themes emerged; (i) Transitions and the journey, (ii) Challenges
  in finding and providing support and (iii) The role of the unit in providing supportive
  care. While the service was seen as supportive, the need for flexibility was emphasised
  to facilitate the transition from unaffected to affected status. Affected individuals
  felt it was important to be known as the person they had been, despite the changes
  due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of service in a dedicated unit is an
  appropriate way to support affected patients and their carers. Enhancing understanding
  of the disease and allowing the individual to make choices can assist coping with
  this challenging disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is helpful to allow
  patients control over timing and frequency of contact with professionals. Improving
  understanding of the condition in the public and health professionals may enable
  patients to access a greater range of social activities.'
