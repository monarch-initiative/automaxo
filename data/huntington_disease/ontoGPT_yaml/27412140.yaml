input_text: "Diagnosis and misdiagnosis of adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Kufs
  disease). OBJECTIVE: To critically re-evaluate cases diagnosed as adult neuronal
  ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL) in order to aid clinicopathologic diagnosis as a route
  to further gene discovery. METHODS: Through establishment of an international consortium
  we pooled 47 unsolved cases regarded by referring centers as ANCL. Clinical and
  neuropathologic experts within the Consortium established diagnostic criteria for
  ANCL based on the literature to assess each case. A panel of 3 neuropathologists
  independently reviewed source pathologic data. Cases were given a final clinicopathologic
  classification of definite ANCL, probable ANCL, possible ANCL, or not ANCL. RESULTS:
  Of the 47 cases, only 16 fulfilled the Consortium's criteria of ANCL (5 definite,
  2 probable, 9 possible). Definitive alternate diagnoses were made in 10, including
  Huntington disease, early-onset Alzheimer disease, Niemann-Pick disease, neuroserpinopathy,
  prion disease, and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Six cases had
  features suggesting an alternate diagnosis, but no specific condition was identified;
  in 15, the data were inadequate for classification. Misinterpretation of normal
  lipofuscin as abnormal storage material was the commonest cause of misdiagnosis.
  CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of ANCL remains challenging; expert pathologic analysis and
  recent molecular genetic advances revealed misdiagnoses in >1/3 of cases. We now
  have a refined group of cases that will facilitate identification of new causative
  genes."
