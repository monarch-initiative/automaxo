input_text: "Euthanasia and assisted suicide in neurological diseases: a systematic
  review.OBJECTIVE: To identify the neurological diseases for which euthanasia and
  assisted suicide are most frequently requested in the countries where these medical
  procedures are legal and the specific characteristics of euthanasia in some of these
  diseases, and to show the evolution of euthanasia figures. METHODS: We conducted
  a systematic literature review. RESULTS: Dementia, motor neuron disease, multiple
  sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease are the neurological diseases that most frequently
  motivate requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Requests related to dementia
  constitute the largest group, are growing, and raise additional ethical and legal
  issues due to these patients' diminished decision-making capacity. In some countries,
  the ratios of euthanasia requests to all cases of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron
  disease, or Huntington disease are higher than for any other disease. CONCLUSIONS:
  After cancer, neurological diseases are the most frequent reason for requesting
  euthanasia or assisted suicide."
