input_text: 'In vivo evaluation of 18F-MNI698: an 18F-labeled radiotracer for imaging
  of serotonin 4 receptors in brain. UNLABELLED: Serotonin 4 receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine
  receptor 4 [5HT4R]) hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach to multiple brain
  disorders, including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. In vivo imaging of these
  receptors with selective 5HT4R radiotracers and PET would be valuable to investigate
  alterations in 5HT4R in different brain disorders and to assist drug discovery.
  In this study, (18)F-MNI698 was evaluated as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging
  of 5HT4R in the brain. METHODS: Eighteen PET studies were performed in 3 adult rhesus
  monkeys. The radiotracer was administered as a bolus intravenous injection or bolus
  plus constant infusion (time that would be required to inject the bolus at the infusion
  rate = 60 min), and arterial blood was collected for data quantification. Kinetic
  models were used to estimate distribution volumes and binding potentials, for which
  the cerebellum was used as a reference region. (18)F-MNI698 test-retest variability
  and upper mass dose limits were determined. Preblocking studies using several doses
  of SB204070, a selective 5HT4R antagonist, were performed. RESULTS: (18)F-MNI698
  avidly entered the monkey brain (peak percentage injected dose of ~ 6.6%), and its
  brain distribution was consistent with known 5HT4R densities. At 120 min after bolus
  injection and after the start of radiotracer infusion, only less than 5% and approximately
  10% parent compound was present in blood, respectively. Measured binding potentials
  were underestimated by 22%-36% when noninvasive methods were used for data quantification
  in comparison with invasive methods. A good agreement was found between test-retest
  measurements. The radiotracer upper mass dose limit (<5% occupancy) was determined
  to be 13.1 mug per 70 kg of body weight. SB204070 blocked the radiotracer binding
  in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Data indicate that (18)F-MNI698 is a promising
  PET radiotracer for imaging of 5HT4R in the brain, and human studies are warranted
  based on these study results.'
