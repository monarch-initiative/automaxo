input_text: Long-term follow-up of Huntington disease treated by bilateral deep brain
  stimulation of the internal globus pallidus. Deep brain stimulation is now accepted
  as a safe and efficient treatment for movement disorders including selected types
  of dystonia and dyskinesia. Very little, however, is known about its effect on other
  movement disorders, particularly for "choreic" movements. Huntington disease is
  a fatal autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement
  disorders, progressive cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms. Bilateral
  chronic stimulation of the internal globus pallidus was performed to control choreic
  movements in a 60-year-old man with a 10-year history of Huntington disease. Chronic
  deep brain stimulation resulted in remarkable improvement of choreic movements.
  Postoperative improvement was sustained after 4 years of follow-up with a marked
  improvement in daily quality of life.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
