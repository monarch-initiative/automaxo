input_text: Long-term follow-up of Huntington disease treated by bilateral deep brain
  stimulation of the internal globus pallidus. Deep brain stimulation is now accepted
  as a safe and efficient treatment for movement disorders including selected types
  of dystonia and dyskinesia. Very little, however, is known about its effect on other
  movement disorders, particularly for "choreic" movements. Huntington disease is
  a fatal autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement
  disorders, progressive cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms. Bilateral
  chronic stimulation of the internal globus pallidus was performed to control choreic
  movements in a 60-year-old man with a 10-year history of Huntington disease. Chronic
  deep brain stimulation resulted in remarkable improvement of choreic movements.
  Postoperative improvement was sustained after 4 years of follow-up with a marked
  improvement in daily quality of life.
