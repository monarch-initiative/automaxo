input_text: "[Gene Therapy for Huntington Disease].Englisch: Being one of the most
  common genetic neurodegenerative disease, Huntington's disease has been a model
  disease - also for gene therapy. Among the various options, the development of antisense
  oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include
  micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger
  proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of
  application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference
  between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein
  are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular
  toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION
  HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus.
  Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene
  therapy against Huntington's disease."
