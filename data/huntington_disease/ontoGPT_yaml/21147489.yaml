input_text: "The neurology and natural history of patients with indeterminate CAG
  repeat length mutations of the Huntington disease gene. OBJECTIVE: This study aims
  to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate
  CAG repeat length (36-39) of the Huntingtin gene, HTT. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation
  of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard
  deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG
  repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation
  0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological
  examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging
  were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired
  tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and
  impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome
  is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three
  patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression
  was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular
  dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC)
  and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional
  impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations
  and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS:
  This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with
  CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity
  in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given
  to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of
  such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG
  repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and
  treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors."
