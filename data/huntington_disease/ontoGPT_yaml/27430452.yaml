input_text: "Movement disorders. Movement disorders can be hypokinetic (e.g., parkinsonism),
  hyperkinetic, or dystonic in nature and commonly arise from altered function in
  nuclei of the basal ganglia or their connections. As obvious structural changes
  are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic
  disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation
  is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly
  unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for
  differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism.
  Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI),
  positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography
  (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status
  (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein
  deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during
  the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli.
  In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities
  can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor
  disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions. Various
  approaches are reviewed here. "
