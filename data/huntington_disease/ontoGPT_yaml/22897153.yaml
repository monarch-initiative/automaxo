input_text: Dimethyl fumarate - only an anti-psoriatic medication? Fumaric acid esters
  have been used successfully in the therapy of psoriasis vulgaris since 1959. In
  the last 17 years, many of the underlying mechanisms of anti-psoriatic action, such
  as a Th1/Th2 shift, a suppression of important leukocyte adhesion molecules, the
  induction of pro-apoptotic pathways in T-cells and recently anti-angiogenic action,
  have been discovered. Based on the knowledge of these immunomodulatory characteristics,
  fumaric acid esters have been shown to be effective or potentially effective in
  a multitude of dermatological as well as non-dermatological diseases. The range
  of new therapeutic targets reaches from multiple sclerosis to illnesses such as
  necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare and sarcoidosis. Experimental approaches
  offer promising, although preliminary, results on the treatment of cancer, malaria,
  chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and Huntington disease, to name but a few. This
  valued and well-known drug mainly prescribed by dermatologists is now experiencing
  a renaissance far beyond dermatologic applications.
