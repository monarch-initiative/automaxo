input_text: "Stem Cells: A Review Encompassing the Literature with a Special Focus
  on the Side-Lined Miraculous Panacea; Pre-Morula Stem Cells. Stem cells are the
  undifferentiated cells in the body that possess the ability to differentiate and
  give rise to any type of cells in the body. In recent years, there has been a growing
  interest in therapies involving stem cells as different treatment methods got developed.
  Depending on the source, there are two major kinds of stem cells, embryonic and
  adult stem cells. The former type is found in the embryo at the different developmental
  stages before the implantation and excels the latter owing to pluripotency. On the
  premise of the attributes of stem cells, they are touted as the \"panacea for all
  ills\" and are extensively sought for their potential therapeutic roles. There are
  a lot of robust pieces of evidence that have proved to cure the different ailments
  in the body like Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Spinal cord injury
  with stem cell therapy but associated with adverse effects like immune rejection
  and teratoma formation. In this regard, the pre-morula (isolated at an early pre-morula
  stage) stem cells (PMSCs) are one of its kind of embryonic stem cells that are devoid
  of the aforementioned adverse effects. Taking the beneficial factor into account,
  they are being used for the treatment of disorders like Cerebral palsy, Parkinson's
  disorder, Aplastic anemia, Multiple sclerosis and many more. However, it is still
  illegal to use stem cells in the abovementioned disorders. This review encompasses
  different stem cells and emphasizes on PMSCs for their uniqueness in therapy as
  no other previously published literature reviews have taken these into consideration.
  Later in the review, current regulatory aspects related to stem cells are also considered."
