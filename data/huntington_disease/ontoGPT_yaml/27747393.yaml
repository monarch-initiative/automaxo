input_text: "Exercise effects in Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a
  relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms across a wide
  range of neurological domains, including cognitive and motor dysfunction. There
  is still no causative treatment for HD but environmental factors such as passive
  lifestyle may modulate disease onset and progression. In humans, multidisciplinary
  rehabilitation has a positive impact on cognitive functions. However, a specific
  role for exercise as a component of an environmental enrichment effect has been
  difficult to demonstrate. We aimed at investigating whether endurance training (ET)
  stabilizes the progression of motor and cognitive dysfunction and ameliorates cardiovascular
  function in HD patients. Twelve male HD patients (mean +- SD, 54.8 +- 7.1 years)
  and twelve male controls (49.1 +- 6.8 years) completed 26 weeks of endurance training.
  Before and after the training intervention, clinical assessments, exercise physiological
  tests, and a body composition measurement were conducted and a muscle biopsy was
  taken from M. vastus lateralis. To examine the natural course of the disease, HD
  patients were additionally assessed 6 months prior to ET. During the ET period,
  there was a motor deficit stabilization as indicated by the Unified Huntington's
  Disease Rating Scale motor section score in HD patients (baseline: 18.6 +- 9.2,
  pre-training: 26.0 +- 13.7, post-training: 26.8 +- 16.4). Peak oxygen uptake ([Formula:
  see text]) significantly increased in HD patients ( [Formula: see text] = +0.33
  +- 0.28 l) and controls ( [Formula: see text] = +0.29 +- 0.41 l). No adverse effects
  of the training intervention were reported. Our results confirm that HD patients
  are amenable to a specific exercise-induced therapeutic strategy indicated by an
  increased cardiovascular function and a stabilization of motor function."
