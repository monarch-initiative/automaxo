input_text: "Cognitive dysfunction, social behavior disorder, cerebellar ataxia, and
  atypical brain FDG-PET presentation in spinocerebellar ataxia 17: a case report.
  BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) is a rare autosomal dominant form
  of inherited ataxia, caused by heterozygous trinucleotide repeat expansions encoding
  glutamine in the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) gene. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe
  the clinical history, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging findings of a 42-year-old
  patient who presented for medical attention showing prevalent behavioral and cognitive
  problems along with progressively worsening gait disturbances. The patient's family
  history indicated the presence of SCA17 in the maternal lineage. Genetic analysis
  confirmed a heterozygous 52-CAG pathological expansion repeat in TBP (normal interval,
  25-40 CAG. Brain 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed
  bilateral hypometabolism in the sensorimotor cortex, with a slight predominance
  on the right, as well as in the striatal nuclei and thalamic hypermetabolism, a
  finding similar to what is observed in Huntington's disease. The patient also underwent
  neuropsychological evaluation, which revealed mild cognitive impairment and difficulties
  in social interaction and understanding other's emotions (Faux Pas Test and Reading
  the Mind in the Eyes Test). CONCLUSION: Our report emphasizes the importance of
  considering SCA17 as a possible diagnosis in patients with a prevalent progressive
  cognitive and behavioral disorders, even with a pattern of FDG-PET hypometabolism
  not primarily indicative of this disease."
