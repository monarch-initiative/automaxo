input_text: Two-point magnitude MRI for rapid mapping of brown adipose tissue and
  its application to the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington disease. The recent discovery
  of active brown fat in human adults has led to renewed interest in the role of this
  key metabolic tissue. This is particularly true for neurodegenerative conditions
  like Huntington disease (HD), an adult-onset heritable disorder with a prominent
  energy deficit phenotype. Current methods for imaging brown adipose tissue (BAT)
  are in limited use because they are equipment-wise demanding and often prohibitively
  expensive. This prompted us to explore how a standard MRI set-up can be modified
  to visualize BAT in situ by taking advantage of its characteristic fat/water content
  ratio to differentiate it from surrounding white fat. We present a modified MRI
  protocol for use on an 11.7 T small animal MRI scanner to visualize and quantify
  BAT in wild-type and disease model laboratory mice. In this application study using
  the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD we demonstrate a significantly reduced BAT
  volume in HD mice vs. matched controls (n = 5 per group). This finding provides
  a plausible structural explanation for the previously described temperature phenotype
  of HD mice and underscores the significance of peripheral tissue pathology for the
  HD phenotype. On a more general level, the results demonstrate the feasibility of
  MR-based BAT imaging in rodents and open the path towards transferring this imaging
  approach to human patients. Future studies are needed to determine if this method
  can be used to track disease progression in HD and other disease entities associated
  with BAT abnormalities, including metabolic conditions such as obesity, cachexia,
  and diabetes.
