input_text: Connectomic imaging reveals Huntington-related pathological and pharmaceutical
  effects in a mouse model. Recent studies suggest that neurodegenerative diseases
  could affect brain structure and function in disease-specific network patterns;
  however, how spontaneous activity affects structural covariance network (SC) is
  not clear. We hypothesized that hyper-excitability in Huntington disease (HD) disrupts
  the coordinated structural and functional connectivity, and treatment with memantine
  helps to reduce excitotoxicity and normalize the connectivity. MRI was conducted
  to measure somatosensory activation, resting-state functional-connectivity (rsFC),
  SC, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and ALFF covariance (ALFFC) in
  the YAC128 mouse model of HD. We found somatosensory activation was unchanged but
  the subcortical ALFF was increased in HD mice, indicating subcortical but not cortical
  hyperactivity. The reduced sensorimotor rsFC but spared hippocampal and default
  mode networks in the HD mice was consistent with the more pronounced impairment
  in motor function compared with cognitive performance. The disease suppressed SC
  globally and reduced ALFFC in the basal ganglia network as well as its anti-correlation
  with the default mode network. By comparing these connectivity measures, we found
  that the originally coupled rsFC-SC relationship was impaired whereas SC-ALFFC correlation
  was increased by HD, suggesting disease facilitated covariation of brain volume
  and activity amplitude but not neural synchrony. The comparison with mono-synaptic
  axonal projection supports the hypothesis that rsFC, but not SC or ALFFC, is highly
  dependent on structural connectivity under healthy conditions. Treatment with memantine
  had a strong effect on normalizing the SC and reducing ALFF while slightly increasing
  other connectivity measures and restoring the rsFC-SC coupling, which is consistent
  with its effect on alleviating hyper-excitability and improving the coordinated
  neural growth. These results indicate that HD affects the cerebral structure-function
  relationship which could be partially reverted by NMDA antagonism. These connectivity
  measures provide unique insights into pathological and pharmaceutical effects in
  brain circuitry, and could be translatable biomarkers for evaluating drug effect
  and refining its efficacy.
