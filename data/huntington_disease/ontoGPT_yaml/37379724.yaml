input_text: "Genetic screening for Huntington disease phenocopies in Sweden: A tertiary
  center case series focused on short tandem repeat (STR) disorders.OBJECTIVE: To
  perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a Swedish cohort.
  METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed at a tertiary center
  in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP
  associated with inherited prion diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2),
  spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar
  ataxia-17 (SCA17). Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based
  on the salient phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients
  with SCA17, one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide
  expansions in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia
  11 (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic cases.
  WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar ataxia.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and suggest that
  other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD phenocopies."
