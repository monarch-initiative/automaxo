input_text: 'Expanding the Spectrum of Genes Involved in Huntington Disease Using
  a Combined Clinical and Genetic Approach. IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a
  prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene
  exceeding 35 units. However, not all patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological
  expansion in HTT, and the positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine
  patients with HD phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical
  features of HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt
  to improve the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between
  January 1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with
  an HD phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington
  Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical examination
  and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, and genetic examinations.
  Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 and mutations in PRNP, as
  well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD phenocopies, were first screened.
  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate of HD phenocopies and frequency
  of other etiologies using deep clinical phenotyping and next generation sequencing.
  Our goal was to improve the genetic diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify
  new HD related genes. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological
  CAG repeat expansion in HTT, whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not.
  Huntington disease phenocopies accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset
  was similar to those of the HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years,
  P = .29). We first identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a
  fourth patient with an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis.
  A custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome
  sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other neurodegenerative
  conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 3 index cases with
  imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified mutations in genes associated
  with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1),
  and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Huntington disease phenocopies without
  CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein,
  and should be considered in genetic counseling. We used next-generation sequencing
  combined with clinical data and disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies
  simultaneously. Our combined clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies
  identified the underlying cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies
  of HD phenocopies are heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into
  account when searching for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined
  is larger than expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features.
  Other neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot
  be verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated
  herein.'
