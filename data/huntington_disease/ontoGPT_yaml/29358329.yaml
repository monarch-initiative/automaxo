input_text: Profilin reduces aggregation and phase separation of huntingtin N-terminal
  fragments by preferentially binding to soluble monomers and oligomers. Huntingtin
  N-terminal fragments (Htt-NTFs) with expanded polyglutamine tracts form a range
  of neurotoxic aggregates that are associated with Huntington's disease. Here, we
  show that aggregation of Htt-NTFs, irrespective of polyglutamine length, yields
  at least three phases (designated M, S, and F) that are delineated by sharp concentration
  thresholds and distinct aggregate sizes and morphologies. We found that monomers
  and oligomers make up the soluble M phase, ~25-nm spheres dominate in the soluble
  S phase, and long, linear fibrils make up the insoluble F phase. Previous studies
  showed that profilin, an abundant cellular protein, reduces Htt-NTF aggregation
  and toxicity in cells. We confirm that profilin achieves its cellular effects through
  direct binding to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Htt-NTFs. We show that profilin
  preferentially binds to Htt-NTF M-phase species and destabilizes aggregation and
  phase separation by shifting the concentration boundaries for phase separation to
  higher values through a process known as polyphasic linkage. Our experiments, aided
  by coarse-grained computer simulations and theoretical analysis, suggest that preferential
  binding of profilin to the M-phase species of Htt-NTFs is enhanced through a combination
  of specific interactions between profilin and polyproline segments and auxiliary
  interactions between profilin and polyglutamine tracts. Polyphasic linkage may be
  a general strategy that cells utilize to regulate phase behavior of aggregation-prone
  proteins. Accordingly, detailed knowledge of phase behavior and an understanding
  of how ligands modulate phase boundaries may pave the way for developing new therapeutics
  against a variety of aggregation-prone proteins.
