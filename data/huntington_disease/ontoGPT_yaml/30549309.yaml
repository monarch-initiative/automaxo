input_text: DNA damage signatures in peripheral blood cells as biomarkers in prodromal
  huntington disease. Easily accessible biomarkers in Huntington disease (HD) are
  actively searched. We investigated telomere length and DNA double-strand breaks
  (histone variant pgamma-H2AX) as predictive disease biomarkers in peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 25 premanifest subjects, 58 HD patients with similar
  CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT), and 44 healthy controls (HC). PBMC from
  the pre-HD and HD groups showed shorter telomeres (p < 0.0001) and a significant
  increase of pgamma-H2AX compared to the controls (p < 0.0001). The levels of pgamma-H2AX
  correlated robustly with the presence of the mutated gene in pre-HD and HD. The
  availability of a potentially reversible biomarker (pgamma-H2AX) in the premanifest
  stage of HD, negligible in HC, provides a novel tool to monitor premanifest subjects
  and find patient-specific drugs. Ann Neurol 2018;00:1-6 ANN NEUROL 2019;85:296-301.
