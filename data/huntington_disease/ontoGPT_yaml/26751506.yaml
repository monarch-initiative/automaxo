input_text: "Association Between Change in Body Mass Index, Unified Parkinson's Disease
  Rating Scale Scores, and Survival Among Persons With Parkinson Disease: Secondary
  Analysis of Longitudinal Data From NINDS Exploratory Trials in Parkinson Disease
  Long-term Study 1. IMPORTANCE: Greater body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight
  in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is associated with improved survival
  among persons with Huntington disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Weight loss
  is common among persons with Parkinson disease (PD) and is associated with worse
  quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between change in BMI, Unified
  Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and total scores, and survival among
  persons with PD and to test whether there is a positive association between BMI
  at randomization and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analysis
  (from May 27, 2014, to October 13, 2015) of longitudinal data (3-6 years) from 1673
  participants who started the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
  Exploratory Trials in PD Long-term Study-1 (NET-PD LS-1). This was a double-blind
  randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of creatine monohydrate (10 g/d) that
  was performed at 45 sites throughout the United States and Canada. Participants
  with early (within 5 years of diagnosis) and treated (receiving dopaminergic therapy)
  PD were enrolled from March 2007 to May 2010 and followed up until September 2013.
  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change across time in motor UPDRS score, change across
  time in total UPDRS score, and time to death. Generalized linear mixed models were
  used to estimate the effect of BMI on the change in motor and total UPDRS scores
  after controlling for covariates. Survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards
  models of time to death. A participant's BMI was measured at randomization, and
  BMI trajectory groups were classified according to whether participants experienced
  weight loss (\"decreasing BMI\"), weight stability (\"stable BMI\"), or weight gain
  (\"increasing BMI\") during the study. RESULTS: Of the 1673 participants (mean [SD]
  age, 61.7 [9.6] years; 1074 [64.2%] were male), 158 (9.4%) experienced weight loss
  (decreasing BMI), whereas 233 (13.9%) experienced weight gain (increasing BMI).
  After adjusting for covariates, we found that the weight-loss group's mean (SE)
  motor UPDRS score increased by 1.48 (0.28) (P < .001) more points per visit than
  the weight-stable group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score. The weight-gain group's mean
  (SE) motor UPDRS score decreased by -0.51 (0.24) (P = .03) points per visit, relative
  to the weight-stable group. While there was an unadjusted difference in survival
  between the 3 BMI trajectory groups (log-rank P < .001), this was not significant
  after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Change in BMI was inversely
  associated with change in motor and total UPDRS scores in the NET-PD LS-1. Change
  in BMI was not associated with survival; however, these results were limited by
  the low number of deaths in the NET-PD LS-1. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov
