input_text: "Data quality assurance and control in cognitive research: Lessons learned
  from the PREDICT-HD study. We discuss the strategies employed in data quality control
  and quality assurance for the cognitive core of Neurobiological Predictors of Huntington's
  Disease (PREDICT-HD), a long-term observational study of over 1,000 participants
  with prodromal Huntington disease. In particular, we provide details regarding the
  training and continual evaluation of cognitive examiners, methods for error corrections,
  and strategies to minimize errors in the data. We present five important lessons
  learned to help other researchers avoid certain assumptions that could potentially
  lead to inaccuracies in their cognitive data."

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
