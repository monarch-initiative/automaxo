input_text: 'Differentiation of Reversible Hemichorea Due to Vitamin B12 Deficiency
  From Huntington Disease Via FDG PET.ABSTRACT: Vitamin B12 deficiency may present
  with diverse symptoms, complicating the differential diagnosis. Extrapyramidal movement
  disorders, for instance, are a rare manifestation of vitamin B12 deficiency. MRI
  of the brain frequently remains without conclusive findings. However, 18 F-FDG PET/CT
  may reveal characteristic changes in the metabolism of the basal ganglia and thus
  contribute to an accurate diagnosis. We demonstrate the case of a woman with left-sided
  hemichoreatic movements due to vitamin B12 deficiency showing a contralateral putaminal
  hypermetabolism, which normalized after vitamin B12 supplementation, ruling out
  other deviating causes, particularly Huntington disease.'
