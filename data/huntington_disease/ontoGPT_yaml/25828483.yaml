input_text: Periodic Epileptiform Discharges in Children With Advanced Stages of Progressive
  Myoclonic Epilepsy. Huntington's disease (HD) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy
  (DRPLA) are monogenic forms of neurodegenerative disorders with autosomal dominant
  inheritance. Compared with adult-onset HD and DRPLA, children with these disorders
  are more severely affected and are known to manifest the devastating symptoms of
  progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) syndrome. In this report, we present a 6-year-old
  girl with HD from a family, and 2 siblings with DRPLA from another unrelated family.
  Serial neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG) studies showed that periodic
  epileptiform discharges and synchronized paroxysmal activity became prominent with
  their disease progression. Periodic complexes in EEG may emerge at advanced stages
  of childhood PME as a consequence of rapidly degenerating processes of their brain
  functions.
