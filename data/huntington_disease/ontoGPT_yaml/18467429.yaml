input_text: "Physical therapy intervention for people with Huntington disease. BACKGROUND
  AND PURPOSE: The clinical symptoms of Huntington disease (HD) include progressive
  movement disorders, cognitive deficits, and behavioral changes, all of which affect
  an individual's ability to participate in activities of daily living. To date, very
  few quantitative or qualitative studies have been conducted to guide physical therapists
  working with people with HD. The objective of this study was to characterize current
  physical therapist practice for people with HD, thus informing the development of
  standardized clinical care and future research studies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consultation
  with physical therapists working with people with HD was undertaken in the form
  of mailed questionnaires (n=49) and semistructured interviews (n=8). The development
  of the interview schedule was aided by consideration of the data obtained from the
  questionnaires. Themes identified from the interviews were considered in light of
  published literature and questionnaire responses. RESULTS: The main issues that
  emerged from the interviews were classified into 3 subthemes: (1) there is insufficient
  use of routine physical therapy-related outcome measures at different stages of
  HD, (2) there is underutilization of physical therapy services in managing HD (particularly
  in the early stages), and (3) the management of falls and mobility deficit progression
  is a key treatment aim for people with HD. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A conceptual
  framework for physical therapy intervention in HD was developed on the basis of
  the themes that emerged from the data in this study. Such a framework has utility
  for complex, progressive conditions such as HD and may facilitate clinical decision
  making and standardization of practice and affect the development of future physical
  therapy trials."
