input_text: 'The Prospective Huntington At-Risk Observational Study (PHAROS): The
  Emotional Well-Being, Safety and Feasibility of Long-Term Research Participation.
  BACKGROUND: There is limited understanding of the feasibility of conducting long-term
  research among undiagnosed (pre-symptomatic) adults at risk to develop Huntington
  disease (HD), while protecting their emotional well-being and safety. OBJECTIVE:
  To assess pre-specified events pertaining to emotional well-being, safety, and feasibility
  among healthy consenting adults at risk for developing HD who have chosen not to
  undergo genetic testing. METHODS: PHAROS research participants prospectively reported
  the occurrence of events pertaining to psychological distress (psychiatric evaluations,
  depression, suicidality) and feasibility (maintaining confidentiality, study attrition).
  PHAROS enrolled 1001 participants. RESULTS: Events pertaining to psychological distress
  were reported by 35% of participants. The most common events included heightened
  suicide risk (26%), new onset depression (12%), and new mental health evaluation
  (9%); all occurred significantly more frequently among participants with expanded
  trinucleotide CAG repeats (>=37). Five deaths occurred, none related to suicide.
  Forty-one percent of participants reported self-disclosure of their HD at-risk status,
  and 15% reported that someone else (usually a family member) had done so. Confidentiality
  of CAG test results was maintained by investigators. The withdrawal rate was largely
  uniform over the study period and did not differ significantly by gender or CAG
  status. CONCLUSIONS: The potentially vulnerable research participants in PHAROS
  showed good emotional tolerability and safety. Individual CAG data were not disclosed,
  and confidentiality about disclosure of at-risk HD status was well maintained by
  others (family, friends, etc.). Long-term research participation of adults at risk
  for HD who choose not to undergo pre-symptomatic DNA testing is well tolerated,
  safe and feasible.'
