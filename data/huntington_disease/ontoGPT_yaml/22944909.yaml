input_text: 'Mouse models of polyglutamine diseases in therapeutic approaches: review
  and data table. Part II. Mouse models of human diseases are created both to understand
  the pathogenesis of the disorders and to find successful therapies for them. This
  work is the second part in a series of reviews of mouse models of polyglutamine
  (polyQ) hereditary disorders and focuses on in vivo experimental therapeutic approaches.
  Like part I of the polyQ mouse model review, this work is supplemented with a table
  that contains data from experimental studies of therapeutic approaches in polyQ
  mouse models. The aim of this review was to characterize the benefits and outcomes
  of various therapeutic strategies in mouse models. We examine whether the therapeutic
  strategies are specific to a single disease or are applicable to more than one polyQ
  disorder in mouse models. In addition, we discuss the suitability of mouse models
  in therapeutic approaches. Although the majority of therapeutic studies were performed
  in mouse models of Huntington disease, similar strategies were also used in other
  disease models.'
