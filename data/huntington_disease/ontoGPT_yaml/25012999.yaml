input_text: "Task-specific training in Huntington disease: a randomized controlled
  feasibility trial. BACKGROUND: Task-specific training may be a suitable intervention
  to address mobility limitations in people with Huntington disease (HD). OBJECTIVE:
  The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of goal-directed,
  task-specific mobility training for individuals with mid-stage HD. DESIGN: This
  study was a randomized, blinded, feasibility trial; participants were randomly assigned
  to control (usual care) and intervention groups. SETTING: This multisite study was
  conducted in 6 sites in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Thirty individuals with mid-stage
  HD (13 men, 17 women; mean age=57.0 years, SD=10.1) were enrolled and randomly assigned
  to study groups. INTERVENTION: Task-specific training was conducted by physical
  therapists in participants' homes, focusing on walking, sit-to-stand transfers,
  and standing, twice a week for 8 weeks. Goal attainment scaling was used to individualize
  the intervention and monitor achievement of personal goals. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence
  and adverse events were recorded. Adjusted between-group comparisons on standardized
  outcome measures were conducted at 8 and 16 weeks to determine effect sizes. RESULTS:
  Loss to follow-up was minimal (n=2); adherence in the intervention group was excellent
  (96.9%). Ninety-two percent of goals were achieved at the end of the intervention;
  46% of the participants achieved much better than expected outcomes. Effect sizes
  on all measures were small. LIMITATIONS: Measurements of walking endurance were
  lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of and excellent adherence to a home-based, task-specific
  training program, in which most participants exceeded goal expectations, are encouraging
  given the range of motivational, behavioral, and mobility issues in people with
  HD. The design of the intervention in terms of frequency (dose), intensity (aerobic
  versus anaerobic), and specificity (focused training on individual tasks) may not
  have been sufficient to elicit any systematic effects. Thus, a larger-scale trial
  of this specific intervention does not seem warranted."
