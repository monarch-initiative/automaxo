input_text: Reducing huntingtin by immunotherapy delays disease progression in a mouse
  model of Huntington disease.In Huntington disease (HD), the mutant huntingtin (mtHTT)
  protein is the principal cause of pathological changes that initiate primarily along
  the cortico-striatal axis. mtHTT is ubiquitously expressed and there is, accordingly,
  growing recognition that HD is a systemic disorder with functional interplay between
  the brain and the periphery. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, C6-17, targeting
  an exposed region of HTT near the aa586 Caspase 6 cleavage site. As recently published,
  mAB C6-17 can block cell-to-cell propagation of mtHTT in vitro. In order to reduce
  the burden of the mutant protein in vivo, we queried whether extracellular mtHTT
  could be therapeutically targeted in YAC128 HD mice. In a series of proof of concept
  experiments, we found that systemic mAB C6-17 treatment resulted in the distribution
  of the mAB C6-17 to peripheral and CNS tissues and led to the reduction of HTT protein
  levels. Compared to CTRL mAB or vehicle treated mice, the mAB C6-17 treated YAC128
  animals showed improved body weight and motor behaviors, a delayed progression in
  motor deficits and reduced striatal EM48 immunoreactivity. These results provide
  the first proof of concept for the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of an antibody-based
  anti-HTT passive immunization approach and suggest this modality as a potential
  new HD treatment strategy.
