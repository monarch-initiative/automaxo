input_text: 'Reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication in neurogenetic
  diseases with different self-estimated severities.BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic
  testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic
  diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and
  whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised
  that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and
  that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives
  about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to
  evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and
  to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication.
  We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease.
  RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington
  disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82)
  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated
  severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered
  prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1
  out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100).
  They were less in favour of gamete donation (48.3+-39.8 out of 100) or pregnancy
  abstention (43.3+-40.3 out of 100). The greater the perceived severity of the disease,
  the more reproductive options were considered justified, except for gamete donation.
  Prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis was a motivation to inform relatives for only
  55.3% of participants (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Self-estimated severity minimally impacts
  opinions towards reproductive options. Medically assisted reproduction procedures
  are rarely sought and do not motivate familial communication.'
