input_text: Analysis of Trinucleotide Repeat Stability by Integration at a Chromosomal
  Ectopic Site. Expansions of CNG microsatellite tracts are responsible for several
  neurodegenerative diseases, including myotonic dystrophy type 1, Huntington disease,
  and spinocerebellar ataxia type 8. Here we show that expanded (CNG)n repeats are
  susceptible not only to expansions and contractions, but are prone to DNA double
  strand breaks following replication stress. We describe a general strategy for the
  construction of clonal cell lines containing CNG repeats of various lengths, in
  which the microsatellites are integrated using the yeast FLP recombinase at a single
  ectopic recombination acceptor site in the HeLa genome. We illustrate two types
  of (CTG/CAG) cell lines, one of which contains dual fluorescent marker genes flanking
  the (CTG/CAG) repeat, and one which does not. We show that long CNG repeats are
  prone to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) upon exposure of these cell lines to prolonged
  replication stress.
