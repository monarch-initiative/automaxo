input_text: Emerging Novel Approaches for the Enhanced Delivery of Natural Products
  for the Management of Neurodegenerative Diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs)
  such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis, and prion disease affect any part of the brain. The complete
  mechanism of ND is unknown, but there are some molecular mechanism and chemical
  process. Natural compounds have better compatibility with the human body along with
  lesser side effects. Moreover, several studies showed that various natural compounds
  have significant neuroprotective, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties,
  which are effective for treating the different type of ND. In ND, natural compounds
  act by various mechanisms such as preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), eliminating destructed biomolecules before their accumulation affects cell
  metabolism, and improving the disease conditions. But due to the presence of the
  blood-brain barrier (BBB) layer and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of natural
  compounds, their delivery into the brain is limited. To minimize this problem and
  enhance drug delivery into the brain with an effective therapeutic dose, there is
  a need to develop a practical novel approach. The various studies showed that nanoformulations
  and microneedles (MN) containing natural compounds such as quercetin, curcumin,
  resveratrol, chrysin, piperine, ferulic acid, huperzine A, berberine, baicalein,
  hesperetin, and retinoic acid effectively improved many ND. In this review, the
  effect of such natural drug-loaded nanoformulation and MN patches on ND management
  is discussed, along with their merits and demerits. This review aims to introduce
  different novel approaches for enhancing natural drug delivery into the brain to
  manage various neurodegenerative diseases.
