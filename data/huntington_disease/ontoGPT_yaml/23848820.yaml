input_text: 'Posttrauma cotreatment with lithium and valproate: reduction of lesion
  volume, attenuation of blood-brain barrier disruption, and improvement in motor
  coordination in mice with traumatic brain injury. OBJECT: Although traumatic brain
  injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and morbidity in young adults, no effective
  pharmaceutical treatment is available. By inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3
  (GSK-3) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively, lithium and valproate (VPA)
  have beneficial effects in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in an
  excitotoxic neuronal model and in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
  Huntington disease, and stroke, combined treatment with lithium and VPA produces
  more robust neuroprotective effects than treatment with either agent alone. Building
  on previous work that establishes that therapeutic doses of either lithium or VPA
  have beneficial effects in mouse models of TBI, this study evaluated the effects
  of combined treatment with subeffective doses of lithium and VPA in a mouse model
  of TBI. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent TBI and were subsequently treated with
  lithium, VPA, or a combination of lithium and VPA 15 minutes post-TBI and once daily
  thereafter for up to 3 weeks; all doses were subeffective (1 mEq/kg of lithium and
  200 mg/kg of VPA). Assessed parameters included lesion volume via H & E staining;
  blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity via immunoglobulin G extravasation; neurodegeneration
  via Fluoro-Jade B staining; motor coordination via a beam-walk test; and protein
  levels of acetylhistone H3, phospho-GSK-3beta, and beta-catenin via Western blotting.
  RESULTS: Posttrauma treatment with combined subeffective doses of lithium and VPA
  significantly reduced lesion volume, attenuated BBB disruption, and mitigated hippocampal
  neurodegeneration 3 days after TBI. As expected, subeffective doses of lithium or
  VPA alone did not have these beneficial effects. Combined treatment also improved
  motor coordination starting from Day 7 and persisting at least 21 days after TBI.
  Acetylation of histone H3, an index of HDAC inhibition, was robustly increased by
  the combined treatment 3 days after TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Cotreatment with subeffective
  doses of lithium and VPA significantly attenuated TBI-induced brain lesion, BBB
  disruption, and neurodegeneration, and robustly improved long-term functional recovery.
  These findings suggest that potentiating histone acetylation by HDAC inhibition
  is probably part of the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects associated with
  this combined treatment for TBI. Because both lithium and VPA have a long history
  of safe clinical use, the results suggest that using a combination of these 2 agents
  at subtherapeutic doses to treat patients with TBI may also reduce side effects
  and enhance tolerability.'
