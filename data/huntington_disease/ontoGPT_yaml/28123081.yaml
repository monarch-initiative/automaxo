input_text: Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Protect Against Pyruvate Dehydrogenase
  Dysfunction in Huntington's Disease. Transcriptional deregulation and changes in
  mitochondrial bioenergetics, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) dysfunction,
  have been described in Huntington's disease (HD). We showed previously that the
  histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) trichostatin A and sodium butyrate (SB)
  ameliorate mitochondrial function in cells expressing mutant huntingtin. In this
  work, we investigated the effect of HDACIs on the regulation of PDH activity in
  striatal cells derived from HD knock-in mice and YAC128 mice. Mutant cells exhibited
  decreased PDH activity and increased PDH E1alpha phosphorylation/inactivation, accompanied
  by enhanced protein levels of PDH kinases 1 and 3 (PDK1 and PDK3). Exposure to dichloroacetate,
  an inhibitor of PDKs, increased mitochondrial respiration and decreased production
  of reactive oxygen species in mutant cells, emphasizing PDH as an interesting therapeutic
  target in HD. Treatment with SB and sodium phenylbutyrate, another HDACI, recovered
  cell viability and overall mitochondrial metabolism in mutant cells. Exposure to
  SB also suppressed hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1alpha) stabilization and decreased
  the transcription of the two most abundant PDK isoforms, PDK2 and PDK3, culminating
  in increased PDH activation in mutant cells. Concordantly, PDK3 knockdown improved
  mitochondrial function, emphasizing the role of PDK3 inactivation on the positive
  effects achieved by SB treatment. YAC128 mouse brain presented higher mRNA levels
  of PDK1-3 and PDH phosphorylation and decreased energy levels that were significantly
  ameliorated after SB treatment. Furthermore, enhanced motor learning and coordination
  were observed in SB-treated YAC128 mice. These results suggest that HDACIs, particularly
  SB, promote the activity of PDH in the HD brain, helping to counteract HD-related
  deficits in mitochondrial bioenergetics and motor function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
  The present work provides a better understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in
  Huntington's disease (HD) by showing that the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex
  is a promising therapeutic target. In particular, the histone deacetylase inhibitor
  sodium butyrate (SB) may indirectly (through reduced hypoxia-inducible factor 1
  alpha stabilization) decrease the expression of the most abundant PDH kinase isoforms
  (e.g., PDK3), ameliorating PDH activity and mitochondrial metabolism and further
  affecting motor behavior in HD mice, thus constituting a promising agent for HD
  neuroprotective treatment.
