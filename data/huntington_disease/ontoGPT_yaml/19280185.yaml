input_text: 'Riluzole protects Huntington disease patients from brain glucose hypometabolism
  and grey matter volume loss and increases production of neurotrophins. PURPOSE:
  Huntington disease (HD) mutation increases gain-of-toxic functions contributing
  to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Riluzole interferes with glutamatergic neurotransmission,
  thereby reducing excitotoxicity, enhancing neurite formation in damaged motoneurons
  and increasing serum concentrations of BDNF, a brain cortex neurotrophin protecting
  striatal neurons from degeneration. METHODS: We investigated metabolic and volumetric
  differences in distinct brain areas between 11 riluzole-treated and 12 placebo-treated
  patients by MRI and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET scanning, according
  to fully automated protocols. We also investigated the influence of riluzole on
  peripheral growth factor blood levels. RESULTS: Placebo-treated patients showed
  significantly greater proportional volume loss of grey matter and decrease in metabolic
  FDG uptake than patients treated with riluzole in all cortical areas (p<0.05). The
  decreased rate of metabolic FDG uptake correlated with worsening clinical scores
  in placebo-treated patients, compared to those who were treated with riluzole. The
  progressive decrease in metabolic FDG uptake observed in the frontal, parietal and
  occipital cortex correlated linearly with the severity of motor scores calculated
  by Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-I) in placebo-treated patients.
  Similarly, the rate of metabolic changes in the frontal and temporal areas of the
  brain cortex correlated linearly with worsening behavioural scores calculated by
  UHDRS-III in the placebo-treated patients. Finally, BDNF and transforming growth
  factor beta-1 serum levels were significantly higher in patients treated with riluzole.
  CONCLUSION: The linear correlation between decreased metabolic FDG uptake and worsening
  clinical scores in the placebo-treated patients suggests that FDG-PET may be a valuable
  procedure to assess brain markers of HD.'
