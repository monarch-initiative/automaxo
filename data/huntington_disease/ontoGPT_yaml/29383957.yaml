input_text: 'Physician perceptions of pharmacologic treatment options for chorea associated
  with Huntington disease in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To survey neurologists
  and obtain clinical perceptions of tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in
  patients with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists,
  in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years,
  were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional,
  web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice,
  approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS:
  Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses,
  the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living
  (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment
  for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to
  ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine
  as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians
  consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree
  that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects
  or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions
  (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients "often" or "almost always". The
  most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration
  were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS:
  Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with
  tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical
  practice.'
