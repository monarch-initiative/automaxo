input_text: Cryo-electron tomography provides topological insights into mutant huntingtin
  exon 1 and polyQ aggregates.Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative trinucleotide
  repeat disorder caused by an expanded poly-glutamine (polyQ) tract in the mutant
  huntingtin (mHTT) protein. The formation and topology of filamentous mHTT inclusions
  in the brain (hallmarks of HD implicated in neurotoxicity) remain elusive. Using
  cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, here we show that mHTT exon
  1 and polyQ-only aggregates in vitro are structurally heterogenous and filamentous,
  similar to prior observations with other methods. Yet, we find filaments in both
  types of aggregates under ~2 nm in width, thinner than previously reported, and
  regions forming large sheets. In addition, our data show a prevalent subpopulation
  of filaments exhibiting a lumpy slab morphology in both aggregates, supportive of
  the polyQ core model. This provides a basis for future cryoET studies of various
  aggregated mHTT and polyQ constructs to improve their structure-based modeling as
  well as their identification in cells without fusion tags.
