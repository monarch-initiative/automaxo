input_text: "Widespread heterogeneous neuronal loss across the cerebral cortex in
  Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative
  disease characterized by neuronal degeneration in the basal ganglia and cerebral
  cortex, and a variable symptom profile. Although progressive striatal degeneration
  is known to occur and is related to symptom profile, little is known about the cellular
  basis of symptom heterogeneity across the entire cerebral cortex. To investigate
  this, we have undertaken a double blind study using unbiased stereological cell
  counting techniques to determine the pattern of cell loss in six representative
  cortical regions from the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes in the
  brains of 14 Huntington's disease cases and 15 controls. The results clearly demonstrate
  a widespread loss of total neurons and pyramidal cells across all cortical regions
  studied, except for the primary visual cortex. Importantly, the results show that
  cell loss is remarkably variable both within and between Huntington's disease cases.
  The results also show that neuronal loss in the primary sensory and secondary visual
  cortices relate to Huntington's disease motor symptom profiles, and neuronal loss
  across the associational cortices in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes is
  related to both Huntington's disease motor and to mood symptom profiles. This finding
  considerably extends a previous study (Thu et al., Brain, 2010; 133:1094-1110) which
  showed that neuronal loss in the primary motor cortex was related specifically to
  the motor symptom profiles while neuronal loss in the anterior cingulate cortex
  was related specifically to mood symptom profiles. The extent of cortical cell loss
  in the current study was generally related to the striatal neuropathological grade,
  but not to CAG repeat length on the HTT gene. Overall our findings show that Huntington's
  disease is characterized by a heterogeneous pattern of neuronal cell loss across
  the entire cerebrum which varies with symptom profile. "
