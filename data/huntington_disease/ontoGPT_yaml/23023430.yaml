input_text: 'Poor insight into memory impairment in patients with Huntington disease.
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients suffering from Huntington disease (HD) have been
  shown to present with poor self-awareness of a variety of symptoms. The study aimed
  to assess the self-awareness of memory impairment in HD in comparison to advanced
  Parkinson disease (PD), mild PD and cervical dystonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-awareness
  was tested in 23 patients with HD by comparing patient and caregiver ratings in
  reference to clinical control groups (25 patients with advanced PD, 21 with mild
  PD and 20 with cervical dystonia). Self-awareness was tested using the Self Rating
  Scale of Memory Functions, which was administered to both the patients and the caregivers.
  Neuropsychological assessment addressed general cognitive status (Mini-Mental State
  Examination), verbal learning (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 15-word list) and
  mood (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). RESULTS: Patients with HD significantly
  underestimated their memory dysfunction. Underestimation of memory deficit correlated
  with disease duration and disease severity in HD. CONCLUSIONS: Huntington disease
  patients underestimate memory dysfunction. These results add to the previous reports
  on poor insight in HD in other domains and suggest that anosognosia in HD, albeit
  usually rather mild, may be a generalized phenomenon.'
