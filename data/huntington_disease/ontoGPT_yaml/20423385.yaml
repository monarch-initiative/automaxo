input_text: "Huntington disease: families' experiences of healthcare services. AIM:
  This paper is a report of a study of the perceptions of family caregivers regarding
  the availability and adequacy of health and social care services for their family
  member with Huntington disease, and to compare findings from these reports in United
  Kingdom and United States of America samples. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is
  an inherited neurodegenerative condition. Family members often take responsibility
  for care of relatives with long-term conditions. Studies have demonstrated there
  are both positive and negative outcomes for carers. METHODS: During 2006 and 2007,
  respondents from the United Kingdom (n = 108) and the United States (n = 119) who
  were caring for a relative affected with Huntington disease completed the Community
  Health Care Services Scale to identify areas of concern and the extent to which
  specific issues bothered carers. Data were analysed using statistical tests including
  chi-square, t-tests and factor analysis. Results were compared between carers in
  the two cohorts. RESULTS: Three main factors were derived: 'community resources',
  'individualized care' and 'knowledge of Huntington disease'. Carers had concerns
  about the knowledge of healthcare professionals providing care and thought that
  there were insufficient services to support them and the affected person. There
  were different challenges for carers when the affected person had a long-term neurodegenerative
  condition because these carers were also likely to have responsibilities for earning
  and caring for children. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive facilities and resources are
  needed to support families affected by long-term complex conditions. Healthcare
  professionals need to be aware of the health needs of carers as well as those of
  the affected person."
