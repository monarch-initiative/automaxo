input_text: 'Neural transplantation in Huntington disease: long-term grafts in two
  patients. OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials of fetal neural tissue transplantation for
  Huntington disease (HD) have been conducted with variable clinical results. However,
  no long-term analysis of graft survival and integration has been published. Here,
  we report the pathologic findings in two patients with HD who died 74 and 79 months
  after transplantation. METHODS: Methods used were pathologic examination, histochemistry,
  and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Neostriatum from both patients showed typical
  neuropathologic changes of advanced HD. Surviving grafts were identified in both
  patients (6/6 sites and 7/8 sites, respectively) as well-demarcated nests within
  host neostriatum with associated needle tracts. Grafted neurons adopted either dominant
  calbindin/parvalbumin or calretinin immunoreactivity (IR). Few neurofilament, MAP-2,
  DARPP-32, tyrosine hydroxylase, or calbindin IR processes traversed the host parenchyma-graft
  interface despite minimal junctional gliosis. Immunohistochemistry for CD68 showed
  microgliosis that was more pronounced in host striatum than graft. Scattered CD45
  and CD3 IR cells were present within grafts and host parenchyma. No ubiquitin IR
  neuronal intranuclear inclusions were identified in graft neurons, although these
  were prevalent in host cells. CONCLUSIONS: These two autopsies confirm previous
  findings of neuronal differentiation and survival of transplanted fetal tissue from
  the ganglionic eminence and also demonstrate viability of neurons from fetal transplants
  in human neostriatum for more than 6 years. Despite prolonged survival, these grafts
  had poor integration with host striatum that is likely responsible for lack of clear
  clinical improvement in these patients.'
