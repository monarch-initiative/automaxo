input_text: "Development, characterization and nasal delivery of rosmarinic acid-loaded
  solid lipid nanoparticles for the effective management of Huntington's disease.
  OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential use
  of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as a drug delivery system to enhance the brain-targeting
  efficiency of rosmarinic acid (RA) following intranasal (i.n.) administration. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: The RA-loaded SLNs was prepared by the hot homogenization technique,
  in which glycerol monostearate (GMS) as lipid, tween 80 and soya lecithin were used
  as surfactant along with hydrogenated soya phosphatidyl choline (HSPC) as a stabilizer,
  and were characterized for particle size, zeta potential (ZP), in vitro study. Nasal
  delivery of the developed formulation followed by the study of behavioral (locomotor,
  narrow beam, body weight) and biochemical parameters (glutathione, lipid peroxidation,
  catalase and nitrite) in wistar rat was carried out. RESULTS: Optimized RA-loaded
  SLNs using tween 80 (SLNPRT) have the mean size of (149.2 +- 3.2 nm), ZP (-38.27
  mV) entrapment efficiency (61.9 +- 2.2%). 3-NP-treated rat significantly increased
  behavioral alterations, oxidative damage as compared with the control group. SLNPRT
  treatment significantly improved behavioral abnormalities and attenuated the oxidative
  stress in 3NP-treated rats. However, the nasal delivery of SLNPRT produced significant
  therapeutic action as compared to intravenous application. In the organ distribution
  study, brain drug concentration was found to be 5.69 microg, in pharmacokinetic
  study Cmax, tmax, t1/2, AUC values were found to be 0.284 microg/ml, 1.5 h, 3.17
  h, and 1.505 microg/ml/h, respectively. CONCLUSION: The encouraging results confirmed
  the developed optimized RA-loaded SLNs formulation following the non-invasive nose-to-brain
  drug delivery that is a promising therapeutic approach for the effective management
  in Huntington disease."
