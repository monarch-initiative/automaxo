input_text: 'Anti-semaphorin 4D immunotherapy ameliorates neuropathology and some
  cognitive impairment in the YAC128 mouse model of Huntington disease. Huntington
  disease (HD) is an inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disease with no disease-modifying
  therapy currently available. In addition to characteristic motor deficits and atrophy
  of the caudate nucleus, signature hallmarks of HD include behavioral abnormalities,
  immune activation, and cortical and white matter loss. The identification and validation
  of novel therapeutic targets that contribute to these degenerative cellular processes
  may lead to new interventions that slow or even halt the course of this insidious
  disease. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) is a transmembrane signaling molecule that modulates
  a variety of processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including
  glial cell activation, neuronal growth cone collapse and apoptosis of neural precursors,
  as well as inhibition of oligodendrocyte migration, differentiation and process
  formation. Therefore, inhibition of SEMA4D signaling could reduce CNS inflammation,
  increase neuronal outgrowth and enhance oligodendrocyte maturation, which may be
  of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases, including
  HD. To that end, we evaluated the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D
  monoclonal antibody, which prevents the interaction between SEMA4D and its receptors,
  in the YAC128 transgenic HD mouse model. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorated neuropathological
  signatures, including striatal atrophy, cortical atrophy, and corpus callosum atrophy
  and prevented testicular degeneration in YAC128 mice. In parallel, a subset of behavioral
  symptoms was improved in anti-SEMA4D treated YAC128 mice, including reduced anxiety-like
  behavior and rescue of cognitive deficits. There was, however, no discernible effect
  on motor deficits. The preservation of brain gray and white matter and improvement
  in behavioral measures in YAC128 mice treated with anti-SEMA4D suggest that this
  approach could represent a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HD.
  Importantly, this work provides in vivo demonstration that inhibition of pathways
  initiated by SEMA4D constitutes a novel approach to moderation of neurodegeneration. '
