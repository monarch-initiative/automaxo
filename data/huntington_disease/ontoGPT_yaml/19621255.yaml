input_text: 'Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase deficiency and
  Huntington Disease using three different molecular approaches simultaneously. PURPOSE:
  Description of the confluence of different molecular techniques to detect three
  different mutations in one cell. The man carries a 20 base pair insertion in exon
  12 of the POR gene (c.1551_1552ins20), and the woman carries a point mutation in
  exon 8 of the POR gene (c.859G>C) plus a triplet repeat expansion in the HTT gene.
  METHODS: Huntington Disease (HD) had to be diagnosed using short tandem repeat (STR)
  markers linked to the HTT gene. The mutation c.1551_1552ins20 was analyzed by fragment
  size and c.859G>C was minisequenced. Furthermore, STR markers linked to the POR
  gene were included to support the diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase (POR) deficiency.
  RESULTS: Nine embryos were diagnosed in total: three as POR deficiency affected,
  two as HD affected, one as POR deficiency and HD affected, and two as carriers of
  the paternal POR deficiency mutation and healthy for HD. These two last embryos
  were transferred but no pregnancy was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: A successful procedure
  combining direct and indirect methods for the detection of three different mutations
  in a single cell has been achieved for the first time.'
