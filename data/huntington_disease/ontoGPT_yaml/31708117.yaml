input_text: A Comprehensive Haplotype-Targeting Strategy for Allele-Specific HTT Suppression
  in Huntington Disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder
  caused by a gain-of-function mutation in HTT. Suppression of mutant HTT has emerged
  as a leading therapeutic strategy for HD, with allele-selective approaches targeting
  HTT SNPs now in clinical trials. Haplotypes associated with the HD mutation (A1,
  A2, A3a) represent panels of allele-specific gene silencing targets for efficient
  treatment of individuals with HD of Northern European and indigenous South American
  ancestry. Here we extend comprehensive haplotype analysis of the HD mutation to
  key populations of Southern European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and admixed African
  ancestry. In each of these populations, the HD mutation occurs predominantly on
  the A2 HTT haplotype. Analysis of HD haplotypes across all affected population groups
  enables rational selection of candidate target SNPs for development of allele-selective
  gene silencing therapeutics worldwide. Targeting SNPs on the A1 and A2 haplotypes
  in parallel is essential to achieve treatment of the most HD-affected subjects in
  populations where HD is most prevalent. Current allele-specific approaches will
  leave a majority of individuals with HD untreated in populations where the HD mutation
  occurs most frequently on the A2 haplotype. We further demonstrate preclinical development
  of potent and selective ASOs targeting SNPs on the A2 HTT haplotype, representing
  an allele-specific treatment strategy for these individuals. On the basis of comprehensive
  haplotype analysis, we show the maximum proportion of HD-affected subjects that
  may be treated with three or four allele targets in different populations worldwide,
  informing current allele-specific HTT silencing strategies.
