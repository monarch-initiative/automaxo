input_text: SGTA associates with intracellular aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases.Intracellular
  aggregates are a common pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such
  as polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's
  disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Aggregates are mainly formed by
  aberrant disease-specific proteins and are accompanied by accumulation of other
  aggregate-interacting proteins. Although aggregate-interacting proteins have been
  considered to modulate the formation of aggregates and to be involved in molecular
  mechanisms of disease progression, the components of aggregate-interacting proteins
  remain unknown. In this study, we showed that small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide
  repeat-containing protein alfa (SGTA) is an aggregate-interacting protein in neurodegenerative
  diseases. Immunohistochemistry showed that SGTA interacted with intracellular aggregates
  in Huntington disease (HD) cell models and neurons of HD model mice. We also revealed
  that SGTA colocalized with intracellular aggregates in postmortem brains of patients
  with polyQ diseases including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian
  atrophy. In addition, SGTA colocalized with glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the
  brains of MSA patients, whereas no accumulation of SGTA was observed in neurons
  of PD and ALS patients. In vitro study showed that SGTA bound to polyQ aggregates
  through its C-terminal domain and SGTA overexpression reduced intracellular aggregates.
  These results suggest that SGTA may play a role in the formation of aggregates and
  may act as potential modifier of molecular pathological mechanisms of polyQ diseases
  and MSA.
