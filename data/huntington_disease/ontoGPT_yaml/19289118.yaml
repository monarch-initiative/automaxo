input_text: A majority of Huntington's disease patients may be treatable by individualized
  allele-specific RNA interference. Use of RNA interference to reduce huntingtin protein
  (htt) expression in affected brain regions may provide an effective treatment for
  Huntington disease (HD), but it remains uncertain whether suppression of both wild-type
  and mutant alleles in a heterozygous patient will provide more benefit than harm.
  Previous research has shown suppression of just the mutant allele is achievable
  using siRNA targeted to regions of HD mRNA containing single nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs). To determine whether more than a minority of patients may be eligible for
  an allele-specific therapy, we genotyped DNA from 327 unrelated European Caucasian
  HD patients at 26 SNP sites in the HD gene. Over 86% of the patients were found
  to be heterozygous for at least one SNP among those tested. Because the sites are
  genetically linked, one cannot use the heterozygosity rates of the individual SNPs
  to predict how many sites (and corresponding allele-specific siRNA) would be needed
  to provide at least one treatment possibility for this percentage of patients. By
  computing all combinations, we found that a repertoire of allele-specific siRNA
  corresponding to seven sites can provide at least one allele-specific siRNA treatment
  option for 85.6% of our sample. Moreover, we provide evidence that allele-specific
  siRNA targeting these sites are readily identifiable using a high throughput screening
  method, and that allele-specific siRNA identified using this method indeed show
  selective suppression of endogenous mutant htt protein in fibroblast cells from
  HD patients. Therefore, allele-specific siRNA are not so rare as to be impractical
  to find and use therapeutically.
