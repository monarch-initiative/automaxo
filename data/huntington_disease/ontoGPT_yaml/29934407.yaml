input_text: 'Behavioral Symptoms in Premanifest Huntington Disease Correlate with
  Reduced Frontal CB1R Levels. Many Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers already
  have cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in the premanifest (premotor) phase of the
  disease (pre-HD), but the molecular underpinnings of these symptoms are not well
  understood. Previous work has shown reduced availability of the cerebral type 1
  cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) in manifest HD. Here, we investigated whether CB1R binding
  is related to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in pre-HD mutation carriers. Methods:
  CB1R binding was measured with 18F-MK-9470 (N-[(2S,3S)-3-(3-cyanophenyl)-4-(4-ethoxyphenyl)butan-2-yl]-2-methyl-2-(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)oxypropanamide)
  PET in 15 pre-HD subjects (8 men, 7 women; age, 39.3 +- 9.9 y), 15 gene-negative
  controls from HD families (9 men, 6 women; age, 37.0 +- 10.6 y), and 12 community
  controls (6 men and 6 women; age, 39.9 +- 15.1 y). All subjects also underwent extensive
  assessment of motor and cognitive function, as well as a behavioral test battery
  including the Problem Behavior Assessment for HD (PBA-HD), and MRI. Parametric binding
  images of 18F-MK-9470 were corrected for partial-volume effect. Results: There was
  no difference in CB1R binding, gray matter volume, cognitive function, or psychiatric
  scores between gene-negative controls from HD families and community controls, which
  were therefore pooled to one control group. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects
  showed striatal atrophy, a decrease in CB1R binding in the prefrontal cortex, and
  higher PBA-HD scores on depression, apathy, and irritability (range, P = 0.01-0.005).
  The PBA-HD scores inversely correlated with CB1R binding in prefrontal regions and
  cingulate cortex in pre-HD (range: r = -0.64 to -0.72; P = 0.01-0.008). Conclusion:
  The association between behavioral symptoms and reduced prefrontal CB1R levels may
  provide new insight into the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pre-HD
  and suggest new therapeutic avenues.'
