input_text: AAV-mediated gene delivery of BDNF or GDNF is neuroprotective in a model
  of Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that
  results in the progressive loss of GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons in
  the striatum. Neurotrophic factors have demonstrated neuroprotective actions on
  striatal neurons, suggesting that increased neurotrophic factor expression may prevent
  or reduce neuronal loss in the HD brain. We investigated whether enhanced expression
  of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
  factor (GDNF), achieved by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery,
  could protect striatal neurons in the quinolinic acid (QA) rodent model of HD. Adult
  Wistar rats received unilateral intrastriatal injections of AAV-BDNF, AAV-GDNF,
  AAV-GFP, or PBS. Three weeks later, the rats were lesioned with QA, a toxin that
  induces striatal neuron death by an excitotoxic process. Both AAV-BDNF and AAV-GDNF
  significantly reduced the loss of both NeuN- and calbindin-immunopositive striatal
  neurons 2 weeks after lesion compared to controls. AAV-BDNF also provided significant
  neurotrophic support to NOS-immunopositive striatal interneurons, while AAV-GDNF-treated
  rats demonstrated significant protection of parvalbumin-immunopositive striatal
  interneurons compared to controls. These results indicate that AAV-mediated gene
  transfer of BDNF or GDNF into the striatum provides neuronal protection in a rodent
  model of HD.
