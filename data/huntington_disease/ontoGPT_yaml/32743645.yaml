input_text: 'Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Diffusion Tensor Imaging
  in Sheep (Ovis aries) With Quinolinic Acid Lesions of the Striatum: Time-Dependent
  Recovery of N-Acetylaspartate and Fractional Anisotropy.We created an excitotoxic
  striatal lesion model of Huntington disease (HD) in sheep, using the N-methyl-d-aspartate
  receptor agonist, quinolinic acid (QA). Sixteen sheep received a bolus infusion
  of QA (75 microL, 180 mM) or saline, first into the left and then (4 weeks later)
  into the right striatum. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor
  imaging (DTI) of the striata were performed. Metabolite concentrations and fractional
  anisotropy (FA) were measured at baseline, acutely (1 week after each surgery) and
  chronically (5 weeks or greater after the surgeries). There was a significant decrease
  in the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and in FA in acutely lesioned striata
  of the QA-lesioned sheep, followed by a recovery of NAA and FA in the chronically
  lesioned striata. NAA level changes indicate acute death and/or impairment of neurons
  immediately after surgery, with recovery of reversibly impaired neurons over time.
  The change in FA values of the QA-lesioned striata is consistent with acute structural
  disruption, followed by re-organization and glial cell infiltration with time. Our
  study demonstrates that MRS and DTI changes in QA-sheep are consistent with HD-like
  pathology shown in other model species and that the MR investigations can be performed
  in sheep using a clinically relevant human 3T MRI scanner.'
