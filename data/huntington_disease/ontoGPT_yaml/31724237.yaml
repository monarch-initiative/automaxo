input_text: "HDQLIFE and neuro-QoL physical function measures: Responsiveness in persons
  with huntington's disease. BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological
  disorder that causes severe motor symptoms that adversely impact health-related
  quality of life. Patient-reported physical function outcome measures in HD have
  shown cross-sectional evidence of validity, but responsiveness has not yet been
  assessed. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the responsiveness of the Huntington
  Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (HDQLIFE) and the Quality of Life in Neurological
  Disorders (Neuro-QoL) physical function measures in persons with HD. METHODS: A
  total of 347 participants completed baseline and at least 1 follow-up (12-month
  and 24-month) measure (HDQLIFE Chorea, HDQLIFE Swallowing Difficulties, HDQLIFE
  Speech Difficulties, Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function, and/or Neuro-QoL Lower
  Extremity Function). Of the participants that completed the baseline assessment,
  338 (90.9%) completed the 12-month assessment, and 293 (78.8%) completed the 24-month
  assessment. Standardized response means and general linear models evaluated whether
  the physical function measures were responsive to self-reported and clinician-rated
  change over time. RESULTS: Small to moderate effect sizes for the standardized response
  means supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness of the HDQLIFE and Neuro-QoL
  measures for those with either self-reported or clinician-rated declines in function.
  General linear models supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness for all HRQOL
  measures relative to self-reported declines in health, but generally only 24-month
  responsiveness was supported relative to clinician-rated declines in function. CONCLUSIONS:
  Longitudinal analyses indicate that the HDQLIFE and the Neuro-QoL physical function
  measures are sensitive to change over time in individuals with HD. Thus, these scales
  exhibit evidence of responsiveness and may be useful outcome measures in future
  clinical trials.   2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."
