input_text: "Stem cells in animal models of Huntington disease: A systematic review.
  Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder encoding
  a mutant form of the huntingtin protein (HTT). HD is pathologically characterized
  by loss of neurons in the striatum and cortex, which leads to progressive motor
  dysfunction, cognitive decline and behavioral symptoms. Stem cell-based therapy
  has emerged as a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative
  diseases and may be effective in alleviating and/or halting the pathophysiological
  mechanisms underlying HD. Several pre-clinical studies have used stem cells in animal
  models of HD. Here, we performed a systematic review of preclinical studies to estimate
  the treatment efficacy of stem cells in animal models of HD. Based on our systematic
  review, treatment with stem cells significantly improves neurological and behavioral
  outcomes in animal models of HD. Although promising results were found, the design
  of animal studies, the types of transplanted cells and the route of administration
  are poorly standardized and this greatly complicates comparative analysis."
