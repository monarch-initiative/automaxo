input_text: 'The therapeutic potential of intrabodies in neurologic disorders: focus
  on Huntington and Parkinson diseases. Single-chain Fv and single-domain antibodies
  retain the binding specificity of full-length antibodies but they can be cloned,
  selected, engineered, and manipulated as genes. When expressed intracellularly in
  mammalian cells these intracellular antibodies, or intrabodies, have the potential
  to alter the folding, interactions, modifications, or subcellular localization of
  their targets. These reagents have previously been developed as therapeutics against
  cancer and HIV. Since misfolded and accumulated intracellular proteins characterize
  several major neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease (HD) and
  Parkinson disease, these disorders are prime candidates for intrabody therapy. In
  this article we review the extension of intrabody technology to the nervous system.
  Studies of HD have been used to develop the approach and anti-synuclein strategies
  are in the early stages of development. Such neurodegenerative diseases are therefore
  poised for engineered antibody approaches, which can provide a pipeline of novel
  therapeutics and new drug discovery tools.'
