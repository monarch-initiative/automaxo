input_text: FACS-array-based cell purification yields a specific transcriptome of
  striatal medium spiny neurons in a murine Huntington disease model.Huntington disease
  (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the Huntingtin
  gene. Results from previous studies have suggested that transcriptional dysregulation
  is one of the key mechanisms underlying striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) degeneration
  in HD. However, some of the critical genes involved in HD etiology or pathology
  could be masked in a common expression profiling assay because of contamination
  with non-MSN cells. To gain insight into the MSN-specific gene expression changes
  in presymptomatic R6/2 mice, a common HD mouse model, here we used a transgenic
  fluorescent protein marker of MSNs for purification via FACS before profiling gene
  expression with gene microarrays and compared the results of this "FACS-array" with
  those obtained with homogenized striatal samples (STR-array). We identified hundreds
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enhanced detection of MSN-specific
  DEGs by comparing the results of the FACS-array with those of the STR-array. The
  gene sets obtained included genes ubiquitously expressed in both MSNs and non-MSN
  cells of the brain and associated with transcriptional regulation and DNA damage
  responses. We proposed that the comparative gene expression approach using the FACS-array
  may be useful for uncovering the gene cascades affected in MSNs during HD pathogenesis.
