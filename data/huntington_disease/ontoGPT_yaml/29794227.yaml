input_text: 'Longitudinal Characterization of mGluR5 Using 11C-ABP688 PET Imaging
  in the Q175 Mouse Model of Huntington Disease. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5
  (mGluR5) represents a potential therapeutic target for Huntington disease. Using
  11C-ABP688 (3-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-ylethynyl)-cyclohex-2-enone-O-11C-methyl-oxime),
  a noncompetitive and highly selective antagonist for mGluR5, we aimed to longitudinally
  characterize in vivo changes in mGluR5 by means of PET imaging in the Q175 mouse
  model of Huntington disease. Methods:11C-ABP688 PET imaging, followed by a CT scan,
  was performed on 18 heterozygous mice and 18 wild-type (WT) littermates at 3 different
  time points (6, 9, and 13 mo old). 11C-ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potential
  (BPND) was calculated for each time point in striatum and cortex using the cerebellum
  as the reference region. In addition, voxel-based statistical parametric mapping
  (SPM) analysis was performed on BPND images. Postmortem validation of mGluR5 level
  and neuronal density was performed on the mice at 6 mo old. Results: The 11C-ABP688
  BPND of heterozygous animals was significantly reduced at all time points in the
  striatum (-13.1%, -13.5%, and -14.2% at 6, 9, and 13 mo, respectively; P < 0.001
  for all) and in the cortex (-9.8%, -10.2%, and -10.6%, respectively; P < 0.01 for
  all), when compared with WT animals. Longitudinal changes in 11C-ABP688 BPND were
  also found in heterozygous mice, showing a reduction at 13 mo compared with 6 mo
  (-10.4%, P < 0.05). SPM analysis confirmed reduced BPND in heterozygous compared
  with WT mice, as well as a time-related decline in 11C-ABP688 binding in the striatum
  of heterozygous mice. Postmortem analysis confirmed a mGluR5 decrease in both striatum
  (-36.6%; P < 0.01) and cortex (-16.6%; P < 0.05) in heterozygous mice, whereas no
  difference in neuronal density was found. Conclusion: In vivo imaging of mGluR5
  using 11C-ABP688 PET/CT revealed a marked reduction in ligand binding in the striatum
  and cortex of heterozygous mice, compared with WT mice, as well as a temporal decline.
  This study suggests that 11C-ABP688 PET imaging is a potential biomarker to monitor
  the progression of, and therapeutic strategies for, Huntington disease.'
