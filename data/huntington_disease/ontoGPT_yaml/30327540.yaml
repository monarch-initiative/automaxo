input_text: 'Trends over 42 years in the Adult Medical Genetics Clinic at the University
  of Washington. PURPOSE: We analyzed the patients served by the University of Washington
  Adult Genetic Medicine Clinic (UWAGMC) over a 42-year period to determine how clinical
  services have changed and to evaluate the contributing factors. METHODS: We conducted
  a retrospective survey of patients seen by UWAGMC that included patients seen from
  1975 to 2016. Variables considered included referral indication, disease status,
  and clinic visit date. Indications for referral were then binned into clinical categories
  for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Of 30,780 patient visits during the 39 years
  for which data were available, 57.3% occurred in the last decade. Referrals for
  breast/ovarian cancer or colon/endometrial cancer account for 74.8% of cancer referrals
  since 1998. Huntington disease patients made up 46% of neurological referral indications.
  Telephone screening implemented in 2013 has reduced the number of referrals for
  hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSION: Referral indications increased with
  clinical testing availability and because of the academic programs of UWAGMC providers.
  With increased public awareness of heritable conditions, prescreening self-referrals
  were used to allocate limited resources. These trends demonstrate the need for more
  geneticists in adult medicine to expand centers of excellence for rare diseases
  and to serve the increasing numbers of adult patients with genetic conditions.'
