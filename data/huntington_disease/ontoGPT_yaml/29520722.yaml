input_text: Human Umbilical Cord Matrix Stem Cells Reverse Oxidative Stress-Induced
  Cell Death and Ameliorate Motor Function and Striatal Atrophy in Rat Model of Huntington
  Disease. Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive
  deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies.
  Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the
  replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal
  stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study,
  we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells
  (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus
  on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by
  the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality.
  Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed.
  Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned
  media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis
  were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic
  acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis
  was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells
  against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth.
  On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated
  motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume
  as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings
  imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors,
  which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.
