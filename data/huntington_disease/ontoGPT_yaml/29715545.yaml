input_text: 'Multiple system atrophy and CAG repeat length: A genetic screening of
  polyglutamine disease genes in Italian patients. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is
  an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology characterized
  by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism (MSA-P) and cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). The
  phenotypic spectrum may present overlapping features with other neurodegenerative
  diseases, particularly the autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders.
  To investigate the possible contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype,
  we analyzed the triplet repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes
  for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian
  atrophy (DRPLA) and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients.
  As comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the
  basis of CAG repeat length as "normal", "intermediate" or "expanded" according to
  literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 years
  and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had significantly
  younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P (p < 0.0001). We
  identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 CAG), a SCA2 intermediate
  allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36
  CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA
  alleles were detected in controls. The distribution of CAG repeat length was similar
  among groups except for SCA1 gene that showed a higher percentage of longer normal
  alleles in MSA-C as compared to MSA-P and controls (p < 0.0001). This study supports
  the utility of polyQ genetic testing in the differential diagnosis of MSA, and may
  suggest a possible role of SCA1 repeat length as risk factor for MSA-C. SCA1 and
  SCA2 genetic screening is recommended in MSA Italian patients.'
