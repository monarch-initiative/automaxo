input_text: Early or late-stage anti-N-terminal Huntingtin intrabody gene therapy
  reduces pathological features in B6.HDR6/1 mice. Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive
  neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine sequence in
  mutant huntingtin (mhtt) that produces abnormal folding and aggregation that results
  in the formation of nuclear and cytoplasmic neuronal inclusion bodies. Although
  the precise role of mhtt aggregates in the pathogenesis is unclear, attempts to
  reduce accumulated mhtt protein have ameliorated the phenotype in multiple cellular
  and in vivo HD models. Here, we provide critical results on intracranial delivery
  of a single-chain Fv intrabody, C4, which targets the first 17 amino acids of the
  htt protein, a region of httExon1 that is increasingly being recognized as pivotal.
  To assess long-term efficacy and safety issues, we used adenoassociated viral vectors
  (AAV2/1) to deliver intrabody genes to the striatum of inbred B6.HDR6/1 mice. Treatment
  initiation at various stages of the disease showed that early treatment preserved
  the largest number of cells without nuclear aggregates and that the accumulation
  of aggregated material could be delayed by several months. Even when intrabody treatment
  was not initiated until the clinical disease stage, significant, albeit smaller,
  effects were seen. These data indicate that neuronal intrabodies against critical
  N-terminal epitopes can be safely and effectively delivered using AAV2/1 to delay
  the aggregation phenotype during a sustained period in this HD model, even when
  delivery is initiated after disease onset.
