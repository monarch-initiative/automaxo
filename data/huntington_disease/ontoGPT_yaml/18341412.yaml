input_text: Cell therapy in Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD), caused by
  polyglutamate expansions in the huntingtin protein, is a progressive neurodegenerative
  disease resulting in cognitive and motor impairments and death. Neuronal dysfunction
  and degeneration contribute to progressive physiological, motor, cognitive, and
  emotional disturbances characteristic of HD. A major impetus for research into the
  treatment of HD has centered on cell therapy strategies to protect vulnerable neuronal
  cell populations or to replace dysfunctional or dying cells. The work underlying
  3 approaches to HD cell therapy includes the potential for self-repair through the
  manipulation of endogenous stem cells and/or neurogenesis, the use of fetal or stem
  cell transplantation as a cell replacement strategy, and the administration of neurotrophic
  factors to protect susceptible neuronal populations. These approaches have shown
  some promising results in animal models of HD. Although striatal transplantation
  of fetal-derived cells has undergone clinical assessment since the 1990s, many cell
  therapy strategies have yet to be applied in the clinic environment. A more thorough
  understanding of the pathophysiologies underlying HD as well as the response of
  both endogenous and exogenous cells to the degenerating brain will inform their
  merit as potential therapeutic agents and enhance the framework by which the success
  of such strategies are determined.
