input_text: 'In Vivo Cerebral Imaging of Mutant Huntingtin Aggregates Using 11C-CHDI-180R
  PET in a Nonhuman Primate Model of Huntington Disease.Huntington disease (HD) is
  a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide
  expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes the mutant huntingtin protein
  (mHTT). Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for
  target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering
  mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one
  (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque
  model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery
  of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing
  85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q,
  n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months
  after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R
  brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability
  of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment
  model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining
  for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R
  displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after
  injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible
  binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis
  was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and
  used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls,
  animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R
  binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001).
  No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals.
  The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically.
  Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify
  mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous
  work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess
  the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.'
