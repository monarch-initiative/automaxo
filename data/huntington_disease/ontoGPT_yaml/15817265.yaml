input_text: Lentiviral gene delivery of GDNF into the striatum of R6/2 Huntington
  mice fails to attenuate behavioral and neuropathological changes. Transgenic R6/2
  mice, which express exon 1 of the human mutant Huntington disease gene, develop
  behavioral and neuropathological changes that bear some resemblance to the human
  disease. Several studies have shown that elevated glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
  factor (GDNF) levels can exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of Huntington
  disease that are based on intrastriatal injections of excitotoxins. Therefore, the
  aim of the present study was to examine whether intrastriatal delivery of the GDNF
  gene by lentivirus (LV-GDNF) could provide structural and functional protection
  in R6/2 transgenic mice. Four- to 5-week-old mice were left untreated or alternatively
  received intrastriatal injections of either LV-GDNF or the same viral vector encoding
  green fluorescent protein (GFP) (LV-GFP) as a control. During the 4-week follow-up
  period, there was the expected deterioration in performance of the R6/2 mice in
  paw clasping, rotarod, and open field tests, and the LV-GDNF treated mice showed
  no improvement over controls. ELISA showed that the LV-GDNF-injected animals had
  a significant increase in GDNF level in the striatum, and immunohistochemical analysis
  revealed that GDNF was also overexpressed in brain regions receiving striatal projections.
  However, GDNF overexpression had no effect on the neuropathological changes examined.
  Thus, there were no significant differences in the number of EM-48-positive intraneuronal
  huntingtin inclusions, number of BrdU-positive cells and size of striatal neuronal
  cross-sectional area. These results suggest that intrastriatal lentiviral vector
  transfer of GDNF, performed at 5 weeks of age, does not ameliorate neurological
  and behavioral impairments in the R6/2 transgenic mice model of HD. Further studies
  are, however, needed to investigate if GDNF given at earlier time points is beneficial.
