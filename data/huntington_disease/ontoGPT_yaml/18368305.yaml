input_text: Stem cells and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases
  are characterized by the neurodegenerative changes or apoptosis of neurons involved
  in networks, which are important to specific physiological functions. With the development
  of old-aging society, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is on the increase.
  However, it is difficult to diagnose for most of neurodegenerative diseases. At
  present, there are too few effective therapies. Advances in stem cell biology have
  raised the hope and possibility for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently,
  stem cells have been widely attempted to treat neurodegenerative diseases of animal
  model. Here we review the progress and prospects of various stem cells, including
  embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cell and neural stem cells and so on, for
  the treatments of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's
  disease, Huntington' disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Lou Gehrig's disease.
