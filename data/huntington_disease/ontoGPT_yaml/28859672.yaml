input_text: 'Safety and in vivo immune assessment of escalating doses of oral laquinimod
  in patients with RRMS. BACKGROUND: Laquinimod is an oral immunomodulator in clinical
  development to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Laquinimod is
  in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Huntington Disease
  (HD). The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
  (PK) and cytoimmunologic effects following escalating doses of laquinimod in patients
  with RRMS. METHODS: One hundred twelve patients were randomly assigned to laquinimod/placebo
  in a series of separate dose-escalating cohorts starting from a daily oral dose
  of 0.9 mg/1.2 mg escalating to 2.7 mg, in 0.3 mg increments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight
  patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 mg.
  No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported,
  which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9 mg). There was no increased incidence of
  adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses. Laquinimod-treated patients showed more
  abnormal laboratory levels in liver enzymes, P-amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP),
  and fibrinogen, but most shifts were clinically non-significant. The exposure of
  laquinimod was dose proportional and linear in the tested dose range. An immunological
  substudy showed significant dose-dependent decreases in 6-sulpho LacNAc + dendritic
  cell (slanDC) frequency following laquinimod compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Laquinimod
  doses up to 2.7 mg were safely administered to patients with RRMS. An in vivo effect
  of laquinimod on the innate immune system was demonstrated. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
