input_text: 'Objective assessment of gait and posture in premanifest and manifest
  Huntington disease - A multi-center study. BACKGROUND: Deficits in posture and gait
  are known to contribute to the complex motor phenotype of Huntington disease (HD).
  Objective and quantitative measures of posture and gait provided by posturography
  and GAITRite  assessments may supplement categorical rating scales such as the UHDRS-TMS
  and increase power and sensitivity of clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To investigate
  whether posturography and GAITRite  measures reveal (1) changes in manifest or premanifest
  HD mutation-carriers, (2) a correlation to the UHDRS-TMS and functional measures
  in manifest HD, and (3) a correlation to the disease-burden-score (based on CAG-repeat-length
  and age). METHODS: Posturography and GAITRite  were applied in premanifest (n =
  26) and manifest HD gene-mutation-carriers (n = 40) in different paradigms compared
  to age-matched controls (n = 30) in a cross-sectional multi-site study conducted
  in three centers. Subjects were assessed clinically with the UHDRS Total-Motor-Score,
  Total-Functional-Capacity and Functional-Assessment-Scale. RESULTS: Several posturography
  measures were able to discriminate between controls, premanifest, and manifest mutation-carriers
  in both conditions assessed. Only one GAITRite  measure separated controls and premanifest
  participants, while discrimination between controls and manifest same as between
  premanifest and manifest participants was possible in several measures. Correlation
  with all clinical measures was seen in only one measure per device while correlations
  to the disease-burden-score seen in posturography only. CONCLUSION: Overall the
  results suggests that posturography detects alterations in premanifest and manifest
  mutation-carriers more reliably than GAITRite  measures. Correlations with clinical
  assessment scores are limited; correlation with disease-burden-score is seen in
  posturography only. Data acquisition and analysis was easier with posturography
  than GAITRite  assessments in out-patient settings.'
