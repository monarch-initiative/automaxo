input_text: "T1rho imaging in premanifest Huntington disease reveals changes associated
  with disease progression. BACKGROUND: Imaging biomarkers sensitive to Huntington's
  disease (HD) during the premanifest phase preceding motor diagnosis may accelerate
  identification and evaluation of potential therapies. For this purpose, quantitative
  MRI sensitive to tissue microstructure and metabolism may hold great potential.
  We investigated the potential value of T1rho relaxation to detect pathological changes
  in premanifest HD (preHD) relative to other quantitative relaxation parameters.
  METHODS: Quantitative MR parametric mapping was used to assess differences between
  50 preHD subjects and 26 age- and sex-matched controls. Subjects with preHD were
  classified into two progression groups based on their CAG-age product (CAP) score;
  a high and a low/moderate CAP group. Voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses
  were used to assess changes in the quantitative relaxation times. RESULTS: T1rho
  showed a significant increase in the relaxation times in the high-CAP group, as
  compared to controls, largely in the striatum. The T1rho changes in the preHD subjects
  showed a significant relationship with CAP score. No significant changes in T2 or
  T2* relaxation times were found in the striatum. T2* relaxation changes were found
  in the globus pallidus, but no significant changes with disease progression were
  found. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that quantitative T1rho mapping may provide
  a useful marker for assessing disease progression in HD. The absence of T2 changes
  suggests that the T1rho abnormalities are unlikely owing to altered water content
  or tissue structure. The established sensitivity of T1rho to pH and glucose suggests
  that these factors are altered in HD perhaps owing to abnormal mitochondrial function."
