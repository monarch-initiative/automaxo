input_text: "[Retinal OCT biomarkers and neurodegenerative diseases of the central
  nervous system beyond Alzheimer's disease].BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography
  (OCT) biomarkers are increasingly used by neurologists, psychiatrists, and ophthalmologists
  for the diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of neurodegenerative diseases. Long-term
  data on OCT biomarkers of selected primary and secondary neurodegenerative diseases
  of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's
  disease, are already available in part. In addition, there are rare neurodegenerative
  diseases with early disease onset that may show OCT abnormalities. METHODS: A literature
  review on the association of OCT biomarkers with neurodegenerative diseases of the
  CNS beyond Alzheimer's disease is presented. Parkinson's disease, MS, Friedreich's
  ataxia, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and lysosomal storage diseases
  are addressed. RESULTS: Relevant OCT biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are
  the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and the peripapillary retinal
  nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness. Different sectors may be affected depending
  on the disease entity in addition to global pRFNL reduction. OCT-angiography (OCT-A)
  is also increasingly used as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION:
  Optical coherence tomography biomarkers are used in an interdisciplinary context.
  Retinal pathologies should be excluded by an ophthalmologist. While OCT biomarkers
  are increasingly used clinically in MS, the benefit in other neurodegenerative diseases,
  especially the rare ones, is less well documented. Further longitudinal studies
  are required."
