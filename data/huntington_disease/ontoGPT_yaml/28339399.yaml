input_text: "Early Huntington's Disease: Impulse Control Deficits but Correct Judgment
  Regarding Risky Situations. BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) patients show
  alterations in decision making tasks. However, it is still uncertain if these deficits
  are due to poor judgment regarding risky situations, or to impulse control deficits.
  OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether decision-making in patients is related to genuine
  risk behavior or to impulse control deficits. METHODS: To test between these two
  alternative possibilities, we evaluated the performance of 19 prodromal HD patients
  and 19 matched healthy controls in the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT). This task
  assesses decision-making while dissociating between genuine risk-taking behaviors
  (ascending condition) from impulsive behavior (descending condition). RESULTS: The
  results showed that patients and controls had the same performance during all trials
  in the ascending condition, reflecting a correct judgment regarding risky situations;
  however, during the descending condition, patients responded before the controls
  in all trials, making a significantly larger number of higher bets. Unlike the control
  group, they did not wait for more optimal subsequent options. CONCLUSION: These
  results suggest impulse control deficits in HD gene carriers, but unimpaired risk-taking
  judgment."
