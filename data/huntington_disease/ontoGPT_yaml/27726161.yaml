input_text: Brain Diffusivity and Structural Changes in the R6/2 Mouse Model of Huntington
  Disease. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) is an important diagnostic
  tool in Huntington disease (HD), a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder.
  To clarify the nature of diffusivity changes in HD, we compared the apparent diffusion
  coefficient of water (ADCW ) acquired by DW-MR with extracellular space volume fraction
  alpha and tortuosity lambda, measured by the iontophoretic method in the R6/2 mouse
  model of HD and in wild-type controls (WT). In anisotropic globus pallidus (GP),
  diffusion measurements were performed in the mediolateral (x), rostrocaudal (y),
  and ventrodorsal (z) axes. In HD animals, we detected an increase in ADCW in all
  axes and larger alpha than in WT mice. No significant difference between WT and
  HD mice was found in the values of tortuosity (lambdax , lambday , lambdaz ). Despite
  structural changes in GP, diffusion anisotropy was unaffected in HD mice. Immunohistochemical
  analysis revealed in HD mice weaker expression of extracellular matrix and a decrease
  in neuron numbers compared with WT mice. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining
  detected astrogliosis-like changes in the morphology of astrocytic processes in
  HD GP. In the somatosensory cortex, no significant differences in the studied parameters
  were found. We conclude that in the R6/2 model of HD, a decrease in the number of
  neurons in the GP results in increased ADCW and alpha values. Values of lambda were
  not significantly changed as the increase of diffusion obstacles formed by reactive
  astrocytes was compensated for by the extracellular matrix reduction.   2016 Wiley
