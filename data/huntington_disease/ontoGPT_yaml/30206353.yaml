input_text: "Reverse pre-symptomatic testing for Huntington disease: double disclosure
  when 25% at-risk children reveal the genetic status to their parent. Predictive
  testing for Huntington disease (HD) in 25% at-risk individuals is testing with full
  knowledge, and sometimes assuming, that the parent does not want to know his status.
  The goal of this study was to understand: (1) the differences in the motivation
  between 25% and 50% at-risk individuals to be tested and (2) the consequences of
  \"double disclosure\", including parental reactions. Test requests from 25% at-risk
  individuals were rare (155/1611, 10%). We compared their motivation with those of
  1456 50% at-risk individuals. The principal motivation to have the test for both
  groups was \"to know\" (48% versus 58%, p = 0.049), but the desire to have children
  was more frequent in the 25% at-risk group (32% versus 17%, p < 0.001). Sixty percent
  of the 25% at-risk group went through the testing procedure: 15% (n = 14) were variant
  positive for HD. Testees reported four adverse reactions of their parent (22%):
  one committed suicide and three became depressed. This result highlights the impact
  of \"double disclosure\", a bad result for the person themselves and the transmitting
  parent. It is the responsibility of the team to anticipate this outcome with the
  25% at-risk individuals: children revealing the genetic status to their parent.
  They should help the testees and their family to find a satisfactory solution to
  help prevent adverse reactions. This includes ensuring that the candidate is well-infomed
  abour the testing options and consequences to her/himself but also to her/his parent.
  The at-risk parent should be offered to discuss the implications of their child's
  testing."
