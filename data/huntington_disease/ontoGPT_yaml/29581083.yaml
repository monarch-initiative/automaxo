input_text: Long-term predictors for psychological outcome of pre-symptomatic testing
  for late-onset neurological diseases. This longitudinal study aimed at determining
  predicting variables for middle and long-term psychological disturbance due pre-symptomatic
  testing (PST) for two late-onset neurological diseases, Huntington disease (HD)
  and TTR (transthyretin protein) familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) Val30Met (now
  classified as Val50Met). 196 clinical records of persons who performed PST at least
  three years ago and answered to the two stages of evaluation (before PST and least
  3 years after disclosure of results) were analysed. For this purpose, regression
  analysis was performed, showing that the Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI),
  psychoticism, somatization and paranoid ideation dimensions assume predictive value
  in the middle and long-term impact for total anxiety and PSDI. The result of PST
  was not a relevant predictor. The application of an evaluation instrument of various
  psychopathological dimensions played a fundamental role in the detection of clinical
  situations that may arise several years later after PST. Attention should be paid
  to providing psychological support to persons at-risk who, at the pre-test phase,
  present some psychopathology indices before pursuing with genetic testing.
