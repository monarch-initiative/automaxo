input_text: 'Clinical evaluation of eye movements in spinocerebellar ataxias: a prospective
  multicenter study. BACKGROUND: Ocular motor abnormalities reflect the varied neuropathology
  of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and may serve to clinically distinguish the different
  SCAs. We analyzed the various eye movement abnormalities detected prospectively
  at the baseline visit during a large multicenter natural history study of SCAs 1,
  2, 3, and 6. METHODS: The data were prospectively collected from 12 centers in the
  United States in patients with SCAs 1, 2, 3, and 6, as part of the Clinical Research
  Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (NIH-CRC-SCA). Patient characteristics, ataxia
  rating scales, the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale functional examination,
  and clinical staging were used. Eye movement abnormalities including nystagmus,
  disorders of saccades and pursuit, and ophthalmoparesis were recorded, and factors
  influencing their occurrence were examined. RESULTS: A total of 301 patients participated
  in this study, including 52 patients with SCA 1, 64 with SCA 2, 117 with SCA 3,
  and 68 with SCA 6. Although no specific ocular motor abnormality was pathognomonic
  to any SCA, significant differences were noted in their occurrence among different
  disorders. SCA 6 was characterized by frequent occurrence of nystagmus and abnormal
  pursuit and rarity of slow saccades and ophthalmoparesis and SCA 2 by the frequent
  occurrence of slow saccades and infrequent nystagmus and dysmetric saccades. SCA
  1 and SCA 3 subjects had a more even distribution of eye movement abnormalities.
  CONCLUSIONS: Prospective data from a large cohort of patients with SCAs 1, 2, 3,
  and 6 provide statistical validation that the SCAs exhibit distinct eye movement
  abnormalities that are useful in identifying the genotypes. Many of the abnormalities
  correlate with greater disease severity measures.'
