input_text: 'JAZ (Znf346), a SIRT1-interacting protein, protects neurons by stimulating
  p21 (WAF/CIP1) protein expression. SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase, protects
  neurons in various models of neurodegenerative diseases. We previously described
  that neuroprotection by SIRT1 is independent of its catalytic activity. To elucidate
  how SIRT1 protects neurons, we performed a mass spectrometric screen to find SIRT1-interacting
  proteins. One of the proteins identified was JAZ (Znf346), a member of a new class
  of Cys-2-His-2 zinc finger proteins. To investigate the significance of JAZ in the
  regulation of neuronal survival, we overexpressed it in neurons. We found that JAZ
  protects cerebellar granule neurons against potassium deprivation-induced death
  and cortical neurons from death resulting from oxidative stress. JAZ also protects
  neurons against toxicity induced by mutant huntingtin and mutant ataxin-1 expression.
  Although expression of endogenous JAZ does not change in neurons primed to die,
  knockdown of its expression promotes death of otherwise healthy neurons. In contrast
  to its protective effect in neurons, overexpression of JAZ in different cell lines
  promotes death. We find that JAZ suppresses cell cycle progression, thereby explaining
  its contrasting effect in postmitotic neurons versus proliferating cell lines. Although
  not affecting the expression of several cyclins, overexpression of JAZ stimulates
  expression of p21 (WAF1/CIP1), a cell cycle inhibitor known to have neuroprotective
  effects. Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional assays indicate
  that the stimulatory effect of JAZ on p21 expression is mediated at the transcriptional
  level. Furthermore, knockdown of p21 expression inhibits the neuroprotective effect
  of JAZ. Together, our results suggest that JAZ protects neurons by inhibiting cell
  cycle re-entry through the transcriptional stimulation of p21 expression. '
