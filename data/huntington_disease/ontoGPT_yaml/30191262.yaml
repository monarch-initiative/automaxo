input_text: "The effect of laquinimod, a novel immuno-modulator in development to
  treat Huntington disease, on the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel
  in healthy young women. PURPOSE: Laquinimod is an orally dosed immuno-modulator
  currently under development for Huntington's disease (HD). Preclinical findings
  suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of
  females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined
  oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of
  COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with
  laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated. METHODS: In this randomized, phase-1 single-center,
  double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study
  in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of
  21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was
  administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration.
  Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected
  on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose. RESULTS:
  The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24 and Cmax of
  EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range
  (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in
  previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge
  on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported
  treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSION: The combination of COC and laquinimod
  treatment was found to be safe, tolerable, and devoid of any noticeable pharmacokinetic
  interaction."
