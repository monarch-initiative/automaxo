input_text: 'Cannabinoid receptor ligand bias: implications in the central nervous
  system. The G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors CB1, CB2, GPR18, and GPR55 regulate
  neurotransmission, pain, and inflammation and have been intensively investigated
  as potential drug targets. Each of these GPCRs is coupled to multiple effector proteins
  mediating divergent cellular signals. The ligand bias of cannabinoid-targeted compounds
  is only beginning to be quantified. Research into cannabinoid bias is now revealing
  correlations between bias in cell culture and functional outcomes in vivo. We present
  an example study of cannabinoid bias in the context of Huntington disease. In future,
  an understanding of cannabinoid receptor structure and quantification of ligand
  bias will optimize drug selection matched to patient population and disease.'
