input_text: 'Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A Is Affected in the Central Nervous System
  of Mice with Huntington Disease and in the Brain of a Human with Huntington Disease
  Postmortem.Synaptic dysfunction is a primary mechanism underlying Huntington disease
  (HD) progression. This study investigated changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein
  2A (SV2A) density by means of 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging in the central
  nervous system of mice with HD. Methods: Dynamic 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging
  was performed at clinically relevant disease stages (at 3, 7, 10, and 16 mo) in
  the heterozygous knock-in Q175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates (16-18
  mice per genotype and time point). Cerebral 11C-UCB-J analyses were performed to
  assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16
  mo) disease stages. 11C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo.
  3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in
  mouse and human brain tissues. Results:11C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic
  heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression
  (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11C-UCB-J binding was detectable
  in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant
  reduction (P < 0.0001). 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated
  the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice (P < 0.05).
  Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower
  SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion:11C-UCB-J
  PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both
  the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of
  synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical
  application, 11C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients
  with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.'
