input_text: Super-resolution imaging reveals extrastriatal synaptic dysfunction in
  presymptomatic Huntington disease mice. Synaptic structure and function are compromised
  prior to cell death and symptom onset in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.
  In Huntington disease (HD), a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin
  protein results in a presymptomatic stage that typically spans multiple decades
  and is followed by striking degeneration of striatal tissue and the progression
  of debilitating motor symptoms. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that the HD presymptomatic
  window is associated with injurious effects to striatal synapses, many of which
  appear to be prerequisites to subsequent cell death. While the striatum is the most
  vulnerable region in the HD brain, it is widely recognized that HD is a brain-wide
  disease, affecting numerous extrastriatal regions that contribute to debilitating
  non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction. Currently, we have a poor understanding
  of the synaptic integrity, or lack thereof, in extrastriatal regions in the presymptomatic
  HD brain. If early therapeutic intervention seeks to maintain healthy synaptic function,
  it is important to understand early HD-associated synaptopathy at a brain-wide,
  rather than striatal-exclusive, level. Here, we focused on the hippocampus as this
  structure is generally thought to be affected only in manifest HD despite the subtle
  cognitive deficits known to emerge in prodromal HD. We used super-resolution microscopy
  and multi-electrode array electrophysiology as sensitive measures of excitatory
  synapse structure and function, respectively, in the hippocampus of presymptomatic
  heterozygous HD mice (Q175FDN model). We found clear evidence for enhanced AMPA
  receptor subunit clustering and hyperexcitability well before the onset of a detectable
  HD-like behavioral phenotype. In addition, activity-dependent re-organization of
  synaptic protein nanostructure, and functional measures of synaptic plasticity were
  impaired in presymptomatic HD mice. These data demonstrate that synaptic abnormalities
  in the presymptomatic HD brain are not exclusive to the striatum, and highlight
  the need to better understand the region-dependent complexities of early synaptopathy
  in the HD brain.
