input_text: Inclusions of R6/2 Mice Are Not Amyloid and Differ Structurally from Those
  of Huntington Disease Brain. R6/2 mice contain an N-terminal fragment of human huntingtin
  with an expanded polyQ and develop a neurological disease resembling Huntington
  disease. Although the brain of R6/2 mice contains numerous inclusions, there is
  very little neuronal death. In that respect, R6/2 mice differ from patients with
  Huntington disease whose striatum and cerebral cortex develop inclusions associated
  with extensive neuronal loss. We have previously demonstrated using synchrotron-based
  infrared microspectroscopy that the striatum and the cortex of patients with Huntington
  disease contained inclusions specifically enriched in amyloid beta-sheets. We had
  concluded that the presence of an amyloid motif conferred toxicity to the inclusions.
  We demonstrate here by synchrotron based infrared microspectroscopy in transmission
  and attenuated total reflectance mode that the inclusions of R6/2 mice possess no
  detectable amyloid and are composed of proteins whose structure is not distinguishable
  from that of the surrounding soluble proteins. The difference in structure between
  the inclusions of patients affected by Huntington disease and those of R6/2 mice
  might explain why the former but not the latter cause neuronal death.
