input_text: Sleeping Beauty-mediated down-regulation of huntingtin expression by RNA
  interference. Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurologic disorder that
  is characterized by abnormal expansion of a CAG nt repeat in the first exon of the
  huntingtin (htt) gene, producing a mutant protein with an elongated polyglutamine
  stretch. The presence of this mutant protein is correlated with the characteristic
  loss of striatal neurons and the clinical manifestation of HD. Currently there is
  no effective treatment for the associated cell death. The aim of this study was
  to evaluate an innovative strategy combining RNA interference (RNAi) and gene transfer
  via the nonviral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system to down-regulate Htt expression.
  siRNA expression vectors were designed to target exons 1, 4, 6, and 62 of the human
  htt gene. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to quantify Htt mRNA
  and protein levels, respectively, in human cell lines. The results indicated that
  selected siRNA constructs significantly decreased Htt mRNA and protein levels relative
  to controls. In addition, SB transposition of the siRNA constructs into the genome
  reduced long-term protein expression of Htt by approximately 90%. The combination
  of siRNA, the SB transposon, and an accurate transgenic mouse model may permit evaluation
  of this approach in preventing the pathogenesis associated with expression of mutant
  Htt.
