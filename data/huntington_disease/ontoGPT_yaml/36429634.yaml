input_text: "Home-Based Exercise to Improve Motor Functions, Cognitive Functions,
  and Quality of Life in People with Huntington's Disease: A Systematic Review and
  Meta-Analysis. Exercise in different settings has become a fundamental part of Huntington's
  disease (HD) management. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was
  to investigate the effectiveness of home-based exercises (HBE) in HD. Randomized
  controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of HBE on motor, cognitive, or
  health-related quality of life (QoL) outcomes in HD were included. Standardized
  mean difference (SMD), the 95% confidence interval, and p-values were calculated
  by comparing the outcomes change between HBE and control groups. Seven RCTs met
  the inclusion criteria. The included RCTs prescribed different types of HBEs, i.e.,
  aerobic strengthening, walking, balance, and fine motor exercises. The HBE protocol
  length was between 6 and 36 weeks. The meta-analyses showed a significant effect
  of HBE intervention on motor function measure by Unified Huntington Disease Rating
  and overall QoL measure by Short Form-36 post-treatment respectively, [SMD = 0.481,
  p = 0.048], [SMD = 0.378, p = 0.003]. The pooled analysis did not detect significant
  changes in cognition, gait characteristics, or functional balance scales. The current
  study shows the positive effect of HBE in HD, especially on motor function and QoL.
  No significant adverse events were reported. The current results support the clinical
  effect of HBE intervention on motor function and QoL in HD patients. However, these
  results should be taken with caution due to the limited available evidence. Well-designed
  clinical studies that consider the disease severity and stages are required in the
  future."
