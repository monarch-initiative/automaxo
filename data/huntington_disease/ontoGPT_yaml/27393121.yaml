input_text: 'New measures to capture end of life concerns in Huntington disease: Meaning
  and Purpose and Concern with Death and Dying from HDQLIFE (a patient-reported outcomes
  measurement system). PURPOSE: Huntington disease (HD) is an incurable terminal disease.
  Thus, end of life (EOL) concerns are common in these individuals. A quantitative
  measure of EOL concerns in HD would enable a better understanding of how these concerns
  impact health-related quality of life. Therefore, we developed new measures of EOL
  for use in HD. METHODS: An EOL item pool of 45 items was field tested in 507 individuals
  with prodromal or manifest HD. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA
  and CFA, respectively) were conducted to establish unidimensional item pools. Item
  response theory (IRT) and differential item functioning analyses were applied to
  the identified unidimensional item pools to select the final items. RESULTS: EFA
  and CFA supported two separate unidimensional sets of items: Concern with Death
  and Dying (16 items), and Meaning and Purpose (14 items). IRT and DIF supported
  the retention of 12 Concern with Death and Dying items and 4 Meaning and Purpose
  items. IRT data supported the development of both a computer adaptive test (CAT)
  and a 6-item, static short form for Concern with Death and Dying. CONCLUSION: The
  HDQLIFE Concern with Death and Dying CAT and corresponding 6-item short form, and
  the 4-item calibrated HDQLIFE Meaning and Purpose scale demonstrate excellent psychometric
  properties. These new measures have the potential to provide clinically meaningful
  information about end-of-life preferences and concerns to clinicians and researchers
  working with individuals with HD. In addition, these measures may also be relevant
  and useful for other terminal conditions.'
