input_text: 'Derivation of Huntington disease affected Genea020 human embryonic stem
  cell line. The Genea020 human embryonic stem cell line was derived from a donated,
  fully commercially consented ART blastocyst, carrying Htt gene CAG expansion of
  48 repeats, indicative of Huntington disease. Following ICM outgrowth on inactivated
  human feeders, karyotype was confirmed as 46, XX by CGH and STR analysis demonstrated
  a female allele pattern. The hESC line had pluripotent cell morphology, 89% of cells
  expressed Nanog, 95% Oct4, 29% Tra1-60 and 99% SSEA4, gave a Pluritest pluripotency
  score of 27.51, novelty of 1.43 and demonstrated alkaline phosphatase activity.
  The cell line was negative for Mycoplasma and visible contamination. '

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
