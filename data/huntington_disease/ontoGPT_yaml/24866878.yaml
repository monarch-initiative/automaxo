input_text: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for inherited neurological disorders.
  Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an option for couples at risk of having
  offspring with an inherited debilitating or fatal neurological disorder who wish
  to conceive a healthy child. PGD has been carried out for conditions with various
  modes of inheritance, including spinal muscular atrophy, Huntington disease, fragile
  X syndrome, and chromosomal or mitochondrial disorders, and for susceptibility genes
  for cancers with nervous system involvement. Most couples at risk of transmitting
  a genetic mutation would opt for PGD over prenatal testing and possible termination
  of a pregnancy. The aim of this Perspectives article is to assist neurologists in
  counselling and treating patients who wish to explore the option of PGD to enable
  conception of an unaffected child. PGD can be accomplished for most disorders in
  which the genetic basis is known, and we argue that it is time for clinicians and
  neurological societies to consider the evidence and to formulate guidelines for
  the responsible integration of PGD into modern preventative neurology.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
