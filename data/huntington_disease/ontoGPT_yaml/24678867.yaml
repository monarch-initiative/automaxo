input_text: "Movement sequencing in Huntington disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine longitudinal
  changes in movement sequencing in prodromal Huntington's disease (HD) participants
  (795 prodromal HD; 225 controls) from the PREDICT-HD study. METHODS: Prodromal HD
  participants were tested over seven annual visits and were stratified into three
  groups (low, medium, high) based on their CAG-Age Product (CAP) score, which indicates
  likely increasing proximity to diagnosis. A cued movement sequence task assessed
  the impact of advance cueing on response initiation and execution via three levels
  of advance information. RESULTS: Compared to controls, all CAP groups showed longer
  initiation and movement times across all conditions at baseline, demonstrating a
  disease gradient for the majority of outcomes. Across all conditions, the high CAP
  group had the highest mean for baseline testing, but also demonstrated an increase
  in movement time across the study. For initiation time, the high CAP group showed
  the highest mean baseline time across all conditions, but also faster decreasing
  rates of change over time. CONCLUSIONS: With progress to diagnosis, participants
  may increasingly use compensatory strategies, as evidenced by faster initiation.
  However, this occurred in conjunction with slowed execution times, suggesting a
  decline in effectively accessing control processes required to translate movement
  into effective execution."
