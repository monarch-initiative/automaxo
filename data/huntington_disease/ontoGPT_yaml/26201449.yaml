input_text: 'Huntingtin Haplotypes Provide Prioritized Target Panels for Allele-specific
  Silencing in Huntington Disease Patients of European Ancestry. Huntington disease
  (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in
  the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis with the mutation allow
  for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT transcript as a therapeutic
  strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise heterozygosity estimates are needed
  across diverse HD patient populations. Here we present the first comprehensive investigation
  of all common target alleles across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes
  from the 1000 Genomes Project and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives
  in Canada, Sweden, France, and Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and
  A3a) define mutually exclusive sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy
  in the greatest number of patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80%
  are treatable using these three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion
  found exclusively on the A1 haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of
  mutant HTT in approximately 40% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary
  to the deletion reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78% in patient cells while sparing
  wild-type HTT expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG
  occurs, we demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific
  therapy for a monogenic disorder. '
