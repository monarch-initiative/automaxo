input_text: Perinatal applications of neural stem cells. The brain, unlike many tissues,
  has a limited capacity for self-repair and so there has been great interest in the
  possibility of transplanting neural cells to replace those lost through injury or
  disease. Encouraging research in humans is already underway examining the possibility
  of neural cell replacement in adult neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's
  disease and Huntington disease. In addition, experiments exploring neural stem cell
  replacement in rodent models of acute stroke, demyelination and spinal cord injury
  have demonstrated functional improvements in treated animals. When considering perinatal
  neural stem cell therapy, it should not be overlooked that the immature, developing
  brain might provide a more favourable environment for stem cell integration. However,
  considerable advances need to be made both in understanding the basic biology of
  neural stem cells, including the instructive signals that determine their proliferation
  and differentiation, and in characterising their responses when transplanted in
  a damaged or diseased area of the brain.
