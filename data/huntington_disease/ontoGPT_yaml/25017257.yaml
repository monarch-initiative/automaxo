input_text: 'New perspectives on preimplantation genetic diagnosis and preimplantation
  genetic screening. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is a procedure that involves
  the removal of one or more nuclei from oocytes (a polar body) or embryos (blastomeres
  or trophectoderm cells) in order to test for problems in genome sequence or chromosomes
  of the embryo prior to implantation. It provides new hope of having unaffected children,
  as well as avoiding the necessity of terminating an affected pregnancy for genetic
  parents who carry an affected gene or have balanced chromosomal status. Polymerase
  chain reaction-based molecular techniques are the methods used to detect gene defects
  with a known sequence and X-linked diseases. The indication for using this approach
  has expanded for couples who are prevented from having babies because they carry
  a serious genetic disorder to couples with conditions that are not immediately life
  threatening, such as cancer predisposition genes and Huntington disease. In addition,
  fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has been widely applied for the detection
  of chromosome abnormalities. FISH allows the evaluation of many chromosomes at the
  same time, up to 15 chromosome pairs in a single cell. Preimplantation genetic screening,
  defined as a test that screens for aneuploidy, has been most commonly used in situations
  of advanced maternal age, a history of recurrent miscarriage, a history of repeated
  implantation failure, or a severe male factor. Unfortunately, randomized controlled
  trials have as yet shown no benefit with respect to preimplantation genetic screening
  using cleavage stage biopsy, which is probably attributable to the high levels of
  mosaicism at early cleavage stages and the limitations of FISH. Recently, two main
  types of array-based technology combined with whole genome amplification have been
  developed for use in preimplantation genetic diagnosis; these are comparative genomic
  hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism-based arrays. Both allow the analysis
  of all chromosomes, and the latter also allows the haplotype of the sample to be
  determined. The promising results of these two approaches will inspire further validation
  of these array platforms, even at the single-cell level. It remains to be decided
  which embryo stage is the best for biopsy. Moreover, if randomized controlled trials
  are confirmed to play a role in increasing delivery rates, this will be a major
  step forward for assisted reproductive technology patients around the world. '
