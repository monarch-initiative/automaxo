input_text: 'Suicidal Ideation Assessment in Individuals with Premanifest and Manifest
  Huntington Disease. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is associated with increased
  risk of suicide. OBJECTIVE: This study compares suicide ideation in HD to the general
  population, assesses factors associated with increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts,
  and compares clinician-rated to self-reported assessments of suicidal ideation.
  METHODS: We examined 496 participants with premanifest or manifest HD. Clinician-rated
  suicidal ideation was measured using the Problem Behaviors Assessment - short form.
  Self-reported ideation was measured using two items from the HDQLIFE Concern with
  Death and Dying item bank. Independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare
  the prevalence of suicidal thoughts between our HD sample and the U.S. POPULATION:
  Logistic regression analyses were used to determine characteristics associated with
  higher odds of clinically significant suicidal ideation. Kappa agreement coefficients
  were calculated to evaluate concurrence between clinician-rated and self-reported
  assessments. RESULTS: Our sample had a significantly higher occurrence of suicidal
  ideation (19.76%) and suicidal plans (2.1%) than the general population (p < 0.0001).
  Odds of clinically significant suicidal ideation were 6.8 times higher in females
  (p = 0.04) on the clinician measure, and Hispanic/Latinos had 10.9 times higher
  odds than non-Hispanics (p = 0.025) on the self-report measure. Clinician-rated
  assessment had fair agreement (k = 0.2-0.4) with self-reported assessments, except
  in early stage HD where there was no overlap in the identification of participants
  with clinically significant suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: Assessment for suicidal
  ideation and clinically significant suicidal thoughts in HD with a multimodal approach
  that includes clinician-rated and self-report measures is critical at all stages
  of the disease.'
