input_text: 'Cortical interneuron loss and symptom heterogeneity in Huntington disease.
  OBJECTIVE: The cellular basis of variable symptoms in Huntington disease (HD) is
  unclear. One important possibility is that degeneration of the interneurons in the
  cerebral cortex, which play a critical role in modulating cortical output to the
  basal ganglia, might play a significant role in the development of variable symptomatology
  in HD. This study aimed to examine whether symptom variability in HD is specifically
  associated with variable degeneration of cortical interneurons. METHODS: We undertook
  a double-blind study using stereological cell counting methods to quantify the 3
  major types of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons (calbindin-D28k, calretinin,
  parvalbumin) in 13 HD cases of variable motor/mood symptomatology and 15 matched
  control cases in the primary motor and anterior cingulate cortices. RESULTS: In
  the primary motor cortex, there was a significant loss (57% reduction) of only calbindin
  interneurons (p=0.022) in HD cases dominated by motor symptoms, but no significant
  interneuron loss in cases with a dominant mood phenotype. In contrast, the anterior
  cingulate cortex showed a major significant loss in all 3 interneuron populations,
  with 71% loss of calbindin (p=0.001), 60% loss of calretinin (p=0.001), and 80%
  loss of parvalbumin interneurons (p=0.005) in HD cases with major mood disorder,
  and no interneuron loss was observed in cases with major motor dysfunction. INTERPRETATION:
  These findings suggest that region-specific degeneration of cortical interneurons
  is a key component in understanding the neural basis of symptom heterogeneity in
  HD.'
