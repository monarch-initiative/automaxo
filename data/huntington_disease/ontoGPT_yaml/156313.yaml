input_text: Isoniazid therapy of Huntington disease. We describe clinical and biochemical
  changes in seven patients with Huntington disease given isoniazid (INH) in dosages
  three to five greater than normally used in tuberculosis. Because INH inhibits the
  enzyme gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-T), and increases GABA content
  in the brains of experimental animals, it might correct the brain GABA deficiency
  characteristic of Huntington disease. Of six patients treated long enough to be
  clinically evaluated, one showed marked and two others showed signifciant improvement.
  High-dose INH therapy carries serious toxic risks, which are influenced by patients'
  acetylator phenotypes. Nevertheless, results are sufficiently promising to warrant
  further controlled trials of INH or other GABA-T inhibitors in Huntington disease.
