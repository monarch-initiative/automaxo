input_text: 'The CREST-E study of creatine for Huntington disease: A randomized controlled
  trial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether creatine administration could slow progressive
  functional decline in adults with early symptoms of Huntington disease. METHODS:
  We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
  up to 40 g daily of creatine monohydrate in participants with stage I and II HD
  treated for up to 48 months. The primary outcome measure was the rate of change
  in total functional capacity (TFC) between baseline and end of follow-up. Secondary
  outcome measures included changes in additional clinical scores, tolerability, and
  quality of life. Safety was assessed by adverse events and laboratory studies. RESULTS:
  At 46 sites in North America, Australia, and New Zealand, 553 participants were
  randomized to creatine (275) or placebo (278). The trial was designed to enroll
  650 patients, but was halted for futility after the first interim analysis. The
  estimated rates of decline in the primary outcome measure (TFC) were 0.82 points
  per year for participants on creatine, 0.70 points per year for participants on
  placebo, favoring placebo (nominal 95% confidence limits -0.11 to 0.35). Adverse
  events, mainly gastrointestinal, were significantly more common in participants
  on creatine. Serious adverse events, including deaths, were more frequent in the
  placebo group. Subgroup analysis suggested that men and women may respond differently
  to creatine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support the use of creatine
  treatment for delaying functional decline in early manifest HD. CLINICALTRIALSGOV
  IDENTIFIER: NCT00712426. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II
  evidence that for patients with early symptomatic HD, creatine monohydrate is not
  beneficial for slowing functional decline.'
