input_text: '3-Nitropropionic acid production by the endophytic Diaporthe citri: Molecular
  taxonomy, chemical characterization, and quantification under pH variation. 3-nitropropionic
  acid (3-NPA) is a nitrogenated compound produced by plants and fungi and has been
  associated with poisoning episodes in humans, animals, and to induction of Huntington
  disease symptoms in rats. The production of 3-NPA by endophytes has been reported,
  but the function and biosynthesis are not well-defined. The specie of endophytic
  strain G-01 was confirmed as Diaporthe citri using a multilocus sequence analysis,
  and was verified different concentrations of 3-NPA produced at different initial
  pHs by these strain. The chemical analysis indicated that 3-NPA was the majority
  compound present in the crude extracts. The better extraction condition was at an
  initial pH of 7.0 for 22 d, yielding about 80 % of 3-NPA per mg of extract. It was
  observed that the concentration of 3-NPA increased after the initial consumption
  of reduction sugars, indicating that the compound is produced after the high energetic
  production phase of the fungus. These and other studies demonstrate the production
  of this compound by plants and endophytic fungi, indicating that 3-NPA may be involved
  in defence and nutrition systems of endophytes and host plants, and they also might
  participate in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle.'
