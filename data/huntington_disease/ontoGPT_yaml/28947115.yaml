input_text: Contemporary health care for Huntington disease. Providing medical care
  for people and families affected by Huntington disease (HD) can be a rewarding effort
  when realistic goals of improved quality of life and optimized functional status
  are set. Multiple disease symptoms can remit or improve with currently available
  pharmacologic and behavioral interventions, even though barriers exist that interfere
  with access to treatment. Connecting expert multidisciplinary teams with community-based
  care, developing treatment guidelines, and involving the HD family community in
  quality improvements can achieve an integrated system of health care delivery. Engaging
  people with HD in high-quality compassionate care will not only improve lives, it
  will also encourage participation in clinical trials that search for disease-modifying
  treatments that will reduce or bring the suffering of HD to an end.
