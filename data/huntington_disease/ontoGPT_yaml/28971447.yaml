input_text: "Huntington Disease: Genetics, Prevention, and Therapy Approaches. Huntington's
  chorea or Huntington disease (HD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative
  disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. The multidisciplinary study
  of HD has been the focus of an international collaborating effort of basic and applied
  research for several decades. HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using
  linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes
  mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available
  for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical
  guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake
  of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low. Current treatment of HD is
  mostly symptomatic, but ongoing observational studies, clinical trials and development
  of new gene silencing technologies have provided hopeful results."
