input_text: Functional imaging in Huntington disease. Functional imaging has been
  increasingly used in the study of neurodegenerative diseases as such techniques
  can elucidate neurochemical and functional changes that cannot be captured with
  structural imaging. Unlike other neurodegenerative diseases, in Huntington disease
  (HD) genetic testing allows for diagnostic certainty. Thus, the focus has been on
  understanding the pathophysiogic processes underlying the development of the disease,
  as well as the identification of potential biomarkers to monitor disease progression,
  particularly during the presymptomatic stage. These imaging methods have expanded
  our understanding of HD beyond dopaminergic deficits and striatal cell loss, and
  have described alteration in widespread networks relating to motor and cognitive
  symptoms. In this chapter, we review the current literature on radiotracer and functional
  magnetic resonance imaging relating to HD.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
