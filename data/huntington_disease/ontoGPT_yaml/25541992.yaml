input_text: 'Prodromal Huntington disease as a model for functional compensation of
  early neurodegeneration. Functional compensation demonstrated as mechanism to offset
  neuronal loss in early Alzheimer disease may also occur in other adult-onset neurodegenerative
  diseases, particularly Huntington disease (HD) with its genetic determination and
  gradual changes in structural integrity. In HD, neurodegeneration typically initiates
  in the dorsal striatum, successively affecting ventral striatal areas. Investigating
  carriers of the HD mutation with evident dorsal, but only minimal or no ventral
  striatal atrophy, we expected to find evidence for compensation of ventral striatal
  functioning. We investigated 14 pre- or early symptomatic carriers of the mutation
  leading to HD and 18 matched healthy controls. Participants underwent structural
  T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI during a reward task that
  probes ventral striatal functioning. Motor functioning and attention were assessed
  with reaction time (RT) tasks. Structural images confirmed a specific decrease of
  dorsal striatal but only marginal ventral striatal volume in HD relative to control
  subjects, paralleling prolonged RT in the motor response tasks. While behavioral
  performance in the reward task during fMRI scanning was unimpaired, reward-related
  fMRI signaling in the HD group was differentially enhanced in the bilateral ventral
  striatum and in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex/anterior insula, as another region
  sensitive to reward processing. We provide evidence for the concept of functional
  compensation in premanifest HD which may suggest a defense mechanism in neurodegeneration.
  Given the so far inevitable course of HD with its genetically determined endpoint,
  this disease may provide another model to study the different aspects of the concept
  of functional compensation. '
