input_text: "Huntington's disease in Turkey: genetic counseling, clinical features,
  and outcome.Objective: This study aims to report the data of genetic counseling
  and to identify the clinical features of Turkish Huntington's disease (HD) patients
  and to investigate its possible relationship with genetic data.Method: A regular
  weekly outpatient clinic has been held routinely since January 2018. Patients and
  their referred relatives have been evaluated regarding clinical features and genetic
  counseling. The database of our collaborative team was used for the study.Results:
  Total 141 individuals have been evaluated. Among 84 subjects genetic counseling
  was given, diagnosis of HD was confirmed genetically in 34 (42.0%) of individuals
  (25 were symptomatic-HD, 9 were presymptomatic-HD). Fifty-seven patients were previously
  diagnosed with HD. The mean age of onset was 42.4 (11.9) years. Chorea was mostly
  reported initial symptom. The mean CAG repeat number of the expanded allele was
  44.1 (5.1) and correlated inversely with the age of onset (p < 0.001). During a
  4.8 (3.1) year follow-up, 10% of the patients were deceased. At the last visit,
  over half of patients had all of the movement, behavioral and cognitive problems,
  and 41.6% of them had required 24-hr supervision appropriate (UHDRS-independence
  score 64.6 (24.4)). Paternal inheritance was related to higher CAG repeats, younger
  age of disease onset, and higher UHDRS-motor scores.Conclusion: HD in Turkey is
  a severe disabling disease affecting a younger adult population. Over half of patients
  had all of the movement, behavioral and cognitive problems. Genetic counseling gives
  the opportunity to diagnose subjects at the pre-symptomatic phase. A collaborative
  approach is rational in the management of HD."
