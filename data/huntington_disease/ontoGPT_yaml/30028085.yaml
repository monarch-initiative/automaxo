input_text: "Evidence of cardiac electrical remodeling in patients with Huntington
  disease. OBJECTIVE: Although Huntington's disease (HD) is a disease of the central
  nervous system, HD mortality surveys indicate heart disease as a major cause of
  death. Cardiac dysfunction in HD might be a primary consequence of peripherally
  expressed mutant huntingtin or secondary to either a general decline in health or
  the onset of neurological dysfunction. The aim of the study was to clarify the heart
  muscle involvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured conventional and advanced
  resting ECG indices. Thirty-one subjects with a confirmed huntingtin gene mutation
  and 31 age- and gender-matched controls were included. The HD subjects were divided
  into four groups based on their Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS)
  motor score. RESULTS: We detected changes in advanced ECG variables connected with
  electrical ventricular remodeling (t test, p < 0.01). The increase in the unexplained
  part of both QT variability and the standard deviation of normal-to-normal QT intervals,
  presumably reflecting beat-to-beat changes in repolarization, was most pronounced.
  Further, both variables correlated with the product of the cytosine-adenine-guanine
  (CAG) triplets' repeat length and the subjects' age (CAP), the former R = 0.423
  (p = 0.018) and the latter R = 0.499 (p = 0.004). There was no correlation between
  the CAP score and any of variables representing autonomic nervous system activity.
  CONCLUSIONS: Both autonomic nervous system dysfunction and cardiac electrical remodeling
  are present in patients with HD. The changes in advanced ECG variables observed
  in the study evolve with HD progression. The increased values of QT unexplained
  variability may be a marker of temporal inhomogeneity in ventricular repolarization
  associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias."
