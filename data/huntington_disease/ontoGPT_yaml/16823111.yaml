input_text: 'Cell and tissue engineering and clinical applications: an overview. Most
  human tissues do not regenerate spontaneously; this is why cell therapies and tissue
  engineering are promising alternatives. The principle is simple: cells are collected
  in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous
  support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical
  parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be
  implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field
  of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings
  up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent,
  but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential
  of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and
  it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating
  functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells
  from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability
  of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic.
  Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting
  cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune
  responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune
  response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient
  response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene
  therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged
  in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies,
  ..). A large number of clinical areas stand as candidates for clinical applications:
  leukaemia and cancers, cardiac insufficiency and vascular diseases, cartilage and
  bone repair, ligaments and tendons, liver diseases, ophthalmology, diabetes, neurological
  diseases (Parkinson, Huntington disease, ..), .. Various aspects of this new regenerative
  therapeutic medicine are developed in this work.'
