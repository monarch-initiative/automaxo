input_text: Implicit learning impairment identified via predictive saccades in Huntington's
  disease correlates with extended cortico-striatal atrophy. The ability to anticipate
  events and execute motor commands prior to a sensory event is an essential capability
  for human's everyday life. This implicitly learned anticipatory behavior depends
  on the past performance of repeated sensorimotor interactions timed with external
  cues. This kind of predictive behavior has been shown to be compromised in neurological
  disorders such as Huntington disease (HD), in which neural atrophy includes key
  cortical and basal ganglia regions. To investigate the neural basis of the anticipatory
  behavioral deficits in HD we used a predictive-saccade paradigm that requires predictive
  control to generate saccades in a metronomic temporal pattern. This is ideal because
  the integrity of the oculomotor network that includes the striatum and prefrontal,
  parietal, occipital and temporal cortices can be analyzed using structural MRI.
  Our results showed that the HD patients had severe predictive saccade deficits (i.e.,
  an inability to reduce saccade reaction time in predictive condition), which are
  accentuated in patients with more severe motor deterioration. Structural imaging
  analyses revealed that these anticipatory deficits correlated with grey-matter atrophy
  in frontal, parietal-occipital and striatal regions. These findings indicate that
  the predictive saccade control deficits in HD are related to an extended cortico-striatal
  atrophy. This suggests that eye movement measurement could be a reliable marker
  of the progression of cognitive deficits in HD.
