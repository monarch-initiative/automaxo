input_text: Robust Preimplantation Genetic Testing of Huntington Disease by Combined
  Triplet-Primed PCR Analysis of the HTT CAG Repeat and Multi-Microsatellite Haplotyping.
  Huntington disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion
  of a CAG repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease prevention can be facilitated
  by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed
  a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by
  combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and
  multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy
  was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical
  application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed
  all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus
  or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed
  as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh
  cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers.
  Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers
  and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term.
  This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed
  in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start
  of PGT-M.
