input_text: 'Prion-like proteins sequester and suppress the toxicity of huntingtin
  exon 1. Expansions of preexisting polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in at least nine
  different proteins cause devastating neurodegenerative diseases. There are many
  unique features to these pathologies, but there must also be unifying mechanisms
  underlying polyQ toxicity. Using a polyQ-expanded fragment of huntingtin exon-1
  (Htt103Q), the causal protein in Huntington disease, we and others have created
  tractable models for investigating polyQ toxicity in yeast cells. These models recapitulate
  key pathological features of human diseases and provide access to an unrivalled
  genetic toolbox. To identify toxicity modifiers, we performed an unbiased overexpression
  screen of virtually every protein encoded by the yeast genome. Surprisingly, there
  was no overlap between our modifiers and those from a conceptually identical screen
  reported recently, a discrepancy we attribute to an artifact of their overexpression
  plasmid. The suppressors of Htt103Q toxicity recovered in our screen were strongly
  enriched for glutamine- and asparagine-rich prion-like proteins. Separated from
  the rest of the protein, the prion-like sequences of these proteins were themselves
  potent suppressors of polyQ-expanded huntingtin exon-1 toxicity, in both yeast and
  human cells. Replacing the glutamines in these sequences with asparagines abolished
  suppression and converted them to enhancers of toxicity. Replacing asparagines with
  glutamines created stronger suppressors. The suppressors (but not the enhancers)
  coaggregated with Htt103Q, forming large foci at the insoluble protein deposit in
  which proteins were highly immobile. Cells possessing foci had fewer (if any) small
  diffusible oligomers of Htt103Q. Until such foci were lost, cells were protected
  from death. We discuss the therapeutic implications of these findings. '
