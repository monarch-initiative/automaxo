input_text: Putaminal Hypometabolism Exceeding Caudate Abnormalities on 18F-FDG PET
  in Huntington Disease. An F-FDG PET scan performed on a patient suspected of having
  early Huntington disease (HD) showed marked hypometabolism in bilateral putamen
  that was significantly worse than the hypometabolism in caudate. While HD could
  not be completely excluded, the scan finding was felt to be somewhat atypical for
  HD because of a lesser degree of caudate involvement. Genetic testing eventually
  confirmed the diagnosis of HD. This case shows that diagnosis of HD should still
  be considered even when putaminal hypometabolism exceeds caudate  changes on F-FDG
  PET imaging.
