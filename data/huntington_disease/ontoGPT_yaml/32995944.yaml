input_text: "Sigma-1 and dopamine D2/D3 receptor occupancy of pridopidine in healthy
  volunteers and patients with Huntington disease: a [18F] fluspidine and [18F] fallypride
  PET study.PURPOSE: Pridopidine is an investigational drug for Huntington disease
  (HD). Pridopidine was originally thought to act as a dopamine stabilizer. However,
  pridopidine shows highest affinity to the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) and enhances neuroprotection
  via the S1R in preclinical studies. Using [18F] fluspidine and [18F] fallypride
  PET, the purpose of this study was to assess in vivo target engagement/receptor
  occupancy of pridopidine to the S1R and dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) at clinical
  relevant doses in healthy volunteers (HVs) and as proof-of-concept in a small number
  of patients with HD. METHODS: Using [18F] fluspidine PET (300 MBq, 0-90 min), 11
  male HVs (pridopidine 0.5 to 90 mg; six dose groups) and three male patients with
  HD (pridopidine 90 mg) were investigated twice, without and 2 h after single dose
  of pridopidine. Using [18F] fallypride PET (200 MBq, 0-210 min), four male HVs were
  studied without and 2 h following pridopidine administration (90 mg). Receptor occupancy
  was analyzed by the Lassen plot. RESULTS: S1R occupancy as function of pridopidine
  dose (or plasma concentration) in HVs could be described by a three-parameter Hill
  equation with a Hill coefficient larger than one. A high degree of S1R occupancy
  (87% to 91%) was found throughout the brain at pridopidine doses ranging from 22.5
  to 90 mg. S1R occupancy was 43% at 1 mg pridopidine. In contrast, at 90 mg pridopidine,
  the D2/D3R occupancy was only minimal (~ 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our PET findings indicate
  that at clinically relevant single dose of 90 mg, pridopidine acts as a selective
  S1R ligand showing near to complete S1R occupancy with negligible occupancy of the
  D2/D3R. The dose S1R occupancy relationship suggests cooperative binding of pridopidine
  to the S1R. Our findings provide significant clarification about pridopidine's mechanism
  of action and support further use of the 45-mg twice-daily dose to achieve full
  and selective targeting of the S1R in future clinical trials of neurodegenerative
  disorders. Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT03019289 January 12, 2017; EUDRA-CT-Nr.
