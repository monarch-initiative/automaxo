  Disease: A PET Study.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Synaptic damage has been proposed
  to play a major role in the pathophysiology of Huntington disease (HD), but in vivo
  evidence in humans is lacking. We performed a PET imaging study to assess synaptic
  damage and its clinical correlates in early HD in vivo. METHODS: In this cross-sectional
  study, premanifest and early manifest (Shoulson-Fahn stage 1 and 2) HD mutation
  carriers and age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent clinical assessment
  of motor and nonmotor manifestations and time-of-flight PET with 11C-UCB-J, a radioligand
  targeting the ubiquitous presynaptic terminal marker synaptic vesicle protein 2A
  (SV2A). We also performed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET in all participants
  because regional cerebral glucose consumption is thought to largely reflect synaptic
  activity. Volumes of interest were delineated on the basis of individual 3-dimensional
  T1 MRI. Standardized uptake value ratio-1 images were calculated for 11C-UCB-J with
  the centrum semiovale as reference region. 18F-FDG-PET activity was normalized to
  the pons. All PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. Volume of interest-
  and voxel-based analyses were performed. Correlations between clinical scores and
  11C-UCB-J PET data were calculated. RESULTS: Eighteen HD mutation carriers (age
  51.4 +- 11.6 years; 6 female; 7 premanifest, 11 early manifest) and 15 healthy controls
  (age 52.3 +- 3.5 years; 4 female) were included. In the HD group, significant loss
  of SV2A binding was found in putamen, caudate, pallidum, cerebellum, parietal, and
  temporal and frontal cortex, whereas reduced 18F-FDG uptake was restricted to caudate
  and putamen. In the premanifest subgroup, 11C-UCB-J and 18F-FDG-PET showed significant
  reductions in putamen and caudate only. In the total HD group, SV2A loss in the
  putamen correlated with motor impairment. DISCUSSION: Our data reveal loss of presynaptic
  terminal integrity in early HD, which begins in the striatum in the premanifest
  phase, spreads extensively to extrastriatal regions in the early manifest phase,
  and correlates with motor impairment. 11C-UCB-J PET is more sensitive than 18F-FDG-PET
  for detection of extrastriatal changes in early HD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE:
  This study provides Class III evidence that 11C-UCB-J PET accurately discriminates
  individuals HD from normal controls.'
