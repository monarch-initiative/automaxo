input_text: "Heart Rate Variability in Huntington Disease: A Long-Term Longitudinal
  Study.INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to follow tonic and phasic autonomic
  nervous activity in Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers and patients. METHODS:
  Evaluation of motor functions and total functional capacity was performed in 30
  HD mutation carriers or patients at the beginning and in 22 subjects after 8-10
  years. Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were
  measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group
  of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted
  in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so
  (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early
  symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At
  the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean
  arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and
  EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min)
  than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was
  also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at
  the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136
  vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated
  from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +-
  433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational
  study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress.
  There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD
  subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of
  an outbreak of clinical disease phase."
