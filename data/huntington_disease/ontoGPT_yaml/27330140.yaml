input_text: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in early Huntington's disease. Huntington's
  disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by motor dysfunction
  with involuntary movements and loss of voluntary control, cognitive deterioration
  and psychiatric problems. We report a 51-year-old man with early HD who experienced
  stereotyped episodes of repetitive, purposeless complex movements and unresponsiveness.
  His neurological examination was compatible with HD as were all investigations.
  We diagnosed psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. While seizures are common in juvenile-onset
  HD, they are no more prevalent in adult-onset HD than in the general population.
  However, neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in HD and can involve a number of
  different complaints. Patients may experience dissociative attacks soon after manifesting
  a HD diagnosis. Such episodes can be managed with patient and carer education, cognitive
  behavioural therapy and anxiolytic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
