input_text: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation not beneficial in severe
  choreiform movements of Huntington disease. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
  (rTMS) has been used therapeutically for reducing choreiform movements in patients
  with Huntington disease. There have been case studies reporting improvement in choreiform
  movements with administration of low-frequency rTMS lasting for a brief period.
  We report a case series where application of 7 consecutive sessions of bilateral
  low-frequency rTMS over the scalp area corresponding to supplementary motor area
  in patients with severe Huntington chorea did not reduce the intensity of choreiform
  movements even transiently. Hence, the proposed role of rTMS in reducing intensity
  of choreiform movements by altering neuronal plasticity may not hold true in severe
  cases.
