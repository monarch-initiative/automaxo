input_text: 'Neurodegeneration and the Cerebellum. BACKGROUND: The cerebellum modulates
  diverse neuronal networks, regulating motor, cognitive, behavioral, and limbic circuits.
  Structural and functional changes to the cerebellum that occur with neurodegenerative
  conditions have not been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: We synthesize the current
  understanding of cerebellar somatotopy and function with previously described cerebellar
  changes in neurodegenerative diseases not associated with primary cerebellar pathology.
  METHODS: A thorough literature review defines the role of the cerebellum in normal
  function and neurodegeneration, and we additionally provide exemplar cases of cerebellar
  dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. RESULTS: Comparisons between normal
  function and neurodegenerative disease states emphasize how normal organization
  of the cerebellum is altered in neurodegenerative disease states. We illustrate
  key anatomic structures using novel cerebellar segmentation tools and images. CONCLUSIONS:
  Altered cerebellum in neurodegeneration can provide important diagnostic and pathologic
  insights into both predicting disease progression and network dysfunction.'
