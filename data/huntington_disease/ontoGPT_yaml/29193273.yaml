input_text: Activation of caspase-6 and cleavage of caspase-6 substrates is an early
  event in NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity, due to overstimulation
  of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), has a pivotal role in many neurological
  disorders. However, NMDAR antagonists often cause side effects, and identifying
  more druggable therapeutic targets for NMDAR excitotoxicity is an important goal.
  Activation of caspases is a downstream effect of excitotoxicity that may be critically
  involved in NMDAR-mediated cell death. Caspase-6 (casp6) in particular has been
  shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke, Huntington disease, and
  Alzheimer disease. Using N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic injuries
  of primary rat neurons, we demonstrate that there is an early increase in caspase
  profiles after an excitotoxic event at the level of mRNA, protein, and activity.
  Casp6 is elevated and activated first, followed by caspase-8 and caspase-3. Similarly,
  known casp6 substrates huntingtin, as well as novel casp6 substrates serine/threonine
  kinase 3 and death domain-associated protein, are cleaved in similar temporal patterns
  post NMDA. On the basis of these data, we propose that casp6 may be an initiator
  caspase in apoptotic cascades leading to neuronal death after an excitotoxic event
  and suggest casp6 as a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders where
  NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity has been shown to play a role.
