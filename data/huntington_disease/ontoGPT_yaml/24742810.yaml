input_text: 'Quantitative 7T phase imaging in premanifest Huntington disease. BACKGROUND
  AND PURPOSE: In vivo MR imaging and postmortem neuropathologic studies have demonstrated
  elevated iron concentration and atrophy within the striatum of patients with Huntington
  disease, implicating neuronal loss and iron accumulation in the pathogenesis of
  this neurodegenerative disorder. We used 7T MR imaging to determine whether quantitative
  phase, a measurement that reflects both iron content and tissue microstructure,
  is altered in subjects with premanifest Huntington disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  Local field shift, calculated from 7T MR phase images, was quantified in 13 subjects
  with premanifest Huntington disease and 13 age- and sex-matched controls. All participants
  underwent 3T and 7T MR imaging, including volumetric T1 and 7T gradient recalled-echo
  sequences. Local field shift maps were created from 7T phase data and registered
  to caudate ROIs automatically parcellated from the 3T T1 images. Huntington disease-specific
  disease burden and neurocognitive and motor evaluations were also performed and
  compared with local field shift. RESULTS: Subjects with premanifest Huntington disease
  had smaller caudate volume and higher local field shift than controls. A significant
  correlation between these measurements was not detected, and prediction accuracy
  for disease state improved with inclusion of both variables. A positive correlation
  between local field shift and genetic disease burden was also found, and there was
  a trend toward significant correlations between local field shift and neurocognitive
  tests of working memory and executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with premanifest
  Huntington disease exhibit differences in 7T MR imaging phase within the caudate
  nuclei that correlate with genetic disease burden and trend with neurocognitive
  assessments. Ultra-high-field MR imaging of quantitative phase may be a useful approach
  for monitoring neurodegeneration in premanifest Huntington disease.'
