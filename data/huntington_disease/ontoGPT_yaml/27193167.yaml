input_text: 'Oxygen consumption deficit in Huntington disease mouse brain under metabolic
  stress. In vivo evidence for brain mitochondrial dysfunction in animal models of
  Huntington disease (HD) is scarce. We applied the novel 17O magnetic resonance spectroscopy
  (MRS) technique on R6/2 mice to directly determine rates of oxygen consumption (CMRO2)
  and assess mitochondrial function in vivo Basal respiration and maximal CMRO2 in
  the presence of the mitochondrial uncoupler dinitrophenol (DNP) were compared using
  16.4 T in isoflurane anesthetized wild type (WT) and HD mice at 9 weeks. At rest,
  striatal CMRO2 of R6/2 mice was equivalent to that of WT, indicating comparable
  mitochondrial output despite onset of motor symptoms in R6/2. After DNP injection,
  the maximal CMRO2 in both striatum and cortex of R6/2 mice was significantly lower
  than that of WT, indicating less spare energy generating capacity. In a separate
  set of mice, oligomycin injection to block ATP generation decreased CMRO2 equally
  in brains of R6/2 and WT mice, suggesting oxidative phosphorylation capacity and
  respiratory coupling were equivalent at rest. Expression levels of representative
  mitochondrial proteins were compared from harvested tissue samples. Significant
  differences between R6/2 and WT included: in striatum, lower VDAC and the mitochondrially
  encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit I relative to actin; in cortex, lower tricarboxylic
  acid cycle enzyme aconitase and higher protein carbonyls; in both, lower glycolytic
  enzyme enolase. Therefore in R6/2 striatum, lowered CMRO2 may be attributed to a
  decrease in mitochondria while the cortical CMRO2 decrease may result from constraints
  upstream in energetic pathways, suggesting regionally specific changes and possibly
  rates of metabolic impairment.'
