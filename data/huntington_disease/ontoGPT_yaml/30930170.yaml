input_text: Metabolic Reprogramming in Astrocytes Distinguishes Region-Specific Neuronal
  Susceptibility in Huntington Mice. The basis for region-specific neuronal toxicity
  in Huntington disease is unknown. Here, we show that region-specific neuronal vulnerability
  is a substrate-driven response in astrocytes. Glucose is low in HdhQ(150/150) animals,
  and astrocytes in each brain region adapt by metabolically reprogramming their mitochondria
  to use endogenous, non-glycolytic metabolites as an alternative fuel. Each region
  is characterized by distinct metabolic pools, and astrocytes adapt accordingly.
  The vulnerable striatum is enriched in fatty acids, and mitochondria reprogram by
  oxidizing them as an energy source but at the cost of escalating reactive oxygen
  species (ROS)-induced damage. The cerebellum is replete with amino acids, which
  are precursors for glucose regeneration through the pentose phosphate shunt or gluconeogenesis
  pathways. ROS is not elevated, and this region sustains little damage. While mhtt
  expression imposes disease stress throughout the brain, sensitivity or resistance
  arises from an adaptive stress response, which is inherently region specific. Metabolic
  reprogramming may have relevance to other diseases.
