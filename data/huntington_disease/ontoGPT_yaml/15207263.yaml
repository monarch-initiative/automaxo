input_text: Proactive transplantation of human neural stem cells prevents degeneration
  of striatal neurons in a rat model of Huntington disease. We have investigated the
  effectiveness of transplantation of human neural stem cells into adult rat striatum
  prior to induction of striatal damage with the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic
  acid (3-NP). Systemic 3-NP administration caused widespread neuropathological deficits
  similar to ones found in Huntington disease (HD) including impairment in motor function
  (rotarod balance test) and extensive degeneration of neuron-specific nuclear antigen
  (NeuN)(+) neurons, calbindin(+) neurons and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)(+)
  striatal neurons. Animals receiving intrastriatal implantation of human neural stem
  cells (hNSCs) 1 week before 3-NP treatments exhibited significantly improved motor
  performance and reduced damage to striatal neurons compared with control sham injections.
  In contrast, transplantation of hNSCs at 12 h after the initial 3-NP administration
  did not lead to any improvement in motor performance or protect striatal neurons
  from the 3-NP-induced toxicity. These results indicate that the presence of grafted
  hNSCs before 3-NP treatment is required for host striatal neuronal protection and
  enhanced motor function. Immunoreactivity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
  was found in vitro in cultured hNSCs and in vivo in grafted NSCs with expression
  and secretion of BDNF demonstrated by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, dot-blot, and
  ELISA analyses. Thus, protective effects of proactive transplantation of hNSCs may
  be due, in part, to effects mediated by BDNF. The findings in this work have particular
  relevance to a rat model of HD in that proactive transplanted hNSCs protect host
  striatal neurons against neuronal injury and improve motor impairment induced by
  3-NP toxicity.
