input_text: 'Effect of Deutetrabenazine on Chorea Among Patients With Huntington Disease:
  A Randomized Clinical Trial. IMPORTANCE: Deutetrabenazine is a novel molecule containing
  deuterium, which attenuates CYP2D6 metabolism and increases active metabolite half-lives
  and may therefore lead to stable systemic exposure while preserving key pharmacological
  activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine treatment
  to control chorea associated with Huntington disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
  Ninety ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest Huntington disease and a baseline
  total maximal chorea score of 8 or higher (range, 0-28; lower score indicates less
  chorea) were enrolled from August 2013 to August 2014 and randomized to receive
  deutetrabenazine (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45) in a double-blind fashion at 34 Huntington
  Study Group sites. INTERVENTIONS: Deutetrabenazine or placebo was titrated to optimal
  dose level over 8 weeks and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout.
  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was the total maximal chorea score
  change from baseline (the average of values from the screening and day-0 visits)
  to maintenance therapy (the average of values from the week 9 and 12 visits) obtained
  by in-person visits. This study was designed to detect a 2.7-unit treatment difference
  in scores. The secondary end points, assessed hierarchically, were the proportion
  of patients who achieved treatment success on the Patient Global Impression of Change
  (PGIC) and on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the change in 36-Item
  Short Form- physical functioning subscale score (SF-36), and the change in the Berg
  Balance Test. RESULTS: Ninety patients with Huntington disease (mean age, 53.7 years;
  40 women [44.4%]) were enrolled. In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean total maximal
  chorea scores improved from 12.1 (95% CI, 11.2-12.9) to 7.7 (95% CI, 6.5-8.9), whereas
  in the placebo group, scores improved from 13.2 (95% CI, 12.2-14.3) to 11.3 (95%
  CI, 10.0-12.5); the mean between-group difference was -2.5 units (95% CI, -3.7 to
  -1.3) (P < .001). Treatment success, as measured by the PGIC, occurred in 23 patients
  (51%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 9 (20%) in the placebo group (P = .002).
  As measured by the CGIC, treatment success occurred in 19 patients (42%) in the
  deutetrabenazine group vs 6 (13%) in the placebo group (P = .002). In the deutetrabenazine
  group, the mean SF-36 physical functioning subscale scores decreased from 47.5 (95%
  CI, 44.3-50.8) to 47.4 (44.3-50.5), whereas in the placebo group, scores decreased
  from 43.2 (95% CI, 40.2-46.3) to 39.9 (95% CI, 36.2-43.6), for a treatment benefit
  of 4.3 (95% CI, 0.4 to 8.3) (P = .03). There was no difference between groups (mean
  difference of 1.0 unit; 95% CI, -0.3 to 2.3; P = .14), for improvement in the Berg
  Balance Test, which improved by 2.2 units (95% CI, 1.3-3.1) in the deutetrabenazine
  group and by 1.3 units (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) in the placebo group. Adverse event rates
  were similar for deutetrabenazine and placebo, including depression, anxiety, and
  akathisia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with chorea associated with
  Huntington disease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in
  improved motor signs at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the clinical
  importance of the effect size and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety.
