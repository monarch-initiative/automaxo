input_text: 'Recent advances in the therapeutic development for Huntington disease.
  INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition.
  The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development
  of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative
  conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with
  a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review
  on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and
  clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification
  or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions
  were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include
  huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation.
  Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA
  of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides
  (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial
  results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with
  a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials
  for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays
  to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational
  development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored
  in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS:
  The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core
  disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected
  to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.'
