input_text: Early white matter pathology in the fornix of the limbic system in Huntington
  disease.Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by
  an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The typical motor symptoms
  have been associated with basal ganglia pathology. However, psychiatric and cognitive
  symptoms often precede the motor component and may be due to changes in the limbic
  system. Recent work has indicated pathology in the hypothalamus in HD but other
  parts of the limbic system have not been extensively studied. Emerging evidence
  suggests that changes in HD also include white matter pathology. Here we investigated
  if the main white matter tract of the limbic system, the fornix, is affected in
  HD. We demonstrate that the fornix is 34% smaller already in prodromal HD and 41%
  smaller in manifest HD compared to controls using volumetric analyses of MRI of
  the IMAGE-HD study. In post-mortem fornix tissue from HD cases, we confirm the smaller
  fornix volume in HD which is accompanied by signs of myelin breakdown and reduced
  levels of the transcription factor myelin regulating factor but detect no loss of
  oligodendrocytes. Further analyses using RNA-sequencing demonstrate downregulation
  of oligodendrocyte identity markers in the fornix of HD cases. Analysis of differentially
  expressed genes based on transcription-factor/target-gene interactions also revealed
  enrichment for binding sites of SUZ12 and EZH2, components of the Polycomb Repressive
  Complex 2, as well as RE1 Regulation Transcription Factor. Taken together, our data
  show that there is early white matter pathology of the fornix in the limbic system
  in HD likely due to a combination of reduction in oligodendrocyte genes and myelin
  break down.
