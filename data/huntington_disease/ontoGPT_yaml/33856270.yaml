input_text: "Naringenin mitigates behavioral alterations and provides neuroprotection
  against 3-nitropropinoic acid-induced Huntington's disease like symptoms in rats.BACKGROUND:
  Naringenin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory flavonoid which has been
  widely used as a therapeutic agent in various toxic models. However, few studies
  have clearly discussed the neuromodulatory effects of naringenin against different
  neurodegenerative disorders. AIM: We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of
  naringenin against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurobehavioral, biochemical
  and histopathological alterations in rats. METHODS: Albino Wistar rats were randomly
  divided into three experimental groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered group,
  received saline. Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 4 consecutive
  days. Group 3 received naringenin (50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) twice daily for a
  period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP administration. On the 5th
  day, neurobehavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes
  and the striatum tissue was used for analysis of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity
  and serotonin (5-HT) levels. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by
  glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. RESULTS: Our results showed
  that naringenin co-treatment provides neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced neurological
  disorders. Naringenin also increased the MAO activity and 5-HT levels in the striatum.
  Moreover, co-treatment with naringenin reduced the expression of GFAP protein in
  the striatal part and significantly attenuated the neuronal cell death. The findings
  of the present study suggest that naringenin provides neuroprotection and mitigates
  neurobehavioral alterations in experimental rats. CONCLUSION: The results show that
  co-treatment with naringenin ameliorates 3-NP-induced HD-like symptoms in rats."
