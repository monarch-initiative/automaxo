input_text: "Naringenin mitigates behavioral alterations and provides neuroprotection
  against 3-nitropropinoic acid-induced Huntington's disease like symptoms in rats.
  BACKGROUND: Naringenin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory flavonoid
  which has been widely used as a therapeutic agent in various toxic models. However,
  few studies have clearly discussed the neuromodulatory effects of naringenin against
  different neurodegenerative disorders. AIM: We investigated the neuroprotective
  efficacy of naringenin against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurobehavioral,
  biochemical and histopathological alterations in rats. METHODS: Albino Wistar rats
  were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered
  group, received saline. Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 4
  consecutive days. Group 3 received naringenin (50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) twice
  daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP administration.
  On the 5th day, neurobehavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral
  outcomes and the striatum tissue was used for analysis of the monoamine oxidase
  (MAO) activity and serotonin (5-HT) levels. In addition, astrocytes activation was
  observed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. RESULTS: Our
  results showed that naringenin co-treatment provides neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced
  neurological disorders. Naringenin also increased the MAO activity and 5-HT levels
  in the striatum. Moreover, co-treatment with naringenin reduced the expression of
  GFAP protein in the striatal part and significantly attenuated the neuronal cell
  death. The findings of the present study suggest that naringenin provides neuroprotection
  and mitigates neurobehavioral alterations in experimental rats. CONCLUSION: The
  results show that co-treatment with naringenin ameliorates 3-NP-induced HD-like
  symptoms in rats."
