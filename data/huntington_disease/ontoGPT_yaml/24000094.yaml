input_text: "Relationship of Mediterranean diet and caloric intake to phenoconversion
  in Huntington disease. IMPORTANCE: Adherence to Mediterranean-type diet (MeDi) may
  delay onset of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Whether adherence to MeDi affects
  time to phenoconversion in Huntington disease (HD), a highly penetrant, single-gene
  disorder, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine if MeDi modifies the time to clinical
  onset of HD (phenoconversion) in premanifest carriers participating in Prospective
  Huntington at Risk Observational Study (PHAROS), and to examine the effects of body
  mass index and caloric intake on time to phenoconversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
  A prospective cohort study of 41 Huntington study group sites in the United States
  and Canada involving 1001 participants enrolled in PHAROS between July 1999 and
  January 2004 who were followed up every 9 months until 2010. A total of 211 participants
  aged 26 to 57 years had an expanded CAG repeat length (>= 37). EXPOSURE: A semiquantitative
  food frequency questionnaire was administered 33 months after baseline. We calculated
  daily gram intake for dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, monounsaturated
  and saturated fatty acids, and alcohol and constructed MeDi scores (0-9); higher
  scores indicate higher adherence. Demographics, medical history, body mass index,
  and Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score were collected. MAIN
  OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine the
  association of MeDi and phenoconversion. RESULTS Age, sex, caloric intake, education
  status, and UHDRS motor scores did not differ among MeDi tertiles (0-3, 4-5, and
  6-9). The highest body mass index was associated with the lowest adherence to MeDi.
  Thirty-one participants phenoconverted. In a model adjusted for age, CAG repeat
  length, and caloric intake, MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion (P for
  trend = 0.14 for tertile of MeDi, and P = .22 for continuous MeDi). When individual
  components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio, 2.36;
  95% CI, 1.0-5.57; P = .05) and higher caloric intake (P = .04) were associated with
  risk of phenoconversion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MeDi was not associated with
  phenoconversion; however, higher consumption of dairy products had a 2-fold increased
  risk and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression
  in manifest HD). Studies of diet and energy expenditure in premanifest HD may provide
  data for interventions to modify specific components of diet that may delay the
  onset of HD."
