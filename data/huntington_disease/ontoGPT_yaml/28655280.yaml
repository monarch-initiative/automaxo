input_text: "Factors Associated With End-of-Life Planning in Huntington Disease. OBJECTIVE:
  Knowledge of one's gene status for adult onset conditions provides opportunity to
  make advance end-of-life (EOL) plans. The purposes of these analyses were to (1)
  determine the prevalence of EOL plans, including advance directives (ADs) among
  persons across 3 stages of Huntington disease (HD) and (2) examine factors associated
  with having ADs in this sample. METHODS: Data are from 503 participants in the HD
  Quality of Life study. Participants completed an online health-related quality-of-life
  survey that included questions regarding EOL planning and self-reported HD symptoms.
  Frequencies were calculated for EOL planning by the HD stage. Bivariate analysis
  and logistic regression were used to identify variables associated with having ADs.
  RESULTS: A total of 38.2% of participants stated they had ADs and fewer than half
  had other EOL plans. Being older, increased HD stage, more years of education, lower
  anxiety, more swallowing symptoms, and higher meaning and purpose were associated
  with having ADs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ADs in our sample is comparable to
  the general US population, but surprisingly low, considering the severity and long
  disease course of HD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health-care providers should develop
  specific interventions early in the disease process to increase ADs in this population."
