input_text: 'A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of latrepirdine
  in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. BACKGROUND Latrepirdine is
  an orally administered experimental small molecule that was initially developed
  as an antihistamine and subsequently was shown to stabilize mitochondrial membranes
  and function, which might be impaired in Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE To determine
  the effect of latrepirdine on cognition and global function in patients with mild
  to moderate Huntington disease. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
  study. SETTING Sixty-four research centers in Australia, Europe, and North America.
  PATIENTS Four hundred three patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and
  baseline cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10-26). INTERVENTION
  Latrepirdine (20 mg) vs matching placebo administered orally 3 times daily for 26
  weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary outcome measures were cognition as measured
  by the change in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to week 26 and
  global function at week 26 as measured by the Clinician Interview-Based Impression
  of Change, plus carer interview, which ranges from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked
  worsening). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included behavior, daily function,
  motor function, and safety. RESULTS The mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination
  score among participants randomized to latrepirdine (1.5-point improvement) did
  not differ significantly from that among participants randomized to placebo (1.3-point
  improvement) (P=.39). Similarly, the distribution of the Clinician Interview-Based
  Impression of Change, plus carer interview did not differ significantly among those
  randomized to latrepirdine compared with placebo (P=.84). No significant treatment
  effects were detected on the secondary efficacy outcome measures. The incidence
  of adverse events was similar between those randomized to latrepirdine (68.5%) and
  placebo (68.0%). CONCLUSION In patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease
  and cognitive impairment, treatment with latrepirdine for 6 months was safe and
  well tolerated but did not improve cognition or global function relative to placebo.
