input_text: "Agreement between clinician-rated versus patient-reported outcomes in
  Huntington disease. BACKGROUND: Clinician-rated measures of functioning are often
  used as primary endpoints in clinical trials and other behavioral research in Huntington
  disease. As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible,
  there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated
  measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM:
  The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report
  and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington
  disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease
  were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence
  Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed
  by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington
  disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis
  of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement
  coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement
  between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional
  capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those
  with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease
  reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although
  self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures,
  differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are
  provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported
  administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related
  assessments are not feasible."
