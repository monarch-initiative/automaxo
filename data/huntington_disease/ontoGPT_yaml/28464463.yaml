input_text: 'Resting-state connectivity and modulated somatomotor and default-mode
  networks in Huntington disease. AIMS: To analyze brain functional connectivity in
  the somatomotor and default-mode networks (DMNs) of patients with Huntington disease
  (HD), its relationship with gray matter (GM) volume loss, and functional changes
  after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: Ten patients and ten untreated controls underwent
  T1-weighted imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);
  four patients were also assessed after 3 months of pridopidine treatment (90 mg/d).
  The seed-based functional connectivity patterns from the posterior cingulate cortex
  and the supplementary motor area (SMA), considered cortical hubs of the DMN and
  somatomotor networks, respectively, were computed. FMRIB Software Library voxel-based
  morphometry measured GM volume. RESULTS: Patients had GM volume decrease in all
  cortical and subcortical areas of the somatomotor network with preservation of the
  SMA, and increased somatomotor and DMN connectivity. In DMN structures, functional
  connectivity impairment preceded volume loss. Pridopidine reduced the intensity
  of these aberrant connections. CONCLUSION: The abnormal connectivity of the somatomotor
  and DMN observed in HD patients may represent an early dysfunction marker, as it
  preceded volume loss in DMN. Pridopidine reduced connectivity of these networks
  in all four treated patients, suggesting that connectivity is sensitive to treatment
  response.'
