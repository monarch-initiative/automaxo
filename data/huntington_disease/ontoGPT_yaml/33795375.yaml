input_text: 'Microglia Activation in Basal Ganglia Is a Late Event in Huntington Disease
  Pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To define the role played by microglia in different
  stages of Huntington disease (HD), we used the TSPO radioligand [11C]-ER176 and
  PET to evaluate microglial activation in relation to neurodegeneration and in relation
  to the clinical features seen at premanifest and manifest stages of the disease.
  METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study in which 18 subjects (6 controls, 6 premanifest,
  and 6 manifest HD gene carriers) underwent a [11C]-ER176 PET scan and an MRI for
  anatomic localization. Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) was performed,
  and group differences in [11C]-ER176 binding (used to evaluate the extent of microglial
  activation) were assessed by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Microglial
  activation was correlated with ROIs volumes, disease burden, and the scores obtained
  in the clinical scales. As an exploratory aim, we evaluated the dynamic functions
  of microglia in vitro, by using induced microglia-like (iMG) cells from peripheral
  blood monocytes. RESULTS: Individuals with manifest HD present higher [11C]-ER176
  SUVR in both globi pallidi and putamina in comparison with controls. No differences
  were observed when we compared premanifest HD with controls or with manifest HD.
  We also found a significant correlation between increased microglial activation
  and cumulative disease burden, and with reduced volumes. iMG from controls, premanifest
  HD, and manifest HD patients showed similar phagocytic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether,
  our data demonstrate that microglial activation is involved in HD pathophysiology
  and is associated with disease progression.'
