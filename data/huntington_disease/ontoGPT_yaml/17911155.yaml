input_text: 'Polyglutamine diseases: emerging concepts in pathogenesis and therapy.
  Polyglutamine diseases are a family of neurodegenerative conditions that each derive
  from a CAG triplet repeat expansion in a specific gene. This produces a pathogenic
  protein that contains a critically expanded tract of glutamines. These prototypical
  protein misfolding disorders include Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy,
  dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and several spinocerebellar ataxias. This article
  reviews the emerging concepts in pathogenesis and therapy. Key ideas include the
  role of proteolytic cleavage, the importance of conformational change in the pathogenic
  proteins, the role of protein aggregation and the importance of transcriptional
  and metabolic disturbances. The relative role of functional perturbation in a target
  protein induced by a polyglutamine expansion is also discussed. Therapeutic strategies
  include counteracting cellular perturbations and direct targeting of polyglutamine
  protein expression, cleavage or conformation.'
