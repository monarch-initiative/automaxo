input_text: Dose-Dependent Lowering of Mutant Huntingtin Using Antisense Oligonucleotides
  in Huntington Disease Patients. On December 11 of 2017, Ionis Pharmaceuticals published
  a press release announcing dose-dependent reductions of mutant huntingtin protein
  in their HTTRx Phase 1/2a study in Huntington disease (HD) patients. The results
  from this Ionis trial have gained much attention from the patient community and
  the oligonucleotide therapeutics field, since it is the first trial targeting the
  cause of HD, namely the mutant huntingtin protein, using antisense oligonucleotides
  (ASOs). The press release also states that the primary endpoints of the study (safety
  and tolerability) were met, but does not contain data. This news follows the approval
  of another therapeutic ASO nusinersen (trade name Spinraza) for a neurological disease,
  spinal muscular atrophy, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines
  Agency, in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Combined, this offers hope for the development
  of the HTTRx therapy for HD patients.
