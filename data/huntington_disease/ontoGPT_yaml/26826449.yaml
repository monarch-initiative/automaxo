input_text: 'Use of human stem cells in Huntington disease modeling and translational
  research. Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused
  by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT)
  protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and
  progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because
  HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis
  should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem
  cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients
  and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate
  functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have
  been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes
  to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also
  provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors
  differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype.
  Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural
  tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though
  shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular
  HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also
  describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific
  stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem
  cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. '
