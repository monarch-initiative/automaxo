input_text: 'Anesthetic management of patients with Huntington disease. BACKGROUND:
  Huntington disease (HD) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with symptoms of chorea,
  dystonia, incoordination, cognitive decline, and behavioral difficulties. Abnormal
  responses to anesthesia have been reported in case reports and raised concerns regarding
  the safety of anesthesia in this patient population. METHODS: We performed a computerized
  search of the Mayo Clinic medical records database searching for patients with HD
  who underwent general anesthesia. Medical records were reviewed for anesthetic technique,
  medications used, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: We identified 11 patients
  with genetically confirmed HD who underwent 17 general anesthetics. Psychiatric
  medication use was common, with 6 patients using antipsychotics, 7 patients using
  antidepressants, and 3 patients using benzodiazepines. Succinylcholine was used
  in 7 anesthetics, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs in 11 anesthetics,
  all without adverse effects. Patients had normal responses to induction and maintenance
  of anesthesia without adverse effects. Serious postoperative complications did not
  occur. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous case reports, we found that patients with
  HD have normal responses to general anesthesia. However, the anesthesiologist should
  be aware of interactions between anesthetics and psychiatric medications frequently
  used by these patients. Measures should also be taken to minimize the risk of pulmonary
  aspiration because bulbar dysfunction may be a manifestation of this disease.'
