input_text: 'Substance abuse may hasten motor onset of Huntington disease: Evaluating
  the Enroll-HD database. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between substances
  of abuse and age at motor onset (AMO) in patients with Huntington disease (HD) in
  a large and diverse patient population. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational
  study of the Enroll-HD database. Participants were determined to belong to 1 of
  3 substance abuse groups: (1) tobacco abusers, (2) alcohol abusers, and (3) drug
  abusers. A group of participants who had never abused substances served as a control
  group. The average AMO of patients in the substance abuse groups was compared to
  the control group. The number of CAG repeats was used as a covariate in all analyses.
  RESULTS: The average difference in AMOs of participants in the tobacco (n = 566),
  alcohol (n = 374), and drug abuse groups (n = 217) compared to the control group
  (n = 692) were 2.3 (F1, 1,258 = 33.8, p < 0.0001), 1.0 (F1, 1,066 = 4.2, p = 0.04),
  and 3.3 (F1, 909 = 29.7, p < 0.0001) years earlier, respectively. In all substance
  abuse groups, the AMO was lowered to a greater degree in female participants than
  it was in male participants. CONCLUSIONS: Substances of abuse have a strong effect
  on the AMO in patients with HD. These effects seem to be amplified in women with
  HD compared to men. These results may provide a safe intervention capable of adding
  disease-free years to patients with HD.'
