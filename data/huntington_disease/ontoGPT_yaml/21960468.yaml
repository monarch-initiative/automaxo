input_text: "Adherence to use of a home-based exercise DVD in people with Huntington
  disease: participants' perspectives. BACKGROUND: Individualized exercise instruction
  on a regular basis may be desirable for people with Huntington disease (HD). Sustained
  interventions, however, may not be the most feasible for lifelong disease management.
  It is critical, therefore, for physical therapists to find ways to facilitate engagement
  in independent exercise programs. The capabilities of DVD technology can make the
  DVD a useful format to facilitate engagement for people with HD who have motivational
  and cognitive problems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore how
  people with HD used a home-based exercise DVD and how it was perceived by the participants
  and their caregivers. DESIGN: An exploratory, mixed-method design was used in this
  study. METHODS: Fifteen participants with HD were provided with an exercise DVD,
  developed by the authors, to support their engagement in a home-based exercise program.
  Exercise diaries were used to record adherence rates. Semistructured interviews
  were conducted to explore what factors affected the usability of the DVD. Conversations
  were audio recorded and fully transcribed. Content analysis approach was used to
  analyze the interviews. RESULTS: Most of the participants (11/15, 73.3%) adhered
  well to the use of the DVD. Participants felt that the exercises were suitable.
  Commitment of the caregiver as a key to the success of the program was the main
  theme that emerged from the data. Participants identified barriers and facilitators
  that affected adherence to using the exercise DVD and described management strategies
  that helped promote adherence to the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: The DVD was
  perceived to be suitable and supportive. The DVD could be appropriate for use in
  supporting people with HD to engage in exercise at home, either outside of therapy
  sessions or upon completion of a therapy program."
