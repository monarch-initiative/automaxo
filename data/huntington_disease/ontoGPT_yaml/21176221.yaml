input_text: 'Differential fate and functional outcome of lithium chloride primed adult
  neural progenitor cell transplants in a rat model of Huntington disease. INTRODUCTION:
  The ability to predetermine the fate of transplanted neural progenitor cells (NPCs)
  and specifically to direct their maturation has the potential to enhance the efficiency
  of cell-transplantation therapy for neurodegenerative disease. We previously demonstrated
  that transient exposure of subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived adult NPCs to lithium
  chloride during in vitro proliferation alters differential fate in vitro and increases
  the proportion of cells expressing neuronal markers while reducing glial progeny.
  To extend these findings, we examined whether in vitro priming of adult SVZ-derived
  NPCs with lithium chloride before transplantation into the quinolinic acid (QA)
  lesion rat model of Huntington disease altered in vivo neuronal differentiation
  and sensorimotor function compared with nonprimed NPC transplants. METHODS: NPCs
  were isolated from the SVZ of the adult rat brain and cultured for 2 weeks. Four
  days before transplantation into the QA-lesioned rat striatum, the cells were labeled
  with BrdU and primed with lithium chloride. The rats underwent regular evaluation
  of forelimb use and sensorimotor neglect to establish functional effects of NPC
  transplantation. Twelve weeks after transplantation, the brains were analyzed with
  immunohistochemistry to compare the differential fate of primed and nonprimed NPCs.
  RESULTS: We observed that in vitro priming of adult NPCs with lithium chloride reduced
  gliogenesis and enhanced the occurrence of DARPP-32-positive neurons when compared
  with nonprimed cells 12 weeks after transplantation into the QA-lesioned striatum.
  Lithium chloride priming also augmented the formation of efferent projections from
  newly formed neurons in the damaged host striatum to the globus pallidus. This was
  associated with acceleration of sensorimotor function recovery in rats receiving
  transplants of lithium chloride-primed adult NPCs compared with nonprimed transplants.
  CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings indicate that in vitro priming of adult NPCs
  with lithium chloride may augment transplant efficiency and accelerate sensorimotor
  function outcome in vivo.'
