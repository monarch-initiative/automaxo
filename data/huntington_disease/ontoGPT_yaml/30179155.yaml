input_text: Metformin reverses early cortical network dysfunction and behavior changes
  in Huntington's disease. Catching primal functional changes in early, 'very far
  from disease onset' (VFDO) stages of Huntington's disease is likely to be the key
  to a successful therapy. Focusing on VFDO stages, we assessed neuronal microcircuits
  in premanifest Hdh150 knock-in mice. Employing in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging,
  we revealed an early pattern of circuit dysregulation in the visual cortex - one
  of the first regions affected in premanifest Huntington's disease - characterized
  by an increase in activity, an enhanced synchronicity and hyperactive neurons. These
  findings are accompanied by aberrations in animal behavior. We furthermore show
  that the antidiabetic drug metformin diminishes aberrant Huntingtin protein load
  and fully restores both early network activity patterns and behavioral aberrations.
  This network-centered approach reveals a critical window of vulnerability far before
  clinical manifestation and establishes metformin as a promising candidate for a
  chronic therapy starting early in premanifest Huntington's disease pathogenesis
  long before the onset of clinical symptoms.
