input_text: "Predictive testing for Huntington disease over 24 years: Evolution of
  the profile of the participants and analysis of symptoms. BACKGROUND: Huntington
  disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative autosomal dominant genetic condition.
  Predictive testing (PT) is available through a defined protocol for at-risk individuals.
  We analyzed the over-24-years evolution of practices regarding PT for HD in a single
  center. METHODS: We gathered data from the files of all individuals seeking PT for
  HD in Lyon, France, from 1994 to 2017. RESULTS: 448 out of 567 participants had
  exploitable data. Age at consultation dichotomized over 24 years toward an eightfold
  increase in individuals aged >55 (2/94 vs. 30/183; 2% to 16%; p < .0001) and twice
  as many individuals aged 18-20 (3/94 vs. 12/183; 3%-7%; p < .05). Motives for testing
  remained stable. The rate of withdrawal doubled over 24 years (9/94 vs. 38/183;
  9%-21%; p < .02). Independently of the time period, less withdrawal was observed
  for married, accompanied, at 50% risk, and symptomatic individuals, and in those
  able to explicit the motives for testing or taking the test to inform their children.
  We also assessed the consistency between the presence of subtle symptoms compatible
  with HD found before the test by the team's neurologist, and the positivity of the
  molecular test. The concordance was 100% (17/17) for associated motor and cognitive
  signs, 87% (27/31) for isolated motor signs, and 70% (7/10) for isolated cognitive
  signs. Furthermore, 91% (20/22) of individuals who requested testing because they
  thought they had symptoms, were indeed found carriers. CONCLUSION: This over-24
  years study underlines an increasing withdrawal from protocol and a dichotomization
  of participants' age. We also show a strong concordance between symptoms perceived
  by the neurologist or by the patient, and the subsequent positivity of the predictive
  molecular test."
