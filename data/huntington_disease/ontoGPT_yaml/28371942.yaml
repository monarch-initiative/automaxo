input_text: "Physical Activity Self-Management and Coaching Compared to Social Interaction
  in Huntington Disease: Results From the ENGAGE-HD Randomized, Controlled Pilot Feasibility
  Trial. BACKGROUND: Self-management and self-efficacy for physical activity is not
  routinely considered in neurologic rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed
  feasibility and outcomes of a 14-week physical activity self-management and coaching
  intervention compared with social contact in Huntington disease (HD) to inform the
  design of a future full-scale trial. DESIGN: Assessor blind, multisite, randomized
  pilot feasibility trial. SETTING: Participants were recruited and assessed at baseline,
  16 weeks following randomization, and then again at 26 weeks in HD specialist clinics
  with intervention delivery by trained coaches in the participants' homes. PATIENTS
  AND INTERVENTION: People with HD were allocated to the ENGAGE-HD physical activity
  coaching intervention or a social interaction intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Eligibility,
  recruitment, retention, and intervention participation were determined at 16 weeks.
  Other outcomes of interest included measures of mobility, self-efficacy, physical
  activity, and disease-specific measures of motor and cognition. Fidelity and costs
  for both the physical activity and social comparator interventions were established.
  RESULTS: Forty percent ( n = 46) of eligible patients were enrolled; 22 were randomized
  to the physical intervention and 24 to social intervention. Retention rates in the
  physical intervention and social intervention were 77% and 92%, respectively. Minimum
  participation criteria were achieved by 82% of participants in the physical intervention
  and 100% in the social intervention. There was no indication of between-group treatment
  effects on function; however, increases in self-efficacy for exercise and self-reported
  levels of physical activity in the physical intervention lend support to our predefined
  intervention logic model. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures may have
  introduced bias. CONCLUSIONS: An HD physical activity self-management and coaching
  intervention is feasible and worthy of further investigation."
