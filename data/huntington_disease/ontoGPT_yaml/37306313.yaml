input_text: 'Selective perforant-pathway atrophy in Huntington disease: MRI analysis
  of hippocampal subfields.INTRODUCTION: While individuals with Huntington disease
  (HD) show memory impairment that indicates hippocampal dysfunction, the available
  literature does not consistently identify structural evidence for involvement of
  the whole hippocampus but rather suggests that hippocampal atrophy may be confined
  to certain hippocampal subregions. METHODS: We processed T1-weighted MRI from IMAGE-HD
  study using FreeSurfer 7.0 and compared the volumes of the hippocampal subfields
  among 36 early motor symptomatic (symp-HD), 40 pre-symptomatic (pre-HD), and 36
  healthy control individuals across three timepoints over 36 months. RESULTS: Mixed-model
  analyses revealed significantly lower subfield volumes in symp-HD, compared with
  pre-HD and control groups, in the subicular regions of the perforant-pathway: presubiculum,
  subiculum, dentate gyrus, tail, and right molecular layer. These adjoining subfields
  aggregated into a single principal component, which demonstrated an accelerated
  rate of atrophy in the symp-HD. Volumes between pre-HD and controls did not show
  any significant difference. In the combined HD groups, CAG repeat length and disease
  burden score were associated with presubiculum, molecular layer, tail, and perforant-pathway
  subfield volumes. Hippocampal left tail and perforant-pathway subfields were associated
  with motor onset in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal subfields atrophy
  in early symptomatic HD affects key regions of the perforant-pathway, which may
  implicate the distinctive memory impairment at this stage of illness. Their volumetric
  associations with genetic and clinical markers suggest the selective susceptibility
  of these subfields to mutant Huntingtin and disease progression.'
