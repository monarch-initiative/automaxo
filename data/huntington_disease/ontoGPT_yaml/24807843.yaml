input_text: "Autophagy of mitochondria: a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative
  disease. The autophagic process is the only known mechanism for mitochondrial turnover
  and it has been speculated that dysfunction of autophagy may result in mitochondrial
  error and cellular stress. Emerging investigations have provided new understanding
  of how autophagy of mitochondria (also known as mitophagy) is associated with cellular
  oxidative stress and its impact on neurodegeneration. This impaired autophagic function
  may be considered as a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative
  disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis,
  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease. It can be suggested that
  autophagy dysfunction along with oxidative stress is considered main events in neurodegenerative
  disorders. New therapeutic approaches have now begun to target mitochondria as a
  potential drug target. This review discusses evidence supporting the notion that
  oxidative stress and autophagy are intimately associated with neurodegenerative
  disease pathogenesis. This review also explores new approaches that can prevent
  mitochondrial dysfunction, improve neurodegenerative etiology, and also offer possible
  cures to the aforementioned neurodegenerative diseases. "
