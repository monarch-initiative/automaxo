input_text: 'Huntington disease: new insights into molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic
  opportunities. Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by
  CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) and involves a complex web of
  pathogenic mechanisms. Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with
  immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally.
  Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG
  repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide
  association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic
  instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal
  models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective.
  Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable
  changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic
  benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide
  successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with
  HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with
  trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights
  into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including
  the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.'
