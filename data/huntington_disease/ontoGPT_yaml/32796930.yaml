input_text: 'Huntington disease: new insights into molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic
  opportunities.Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG
  repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) and involves a complex web of pathogenic
  mechanisms. Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and
  mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence
  suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion
  in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies
  have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease
  course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic
  transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals
  with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically,
  the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully,
  and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger
  trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other
  HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular
  pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of
  DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.'
