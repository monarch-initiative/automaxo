input_text: The absence of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression protects against
  NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in mouse brain. We previously showed that
  the expression and activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (Ido1) are chronically
  elevated in the striatum of YAC128 mouse model of HD. This was followed by increased
  production of neurotoxic metabolite hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) in the striatum of
  symptomatic mice. We therefore hypothesized that the chronic Ido1 induction in the
  striatum of YAC128 mice leads to increased neurotoxicity in this mouse model; based
  on this hypothesis, we predicted that the absence of Ido1 expression would result
  in decreased sensitivity to neurotoxicity in mice. The work described in this brief
  communication will include the characterization of Ido(-/-) striatum in terms of
  enzymatic expression and activity in the first step of the pathway. Additionally,
  we assessed the sensitivity of the striatum to excitotoxic insult in the absence
  of Ido1 expression in the striatum of constitutive Ido1 null mice (Ido(-/-)) and
  demonstrated that Ido(-/-) mice are less sensitive to QA-induced striatal neurotoxicity.
  Finally, through measurement of kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites in Ido(-/-)
  mice, we showed decreased levels of 3-HK in the striatum of these mice. This study
  suggests that the inhibition of the first step in the KP may be neuroprotective
  and should be considered as a potential therapeutic target in HD and other neurodegenerative
  diseases.
