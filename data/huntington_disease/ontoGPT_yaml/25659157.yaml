input_text: 'Volumetric analysis of the hypothalamus in Huntington Disease using 3T
  MRI: the IMAGE-HD Study. Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder
  caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. Non-motor symptoms and
  signs such as psychiatric disturbances, sleep problems and metabolic dysfunction
  are part of the disease manifestation. These aspects may relate to changes in the
  hypothalamus, an area of the brain involved in the regulation of emotion, sleep
  and metabolism. Neuropathological and imaging studies using both voxel-based morphometry
  (VBM) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as positron emission tomography
  (PET) have demonstrated pathological changes in the hypothalamic region during early
  stages in symptomatic HD. In this investigation, we aimed to establish a robust
  method for measurements of the hypothalamic volume in MRI in order to determine
  whether the hypothalamic dysfunction in HD is associated with the volume of this
  region. Using T1-weighted imaging, we describe a reproducible delineation procedure
  to estimate the hypothalamic volume which was based on the same landmarks used in
  histologically processed postmortem hypothalamic tissue. Participants included 36
  prodromal HD (pre-HD), 33 symptomatic HD (symp-HD) and 33 control participants who
  underwent MRI scanning at baseline and 18 months follow-up as part of the IMAGE-HD
  study. We found no evidence of cross-sectional or longitudinal changes between groups
  in hypothalamic volume. Our results suggest that hypothalamic pathology in HD is
  not associated with volume changes. '
