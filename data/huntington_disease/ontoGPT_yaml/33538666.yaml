input_text: "Withania somnifera in Neurological Disorders: Ethnopharmacological Evidence,
  Mechanism of Action and its Progress in Delivery Systems.BACKGROUND: The underlying
  cause of major neurodegenerative disorders remains a healthcare mystery. The thoroughly
  investigated causes include oxidative stress, inflammation, environmental factor,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular neuronal protein aggregation. Withania
  somnifera has been used for more than 2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to
  improve disease defense, prevent aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation,
  and generate a feeling of mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing
  its neuroprotective nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have
  delineated the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders
  and its progress in delivery systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval
  of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were
  W. somnifera, Ashwagandha, neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source
  of the data retrieval includes research articles, review papers, and short communications
  from reputed publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier,
  Nature, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review,
  we found that W. somnifera mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's
  disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and
  anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better neuroprotective
  activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers of
  natural products are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION:
  The current review substantially deciphered the protective role of W. somnifera
  against various neurological disorders. However, future studies are further required
  better to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their neuroprotective nature."
