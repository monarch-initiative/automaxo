input_text: "Apathy Is Related to Cognitive Control and Striatum Volumes in Prodromal
  Huntington's Disease. OBJECTIVES: Apathy is a debilitating symptom of Huntington's
  disease (HD) and manifests before motor diagnosis, making it an excellent therapeutic
  target in the preclinical phase of Huntington's disease (prHD). HD is a neurological
  genetic disorder characterized by cognitive and motor impairment, and psychiatric
  abnormalities. Apathy is not well characterized within the prHD. In previous literature,
  damage to the caudate and putamen has been correlated with increased apathy in other
  neurodegenerative and movement disorders. The objective of this study was to determine
  whether apathy severity in individuals with prHD is related to striatum volumes
  and cognitive control. We hypothesized that, within prHD individuals, striatum volumes
  and cognitive control scores would be related to apathy. METHODS: We constructed
  linear mixed models to analyze striatum volumes and cognitive control, a composite
  measure that includes tasks assessing with apathy scores from 797 prHD participants.
  The outcome variable for each model was apathy, and the independent variables for
  the four separate models were caudate volume, putamen volume, cognitive control
  score, and motor symptom score. We also included depression as a covariate to ensure
  that our results were not solely related to mood. RESULTS: Caudate and putamen volumes,
  as well as measures of cognitive control, were significantly related to apathy scores
  even after controlling for depression. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral apathy expressed
  by these individuals was related to regions of the brain commonly associated with
  isolated apathy, and not a direct result of mood symptoms. (JINS, 2019, 25, 462-469)."
