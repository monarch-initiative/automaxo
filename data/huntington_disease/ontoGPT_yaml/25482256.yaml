input_text: 'Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management.
  Huntington disease (HD) is a degenerative brain disease clinically manifested by
  the characteristic triad: physical symptoms including involuntary movements and
  poor coordination, cognitive changes with less ability to organize routine tasks,
  and some emotional and behavioral disturbances. For patients with HD, feeding is
  one of the problems they have to face. People with HD often have lower than average
  body weight and struggle with malnutrition. As a part of therapy, good nutrition
  is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged
  time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally
  are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric,
  or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy.
  Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of
  complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration
  pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply,
  adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome. '
