input_text: 'Subjective Assessment of Sleep in Huntington Disease: Reliability of
  Sleep Questionnaires Compared to Polysomnography. INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study
  was to evaluate the clinical reliability of subjective sleep evaluation, based on
  sleep and psychometric questionnaires, by comparing the results with those obtained
  with laboratory-based video-polysomnography (V-PSG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty
  consecutive Huntington disease (HD) patients were enrolled. Subjective evaluation
  of sleep included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the sleep questionnaire
  for HD (HDQ), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Bologna questionnaire for sleepiness
  (BQ), the Berlin questionnaire, and the RBD questionnaire; the International Restless
  Legs Syndrome Study Group scale was administered to patients with positive screening.
  The psychometric evaluation included the Zung Anxiety Scale, the short form of the
  Beck Depression Inventory, and the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory. All
  patients underwent V-PSG. RESULTS: In sleepiness evaluation, the Epworth score was
  above the cutoff in 6 subjects, and the BQ detected a "high risk" of sleepiness
  in 7 cases. The results were concordant in 24 and discordant in 5 cases. In the
  evaluation of sleep quality, the PSQI score was above the cutoff in 18 subjects.
  According to the HDQ, 10 subjects were poor sleepers. The results were concordant
  with the PSQI in 20 subjects. DISCUSSION: All comparisons between scale scores and
  PSG results showed poor or totally absent concordance between subjective and objective
  measures. SIGNIFICANCE: The subjective evaluation of sleep in HD patients shows
  a poor correlation with PSG results.'
