input_text: "Optical coherence tomography angiography findings in Huntington's disease.OBJECTIVES:
  To evaluate the retinal and choriocapillaris vascular networks in macular region
  and the central choroidal thickness (CCT) in patients affected by Huntington disease
  (HD), using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and enhanced depth imaging
  spectral-domain OCT (EDI SD-OCT). METHODS: We assessed the vessel density (VD) in
  superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and choriocapillaris
  (CC) using OCTA, while CCT was measured by EDI SD-OCT. RESULTS: Sixteen HD patients
  (32 eyes) and thirteen healthy controls (26 eyes) were enrolled in this prospective
  study. No significant difference in retinal and choriocapillaris VD was found between
  HD patients and controls while CCT turned to be thinner in patients respect to controls.
  There were no significant relationships between OCTA findings and neurological parameters.
  CONCLUSION: The changes in choroidal structure provide useful information regarding
  the possible neurovascular involvement in the physiopathology of HD. Choroidal vascular
  network could be a useful parameter to evaluate the vascular impairment that occurs
  in this neurodegenerative disease."
