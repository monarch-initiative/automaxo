input_text: Abnormal visual scanning and impaired mental state recognition in pre-manifest
  Huntington disease.Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder
  that affects not only the motor but also the cognitive and the neuropsychiatric
  domain. In particular, deficits in mental state recognition may emerge already at
  early pre-manifest stages of the disease. The aim of this research was to explore
  the relation between visual scanning behavior and complex mental state recognition
  in individuals with pre-manifest HD (preHD). Eighteen preHD and eighteen age- and
  gender-matched healthy controls took the revised "Reading the Mind in the Eyes"
  test while their eye-movements were tracked. In addition to the expected deficits
  in mental state recognition, preHD showed abnormalities concerning all three scanning
  variables we considered, namely the absolute number of fixations (FC), the average
  fixation duration (AFD), and the percentage of time spent fixating (FTR). In preHD,
  FC and FTR but not AFD predicted mental state recognition over and beyond general
  disease-related declines in cognition and motor functioning. Notably, preHD showed
  abnormal vertical and horizontal fixation patterns, and these patterns predicted
  mental state recognition, suggesting the involvement of mechanisms related to the
  embodied processing of emotional stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that impaired
  facial mental state recognition in pre-manifest HD is partly due to emotional-motivational
  factors affecting the visual scanning of facial expressions.
