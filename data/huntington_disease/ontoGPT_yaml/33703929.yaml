input_text: Cerebral venous thrombosis, neutropenia and iron-deficiency anemia in
  Huntington disease.Neurologic and nonneurologic manifestations have been shown for
  Huntington disease (HD) as a genetic neurodegenerative disorder. However, cerebral
  venous thrombosis (CVT), iron-deficiency anemia and neutropenia have not been reported
  as its presentations to date. We introduce the first case of a HD patient with CVT,
  iron-deficiency anemia and neutropenia. All transient and chronic risk factors for
  development of these manifestations were ruled out. According to the experimental
  evidences reviewed in this article, we suggest that HD itself could promote formation
  of CVT, iron-deficiency anemia and neutropenia through vascular and blood cell abnormalities.
