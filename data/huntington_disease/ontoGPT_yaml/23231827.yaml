input_text: 'Management of upper extremity dysfunction in people with Parkinson disease
  and Huntington disease: facilitating outcomes across the disease lifespan. Parkinson
  Disease (PD) and Huntington Disease (HD) are degenerative neurological diseases,
  which can result in impairments and activity limitations affecting the upper extremities
  from early in the disease process. The progressive nature of these diseases poses
  unique challenges for therapists aiming to effectively maximize physical functioning
  and minimize participation restrictions in these patient groups. Research is underway
  in both diseases to develop effective disease-modifying agents and pharmacological
  interventions, as well as mobility-focused rehabilitation protocols. Rehabilitation,
  and in particular task-specific interventions, has the potential to influence the
  upper extremity functional abilities of patients with these degenerative conditions.
  However to date, investigations of interventions specifically addressing upper extremity
  function have been limited in both PD, and in particular HD. In this paper, we provide
  an update of the known pathological features of PD and HD as they relate to upper
  extremity function. We further review the available literature on the use of outcome
  measures, and the clinical management of upper extremity function in both conditions.
  Due to the currently limited evidence base in both diseases, we recommend utilization
  of a clinical management framework specific for degenerative conditions that can
  serve as a guideline for disease management.'
