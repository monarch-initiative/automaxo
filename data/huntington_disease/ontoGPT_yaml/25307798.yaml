input_text: 'Low utilization of prenatal and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis in
  Huntington disease - risk discounting in preventive genetics. Huntington disease
  (HD) is a late-onset, fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a (CAG) triplet
  repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene that enlarges during male meiosis. In 1996
  in this journal, one of us (J. D. S.) presented a methodology to perform pre-implantation
  genetic diagnosis in families at-risk for HD without revealing the genetic status
  of the at-risk parent. Despite the introduction of accurate prenatal and pre-implantation
  genetic testing which can prevent transmission of the abnormal HD gene in the family
  permanently, utilization of these options is extremely low. In this article, we
  examine the decision-making process regarding genetic testing in families with HD
  and discuss the possible reasons for the low uptake among this group. '
