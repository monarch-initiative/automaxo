input_text: 'Complementary therapy for the treatment of glaucoma: a perspective. Although
  neuroprotective strategies and pharmaceutical agents have been initiated in the
  treatment of numerous disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including
  trauma, epilepsy, stroke, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,and
  AIDS dementia, none have yet been applied to the treatment of glaucoma. A prospective,
  placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would
  not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional
  medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal
  treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving
  the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection.
  Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated
  side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and,
  according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping
  in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating
  effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests
  are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal
  plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending
  large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge
  about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically
  in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials
  are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of
  Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps
  those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs
  known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the
  pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment
  of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography
  are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects,
  or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done
  for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At
  the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal
  agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has
  numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent
  mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular
  blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity,
  nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE
  could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.'
