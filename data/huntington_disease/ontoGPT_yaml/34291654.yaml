input_text: "Disparities in Palliative Care Utilization Among Hospitalized People
  With Huntington Disease: A National Cross-Sectional Study. BACKGROUND: People with
  Huntington's disease (HD) often become institutionalized and more frequently die
  away from the home setting. The reasons behind differences in end-of-life care are
  poorly understood. Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative
  care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for
  this neurodegenerative disease. It is unknown what factors are associated with in-patient
  specialty PC consultation in this population and how PC might be related to discharge
  disposition. OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious
  illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC
  encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge
  disposition. DESIGN: We analyzed factors associated with PC consultation for people
  with HD using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide
  Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for
  Healthcare Research and Quality. An anonymized, cross-sectional, and stratified
  sample of 20% of United States hospitalizations from 2007 through 2014 were included
  using ICD-9 codes. RESULTS: 8521 patients with HD were admitted to the hospital.
  Of those, 321 (3.8%) received specialty PC. Payer type, (specifically private insurer
  or other insurer as compared to Medicare), income, (specifically the top quartile
  as compared to the bottom quartile), mortality risk, D.N.R., aspiration pneumonia,
  and depression were significantly associated with PC in a multivariate model. Among
  those who received PC, the odds ratio (OR) of discharge to a facility was 0.43 (95%
  CI, 0.32-0.58), whereas the OR of discharge to home with services was 2.25 (95%
  CI 1.57-3.23), even after adjusting for possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Among
  patients with HD, economic factors, depression, and serious illness-specific factors
  were associated with PC, and PC was associated with discharge disposition. These
  findings have implications for the adaptation of inpatient PC models to meet the
  needs of persons with HD."
