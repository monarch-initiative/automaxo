input_text: 'Stem and progenitor cell-based therapy of the human central nervous system.
  Multipotent neural stem cells, capable of giving rise to both neurons and glia,
  line the cerebral ventricles of all adult animals, including humans. In addition,
  distinct populations of nominally glial progenitor cells, which also have the capacity
  to generate several cell types, are dispersed throughout the subcortical white matter
  and cortex. A number of approaches have evolved for using neural progenitor cells
  in cell therapy. Four strategies are especially attractive for clinical translation:
  first, transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells as a means of treating
  the disorders of myelin; second, transplantation of phenotypically restricted neuronal
  progenitor cells to treat diseases of discrete loss of a single neuronal phenotype,
  such as Parkinson disease; third, implantation of mixed progenitor pools to treat
  diseases characterized by the loss of several discrete phenotypes, such as spinal
  cord injury; and fourth, mobilization of endogenous neural progenitor cells to restore
  neurons lost as a result of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Huntington
  disease. Together, these may present the most compelling strategies and near-term
  disease targets for cell-based neurological therapy.'
