input_text: Restoration of BDNF, DARPP32, and D2R Expression Following Intravenous
  Infusion of Human Immature Dental Pulp Stem Cells in Huntington's Disease 3-NP Rat
  Model.Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative inherited genetic disorder,
  which leads to the onset of motor, neuropsychiatric and cognitive disturbances.
  HD is characterized by the loss of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic medium spiny
  neurons (MSNs). To date, there is no treatment for HD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
  provide a substantial therapeutic opportunity for the HD treatment. Herein, we investigated
  the therapeutic potential of human immature dental pulp stem cells (hIDPSC), a special
  type of MSC originated from the neural crest, for HD treatment. Two different doses
  of hIDPSC were intravenously administrated in a subacute 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP)-induced
  rat model. We demonstrated hIDPSC homing in the striatum, cortex and subventricular
  zone using specific markers for human cells. Thirty days after hIDPSC administration,
  the cells found in the brain are still express hallmarks of undifferentiated MSC.
  Immunohistochemistry quantities analysis revealed a significant increase in the
  number of BDNF, DARPP32 and D2R positive stained cells in the striatum and cortex
  in the groups that received hIDPSC. The differences were more expressive in animals
  that received only one administration of hIDPSC. Altogether, these data suggest
  that the intravenous administration of hIDPSCs can restore the BDNF, DARPP32 and
  D2R expression, promoting neuroprotection and neurogenesis.
