input_text: "Systematic data analysis and data mining in CatWalk gait analysis by
  heat mapping exemplified in rodent models for neurodegenerative diseases. BACKGROUND:
  Motor impairment appears as a characteristic symptom of several diseases and injuries.
  Therefore, tests for analyzing motor dysfunction are widely applied across preclinical
  models and disease stages. Among those, gait analysis tests are commonly used, but
  they generate a huge number of gait parameters. Thus, complications in data analysis
  and reporting raise, which often leads to premature parameter selection. NEW METHODS:
  In order to avoid arbitrary parameter selection, we present here a systematic initial
  data analysis by utilizing heat-maps for data reporting. We exemplified this approach
  within an intervention study, as well as applied it to two longitudinal studies
  in rodent models related to Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington disease (HD).
  RESULTS: The systematic initial data analysis (IDA) is feasible for exploring gait
  parameters, both in experimental and longitudinal studies. The resulting heat maps
  provided a visualization of gait parameters within a single chart, highlighting
  important clusters of differences. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Often, premature
  parameter selection is practiced, lacking comprehensiveness. Researchers often use
  multiple separated graphs on distinct gait parameters for reporting. Additionally,
  negative results are often not reported. CONCLUSIONS: Heat mapping utilized in initial
  data analysis is advantageous for reporting clustered gait parameter differences
  in one single chart and improves data mining."
