input_text: 'Tetrabenazine Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Chorea Associated with
  Huntington Disease: A Retrospective Chart Review. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease
  (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including
  chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine
  was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea
  related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients
  using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation,
  dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based
  on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart
  review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com)
  opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and
  abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment
  patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were
  reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients
  (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping
  upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses
  (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control
  (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with
  increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS:
  Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April
  2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine
  dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms
  of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options,
  such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource
  use.'
