input_text: 'Safety and Efficacy of Flexible-Dose Deutetrabenazine in Children and
  Adolescents With Tourette Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Tourette
  syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor
  and phonic tics; treatments for tics are associated with safety concerns. Deutetrabenazine
  is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment
  of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia in adults. Objective:
  To examine whether deutetrabenazine is effective and safe for the treatment of Tourette
  syndrome in children and adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase
  2/3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-titration
  study included children and adolescents (aged 6-16 years) with Tourette syndrome
  with active tics causing distress or impairment (ie, Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total
  Tic Score [YGTSS-TTS] >=20). The trial was conducted over 12 weeks, with 1 week
  of follow-up from February 2018 to November 2019 at 36 centers in the United States,
  Canada, Denmark, Russia, Serbia, and Spain. Data analysis was conducted from January
  31 to April 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive deutetrabenazine
  or placebo, titrated during 7 weeks to an optimal level, followed by a 5-week maintenance
  period. The maximum total daily deutetrabenazine dose was 48 mg/d. Main Outcomes
  and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 12
  in YGTSS-TTS. Key secondary end points included changes in Tourette Syndrome-Clinical
  Global Impression, Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact, and Child
  and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily
  Living subscale score. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events,
  vital signs, questionnaires, and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 119
  participants were randomized to deutetrabenazine (59 participants; mean [SD] age,
  11.5 [2.5] years; 53 [90%] boys; 49 [83%] White; 3 [5%] Black) and placebo (60 participants;
  mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.6] years; 51 [85%] boys; 53 [88%] White; 3 [5%] Black). At
  week 12, the difference in YGTSS-TTS score was not significant between deutetrabenazine
  and placebo (least squares mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -4.1 to 2.8; P = .69;
  Cohen d, -0.07). There were no nominally significant differences between groups
  for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for
  38 patients (66%) and 33 patients (56%) receiving deutetrabenazine and placebo,
  respectively, and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In
  this study of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome,
  the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified.
  These results may be informative for future studies of treatments for tics in Tourette
  syndrome. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03452943.'
