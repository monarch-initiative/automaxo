input_text: "The clinical utility of exome sequencing and extended bioinformatic analyses
  in adolescents and adults with a broad range of neurological phenotypes: an Australian
  perspective. Currently there is no secured ongoing funding in Australia for next
  generation sequencing (NGS) such as exome sequencing (ES) for adult neurological
  disorders. Studies have focused on paediatric populations in research or highly
  specialised settings, utilised standard NGS pipelines focusing only on small insertions,
  deletions and single nucleotide variants, and not explored impacts on management
  in detail. This prospective multi-site study performed ES and an extended bioinformatics
  repeat expansion analysis pipeline, on patients with broad phenotypes (ataxia, dementia,
  dystonia, spastic paraparesis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease and complex/not-otherwise-specified),
  with symptom onset between 2 and 60 years. Genomic data analysis was phenotype-driven,
  using virtual gene panels, reported according to American College of Medical Genetics
  and Genomics guidelines. One-hundred-and-sixty patients (51% female) were included,
  median age 52 years (range 14-79) and median 9 years of symptoms. 34/160 (21%) patients
  received a genetic diagnosis. Highest diagnostic rates were in spastic paraparesis
  (10/25, 40%), complex/not-otherwise-specified (10/38, 26%) and ataxia (7/28, 25%)
  groups. Findings were considered 'possible/uncertain' in 21/160 patients. Repeat
  expansion detection identified an unexpected diagnosis of Huntington disease in
  an ataxic patient with negative ES. Impacts on management, such as more precise
  and tailored care, were seen in most diagnosed patients (23/34, 68%). ES and a novel
  bioinformatics analysis pipepline had a substantial diagnostic yield (21%) and management
  impacts for most diagnosed patients, in heterogeneous, complex, mainly adult-onset
  neurological disorders in real-world settings in Australia, providing evidence for
  NGS and complementary multiple, new technologies as valuable diagnostic tools."
