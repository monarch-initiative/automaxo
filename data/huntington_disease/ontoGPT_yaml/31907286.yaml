input_text: 'Clinical recommendations to guide physical therapy practice for Huntington
  disease. OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined
  the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease
  (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs
  Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs.
  The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which
  we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review
  suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and
  activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to
  provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend
  the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic
  exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to
  improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence)
  to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B)
  evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in
  the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function
  and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing
  strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of
  HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning
  devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS:
  There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness,
  motor function, and gait in persons with HD.'
