input_text: Dynamic functional network connectivity in Huntington's disease and its
  associations with motor and cognitive measures. Dynamic functional network connectivity
  (dFNC) is an expansion of traditional, static FNC that measures connectivity variation
  among brain networks throughout scan duration. We used a large resting-state fMRI
  (rs-fMRI) sample from the PREDICT-HD study (N = 183 Huntington disease gene mutation
  carriers [HDgmc] and N = 78 healthy control [HC] participants) to examine whole-brain
  dFNC and its associations with CAG repeat length as well as the product of scaled
  CAG length and age, a variable representing disease burden. We also tested for relationships
  between functional connectivity and motor and cognitive measurements. Group independent
  component analysis was applied to rs-fMRI data to obtain whole-brain resting state
  networks. FNC was defined as the correlation between RSN time-courses. Dynamic FNC
  behavior was captured using a sliding time window approach, and FNC results from
  each window were assigned to four clusters representing FNC states, using a k-means
  clustering algorithm. HDgmc individuals spent significantly more time in State-1
  (the state with the weakest FNC pattern) compared to HC. However, overall HC individuals
  showed more FNC dynamism than HDgmc. Significant associations between FNC states
  and genetic and clinical variables were also identified. In FNC State-4 (the one
  that most resembled static FNC), HDgmc exhibited significantly decreased connectivity
  between the putamen and medial prefrontal cortex compared to HC, and this was significantly
  associated with cognitive performance. In FNC State-1, disease burden in HDgmc participants
  was significantly associated with connectivity between the postcentral gyrus and
  posterior cingulate cortex, as well as between the inferior occipital gyrus and
  posterior parietal cortex.
