input_text: "A Classification System to Guide Physical Therapy Management in Huntington
  Disease: A Case Series. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease
  (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition
  throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides
  a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions,
  such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications,
  based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical
  therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute
  to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions
  in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this
  case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management
  of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years
  of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive
  declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling.
  Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living.
  INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the
  interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training,
  task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking
  tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated
  improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values
  for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements
  on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2
  individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests.
  Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide
  proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical
  therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-,
  mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities;
  those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier
  disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors
