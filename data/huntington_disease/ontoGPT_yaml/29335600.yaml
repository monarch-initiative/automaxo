input_text: Alteration in Fluidity of Cell Plasma Membrane in Huntington Disease Revealed
  by Spectral Phasor Analysis. Huntington disease (HD) is a late-onset genetic neurodegenerative
  disorder caused by expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide in
  the exon 1 of the gene encoding the polyglutamine (polyQ). It has been shown that
  protein degradation and lipid metabolism is altered in HD. In many neurodegenerative
  disorders, impaired lipid homeostasis is one of the early events in the disease
  onset. Yet, little is known about how mutant huntingtin may affect phospholipids
  membrane fluidity. Here, we investigated how membrane fluidity in the living cells
  (differentiated PC12 and HEK293 cell lines) are affected using a hyperspectral imaging
  of widely used probes, LAURDAN. Using phasor approach, we characterized the fluorescence
  of LAURDAN that is sensitive to the polarity of the immediate environment. LAURDAN
  is affected by the physical order of phospholipids (lipid order) and reports the
  membrane fluidity. We also validated our results using a different fluorescent membrane
  probe, Nile Red (NR). The plasma membrane in the cells expressing expanded polyQ
  shows a shift toward increased membrane fluidity revealed by both LAURDAN and NR
  spectral phasors. This finding brings a new perspective in the understanding of
  the early stages of HD that can be used as a target for drug screening.
