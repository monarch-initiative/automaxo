input_text: 'Digital Devices for Assessing Motor Functions in Mobility-Impaired and
  Healthy Populations: Systematic Literature Review.BACKGROUND: With the advent of
  smart sensing technology, mobile and wearable devices can provide continuous and
  objective monitoring and assessment of motor function outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed
  to describe the existing scientific literature on wearable and mobile technologies
  that are being used or tested for assessing motor functions in mobility-impaired
  and healthy adults and to evaluate the degree to which these devices provide clinically
  valid measures of motor function in these populations. METHODS: A systematic literature
  review was conducted by searching Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL (January 1, 2015, to
  June 24, 2020), the United States and European Union clinical trial registries,
  and the United States Food and Drug Administration website using predefined study
  selection criteria. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were
  performed by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 91 publications representing
  87 unique studies were included. The most represented clinical conditions were Parkinson
  disease (n=51 studies), followed by stroke (n=5), Huntington disease (n=5), and
  multiple sclerosis (n=2). A total of 42 motion-detecting devices were identified,
  and the majority (n=27, 64%) were created for the purpose of health care-related
  data collection, although approximately 25% were personal electronic devices (eg,
  smartphones and watches) and 11% were entertainment consoles (eg, Microsoft Kinect
  or Xbox and Nintendo Wii). The primary motion outcomes were related to gait (n=30),
  gross motor movements (n=25), and fine motor movements (n=23). As a group, sensor-derived
  motion data showed a mean sensitivity of 0.83 (SD 7.27), a mean specificity of 0.84
  (SD 15.40), a mean accuracy of 0.90 (SD 5.87) in discriminating between diseased
  individuals and healthy controls, and a mean Pearson r validity coefficient of 0.52
  (SD 0.22) relative to clinical measures. We did not find significant differences
  in the degree of validity between in-laboratory and at-home sensor-based assessments
  nor between device class (ie, health care-related device, personal electronic devices,
  and entertainment consoles). CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-derived motion data can be leveraged
  to classify and quantify disease status for a variety of neurological conditions.
  However, most of the recent research on digital clinical measures is derived from
  proof-of-concept studies with considerable variation in methodological approaches,
  and much of the reviewed literature has focused on clinical validation, with less
  than one-quarter of the studies performing analytical validation. Overall, future
  research is crucially needed to further consolidate that sensor-derived motion data
  may lead to the development of robust and transformative digital measurements intended
  to predict, diagnose, and quantify neurological disease state and its longitudinal
  change.'
