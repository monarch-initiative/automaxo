input_text: 'Rehabilitation outcomes in Huntington disease patients with low body
  mass index.OBJECTIVES: A catabolic state and a progressive body weight loss are
  a well-documented hallmark of Huntington Disease (HD). No study is still available
  on the effectiveness of intensive in-hospital rehabilitation in HD patients with
  low body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Twenty HD patients with low BMI value were enrolled
  in this study. Disease severity was assessed before and after rehabilitation by
  the Barthel Index, the Total Functional Capacity Scale, and the Physical Performance
  Test. RESULTS: BMI-scores correlated with clinical measures before and after rehabilitation.
  All patients showed an improvement in outcome measures (p<0.001), and an increase
  in BMI values (p<0.001) after rehabilitation. Effectiveness of rehabilitation correlated
  with the values of BMI assessed before reheducational programs (p=0.024) and with
  BMI values observed in each patient in the three months before admission to hospital
  (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the current study show that the effectiveness
  of the rehabilitation is positively correlated with the BMI values and confirm the
  efficacy of in-hospital intensive rehabilitation as a valid strategy finalized to
  improve neuromotor performances and global functional recovery even in HD patients
  with low BMI and at risk of malnutrition.'
