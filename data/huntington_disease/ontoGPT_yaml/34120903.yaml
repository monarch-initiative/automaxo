input_text: "Research on Emotion Recognition and Dementias: Foundations and Prospects.BACKGROUND:
  The study of emotion recognition could be crucial for detecting alterations in certain
  cognitive areas or as an early sign of neurological disorders. OBJECTIVE: The main
  objective of the study is to characterize research development on emotion recognition,
  identifying the intellectual structure that supports this area of knowledge, and
  the main lines of research attracting investigators' interest. METHODS: We identified
  publications on emotion recognition and dementia included in the Web of Science
  Core Collection, analyzing the scientific output and main disciplines involved in
  generating knowledge in the area. A co-citation analysis and an analysis of the
  bibliographic coupling between the retrieved documents elucidated the thematic orientations
  of the research and the reference works that constitute the foundation for development
  in the field. RESULTS: A total of 345 documents, with 24,282 bibliographic references
  between them, were included. This is an emerging research area, attracting the interest
  of investigators in Neurosciences, Psychology, Clinical Neurology, and Psychiatry,
  among other disciplines. Four prominent topic areas were identified, linked to frontotemporal
  dementia, autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's and Huntington
  disease. Many recent papers focus on the detection of mild cognitive impairment.
  CONCLUSION: Impaired emotion recognition may be a key sign facilitating the diagnosis
  and early treatment of different neurodegenerative diseases as well as for triggering
  the necessary provision of social and family support, explaining the growing research
  interest in this area."
