input_text: "Reduced motivation in the BACHD rat model of Huntington disease is dependent
  on the choice of food deprivation strategy. Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited
  neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, cognitive, psychiatric and metabolic
  symptoms. Animal models of HD show phenotypes that can be divided into similar categories,
  with the metabolic phenotype of certain models being characterized by obesity. Although
  interesting in terms of modeling metabolic symptoms of HD, the obesity phenotype
  can be problematic as it might confound the results of certain behavioral tests.
  This concerns the assessment of cognitive function in particular, as tests for such
  phenotypes are often based on food depriving the animals and having them perform
  tasks for food rewards. The BACHD rat is a recently established animal model of
  HD, and in order to ensure that behavioral characterization of these rats is done
  in a reliable way, a basic understanding of their physiology is needed. Here, we
  show that BACHD rats are obese and suffer from discrete developmental deficits.
  When assessing the motivation to lever push for a food reward, BACHD rats were found
  to be less motivated than wild type rats, although this phenotype was dependent
  on the food deprivation strategy. Specifically, the phenotype was present when rats
  of both genotypes were deprived to 85% of their respective free-feeding body weight,
  but not when deprivation levels were adjusted in order to match the rats' apparent
  hunger levels. The study emphasizes the importance of considering metabolic abnormalities
  as a confounding factor when performing behavioral characterization of HD animal
  models. "
