input_text: Structural and molecular myelination deficits occur prior to neuronal
  loss in the YAC128 and BACHD models of Huntington disease. White matter (WM) atrophy
  is a significant feature of Huntington disease (HD), although its aetiology and
  early pathological manifestations remain poorly defined. In this study, we aimed
  to characterize WM-related features in the transgenic YAC128 and BACHD models of
  HD. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), we demonstrate that
  microstructural WM abnormalities occur from an early age in YAC128 mice. Similarly,
  electron microscopy analysis of myelinated fibres of the corpus callosum indicated
  that myelin sheaths are thinner in YAC128 mice as early as 1.5 months of age, well
  before any neuronal loss can be detected. Transcript levels of myelin-related genes
  in striatal and cortical tissues were significantly lower in YAC128 mice from 2
  weeks of age, and these findings were replicated in differentiated primary oligodendrocytes
  from YAC128 mice, suggesting a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed
  structural deficits. Concordant with these observations, we demonstrate reduced
  expression of myelin-related genes at 3 months of age and WM microstructural abnormalities
  using DT-MRI at 12 months of age in the BACHD rats. These findings indicate that
  WM deficits in HD are an early phenotype associated with cell-intrinsic effects
  of mutant huntingtin on myelin-related transcripts in oligodendrocytes, and raise
  the possibility that WM abnormalities may be an early contributing factor to the
  pathogenesis of HD.
