input_text: 'Aberrant astrocytes impair vascular reactivity in Huntington disease.
  OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused
  by the mutant huntingtin gene (mHTT), which harbors expanded CAG repeats. We previously
  reported that the brain vessel density is higher in mice and patients with HD than
  in controls. The present study determines whether vascular function is altered in
  HD and characterizes the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The brain vessel density
  and vascular reactivity (VR) to carbogen challenge of HD mice were monitored by
  3D DeltaR2 -mMRA and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)/flow-sensitive alternating
  inversion recovery (FAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. The amount
  of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and the pericyte coverage were determined
  by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in human and mouse
  brain sections, primary mouse astrocytes and pericytes, and human astrocytes derived
  from induced pluripotent stem cells. RESULTS: Expression of mHTT in astrocytes and
  neurons is sufficient to increase the brain vessel density in HD mice. BOLD and
  FAIR MRI revealed gradually impaired VR to carbogen in HD mice. Astrocytes from
  HD mice and patients contained more VEGF-A, which triggers proliferation of endothelial
  cells and may be responsible for the augmented neurovascular changes. Moreover,
  an astrocytic inflammatory response, which reduces the survival of pericytes through
  an IkappaB kinase-dependent pathway, mediates the low pericyte coverage of blood
  vessels in HD brains. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the inflammation-prone
  HD astrocytes provide less pericyte coverage by promoting angiogenesis and reducing
  the number of pericytes and that these changes can explain the inferior VR in HD
  mice. The resultant impaired VR might hinder cerebral hemodynamics and increase
  brain atrophy during HD progression.'
