input_text: 'In vivo evaluation of candidate allele-specific mutant huntingtin gene
  silencing antisense oligonucleotides. Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant, genetic
  neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of voluntary motor control,
  psychiatric disturbance, and cognitive decline, for which there is currently no
  disease-modifying therapy. HD is caused by the expansion of a CAG tract in the huntingtin
  (HTT) gene. The mutant HTT protein (muHTT) acquires toxic functions, and there is
  significant evidence that muHTT lowering would be therapeutically efficacious. However,
  the wild-type HTT protein (wtHTT) serves vital functions, making allele-specific
  muHTT lowering strategies potentially safer than nonselective strategies. CAG tract
  expansion is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can be
  targeted by gene silencing reagents such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to
  accomplish allele-specific muHTT lowering. Here we evaluate ASOs targeted to HD-associated
  SNPs in acute in vivo studies including screening, distribution, duration of action
  and dosing, using a humanized mouse model of HD, Hu97/18, that is heterozygous for
  the targeted SNPs. We have identified four well-tolerated lead ASOs that potently
  and selectively silence muHTT at a broad range of doses throughout the central nervous
  system for 16 weeks or more after a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection.
  With further validation, these ASOs could provide a therapeutic option for individuals
  afflicted with HD. '
