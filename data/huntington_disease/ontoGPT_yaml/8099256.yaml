input_text: Some developments on the affected-pedigree-member method of linkage analysis.
  Some improvements are presented for the affected-pedigree-member method of linkage
  analysis, which is a generalization of the sib-pair method. The test statistic is
  extended to include contrasts between affected and unaffected pedigree members,
  so that it now utilizes marker information from all typed pedigree members rather
  than just the typed affected members. Computer simulation using a sample pedigree
  of 14 individuals shows that this modification can substantially increase statistical
  power where there is a direct association between marker variation and disease and
  where disease risk is elevated in carriers of the disease allele. Data on Huntington
  disease in 16 British families, which were analyzed previously using only the affected
  individuals, are reanalyzed with the unaffected individuals included. Strong rejection
  of the null hypothesis of no association between Huntington disease and the HindIII
  polymorphism is confirmed, but the particular families in which the association
  is significant differs from that obtained through an analysis based only on affected
  individuals and reflects more closely the results obtained from a lod-score analysis.
  The test statistic is also modified here to incorporate contrasts between individuals
  of zero kinship, if needed. This enables contrasts between individuals from different
  pedigrees, as well as contrasts involving individuals sampled from the general population,
  to be incorporated into the test of association. For population data, the methodology
  reduces to a type of contingency-table analysis, in which the rows of the table
  correspond to different marker-locus genotypes and in which the two columns categorize
  subjects into an "affected" group versus an "unaffected," or control, group. This
  aspect of the methodology is illustrated using two population data sets, the first
  relating APO-E genotype to the frequency of individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis
  and the second relating APO-B genotype to the frequency of coronary artery disease.
  The present methodology confirms the lack of association between marker and disease
  in the former data set and confirms the presence of association in the latter. Finally,
  the methodology is formulated here in terms of ordinary, multiperson kinship coefficients
  rather than in terms of the generalized kinship coefficients originally proposed.
  This greatly reduces the number of coefficients to be calculated, thereby enhancing
  the computational efficiency of the computer program.
