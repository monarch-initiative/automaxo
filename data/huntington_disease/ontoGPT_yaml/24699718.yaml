input_text: "Quadruple deep brain stimulation in Huntington's disease, targeting pallidum
  and subthalamic nucleus: case report and review of the literature. Deep brain stimulation
  (DBS) represents an established treatment option in a growing number of movement
  disorders. Recent case reports suggest beneficial effect of globus pallidus internus
  (GPi)-DBS in selected patients suffering from Huntington's disease with marked disabling
  chorea. We present a 41-year-old man with genetically confirmed HD following quadruple
  GPi- and subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS. Motor function was assessed by Abnormal
  Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and by Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale
  (UHDRS) presurgery and postsurgery for up to 4 years. Furthermore, cognitive, neuropsychiatric
  state and quality of life (QoL) including life satisfaction (QLS) were annually
  evaluated. Chorea assessed by AIMS and UHDRS subscores improved by 52 and 55 %,
  45 and 60 %, 35 and 45 % and 55-66 % at 1-4 years, respectively, compared to presurgical
  state following GPi-STN-DBS. During these time periods bradykinesia did not increase
  following separate STN- and combined GPi-STN-DBS compared to presurgical state.
  Mood, QoL and QLS were ameliorated. However, dysexecutive symptoms increased at
  4 years postsurgery. The present case report suggests that bilateral GPi- and STN-DBS
  may represent a new treatment avenue in selected HD patients. Clinically, GPi-DBS
  attenuated chorea and was associated with a larger effect-adverse effect window
  compared to STN-DBS. However, GPi-DBS-induced bradykinesia may emerge as one main
  limitation of GPi-DBS in HD. Thus, quadruple GPi-STN-DBS may be indicated, if separate
  GPi-DBS does not result in sufficient control of motor symptoms. Future controlled
  studies need to confirm if the present anecdotal observation of additive beneficial
  effects of GPi- and STN-DBS in a HD patient with severe generalized chorea and relatively
  intact cognitive and affective functions indeed represents a new therapeutic option."
