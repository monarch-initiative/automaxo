input_text: 'Efficacy of levetiracetam in Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: Levetiracetam
  (LEV) is a novel antiepileptic drug characterized by a wide spectrum of action;
  no pharmacologic interaction and poor adverse events are reported. In animal models,
  effects of LEV are observed in basal ganglia. The aim of this study was to evaluate
  the efficacy of LEV in reducing involuntary movements in subjects affected by Huntington
  disease (HD). METHODS: This was a single-center, short-term, open-label, controlled
  study. Patients had LEV as add-on therapy for 6 months. In the first visit patients
  were rated according to the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale. Every 2 months
  they were submitted to all these tests. LEV was added at the dose of 500 mg twice
  daily for the first 2 months and then the dosage was increased until 1000 mg twice
  daily for the next 4 more months. The authors enrolled 22 patients: 15 were assigned
  to the LEV group and 7 were enrolled as control subjects. RESULTS: No serious adverse
  events were experienced by the treated patients. After 6 months of treatment patients
  on LEV showed a significant reduction of involuntary movements, with a slight improvement
  of functional capacity compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Results of this
  short-term, prospective, controlled study indicates that in HD patients, LEV is
  effective in reducing involuntary movements, thus improving the quality of life.'
