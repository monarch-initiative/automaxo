input_text: The ubiquitin proteasome system as a potential therapeutic target for
  treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Impairment of "protein quality control"
  in neurons is associated with etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The
  worn-out products of cell metabolism should be safely eliminated via the proteasome,
  autophago-lysosome and exocytosis. Insufficient activity of these degradation mechanisms
  within neurons leads to the accumulation of toxic protein oligomers, which represent
  a starting material for development of neurodegenerative proteinopathy. The spectrum
  of CNS linked proteinopathies is particularly broad and includes Alzheimer's disease
  (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia, Pick disease, Frontotemporal
  dementia, Huntington disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many others. Although
  the primary events in etiopathogenesis of sporadic forms of these diseases are still
  unknown, it is clear that aging, in connection with decreased activity of ubiquitin
  proteasome system, is the most significant risk factor. In this review we discuss
  the pathogenic role and intracellular fate of the candidate molecules associated
  with onset and progression of AD and PD, the protein tau and alpha-synuclein in
  context with the function of ubiquitin proteasome system. We also discuss the possibility
  whether or not the strategies focused to re-establishment of neuroproteostasis via
  accelerated clearance of damaged proteins in proteasome could be a promising therapeutic
  approach for treatment of major neurodegenerative diseases.
