input_text: Comparative transcriptome analysis identified crucial genes and pathways
  affecting sperm motility in the reproductive tract of drakes with different libido.Libido
  can affect the semen quality of male, and the sperm motility in semen quality parameters
  is a reliable index to evaluate the fertility of male. In drakes, the sperm motility
  is gradually acquired in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. However, the relationship
  between libido and sperm motility in drakes has not been reported and the mechanisms
  of testis, epididymis, and spermaduct regulating the sperm motility of drakes are
  unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the semen quality
  of drakes with libido level 4 (LL4) and libido level 5 (LL5), and tried to identify
  the mechanisms regulating the sperm motility in drakes by performing RNA-seq in
  testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. Phenotypically, the sperm motility of drakes
  (P < 0.01), weight of testis (P < 0.05), and organ index of epididymis (P < 0.05)
  in the LL5 group were significantly better than those in LL4 group. Moreover, compared
  with the LL4 group, the ductal square of seminiferous tubule (ST) in testis was
  significantly bigger in the LL5 group (P < 0.05), and the seminiferous epithelial
  thickness (P < 0.01) of ST in testis and lumenal diameter (P < 0.05) of ductuli
  conjugentes/dutus epididymidis in epididymis were significantly longer in the LL5
  group. In transcriptional regulation, in addition to KEGG pathways related to metabolism
  and oxidative phosphorylation, lots of KEGG pathways associated with immunity, proliferation,
  and signaling were also significantly enriched in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct,
  respectively. Furthermore, through the integrated analysis of coexpression network
  and protein-protein interaction network, 3 genes (including COL11A1, COL14A1, and
  C3AR1) involved in protein digestion and absorption pathway and Staphylococcus aureus
  infection pathway were identified in testis, 2 genes (including BUB1B and ESPL1)
  involved in cell cycle pathway were identified in epididymis, and 13 genes (including
  DNAH1, DNAH3, DNAH7, DNAH10, DNAH12, DNAI1, DNAI2, DNALI1, NTF3, ITGA1, TLR2, RELN,
  and PAK1) involved in Huntington disease pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
  were identified in spermaduct. These genes could play crucial roles in the sperm
  motility of drakes with different libido, and all data the present study obtained
  will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating sperm motility
  of drakes.
