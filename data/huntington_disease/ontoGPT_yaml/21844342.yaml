input_text: Combination therapy utilizing shRNA knockdown and an optimized resistant
  transgene for rescue of diseases caused by misfolded proteins. Molecular knockdown
  of disease proteins and restoration of wild-type activity represent a promising
  but challenging strategy for the treatment of diseases that result from the accumulation
  of misfolded proteins (i.e., Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
  and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). In this study we used alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)
  deficiency with the piZZ mutant phenotype as a model system to evaluate the efficiency
  of gene-delivery approaches that both silence the piZZ transcript (e.g., shRNA)
  and restore circulating wild-type AAT expression from resistant codon-optimized
  AAT (AAT-opt) transgene cassette using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivery.
  After systemic injection of a self-complimentary AAV serotype 8 (scAAV8) vector
  encoding shRNA in piZZ transgenic mice, both mutant AAT mRNA in the liver and defected
  serum protein level were inhibited by 95%, whereas liver pathology, as monitored
  by dPAS and fibrosis staining, reversed. To restore blood AAT levels in AAV8/shRNA-treated
  mice, several strategies to restore functional AAT levels were tested, including
  using AAV AAT-opt transgene cassettes targeted to muscle and liver, or combination
  vectors carrying piZZ shRNA and AAT-opt transgenes separately, or a single bicistronic
  AAV vector. With these molecular approaches, we observed over 90% knockdown of mutant
  AAT with a 13- to 30-fold increase of circulating wild-type AAT protein from the
  shRNA-resistant AAT-opt cassette. The molecular approaches applied in this study
  can simultaneously prevent liver pathology and restore blood AAT concentration in
  AAT deficiencies. Based on these observations, similar gene-therapy strategies could
  be considered for any diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins.
