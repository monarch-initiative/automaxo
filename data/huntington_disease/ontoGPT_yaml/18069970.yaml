input_text: 'Stem cell-based cell therapy for Huntington disease: a review. Huntington
  disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and no proven medical therapy
  is currently available to mitigate its clinical manifestations. Although fetal neural
  transplantation has been tried in both preclinical and clinical investigations,
  the efficacy is not satisfactory. With the recent explosive progress of stem cell
  biology, application of stem cell-based therapy in HD is an exciting prospect. Three
  kinds of stem cells, embryonic stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and
  neural stem cells, have previously been utilized in cell therapy in animal models
  of neurological disorders. However, neural stem cells were preferably used by investigators
  in experimental HD studies, since they have a clear capacity to become neurons or
  glial cells after intracerebral or intravenous transplantation, and they induce
  functional recovery. In this review, we summarize the current state of cell therapy
  utilizing stem cells in experimental HD animal models, and discuss the future considerations
  for developing new therapeutic strategies using neural stem cells.'
