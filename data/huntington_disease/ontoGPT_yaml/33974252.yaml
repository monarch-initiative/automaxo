input_text: '[Genetic testing and prenatal diagnosis of two pedigrees affected with
  Huntington disease].OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for two Chinese pedigrees
  affected with Huntington disease and provide prenatal diagnosis for them. METHODS:
  Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the probands. PCR and capillary
  gel electrophoresis were used to determine the number of CAG repeats in their IT15
  gene. Pre-symptomatic testing was offered to their children and relatives, and prenatal
  diagnosis was provided to three pregnant women from the two pedigrees. RESULTS:
  The two probands, in addition with three asymptomatic members, were found to have
  a (CAG)n repeat number greater than 40. Upon prenatal diagnosis, the numbers of
  CAG repeats in two fetuses from pedigree 1 were determined as (16, 19) and (18,
  19), both were within the normal range. A fetus from pedigree 2 was found to have
  a CAG repeat number of (15, 41), which exceeded the normal range. CONCLUSION: Genetic
  testing can facilitate the diagnosis of Huntington disease and avoid further birth
  of affected children.'
