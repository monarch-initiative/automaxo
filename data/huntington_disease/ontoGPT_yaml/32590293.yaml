input_text: Imbalance of the oxytocin-vasopressin system contributes to the neuropsychiatric
  phenotype in the BACHD mouse model of Huntington disease.Neuropsychiatric disturbances
  with altered social cognition, depression and anxiety are among the most debilitating
  early features in the fatal neurodegenerative disorder Huntington disease (HD) which
  is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. The underlying neurobiological
  mechanisms are not known. Neuropathological analyses of postmortem human HD hypothalamic
  tissue have demonstrated loss of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin. The
  dynamic interplay between these neuropeptides is crucial for modulating emotional
  and social behavior but its role in HD is unclear. In the present study, we have
  investigated the effect of expressing the mutant huntingtin gene on the development
  of behavioral changes using the transgenic BACHD mouse model at different ages.
  We show for the first time that BACHD mice exhibit deficits in social behavior with
  parallel aberrations in the balance of the oxytocin-vasopressin system. Importantly,
  our data also show that restoration of the interplay within the system with an acute
  dose of intranasal oxytocin immediately prior to behavioral testing can rescue the
  depressive-like phenotype but not anxiety-like behavior in this transgenic model.
  These findings demonstrate that imbalances in the oxytocin-vasopressin interplay
  contribute to the neuropsychiatric component of HD and suggest that interventions
  aimed at restoring the blunted levels of oxytocin may confer therapeutic benefits
  for this disease.
