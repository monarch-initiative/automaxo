input_text: "Ethics and medical genetics in the United States: a national survey.
  The approaches of 295 medical geneticists in the United States to 14 clinical problems
  and 3 screening situations that required a moral choice are summarized. These data
  are part of a survey of 682 geneticists in 19 nations. Of 490 U.S. geneticists asked
  to participate, 295 (60%) returned anonymous detailed questionnaires. There was
  strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality
  overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial
  interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed;
  that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception,
  sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as
  reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal
  diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal
  anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should
  be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington
  disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about
  disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18
  other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness
  to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of
  XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they
  would give directive counseling. Women were more likely than men to say that they
  would perform prenatal diagnosis for maternal anxiety or for sex selection."
