input_text: 'The Confluence of Psychiatric Symptoms and Neurodegenerative Disease:
  Impact on Genetic Counseling. Hereditary neurodegenerative diseases can present
  with a psychiatric prodrome that overlaps with psychiatric symptoms that are not
  primary to these diseases. When individuals present for predictive testing while
  experiencing such symptoms, clinicians including genetic counselors, must proceed
  with caution and evaluate each situation on a case-by-case basis. Legitimate reasons
  may exist for moving forward with testing. Additionally predicting the consequences
  of testing is unrealistic so that the clinicians must do their best to prepare patients
  for both positive and negative results. A multidisciplinary team following the Huntington
  disease protocol remains the gold standard care for predictive testing for such
  patients. We discuss 3 case histories that demonstrate the complex nature of genetic
  counseling and testing in the presence of psychiatric symptoms, whether emanating
  from the disease itself or the results of living in an affected family.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
