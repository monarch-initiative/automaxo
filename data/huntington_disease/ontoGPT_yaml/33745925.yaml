input_text: Elderberry diet ameliorates motor function and prevents oxidative stress-induced
  cell death in rat models of Huntington disease.Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited
  neurodegenerative disorder which begins in the striatum and then spreads to other
  neural areas. Known as a progressive movement cognitive disorder, HD has no efficient
  therapy. Although the exact mechanism of HD is still unknown, several different
  etiological processes such as oxidative stress have been shown to play critical
  roles. Also, the current evidence indicates a strong correlation between immune
  activation and neural damage induced by neuroinflammatory and apoptotic agents in
  neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, natural products like Elderberry (EB) could be
  considered as a novel and potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of this
  disease. In this study EB was added to the daily ration of ordinary rats for two
  months in order to ameliorate inflammatory and oxidative responses in rats injected
  with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) in an experimental model of HD. Using Rotarod
  and electromyography setups, we showed that EB diet significantly recovered motor
  failure and muscle incoordination in 3-NP injected rats compared to the control
  group. Also, the molecular findings implied that EB diet led to a significant drop
  in 3-NP induced growth in caspase-3 and TNF-alpha concentration. The treatment also
  improved striatal antioxidative capacity by a significant reduction in ROS and a
  remarkable rise in GSH, which might be correlated with motor recovery in the tests.
  In sum, the findings demonstrate the advantages of EB treatment in the HD rat model
  with a score of beneficial anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.
