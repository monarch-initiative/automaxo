input_text: Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Pathology of Amyloid-beta.Mitochondrial
  dysfunction has been widely reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including
  in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and
  Huntington disease. An increasing number of studies have implicated altered glucose
  and energy metabolism in patients with AD. There is compelling evidence of abnormalities
  in some of the key mitochondrial enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, including
  the pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes, which
  play a great significance role in the pathogenesis of AD. Changes in some of the
  enzyme activities of the mitochondria found in AD have been linked with the pathology
  of amyloid-beta (Abeta). This review highlights the role of mitochondrial function
  in the production and clearance of Abeta and how the pathology of Abeta leads to
  a decrease in energy metabolism by affecting mitochondrial function.
