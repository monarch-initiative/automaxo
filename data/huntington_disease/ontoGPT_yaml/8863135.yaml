input_text: Modulation of blood-brain barrier permeability. Genetic and other defects
  leading to brain changes in Down syndrome, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis, Huntington disease, Gaucher disease, hypertension and other disorders
  are rapidly being identified. If brain access were possible, new candidates for
  gene replacement therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, immune proteins or growth
  factors might be used for treating these disease (Lowenstein et al., 1994; Wielbo
  et al., 1995). Further, a number of drugs, peptides, antibodies and biological response
  modifiers have proven valuable in inhibiting malignant, infectious and other pathological
  processes in vitro, but are unlikely to be employed clinically because of their
  limited access to brain.
