input_text: Neural tissue transplantation, repair, and rehabilitation. Transplants
  of cells and tissues to the central nervous system of adult mammals can, under appropriate
  conditions, survive, integrate, and function. In particular, the grafted cells can
  sustain functional recovery in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative conditions
  including genetic and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood and aging,
  ischemic stroke, and brain and spinal cord trauma. In a restricted subset of such
  conditions, cell transplantation has progressed to application in humans in early-stage
  clinical trials. At the present stage of play, there is clear evidence of clinical
  efficacy of fetal cell transplants in Parkinson disease (notwithstanding a range
  of technical difficulties still to be fully resolved), and preliminary claims of
  promising outcomes in several other severe neurodegenerative conditions, including
  Huntington disease and stroke. Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly
  suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects
  the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity,
  and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery.
  There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore
  the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace
  lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be
  integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training
  and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry.
  Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of
  clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive
  therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along
  with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.
