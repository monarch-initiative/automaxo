input_text: "Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 Activation Improves Motor Performance
  and Reduces Pathology in Heterozygous zQ175 Huntington Disease Mice. Huntington's
  disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive
  motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence
  indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays
  a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing
  glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here,
  we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3),
  which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology
  in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice
  with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks
  improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also
  reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial
  activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in
  mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase
  kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore,
  LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases
  both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results
  indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female
  mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell
  signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights
  the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics.
  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments
  and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial
  outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent
  cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists
  can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the
  importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying
  studies."
