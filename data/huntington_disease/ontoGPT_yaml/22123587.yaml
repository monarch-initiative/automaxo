input_text: "Westphal variant Huntington disease and refractory catatonia: a case
  report. A young woman with Westphal variant (juvenile) Huntington disease (HD) also
  developed catatonia. Catatonia is an underdiagnosed psychomotor syndrome often associated
  with neurological and psychiatric disorders, but it has rarely been documented in
  patients with HD. Catatonia usually responds to standard treatment with benzodiazepines
  and electroconvulsive therapy; however, this patient's catatonic syndrome did not
  improve until we augmented the standard treatment with amantadine and levodopa.
  The underlying pathophysiology and a neurochemical hypothesis of HD and catatonia
  can explain their comorbidity and the refractoriness of catatonia to treatment.
  Both conditions are linked to dysregulation of neurotransmitters in the striatocortical
  and corticocortical pathways. This understanding may serve as a guide for the use
  of nonstandard treatments. Our evidence also suggests that electroconvulsive therapy
  can be useful and safe in the treatment of HD."
