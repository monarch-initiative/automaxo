input_text: 'Informing about genetic risk in families with Huntington disease: comparison
  of attitudes across two decades.The low uptake of presymptomatic testing in Huntington
  disease prompted us to question family members on how they handle the transmission
  of information regarding genetic risk. We hypothesised that in 2019, parents would
  inform their at-risk children about their genetic risk more and at a younger age
  than in 2000, given the availability of prenatal diagnosis, French legislation changes
  since 2011, and recent therapeutic advances. We made a questionnaire available about
  the transmission of genetic information within families with Huntington disease
  in 2000 and 2019. We obtained 443 questionnaires (295 in 2019 and 148 in 2000).
  Participants were mainly at-risk for Huntington disease (n = 113), affected (n =
  85), and spouses (n = 154). In 2019, participants had a higher mean education level
  (p < 0.01) and a mean age of 44.1 +- 15.1 years (vs 48.1 +- 11.4 years in 2000,
  p < 0.01). They had been informed about the risk of being a carrier at around 30
  years of age (29.0 +- 14.2 in 2019 vs 32.2 +- 13.8 in 2000, p = 0.09). However,
  they would inform at an earlier age (<=18 years, 67% vs 59%, p = 0.16). Information
  on transmission risk had been given primarily by parents (45% vs 30%, p = 0.06).
  In addition, genetic testing for relatives unaware of their status was recommended
  more frequently in 2019 (46% vs 32%, p < 0.001). Respondents in 2019 recommended
  genetic testing more often but overall attitudes towards information and testing
  have not changed significantly over the 19-year time period since the questionnaire
  was first delivered even despite recent clinical trials potential disease modifying
  therapies.'
