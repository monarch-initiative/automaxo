input_text: "Autonomic dysregulation as an early pathologic feature of Huntington
  Disease.OBJECTIVE: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction has been described
  in adults with motor-manifest Huntington's Disease (HD) or those who are near their
  predicted motor onset. It is unclear if ANS dysfunction is present years prior to
  the onset of motor symptoms of HD. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we compared
  crude markers of ANS function between children with the gene-expansion that causes
  HD (GE group) who were decades from their predicted motor onset and gene-non-expanded
  children (GNE group). METHODS: We included participants from the Kids-HD study who
  were <18 years old. Linear mixed effects regression models were constructed that
  controlled for sex, age, and BMI, and included a random effect per participant and
  per family. We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic
  blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84)
  and GNE (n = 238) groups. We then grouped participants from the GE group based on
  their predicted years to onset (YTO) and compared their vital signs to the GNE group.
  RESULTS: The GE group had higher rHR (  = 3.83, p = 0.0064), SBP (  = 2.38, p =
  0.032), and CBT (  = 0.16, t = 2.92, p = 0.007). The mean rHR and CBT became significantly
  elevated compared to the GNE group in participants who had 15-25 YTO and those who
  had <15 YTO. The mean SBP of participants who had 25-35 YTO was significantly elevated
  compared to the GNE group. CONCLUSION: ANS dysfunction in HD seems to occur approximately
  20 years prior to the predicted onset of motor symptoms of HD."
