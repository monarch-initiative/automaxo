input_text: Retina Oculomics in Neurodegenerative Disease.Ophthalmic biomarkers have
  long played a critical role in diagnosing and managing ocular diseases. Oculomics
  has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights
  into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including
  electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser
  ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography
  have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect
  them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent
  of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be
  integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and
  prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review
  the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases
  including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and
  Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including
  eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to
  further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics
  opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity.
  Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for
  improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.
