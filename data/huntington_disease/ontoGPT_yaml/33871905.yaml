input_text: 'svReg: Structural varying-coefficient regression to differentiate how
  regional brain atrophy affects motor impairment for Huntington disease severity
  groups. For Huntington disease, identification of brain regions related to motor
  impairment can be useful for developing interventions to alleviate the motor symptom,
  the major symptom of the disease. However, the effects from the brain regions to
  motor impairment may vary for different groups of patients. Hence, our interest
  is not only to identify the brain regions but also to understand how their effects
  on motor impairment differ by patient groups. This can be cast as a model selection
  problem for a varying-coefficient regression. However, this is challenging when
  there is a pre-specified group structure among variables. We propose a novel variable
  selection method for a varying-coefficient regression with such structured variables
  and provide a publicly available R package svreg for implementation of our method.
  Our method is empirically shown to select relevant variables consistently. Also,
  our method screens irrelevant variables better than existing methods. Hence, our
  method leads to a model with higher sensitivity, lower false discovery rate and
  higher prediction accuracy than the existing methods. Finally, we found that the
  effects from the brain regions to motor impairment differ by disease severity of
  the patients. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to identify such
  interaction effects between the disease severity and brain regions, which indicates
  the need for customized intervention by disease severity.'
