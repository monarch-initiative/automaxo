input_text: "Progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington
  disease. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the progression of symptoms in the early and middle
  stages of Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: A survey of individuals with symptomatic
  HD completed by a first-degree relative. SETTING: The National Huntington Disease
  Research Roster for Patients and Families, Indianapolis, Ind. PARTICIPANTS: The
  survey included 1238 individuals with a minimum of a 6-year history of symptomatic
  HD. MEASURES: Participating families completed a series of surveys, including the
  Affected Individual Questionnaire, which consists of 19 physical, emotional, and
  cognitive signs commonly thought to occur during disease progression. The respondent
  indicates if each of the symptoms occurred and, if so, at what time during the course
  of the disease: (1) within 1 year, (2) within 2 to 5 years, (3) within 6 to 10 years,
  (4) after more than 10 years, (5) has not occurred, or (6) \"don't know.\" RESULTS:
  The symptoms are categorized into 6 onset periods. Involuntary movements are grouped
  alone as the earliest reported symptom. The second group is composed entirely of
  mental and emotional symptoms, including sadness, depression, and difficult to get
  along with. The third group includes clumsiness, sexual problems, lack of motivation,
  and suspiciousness/paranoia. As the disease progresses, a variety of motor, emotional/behavioral,
  and cognitive symptoms are experienced, including unsteadiness, trouble holding
  onto things, trouble walking, changes in sleeping patterns, delusions and hallucinations,
  intellectual decline, and memory loss. With the approach of late-stage HD, affected
  individuals begin to experience speech difficulty and weight loss. In the late stage,
  patients lose bowel and bladder control. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the symptoms of
  HD are fairly well characterized, their progression, especially in the early and
  middle stages, remains uncertain. Clarification of the disease progression is vital
  to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HD and to the evaluation of therapeutic
  agents that are designed to slow the progression of disease. The results of this
  study assist in clarifying HD progression from early involuntary movements and emotional
  changes to more overt motor symptoms and difficulty with activities of daily living."
