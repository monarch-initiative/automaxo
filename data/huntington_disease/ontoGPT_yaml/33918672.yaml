input_text: Genetic Screen in Adult Drosophila Reveals That dCBP Depletion in Glial
  Cells Mitigates Huntington Disease Pathology through a Foxo-Dependent Pathway. Huntington's
  disease (HD) is a progressive and fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease
  caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the huntingtin gene (HTT).
  In spite of considerable efforts, there is currently no treatment to stop or delay
  the disease. Although HTT is expressed ubiquitously, most of our knowledge has been
  obtained on neurons. More recently, the impact of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) on other
  cell types, including glial cells, has received growing interest. It is currently
  unclear whether new pathological pathways could be identified in these cells compared
  to neurons. To address this question, we performed an in vivo screen for modifiers
  of mutant huntingtin (HTT-548-128Q) induced pathology in Drosophila adult glial
  cells and identified several putative therapeutic targets. Among them, we discovered
  that partial nej/dCBP depletion in these cells was protective, as revealed by strongly
  increased lifespan and restored locomotor activity. Thus, dCBP promotes the HD pathology
  in glial cells, in contrast to previous opposite findings in neurons. Further investigations
  implicated the transcriptional activator Foxo as a critical downstream player in
  this glial protective pathway. Our data suggest that combinatorial approaches combined
  to specific tissue targeting may be required to uncover efficient therapies in HD.
