input_text: 'Efficacy and Safety of Fixed-Dose Deutetrabenazine in Children and Adolescents
  for Tics Associated With Tourette Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance:
  Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset
  of motor and phonic tics, often accompanied by behavioral and psychiatric comorbidities.
  Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved in the
  US for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia.
  Objective: To report results of the ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in
  Tourette Syndrome 2) study examining deutetrabenazine for treatment of Tourette
  syndrome. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 3, randomized, double-blind,
  placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted over 8 weeks
  with a 1-week follow-up (June 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019). Children and adolescents
  aged 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and active tics causing
  distress or impairment were enrolled in the study. Children were recruited from
  52 sites in 10 countries. Data were analyzed from February 4 to April 22, 2020.
  Interventions: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to low-dose deutetrabenazine
  (up to 36 mg/d), high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/d), or a matching placebo,
  which were titrated over 4 weeks to the target dose followed by a 4-week maintenance
  period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from
  baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS)
  for high-dose deutetrabenazine. Key secondary end points included changes in YGTSS-TTS
  for low-dose deutetrabenazine, Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression score,
  Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact score, and Child and Adolescent
  Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale
  score. Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events,
  laboratory parameters, vital signs, and questionnaires. Results: The study included
  158 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 11.7 [2.6] years). A total of 119 participants
  (75%) were boys; 7 (4%), Asian; 1 (1%), Black; 32 (20%), Hispanic; 4 (3%), Native
  American; 135 (85%), White; 2 (1%), multiracial; 9 (6%), other race; and 1 (0.6%),
  of unknown ethnic origin. Fifty-two participants were randomized to the high-dose
  deutetrabenazine group, 54 to the low-dose deutetrabenazine group, and 52 to the
  placebo group. Baseline characteristics for participants were similar between groups.
  Of the total 158 participants, 64 (41%) were aged 6 to 11 years, and 94 (59%) were
  aged 12 to 16 years at baseline. Mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was
  3.3 (2.8) years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 (6.6) points. At week 8, the
  difference in YGTSS-TTS was not significant between the high-dose deutetrabenazine
  and placebo groups (least-squares mean difference, -0.8 points; 95% CI, -3.9 to
  2.3 points; P = .60; Cohen d, -0.11). There were no nominally significant differences
  between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were
  reported for 34 participants (65%) treated with high-dose deutetrabenazine, 24 (44%)
  treated with low-dose deutetrabenazine, and 25 (49%) treated with placebo and were
  generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this fixed-dose randomized
  clinical trial of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome,
  the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified.
