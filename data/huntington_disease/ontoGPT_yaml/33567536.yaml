input_text: A Novel Triplet-Primed PCR Assay to Detect the Full Range of Trinucleotide
  CAG Repeats in the Huntingtin Gene (HTT).The expanded CAG repeat number in HTT gene
  causes Huntington disease (HD), which is a severe, dominant neurodegenerative illness.
  The accurate determination of the expanded allele size is crucial to confirm the
  genetic status in symptomatic and presymptomatic at-risk subjects and avoid genetic
  polymorphism-related false-negative diagnoses. Precise CAG repeat number determination
  is critical to discriminate the cutoff between unexpanded and intermediate mutable
  alleles (IAs, 27-35 CAG) as well as between IAs and pathological, low-penetrance
  alleles (i.e., 36-39 CAG repeats), and it is also critical to detect large repeat
  expansions causing pediatric HD variants. We analyzed the HTT-CAG repeat number
  of 14 DNA reference materials and of a DNA collection of 43 additional samples carrying
  unexpanded, IAs, low and complete penetrance alleles, including large (>60 repeats)
  and very large (>100 repeats) expansions using a novel triplet-primed PCR-based
  assay, the AmplideX PCR/CE HTT Kit. The results demonstrate that the method accurately
  genotypes both normal and expanded HTT-CAG repeat numbers and reveals previously
  undisclosed and very large CAG expansions >200 repeats. We also show that this technique
  can improve genetic test reliability and accuracy by detecting CAG expansions in
  samples with sequence variations within or adjacent to the repeat tract that cause
  allele drop-outs or inaccuracies using other PCR methods.
