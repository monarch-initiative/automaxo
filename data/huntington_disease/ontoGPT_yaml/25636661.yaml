input_text: "Validity of the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment
  Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) in individuals with Huntington disease (HD). PURPOSE:
  The reliability and construct validity of the 12-item World Health Organization
  Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) were examined in individuals with
  Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We examined factor structure (confirmatory factor
  analysis), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), floor and ceiling
  effects, convergent validity (Pearson correlations), and known-groups validity (multivariate
  analysis). RESULTS: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis replicated the six-factor
  latent model that reflects the six separate scales within the WHODAS 2.0 (understanding
  and communicating; getting around; self-care; getting along with others; life activities;
  participation). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.94, suggesting good internal
  consistency reliability. The WHODAS demonstrated a ceiling effect for 19.5 % of
  participants; there were no floor effects. There was evidence for convergent validity;
  the WHODAS demonstrated moderate significant correlations with other general measures
  of health-related quality of life (HRQOL; i.e., RAND-12, EQ5D). Multivariate analyses
  indicated that late-stage HD participants indicated poorer HRQOL than both early-stage
  HD and prodromal HD participants for all HRQOL measures. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide
  support for both the reliability and validity of the WHODAS 2.0 in individuals with
  HD."
