input_text: Multiparametric characterization of white matter alterations in early
  stage Huntington disease.Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic, fully penetrant
  neurodegenerative disorder. Widespread white matter damage affects the brain of
  patients with HD at very early stages of the disease. Fixel-based analysis (FBA)
  is a novel method to investigate the contribution of individual crossing fibers
  to the white matter damage and to detect possible alterations in both fiber density
  and fiber-bundle morphology. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy
  (DW-MRS), on the other hand, quantifies the motion of brain metabolites in vivo,
  thus enabling the investigation of microstructural alteration of specific cell populations.
  The aim of this study was to identify novel specific microstructural imaging markers
  of white matter degeneration in HD, by combining FBA and DW-MRS. Twenty patients
  at an early stage of HD and 20 healthy controls were recruited in a monocentric
  study. Using diffusion imaging we observed alterations to the brain microstructure
  and their morphology in patients with HD. Furthermore, FBA revealed specific fiber
  populations that were affected by the disease. Moreover, the mean diffusivity of
  the intra-axonal metabolite N-acetylaspartate, co-measured with N-acetylaspartylglutamate
  (tNAA), was significantly reduced in the corpus callosum of patients compared to
  controls. FBA and DW-MRS of tNAA provided more specific information about the biological
  mechanisms underlying HD and showed promise for early investigation of white matter
  degeneration in HD.
