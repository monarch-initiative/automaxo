input_text: Characterization of conditions and determination of practical tips for
  mtDNA level estimation in various human cells. Determination of mtDNA copy number
  in the cell is crucial to understand many cellular processes. Recently, the number
  of studies with the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content as the determinant
  of mitochondrial abnormalities increased greatly and is still growing, therefore,
  optimization of technical conditions for this analysis is crucial. Despite using
  similar laboratory protocols, some results cannot be compared between research centers,
  thus causing discrepancies in the assessment of mtDNA content. The aim of this work
  was to test which conditions of biological sample collection and storage affect
  estimation of mtDNA level relative to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) in the blood samples
  and dermal fibroblasts. We found that the time and temperature of sample storage,
  as well as the type of the blood sample (whole blood or leukocytes) influence the
  estimate of mtDNA/nDNA ratio in the blood. In the case of dermal fibroblasts collected
  from healthy control and Huntington disease patients, our data indicate that the
  passage number of cells is essential to obtain reliable results.
