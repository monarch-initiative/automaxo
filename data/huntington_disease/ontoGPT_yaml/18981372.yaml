input_text: "Weight loss in Huntington disease increases with higher CAG repeat number.
  OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused
  by an expanded number of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene. A hallmark of HD is
  unintended weight loss, the cause of which is unknown. In order to elucidate the
  underlying mechanisms of weight loss in HD, we studied its relation to other disease
  characteristics including motor, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances and CAG
  repeat number. METHODS: In 517 patients with early stage HD, we applied mixed-effects
  model analyses to correlate weight changes over 3 years to CAG repeat number and
  various components of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). We
  also assessed the relation between CAG repeat number and body weight and caloric
  intake in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. RESULTS: In patients with HD, mean body mass
  index decreased with -0.15 units per year (p < 0.001). However, no single UHDRS
  component, including motor, cognitive, and behavioral scores, was independently
  associated with the rate of weight loss. Patients with HD with a higher CAG repeat
  number had a faster rate of weight loss. Similarly, R6/2 mice with a larger CAG
  repeat length had a lower body weight, whereas caloric intake increased with larger
  CAG repeat length. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss in Huntington disease (HD) is directly
  linked to CAG repeat length and is likely to result from a hypermetabolic state.
  Other signs and symptoms of HD are unlikely to contribute to weight loss in early
  disease stages. Elucidation of the responsible mechanisms could lead to effective
  energy-based therapeutics."
