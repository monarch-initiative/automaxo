input_text: "Assistive Technology for Cognition and Health-related Quality of Life
  in Huntington's Disease. BACKGROUND: Assistive technology for cognition (ATC) can
  be defined as external devices aimed at supporting cognitive function. Studies in
  neurological populations suggest that use of ATC is a promising strategy to ameliorate
  negative effects of cognitive impairment and improve Health-related Quality of Life
  (HRQoL). There is a lack of studies on the effects of ATC in HD. OBJECTIVE: This
  study aimed to describe the use of ATC in patients with HD, and to investigate the
  association between ATC and HRQoL. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study,
  including eighty-four patients with a clinical HD diagnosis (stages I-V). Socio-demographic
  and clinical data were collected, including information regarding various aspects
  of ATC use and an evaluation of cognitive impairment was performed. The Unified
  Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Functional Capacity scale (TFC)
  and the EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale were used to evaluate functional ability and
  HRQoL. Descriptive analyses were conducted to describe ATC use and regression analyses
  to investigate associations between ATC and HRQoL. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent
  of the patients had ATC, and ATC was used most frequently in stages I-III. Information
  about ATC, needs evaluation and training was provided to 44%, 32.1% and 20.2% respectively.
  The regression analysis showed a significant association between TFC and HRQoL (beta
  value = -0.564, p = 0.001), but there was no association between ATC and HRQoL.
  CONCLUSIONS: One-third of all patients used ATC, mainly those with mild to moderate
  cognitive impairment (stage I -III). No association between ATC and HRQoL was found.
  More research is needed to investigate effects of ATC in HD."
