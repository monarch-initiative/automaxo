input_text: "Mutation-related magnetization-transfer, not axon density, drives white
  matter differences in premanifest Huntington disease: Evidence from in vivo ultra-strong
  gradient MRI.White matter (WM) alterations have been observed in Huntington disease
  (HD) but their role in the disease-pathophysiology remains unknown. We assessed
  WM changes in premanifest HD by exploiting ultra-strong-gradient magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI). This allowed to separately quantify magnetization transfer ratio
  (MTR) and hindered and restricted diffusion-weighted signal fractions, and assess
  how they drove WM microstructure differences between patients and controls. We used
  tractometry to investigate region-specific alterations across callosal segments
  with well-characterized early- and late-myelinating axon populations, while brain-wise
  differences were explored with tract-based cluster analysis (TBCA). Behavioral measures
  were included to explore disease-associated brain-function relationships. We detected
  lower MTR in patients' callosal rostrum (tractometry: p = .03; TBCA: p = .03), but
  higher MTR in their splenium (tractometry: p = .02). Importantly, patients' mutation-size
  and MTR were positively correlated (all p-values < .01), indicating that MTR alterations
  may directly result from the mutation. Further, MTR was higher in younger, but lower
  in older patients relative to controls (p = .003), suggesting that MTR increases
  are detrimental later in the disease. Finally, patients showed higher restricted
  diffusion signal fraction (FR) from the composite hindered and restricted model
  of diffusion (CHARMED) in the cortico-spinal tract (p = .03), which correlated positively
  with MTR in the posterior callosum (p = .033), potentially reflecting compensatory
  mechanisms. In summary, this first comprehensive, ultra-strong gradient MRI study
  in HD provides novel evidence of mutation-driven MTR alterations at the premanifest
  disease stage which may reflect neurodevelopmental changes in iron, myelin, or a
  combination of these."
