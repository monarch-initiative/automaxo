input_text: "Safety of Converting From Tetrabenazine to Deutetrabenazine for the Treatment
  of Chorea. Importance: Tetrabenazine is efficacious for chorea control; however,
  tolerability concerns exist. Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea,
  was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate
  the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine
  in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting,
  and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on
  December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United
  States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided
  a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After
  week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea
  control. Interventions: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide
  comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine
  regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs),
  clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales.
  Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score
  and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with
  HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age,
  52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled.
  Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric
  AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment.
  Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea
  control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1
  and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2];
  P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion
  to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively
  maintained chorea control."
