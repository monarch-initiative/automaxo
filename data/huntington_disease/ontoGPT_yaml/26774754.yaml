input_text: "Using Actiwatch to monitor circadian rhythm disturbance in Huntington'
  disease: A cautionary note. Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative
  disorder that is well recognised as producing progressive deterioration of motor
  function, including dyskinetic movements, as well as deterioration of cognition
  and ability to carry out activities of daily living. However, individuals with HD
  commonly suffer from a wide range of additional symptoms, including weight loss
  and sleep disturbance, possibly due to disruption of circadian rhythmicity. Disrupted
  circadian rhythms have been reported in mice models of HD and in humans with HD.
  One way of assessing an individual's circadian rhythmicity in a community setting
  is to monitor their sleep/wake cycles, and a convenient method for recording periods
  of wakefulness and sleep is to use accelerometers to discriminate between varied
  activity levels (including sleep) during daily life. Here we used Actiwatch( ) Activity
  monitors alongside ambulatory EEG and sleep diaries to record wake/sleep patterns
  in people with HD and normal volunteers. We report that periods of wakefulness during
  the night, as detected by activity monitors, agreed poorly with EEG recordings in
  HD subjects, and unsurprisingly sleep diary findings showed poor agreement with
  both EEG recordings and activity monitor derived sleep periods. One explanation
  for this is the occurrence of 'break through' involuntary movements during sleep
  in the HD patients, which are incorrectly assessed as wakeful periods by the activity
  monitor algorithms. Thus, care needs to be taken when using activity monitors to
  assess circadian activity in individuals with movement disorders."
