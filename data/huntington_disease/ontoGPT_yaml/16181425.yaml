input_text: Cystamine treatment is neuroprotective in the YAC128 mouse model of Huntington
  disease. Huntington disease (HD) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized
  by selective atrophy and cell loss within the striatum. There is currently no treatment
  that can prevent the striatal neuropathology. Transglutaminase (TG) activity is
  increased in HD patients, is associated with cell death, and has been suggested
  to contribute to striatal neuronal loss in HD. This work assesses the therapeutic
  potential of cystamine, an inhibitor of TG activity with additional potentially
  beneficial effects. Specifically, we examine the effect of cystamine on striatal
  neuronal loss in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. We demonstrate here for the first
  time that YAC128 mice show a forebrain-specific increase in TG activity compared
  with wild-type (WT) littermates which is decreased by oral delivery of cystamine.
  Treatment of symptomatic YAC128 mice with cystamine starting at 7 months prevented
  striatal neuronal loss. Cystamine treatment also ameliorated the striatal volume
  loss and striatal neuronal atrophy observed in these animals, but was unable to
  prevent motor dysfunction or the down-regulation of dopamine and cyclic adenosine
  monophsophate-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) expression in the striatum. While
  the exact mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of cystamine in YAC128
  mice is uncertain, our findings suggest that cystamine is neuroprotective and may
  be beneficial in the treatment of HD.
