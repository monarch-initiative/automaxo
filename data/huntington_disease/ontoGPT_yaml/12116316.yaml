input_text: 'Non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease.
  OBJECTIVES: Individuals at risk for Huntington disease face difficult decisions
  regarding their reproductive options. Most do not wish to pass on the gene for Huntington
  disease to their children, but may not be prepared themselves to undergo presymptomatic
  testing and learn their genetic status. For these reasons, many at-risk individuals
  with a family history of HD would choose a method of genetic diagnosis that would
  assure them that they can have children unaffected with HD without revealing their
  own genetic status (non-disclosing). We have shown that, with a carefully designed
  and executed programme of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic testing, one can
  successfully assist at-risk couples to have their own biological children who are
  free from Huntington disease, without forcing parents to confront knowledge of their
  own genetic status. METHODS: Couples where one partner was at 50% risk for Huntington
  disease underwent in vitro fertilization with preimplantation embryo biopsy and
  molecular analysis for Huntington disease where appropriate. RESULTS: After extensive
  counselling and informed consent, 10 couples underwent 13 in vitro fertilization
  and two frozen embryo transfer cycles in a programme for non-disclosing preimplantation
  genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease. In 11 cycles, embryos determined to be
  free of Huntington disease were transferred, resulting in five clinical pregnancies.
  One set of twins and three singleton pregnancies have delivered. One pregnancy resulted
  in a first-trimester loss. CONCLUSIONS: The option of non-disclosing preimplantation
  genetic diagnosis should be reviewed, along with other relevant medical options,
  when counselling at-risk Huntington disease families.'
