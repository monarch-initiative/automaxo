input_text: "Pearls & Oy-sters: Epilepsy is a key feature of pediatric-onset Huntington's
  disease.Pediatric-onset Huntingtons disease (PoHD) presents differently from adult-onset
  disease. Children typically exhibit regression in school performance, psychiatric
  features such as inattention, and oral motor dysfunction. Unlike adult-onset HD,
  in which seizures occur at approximately the rate of the general public, at least
  half of children with HD develop epilepsy and seizures can be a presenting feature
  of PoHD. Here we present the case of a 10-year-old boy with a history of language
  delay, motor regression, oral motor dysfunction, and tremor who presented with a
  first lifetime seizure. Given a family history of Huntingtons disease in his father,
  PoHD was considered, and a pathogenic allele with 88 repeats was confirmed in the
  child. As symptoms progressed, history alone could not differentiate abnormal movements
  from seizures. Continuous video electroencephalography helped to demonstrate epileptic
  myoclonic jerks and guide treatment."
