input_text: 'Late onset Huntington Disease: clinical and genetic characteristics of
  34 cases. We performed a retrospective observational study of thirty-four persons
  with late onset of Huntington Disease (HD) (onset range 60-79 years). CAG trinucleotide
  expansion size ranged from 38-44 repeats. Even at this late age a significant negative
  correlation (r=-0.421, p<0.05) was found between the length of repeat and age of
  onset. Important characteristics of these older subjects were: (1)Most (68%) were
  the first in the family to have a diagnosis of HD, (2) Motor problems were the initial
  symptoms at onset, (3) Disability increased and varied from mild to severe (4) Disease
  duration was somewhat shorter (12 years) than that reported for mid-life onset,
  (5) Death was often related to diseases of old age, such as cancer and cerebrovascular
  disease, (6) Serious falls were a major risk and (7) Global dementia may be associated
  with coincident Alzheimer disease. Recognizing these characteristics will help physicians
  and other health care providers better identify and follow the late onset presentation
  of this disease.'
