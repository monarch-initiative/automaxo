input_text: "Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care: lessons learned from a cohort
  of nursing home residents with advanced Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD)
  is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that progresses over decades and is ultimately
  terminal. As HD advances, patients are frequently placed in institutional care settings,
  including nursing homes and hospices where family, nursing staff, and interdisciplinary
  team members are challenged to help patients live to their highest potential and
  die with dignity. Edgemoor, a distinct part of the San Diego County Psychiatric
  Hospital, is a regional referral facility for patients with HD. Over the past 8
  years, we have cared for 53 patients with advanced HD and describe our experiences
  by presenting their demographic characteristics and the lessons we have learned
  in caring for them. Ultimately, we found that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's
  Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care Initiative provided a meaningful framework
  for setting clinical priorities. This framework is used to summarize the clinical
  lessons that nursing staff and interdisciplinary team members learned about caring
  well for institutionalized individuals with advanced HD."
