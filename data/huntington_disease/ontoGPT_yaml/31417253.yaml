input_text: "Curcumin-loaded nanoparticles: a novel therapeutic strategy in treatment
  of central nervous system disorders. Curcumin as a hydrophobic polyphenol is extracted
  from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. Curcumin is widely used as a dietary spice and
  a topical medication for the treatment of inflammatory disorders in Asia. This compound
  also possesses remarkable anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects with the
  ability to pass from the blood brain barrier. Based on several pharmacological activities
  of curcumin, it has been introduced as an ideal candidate for different neurological
  disorders. Despite the pleiotropic activities of curcumin, poor solubility, rapid
  clearance and low stability have limited its clinical application. In recent years,
  nano-based drug delivery system has effectively improved the aqueous solubility
  and bioavailability of curcumin. In this review article, the effects of curcumin
  nanoparticles and their possible mechanism/s of action has been elucidated in various
  central nervous system (CNS)-related diseases including Parkinson's disease, Huntington
  disease, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Amyotrophic Lateral
  Sclerosis. Furthermore, recent evidences about administration of nano-curcumin in
  the clinical trial phase have been described in the present review article."
