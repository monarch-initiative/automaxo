19621255	Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase deficiency and Huntington Disease using three different molecular approaches simultaneously.	PURPOSE: Description of the confluence of different molecular techniques to detect three different mutations in one cell. The man carries a 20 base pair insertion in exon 12 of the POR gene (c.1551_1552ins20), and the woman carries a point mutation in exon 8 of the POR gene (c.859G>C) plus a triplet repeat expansion in the HTT gene. METHODS: Huntington Disease (HD) had to be diagnosed using short tandem repeat (STR) markers linked to the HTT gene. The mutation c.1551_1552ins20 was analyzed by fragment size and c.859G>C was minisequenced. Furthermore, STR markers linked to the POR gene were included to support the diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase (POR) deficiency. RESULTS: Nine embryos were diagnosed in total: three as POR deficiency affected, two as HD affected, one as POR deficiency and HD affected, and two as carriers of the paternal POR deficiency mutation and healthy for HD. These two last embryos were transferred but no pregnancy was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: A successful procedure combining direct and indirect methods for the detection of three different mutations in a single cell has been achieved for the first time.
18069970	Stem cell-based cell therapy for Huntington disease: a review.	Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and no proven medical therapy is currently available to mitigate its clinical manifestations. Although fetal neural transplantation has been tried in both preclinical and clinical investigations, the efficacy is not satisfactory. With the recent explosive progress of stem cell biology, application of stem cell-based therapy in HD is an exciting prospect. Three kinds of stem cells, embryonic stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells, have previously been utilized in cell therapy in animal models of neurological disorders. However, neural stem cells were preferably used by investigators in experimental HD studies, since they have a clear capacity to become neurons or glial cells after intracerebral or intravenous transplantation, and they induce functional recovery. In this review, we summarize the current state of cell therapy utilizing stem cells in experimental HD animal models, and discuss the future considerations for developing new therapeutic strategies using neural stem cells.

32720531	Gene therapy and immunotherapy as promising strategies to combat Huntington's disease-associated neurodegeneration: emphasis on recent updates and future perspectives.	INTRODUCTION: Modulation of gene expression using gene therapy as well as modulation of immune activation using immunotherapy has attracted considerable attention as rapidly emerging potential therapeutic intervention for the treatment of HD. Several preclinical and clinical trials for gene-based therapy and immunotherapy/antibody-based have been conducted. AREAS COVERED: This review focused on the potential use of gene therapy and immuno-based therapies to treat HD, including the current status, the rationale for these approaches as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting it. Growing knowledge of HD pathogenesis has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets, some of which are now in clinical trials. Focus has been allocated to RNA and DNA-based gene therapies for the reduction of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), using Immuno/antibody-based therapies. EXPERT OPINION: While safety and efficacy of gene therapy and immunotherapy has been well demonstrated for HD, therefore much focus has now been shifted to disease-modifying therapies. This review defines the current status and future directions of gene therapy and immunotherapies. The review summarizes by what means HD genetic root cause modification and functional restoration of mHtt protein could be achieved by using targeted multimodality gene therapy and immunotherapy to target intracellular and extracellular mHtt.
28371942	Physical Activity Self-Management and Coaching Compared to Social Interaction in Huntington Disease: Results From the ENGAGE-HD Randomized, Controlled Pilot Feasibility Trial.	BACKGROUND: Self-management and self-efficacy for physical activity is not routinely considered in neurologic rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed feasibility and outcomes of a 14-week physical activity self-management and coaching intervention compared with social contact in Huntington disease (HD) to inform the design of a future full-scale trial. DESIGN: Assessor blind, multisite, randomized pilot feasibility trial. SETTING: Participants were recruited and assessed at baseline, 16 weeks following randomization, and then again at 26 weeks in HD specialist clinics with intervention delivery by trained coaches in the participants' homes. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: People with HD were allocated to the ENGAGE-HD physical activity coaching intervention or a social interaction intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Eligibility, recruitment, retention, and intervention participation were determined at 16 weeks. Other outcomes of interest included measures of mobility, self-efficacy, physical activity, and disease-specific measures of motor and cognition. Fidelity and costs for both the physical activity and social comparator interventions were established. RESULTS: Forty percent ( n = 46) of eligible patients were enrolled; 22 were randomized to the physical intervention and 24 to social intervention. Retention rates in the physical intervention and social intervention were 77% and 92%, respectively. Minimum participation criteria were achieved by 82% of participants in the physical intervention and 100% in the social intervention. There was no indication of between-group treatment effects on function; however, increases in self-efficacy for exercise and self-reported levels of physical activity in the physical intervention lend support to our predefined intervention logic model. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures may have introduced bias. CONCLUSIONS: An HD physical activity self-management and coaching intervention is feasible and worthy of further investigation.
18590443	Long-term follow-up of Huntington disease treated by bilateral deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus.	"Deep brain stimulation is now accepted as a safe and efficient treatment for movement disorders including selected types of dystonia and dyskinesia. Very little, however, is known about its effect on other movement disorders, particularly for ""choreic"" movements. Huntington disease is a fatal autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement disorders, progressive cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms. Bilateral chronic stimulation of the internal globus pallidus was performed to control choreic movements in a 60-year-old man with a 10-year history of Huntington disease. Chronic deep brain stimulation resulted in remarkable improvement of choreic movements. Postoperative improvement was sustained after 4 years of follow-up with a marked improvement in daily quality of life."

19667213	Progress and challenges in RNA interference therapy for Huntington disease.	Huntington disease is an incurable, dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein. Reducing mutant huntingtin expression may offer a treatment for Huntington disease. RNA interference has emerged as a powerful method to silence dominant disease genes. As such, it is being developed as a prospective Huntington disease therapy. Here I discuss the current progress and important remaining challenges of RNA interference therapy for Huntington disease.
11234911	Short-term effects of olanzapine in Huntington disease.	OBJECTIVE: The aim was to describe the short-term (6 months) effects of olanzapine on behavioral and motor clinical manifestations in a group of 11 patients with Huntington disease. METHOD: An open-pilot study of olanzapine (5 mg) in patients with clinical and genetic diagnosis of Huntington disease was used. The Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale for clinical assessment and the Total Functional Capacity score for the disease-stage evaluation were used. A statistical analysis was performed to compare the effects of olanzapine on the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale scores at time 0 (baseline) and at time 1 (6 months). Comparisons of motor scores, of single behavioral items, and of TFC scores were performed within the group. RESULTS: The behavioral assessment score of items regarding depression, anxiety, irritability, and obsessions showed a significant improvement (range of p, 0.0134-0.048). Given the total behavioral scores (sum of all the items investigated), five patients significantly improved their behavioral score after a 6-month treatment (range of p, 0.013-0.047). Choreic movements improved, although not significantly (0.05 < or = p < or = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine is a potentially useful antipsychotic drug, with significant short-term effects on behavioral changes, mainly in patients with severe psychiatric symptoms at the onset. It might be considered as a possible therapeutic choice for treatment of Huntington disease.
28947115	Contemporary health care for Huntington disease.	Providing medical care for people and families affected by Huntington disease (HD) can be a rewarding effort when realistic goals of improved quality of life and optimized functional status are set. Multiple disease symptoms can remit or improve with currently available pharmacologic and behavioral interventions, even though barriers exist that interfere with access to treatment. Connecting expert multidisciplinary teams with community-based care, developing treatment guidelines, and involving the HD family community in quality improvements can achieve an integrated system of health care delivery. Engaging people with HD in high-quality compassionate care will not only improve lives, it will also encourage participation in clinical trials that search for disease-modifying treatments that will reduce or bring the suffering of HD to an end.
14994927	[Dietetic management of patients with impaired swallowing].	Swallowing deficits may be present in patients with neurological, otolaryngoiatric or internal medicine diseases. These deficits impair their feeding capability, thus inducing malnutrition. Diet therapy in these conditions involves specific instructions for properly choosing, handling and eating food, in order to allow patients to preserve their autonomy and safety while eating, thus preventing malnutrition. We refer paradigmatically to patients with Huntington disease, which is the main neurologic cause of swallowing deficits, although these guidelines may be conveniently extended to other patients with impaired transit of food.
21960468	Adherence to use of a home-based exercise DVD in people with Huntington disease: participants' perspectives.	BACKGROUND: Individualized exercise instruction on a regular basis may be desirable for people with Huntington disease (HD). Sustained interventions, however, may not be the most feasible for lifelong disease management. It is critical, therefore, for physical therapists to find ways to facilitate engagement in independent exercise programs. The capabilities of DVD technology can make the DVD a useful format to facilitate engagement for people with HD who have motivational and cognitive problems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore how people with HD used a home-based exercise DVD and how it was perceived by the participants and their caregivers. DESIGN: An exploratory, mixed-method design was used in this study. METHODS: Fifteen participants with HD were provided with an exercise DVD, developed by the authors, to support their engagement in a home-based exercise program. Exercise diaries were used to record adherence rates. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore what factors affected the usability of the DVD. Conversations were audio recorded and fully transcribed. Content analysis approach was used to analyze the interviews. RESULTS: Most of the participants (11/15, 73.3%) adhered well to the use of the DVD. Participants felt that the exercises were suitable. Commitment of the caregiver as a key to the success of the program was the main theme that emerged from the data. Participants identified barriers and facilitators that affected adherence to using the exercise DVD and described management strategies that helped promote adherence to the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: The DVD was perceived to be suitable and supportive. The DVD could be appropriate for use in supporting people with HD to engage in exercise at home, either outside of therapy sessions or upon completion of a therapy program.
22123587	Westphal variant Huntington disease and refractory catatonia: a case report.	A young woman with Westphal variant (juvenile) Huntington disease (HD) also developed catatonia. Catatonia is an underdiagnosed psychomotor syndrome often associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, but it has rarely been documented in patients with HD. Catatonia usually responds to standard treatment with benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy; however, this patient's catatonic syndrome did not improve until we augmented the standard treatment with amantadine and levodopa. The underlying pathophysiology and a neurochemical hypothesis of HD and catatonia can explain their comorbidity and the refractoriness of catatonia to treatment. Both conditions are linked to dysregulation of neurotransmitters in the striatocortical and corticocortical pathways. This understanding may serve as a guide for the use of nonstandard treatments. Our evidence also suggests that electroconvulsive therapy can be useful and safe in the treatment of HD.
30191262	The effect of laquinimod, a novel immuno-modulator in development to treat Huntington disease, on the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel in healthy young women.	PURPOSE: Laquinimod is an orally dosed immuno-modulator currently under development for Huntington's disease (HD). Preclinical findings suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated. METHODS: In this randomized, phase-1 single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of 21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose. RESULTS: The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24 and Cmax of EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSION: The combination of COC and laquinimod treatment was found to be safe, tolerable, and devoid of any noticeable pharmacokinetic interaction.
21147489	The neurology and natural history of patients with indeterminate CAG repeat length mutations of the Huntington disease gene.	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate CAG repeat length (36-39) of the Huntingtin gene, HTT. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation 0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors.
23108692	A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of latrepirdine in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease.	BACKGROUND Latrepirdine is an orally administered experimental small molecule that was initially developed as an antihistamine and subsequently was shown to stabilize mitochondrial membranes and function, which might be impaired in Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of latrepirdine on cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Sixty-four research centers in Australia, Europe, and North America. PATIENTS Four hundred three patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and baseline cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10-26). INTERVENTION Latrepirdine (20 mg) vs matching placebo administered orally 3 times daily for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary outcome measures were cognition as measured by the change in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to week 26 and global function at week 26 as measured by the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview, which ranges from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included behavior, daily function, motor function, and safety. RESULTS The mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination score among participants randomized to latrepirdine (1.5-point improvement) did not differ significantly from that among participants randomized to placebo (1.3-point improvement) (P=.39). Similarly, the distribution of the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview did not differ significantly among those randomized to latrepirdine compared with placebo (P=.84). No significant treatment effects were detected on the secondary efficacy outcome measures. The incidence of adverse events was similar between those randomized to latrepirdine (68.5%) and placebo (68.0%). CONCLUSION In patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and cognitive impairment, treatment with latrepirdine for 6 months was safe and well tolerated but did not improve cognition or global function relative to placebo. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00920946.
34697770	Emerging Novel Approaches for the Enhanced Delivery of Natural Products for the Management of Neurodegenerative Diseases.	Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease affect any part of the brain. The complete mechanism of ND is unknown, but there are some molecular mechanism and chemical process. Natural compounds have better compatibility with the human body along with lesser side effects. Moreover, several studies showed that various natural compounds have significant neuroprotective, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for treating the different type of ND. In ND, natural compounds act by various mechanisms such as preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating destructed biomolecules before their accumulation affects cell metabolism, and improving the disease conditions. But due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) layer and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds, their delivery into the brain is limited. To minimize this problem and enhance drug delivery into the brain with an effective therapeutic dose, there is a need to develop a practical novel approach. The various studies showed that nanoformulations and microneedles (MN) containing natural compounds such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, chrysin, piperine, ferulic acid, huperzine A, berberine, baicalein, hesperetin, and retinoic acid effectively improved many ND. In this review, the effect of such natural drug-loaded nanoformulation and MN patches on ND management is discussed, along with their merits and demerits. This review aims to introduce different novel approaches for enhancing natural drug delivery into the brain to manage various neurodegenerative diseases.
18977004	Late onset Huntington Disease: clinical and genetic characteristics of 34 cases.	We performed a retrospective observational study of thirty-four persons with late onset of Huntington Disease (HD) (onset range 60-79 years). CAG trinucleotide expansion size ranged from 38-44 repeats. Even at this late age a significant negative correlation (r=-0.421, p<0.05) was found between the length of repeat and age of onset. Important characteristics of these older subjects were: (1)Most (68%) were the first in the family to have a diagnosis of HD, (2) Motor problems were the initial symptoms at onset, (3) Disability increased and varied from mild to severe (4) Disease duration was somewhat shorter (12 years) than that reported for mid-life onset, (5) Death was often related to diseases of old age, such as cancer and cerebrovascular disease, (6) Serious falls were a major risk and (7) Global dementia may be associated with coincident Alzheimer disease. Recognizing these characteristics will help physicians and other health care providers better identify and follow the late onset presentation of this disease.
28947114	The role of rehabilitation therapy in Huntington disease.	The role of rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.
19289118	A majority of Huntington's disease patients may be treatable by individualized allele-specific RNA interference.	Use of RNA interference to reduce huntingtin protein (htt) expression in affected brain regions may provide an effective treatment for Huntington disease (HD), but it remains uncertain whether suppression of both wild-type and mutant alleles in a heterozygous patient will provide more benefit than harm. Previous research has shown suppression of just the mutant allele is achievable using siRNA targeted to regions of HD mRNA containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To determine whether more than a minority of patients may be eligible for an allele-specific therapy, we genotyped DNA from 327 unrelated European Caucasian HD patients at 26 SNP sites in the HD gene. Over 86% of the patients were found to be heterozygous for at least one SNP among those tested. Because the sites are genetically linked, one cannot use the heterozygosity rates of the individual SNPs to predict how many sites (and corresponding allele-specific siRNA) would be needed to provide at least one treatment possibility for this percentage of patients. By computing all combinations, we found that a repertoire of allele-specific siRNA corresponding to seven sites can provide at least one allele-specific siRNA treatment option for 85.6% of our sample. Moreover, we provide evidence that allele-specific siRNA targeting these sites are readily identifiable using a high throughput screening method, and that allele-specific siRNA identified using this method indeed show selective suppression of endogenous mutant htt protein in fibroblast cells from HD patients. Therefore, allele-specific siRNA are not so rare as to be impractical to find and use therapeutically.
22897153	Dimethyl fumarate - only an anti-psoriatic medication?	Fumaric acid esters have been used successfully in the therapy of psoriasis vulgaris since 1959. In the last 17 years, many of the underlying mechanisms of anti-psoriatic action, such as a Th1/Th2 shift, a suppression of important leukocyte adhesion molecules, the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways in T-cells and recently anti-angiogenic action, have been discovered. Based on the knowledge of these immunomodulatory characteristics, fumaric acid esters have been shown to be effective or potentially effective in a multitude of dermatological as well as non-dermatological diseases. The range of new therapeutic targets reaches from multiple sclerosis to illnesses such as necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare and sarcoidosis. Experimental approaches offer promising, although preliminary, results on the treatment of cancer, malaria, chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and Huntington disease, to name but a few. This valued and well-known drug mainly prescribed by dermatologists is now experiencing a renaissance far beyond dermatologic applications.
21824087	Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration by means of coenzyme Q10 and its analogues.	Coenzyme Q10 is a small electron carrier of the respiratory chain with antioxidant properties, widely used for the treatment of mitochondrial disorders. Mitochondrial diseases are neuromuscular disorders caused by impairment of the respiratory chain and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation is fundamental in patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Furthermore, coenzyme Q10 and its analogues, idebenone and mitoquinone (or MitoQ), have been also used in the treatment of other neurogenetic/neurodegenerative disorders. In Friedreich ataxia idebenone may reduce cardiac hypertrophy and, at higher doses, also improve neurological function. These compounds may also play a potential role in other conditions which have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer disease. This review introduces mitochondrial disorders and Friedreich ataxia as two paradigms of the tight links existing between oxidative stress, respiratory chain dysfunction and neurodegeneration, and focuses on current and emerging therapeutic uses of coenzyme Q10 and idebenone in neurology.
25012999	Task-specific training in Huntington disease: a randomized controlled feasibility trial.	BACKGROUND: Task-specific training may be a suitable intervention to address mobility limitations in people with Huntington disease (HD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of goal-directed, task-specific mobility training for individuals with mid-stage HD. DESIGN: This study was a randomized, blinded, feasibility trial; participants were randomly assigned to control (usual care) and intervention groups. SETTING: This multisite study was conducted in 6 sites in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Thirty individuals with mid-stage HD (13 men, 17 women; mean age=57.0 years, SD=10.1) were enrolled and randomly assigned to study groups. INTERVENTION: Task-specific training was conducted by physical therapists in participants' homes, focusing on walking, sit-to-stand transfers, and standing, twice a week for 8 weeks. Goal attainment scaling was used to individualize the intervention and monitor achievement of personal goals. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence and adverse events were recorded. Adjusted between-group comparisons on standardized outcome measures were conducted at 8 and 16 weeks to determine effect sizes. RESULTS: Loss to follow-up was minimal (n=2); adherence in the intervention group was excellent (96.9%). Ninety-two percent of goals were achieved at the end of the intervention; 46% of the participants achieved much better than expected outcomes. Effect sizes on all measures were small. LIMITATIONS: Measurements of walking endurance were lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of and excellent adherence to a home-based, task-specific training program, in which most participants exceeded goal expectations, are encouraging given the range of motivational, behavioral, and mobility issues in people with HD. The design of the intervention in terms of frequency (dose), intensity (aerobic versus anaerobic), and specificity (focused training on individual tasks) may not have been sufficient to elicit any systematic effects. Thus, a larger-scale trial of this specific intervention does not seem warranted.
30950323	Attending to Total Pain in Juvenile Huntington Disease: A Case Report Informed by Narrative Review of the Literature.	OBJECTIVES: To consider the impact of juvenile Huntington disease (JHD) from a biomedical, symptom burden, and total pain palliative care perspective. METHODS: This case report was informed by a narrative review of the literature with inclusion of expert opinion from pediatric palliative care, an adult and pediatric neurologist, and a child psychiatrist. Audio-recorded qualitative interview and coauthorship with the pediatric patient's primary caregiver (his mother). RESULTS: The JHD impacts all domains of child and family function. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Application of the concept of total pain to JHD informs and guides care for this complex, challenging condition.
21285520	The importance of integrating basic and clinical research toward the development of new therapies for Huntington disease.	Huntington disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that results from expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. There are currently no effective treatments for this devastating disease. Given its monogenic nature, disease modification therapies for HD should be theoretically feasible. Currently, pharmacological therapies aimed at disease modification by altering levels of HTT protein are in late-stage preclinical development. Here, we review current efforts to develop new treatments for HD based on our current understanding of HTT function and the main pathological mechanisms. We emphasize the need to enhance translational efforts and highlight the importance of aligning the clinical and basic research communities to validate existing hypotheses in clinical studies. Human and animal therapeutic trials are presented with an emphasis on cellular and molecular mechanisms relevant to disease progression.
156313	Isoniazid therapy of Huntington disease.	We describe clinical and biochemical changes in seven patients with Huntington disease given isoniazid (INH) in dosages three to five greater than normally used in tuberculosis. Because INH inhibits the enzyme gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-T), and increases GABA content in the brains of experimental animals, it might correct the brain GABA deficiency characteristic of Huntington disease. Of six patients treated long enough to be clinically evaluated, one showed marked and two others showed signifciant improvement. High-dose INH therapy carries serious toxic risks, which are influenced by patients' acetylator phenotypes. Nevertheless, results are sufficiently promising to warrant further controlled trials of INH or other GABA-T inhibitors in Huntington disease.
34291654	Disparities in Palliative Care Utilization Among Hospitalized People With Huntington Disease: A National Cross-Sectional Study.	BACKGROUND: People with Huntington's disease (HD) often become institutionalized and more frequently die away from the home setting. The reasons behind differences in end-of-life care are poorly understood. Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for this neurodegenerative disease. It is unknown what factors are associated with in-patient specialty PC consultation in this population and how PC might be related to discharge disposition. OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge disposition. DESIGN: We analyzed factors associated with PC consultation for people with HD using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. An anonymized, cross-sectional, and stratified sample of 20% of United States hospitalizations from 2007 through 2014 were included using ICD-9 codes. RESULTS: 8521 patients with HD were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 321 (3.8%) received specialty PC. Payer type, (specifically private insurer or other insurer as compared to Medicare), income, (specifically the top quartile as compared to the bottom quartile), mortality risk, D.N.R., aspiration pneumonia, and depression were significantly associated with PC in a multivariate model. Among those who received PC, the odds ratio (OR) of discharge to a facility was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.32-0.58), whereas the OR of discharge to home with services was 2.25 (95% CI 1.57-3.23), even after adjusting for possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HD, economic factors, depression, and serious illness-specific factors were associated with PC, and PC was associated with discharge disposition. These findings have implications for the adaptation of inpatient PC models to meet the needs of persons with HD.
32250312	Huntington's Disease Clinical Trials Corner: April 2020.	In this edition of the Huntington's Disease Clinical Trials Corner we expand on the UniQure AMT-130 and on the Neurocrine Biosciences KINECT-HD trials, and list all currently registered and ongoing clinical trials in Huntington's disease.
35698434	Does physical activity improve motor function and gait in huntington disease? A systematic review and meta-analysis.	INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a degeneration of the brain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004), the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p = 0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50 to 3.16; p = 0.007). No benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of programs PA were observed for walking endurance lower limb functionality strenght and cognition function in low and moderate stage of HD. However, no benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. All authors included aerobic exercises in their programs but is unclear if vigorous and intensive PA is optimal for individuals with HD.
31907286	Clinical recommendations to guide physical therapy practice for Huntington disease.	OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.
27747393	Exercise effects in Huntington disease.	Huntington disease (HD) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms across a wide range of neurological domains, including cognitive and motor dysfunction. There is still no causative treatment for HD but environmental factors such as passive lifestyle may modulate disease onset and progression. In humans, multidisciplinary rehabilitation has a positive impact on cognitive functions. However, a specific role for exercise as a component of an environmental enrichment effect has been difficult to demonstrate. We aimed at investigating whether endurance training (ET) stabilizes the progression of motor and cognitive dysfunction and ameliorates cardiovascular function in HD patients. Twelve male HD patients (mean +- SD, 54.8 +- 7.1 years) and twelve male controls (49.1 +- 6.8 years) completed 26 weeks of endurance training. Before and after the training intervention, clinical assessments, exercise physiological tests, and a body composition measurement were conducted and a muscle biopsy was taken from M. vastus lateralis. To examine the natural course of the disease, HD patients were additionally assessed 6 months prior to ET. During the ET period, there was a motor deficit stabilization as indicated by the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor section score in HD patients (baseline: 18.6 +- 9.2, pre-training: 26.0 +- 13.7, post-training: 26.8 +- 16.4). Peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) significantly increased in HD patients ( [Formula: see text] = +0.33 +- 0.28 l) and controls ( [Formula: see text] = +0.29 +- 0.41 l). No adverse effects of the training intervention were reported. Our results confirm that HD patients are amenable to a specific exercise-induced therapeutic strategy indicated by an increased cardiovascular function and a stabilization of motor function.
12842721	Neurophysiological study of facial chorea in patients with Huntington's disease.	OBJECTIVE: Choreic movements of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) may result from an abnormal control of sensory inputs. In order to further examine the pathophysiology of facial choreic movements (FCM), we carried out a neurophysiological study, including prepulse inhibition of the blink reflex (BR), in HD patients with and without FCM. METHODS: The study was conducted in 20 genetically proven HD patients with Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores of FCM ranging between 0 and 3, and in 12 age-matched healthy volunteers who served as control subjects. We counted the number of spontaneous blinks, recorded the electromyographic activity underlying FCM, and analyzed latency, amplitude, and duration of the BR responses to electrical and auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition was studied by comparing the responses to test trials with those to control trials. In control trials BRs were obtained to either a single supraorbital nerve electrical stimulus (EBR) or to a 90dB auditory stimulus (ABR). In test trials, the same stimuli were preceded by the prepulse, which was either a weak acoustic tone or a weak electrical stimulus to the third finger, delivered 30-150 ms before. RESULTS: Spontaneous blinking rate was abnormally low in 3 patients, and abnormally high in 9 patients. Mean duration of the BR was longer in patients than in control subjects. In prepulse trials, the percentage inhibition of the BR was abnormally reduced in 15 patients to at least one sensory modality, and significantly correlated with the score of FCM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the severity of FCM in patients with HD might be an expression of a disturbance in motor control partly related to an abnormal processing of sensory inputs. Such abnormality involves circuits used in prepulse inhibition of the BR.
36429634	Home-Based Exercise to Improve Motor Functions, Cognitive Functions, and Quality of Life in People with Huntington's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	Exercise in different settings has become a fundamental part of Huntington's disease (HD) management. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of home-based exercises (HBE) in HD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of HBE on motor, cognitive, or health-related quality of life (QoL) outcomes in HD were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD), the 95% confidence interval, and p-values were calculated by comparing the outcomes change between HBE and control groups. Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The included RCTs prescribed different types of HBEs, i.e., aerobic strengthening, walking, balance, and fine motor exercises. The HBE protocol length was between 6 and 36 weeks. The meta-analyses showed a significant effect of HBE intervention on motor function measure by Unified Huntington Disease Rating and overall QoL measure by Short Form-36 post-treatment respectively, [SMD = 0.481, p = 0.048], [SMD = 0.378, p = 0.003]. The pooled analysis did not detect significant changes in cognition, gait characteristics, or functional balance scales. The current study shows the positive effect of HBE in HD, especially on motor function and QoL. No significant adverse events were reported. The current results support the clinical effect of HBE intervention on motor function and QoL in HD patients. However, these results should be taken with caution due to the limited available evidence. Well-designed clinical studies that consider the disease severity and stages are required in the future.
30282372	Tetrabenazine Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Chorea Associated with Huntington Disease: A Retrospective Chart Review.	BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.
28628549	A Classification System to Guide Physical Therapy Management in Huntington Disease: A Case Series.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).
18394562	Symptomatic treatment of Huntington disease.	Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive heredoneurodegenerative disease manifested by chorea and other hyperkinetic (dystonia, myoclonus, tics) and hypokinetic (parkinsonism) movement disorders. In addition, a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, along with cognitive decline, contribute significantly to the patient's disability. Because there are no effective neuroprotective therapies that delay the progression of the disease, symptomatic treatment remains the cornerstone of medical management. Several classes of medications have been used to ameliorate the various symptoms of HD, including typical and atypical neuroleptics, dopamine depleters, antidepressants, antiglutamatergic drugs, GABA agonists, antiepileptic medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and botulinum toxin. Recently, surgical approaches including pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation, and fetal cell transplants have been used for the symptomatic treatment of HD. The selected therapy must be customized to the needs of each patient, minimizing the potential adverse effects. The primary aim of this article is to review the role of the different therapies, both available and investigational, for the treatment of the motor, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of HD, and to examine their impact on the patient's functionality and quality of life.
28692723	Safety of Converting From Tetrabenazine to Deutetrabenazine for the Treatment of Chorea.	Importance: Tetrabenazine is efficacious for chorea control; however, tolerability concerns exist. Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea, was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea control. Interventions: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales. Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled. Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment. Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1 and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively maintained chorea control.
32674730	Gene Therapy, A Novel Therapeutic Tool for Neurological Disorders: Current Progress, Challenges and Future Prospective.	Neurological disorders are one of the major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.
28971447	Huntington Disease: Genetics, Prevention, and Therapy Approaches.	Huntington's chorea or Huntington disease (HD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. The multidisciplinary study of HD has been the focus of an international collaborating effort of basic and applied research for several decades. HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low. Current treatment of HD is mostly symptomatic, but ongoing observational studies, clinical trials and development of new gene silencing technologies have provided hopeful results.

23231827	Management of upper extremity dysfunction in people with Parkinson disease and Huntington disease: facilitating outcomes across the disease lifespan.	Parkinson Disease (PD) and Huntington Disease (HD) are degenerative neurological diseases, which can result in impairments and activity limitations affecting the upper extremities from early in the disease process. The progressive nature of these diseases poses unique challenges for therapists aiming to effectively maximize physical functioning and minimize participation restrictions in these patient groups. Research is underway in both diseases to develop effective disease-modifying agents and pharmacological interventions, as well as mobility-focused rehabilitation protocols. Rehabilitation, and in particular task-specific interventions, has the potential to influence the upper extremity functional abilities of patients with these degenerative conditions. However to date, investigations of interventions specifically addressing upper extremity function have been limited in both PD, and in particular HD. In this paper, we provide an update of the known pathological features of PD and HD as they relate to upper extremity function. We further review the available literature on the use of outcome measures, and the clinical management of upper extremity function in both conditions. Due to the currently limited evidence base in both diseases, we recommend utilization of a clinical management framework specific for degenerative conditions that can serve as a guideline for disease management.
28859672	Safety and in vivo immune assessment of escalating doses of oral laquinimod in patients with RRMS.	BACKGROUND: Laquinimod is an oral immunomodulator in clinical development to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Laquinimod is in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Huntington Disease (HD). The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and cytoimmunologic effects following escalating doses of laquinimod in patients with RRMS. METHODS: One hundred twelve patients were randomly assigned to laquinimod/placebo in a series of separate dose-escalating cohorts starting from a daily oral dose of 0.9 mg/1.2 mg escalating to 2.7 mg, in 0.3 mg increments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 mg. No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported, which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9 mg). There was no increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses. Laquinimod-treated patients showed more abnormal laboratory levels in liver enzymes, P-amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, but most shifts were clinically non-significant. The exposure of laquinimod was dose proportional and linear in the tested dose range. An immunological substudy showed significant dose-dependent decreases in 6-sulpho LacNAc + dendritic cell (slanDC) frequency following laquinimod compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Laquinimod doses up to 2.7 mg were safely administered to patients with RRMS. An in vivo effect of laquinimod on the innate immune system was demonstrated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT Number: 2009-011234-99 . Registered 23 June 2009.
28947109	Preimplantation genetics and other reproductive options in Huntington disease.	Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a form of prenatal diagnosis applied to potential parents with known carrier status of a genetic disease, such as Huntington disease. It employs the use of polymerase chain reaction to amplify single cells from early embryos obtained with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques. PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring. Recent advances in sequencing may allow for higher success rates as the chromosomally abnormal embryos will be identified more easily and the embryos with the highest chance of survival will be transferred.
22162184	Placebo effect characteristics observed in a single, international, longitudinal study in Huntington's disease.	BACKGROUND: Classically, clinical trials are based on the placebo-control design. Our aim was to analyze the placebo effect in Huntington's disease. METHODS: Placebo data were obtained from an international, longitudinal, placebo-controlled trial for Huntington's disease (European Huntington's Disease Initiative Study Group). One-hundred and eighty patients were evaluated using the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale over 36 months. A placebo effect was defined as an improvement of at least 50% over baseline scores in the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale, and clinically relevant when at least 10% of the population met it. RESULTS: Only behavior showed a significant placebo effect, and the proportion of the patients with placebo effect ranged from 16% (first visit) to 41% (last visit). Nondepressed patients with better functional status were most likely to be placebo-responders over time. CONCLUSIONS: In Huntington's disease, behavior seems to be more vulnerable to placebo than overall motor function, cognition, and function
29089255	Huntington disease care: From the past to the present, to the future.	INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder without a cure. Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement. RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.
23446701	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation not beneficial in severe choreiform movements of Huntington disease.	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used therapeutically for reducing choreiform movements in patients with Huntington disease. There have been case studies reporting improvement in choreiform movements with administration of low-frequency rTMS lasting for a brief period. We report a case series where application of 7 consecutive sessions of bilateral low-frequency rTMS over the scalp area corresponding to supplementary motor area in patients with severe Huntington chorea did not reduce the intensity of choreiform movements even transiently. Hence, the proposed role of rTMS in reducing intensity of choreiform movements by altering neuronal plasticity may not hold true in severe cases.
29620999	Dose-Dependent Lowering of Mutant Huntingtin Using Antisense Oligonucleotides in Huntington Disease Patients.	On December 11 of 2017, Ionis Pharmaceuticals published a press release announcing dose-dependent reductions of mutant huntingtin protein in their HTTRx Phase 1/2a study in Huntington disease (HD) patients. The results from this Ionis trial have gained much attention from the patient community and the oligonucleotide therapeutics field, since it is the first trial targeting the cause of HD, namely the mutant huntingtin protein, using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The press release also states that the primary endpoints of the study (safety and tolerability) were met, but does not contain data. This news follows the approval of another therapeutic ASO nusinersen (trade name Spinraza) for a neurological disease, spinal muscular atrophy, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Combined, this offers hope for the development of the HTTRx therapy for HD patients.
18467429	Physical therapy intervention for people with Huntington disease.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical symptoms of Huntington disease (HD) include progressive movement disorders, cognitive deficits, and behavioral changes, all of which affect an individual's ability to participate in activities of daily living. To date, very few quantitative or qualitative studies have been conducted to guide physical therapists working with people with HD. The objective of this study was to characterize current physical therapist practice for people with HD, thus informing the development of standardized clinical care and future research studies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consultation with physical therapists working with people with HD was undertaken in the form of mailed questionnaires (n=49) and semistructured interviews (n=8). The development of the interview schedule was aided by consideration of the data obtained from the questionnaires. Themes identified from the interviews were considered in light of published literature and questionnaire responses. RESULTS: The main issues that emerged from the interviews were classified into 3 subthemes: (1) there is insufficient use of routine physical therapy-related outcome measures at different stages of HD, (2) there is underutilization of physical therapy services in managing HD (particularly in the early stages), and (3) the management of falls and mobility deficit progression is a key treatment aim for people with HD. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A conceptual framework for physical therapy intervention in HD was developed on the basis of the themes that emerged from the data in this study. Such a framework has utility for complex, progressive conditions such as HD and may facilitate clinical decision making and standardization of practice and affect the development of future physical therapy trials.
17562830	Neural transplantation in Huntington disease: long-term grafts in two patients.	OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials of fetal neural tissue transplantation for Huntington disease (HD) have been conducted with variable clinical results. However, no long-term analysis of graft survival and integration has been published. Here, we report the pathologic findings in two patients with HD who died 74 and 79 months after transplantation. METHODS: Methods used were pathologic examination, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Neostriatum from both patients showed typical neuropathologic changes of advanced HD. Surviving grafts were identified in both patients (6/6 sites and 7/8 sites, respectively) as well-demarcated nests within host neostriatum with associated needle tracts. Grafted neurons adopted either dominant calbindin/parvalbumin or calretinin immunoreactivity (IR). Few neurofilament, MAP-2, DARPP-32, tyrosine hydroxylase, or calbindin IR processes traversed the host parenchyma-graft interface despite minimal junctional gliosis. Immunohistochemistry for CD68 showed microgliosis that was more pronounced in host striatum than graft. Scattered CD45 and CD3 IR cells were present within grafts and host parenchyma. No ubiquitin IR neuronal intranuclear inclusions were identified in graft neurons, although these were prevalent in host cells. CONCLUSIONS: These two autopsies confirm previous findings of neuronal differentiation and survival of transplanted fetal tissue from the ganglionic eminence and also demonstrate viability of neurons from fetal transplants in human neostriatum for more than 6 years. Despite prolonged survival, these grafts had poor integration with host striatum that is likely responsible for lack of clear clinical improvement in these patients.
15883340	High-dose creatine therapy for Huntington disease: a 2-year clinical and MRS study.	
8866495	Characteristics of individuals with Huntington disease in long-term care.	"This is a retrospective review of 97 Huntington disease (HD) patients living in long-term care facilities in the Twin Cities. The purpose of the study was to describe the demographic features, patterns of behavior, weight change, nursing issues, medication use, and hospitalization in this population. On admission to the nursing home, the ""average"" HD patient was of either sex, 45 years old, previously employed, a high school graduate, and not married. One third had severe behavior problems. Half gained and half lost weight; weight loss was not a predictor of death. Almost all used central nervous system-active drugs, most commonly neuroleptics. Eighty-four percent were ambulatory on admission, but 88% of those who died were nonambulatory at the time of death. We concluded that (a) HD patients are demographically different from other residents of long-term care facilities, (b) weight gain can occur in some late-stage patients, (c) negative behavior is a significant problem but is restricted to a subset of patients, and (d) adapting creatively to increasing multifaceted disability is the greatest challenge to the staff in facilities caring for HD patients."
18235509	Pregnancy and active Huntington disease: a rare combination.	We describe the complicated course of a rare pregnant woman with symptomatic Huntington disease (HD) and discuss multidisciplinary care issues that may be encountered. A 31-year-old gravida 2, para 1 with advanced HD was admitted at 30 weeks gestation for preterm labor. Her course was complicated by progressive cognitive and physical impairment, dysphagia, malnutrition, diabetes insipidus, aspiration pneumonia, chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery and pyelonephritis. Pregnant women with symptomatic HD may present multiple challenges requiring extensive multidisciplinary input.
36513779	Cognition-oriented treatments and physical exercise on cognitive function in Huntington's disease: a systematic review.	Cognitive impairment is prevalent in Huntington's disease (HD), with no treatments currently available. While cognition-oriented treatments and physical exercise have shown efficacy in improving cognition in other populations, they have not been systematically reviewed in HD. This systematic review aims to examine the effects of cognitive and exercise interventions on cognition in HD, along with effects on psychosocial function, functional independence, and neuroimaging outcomes. Seventeen studies (three cognitive, seven exercise, seven combining cognitive and physical exercise) were included. While there was generally low certainty of evidence, interventions that included cognitive training appeared to have larger effect sizes on cognition, while physical exercise (alone or combined with cognitive rehabilitation or stimulation) showed negligible effect sizes. On the other hand, combined interventions had larger effects on psychosocial function. Finally, effects on functional independence appeared negligible following exercise and combined interventions, and effects on neuroimaging outcomes were inconclusive. Larger studies should seek to confirm the benefits of cognitive and physical interventions, and further explore changes in functional independence and neural outcomes.
11176966	Progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington disease.	"OBJECTIVE: To delineate the progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: A survey of individuals with symptomatic HD completed by a first-degree relative. SETTING: The National Huntington Disease Research Roster for Patients and Families, Indianapolis, Ind. PARTICIPANTS: The survey included 1238 individuals with a minimum of a 6-year history of symptomatic HD. MEASURES: Participating families completed a series of surveys, including the Affected Individual Questionnaire, which consists of 19 physical, emotional, and cognitive signs commonly thought to occur during disease progression. The respondent indicates if each of the symptoms occurred and, if so, at what time during the course of the disease: (1) within 1 year, (2) within 2 to 5 years, (3) within 6 to 10 years, (4) after more than 10 years, (5) has not occurred, or (6) ""don't know."" RESULTS: The symptoms are categorized into 6 onset periods. Involuntary movements are grouped alone as the earliest reported symptom. The second group is composed entirely of mental and emotional symptoms, including sadness, depression, and difficult to get along with. The third group includes clumsiness, sexual problems, lack of motivation, and suspiciousness/paranoia. As the disease progresses, a variety of motor, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive symptoms are experienced, including unsteadiness, trouble holding onto things, trouble walking, changes in sleeping patterns, delusions and hallucinations, intellectual decline, and memory loss. With the approach of late-stage HD, affected individuals begin to experience speech difficulty and weight loss. In the late stage, patients lose bowel and bladder control. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the symptoms of HD are fairly well characterized, their progression, especially in the early and middle stages, remains uncertain. Clarification of the disease progression is vital to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HD and to the evaluation of therapeutic agents that are designed to slow the progression of disease. The results of this study assist in clarifying HD progression from early involuntary movements and emotional changes to more overt motor symptoms and difficulty with activities of daily living."
17911155	Polyglutamine diseases: emerging concepts in pathogenesis and therapy.	Polyglutamine diseases are a family of neurodegenerative conditions that each derive from a CAG triplet repeat expansion in a specific gene. This produces a pathogenic protein that contains a critically expanded tract of glutamines. These prototypical protein misfolding disorders include Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and several spinocerebellar ataxias. This article reviews the emerging concepts in pathogenesis and therapy. Key ideas include the role of proteolytic cleavage, the importance of conformational change in the pathogenic proteins, the role of protein aggregation and the importance of transcriptional and metabolic disturbances. The relative role of functional perturbation in a target protein induced by a polyglutamine expansion is also discussed. Therapeutic strategies include counteracting cellular perturbations and direct targeting of polyglutamine protein expression, cleavage or conformation.
36706436	Factors Associated with the Place of Death in Huntington Disease: Analysis of Enroll-HD.	Background: Most people prefer to die at home. Hospice is the standard in end-of-life care for people with Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects people in middle adulthood. Yet, we have little knowledge regarding the place of death for people with HD. Therefore, the current state of knowledge limits HD clinicians' ability to conduct high-quality goals of care conversations. Objectives: We sought to determine the factors associated with the place of death in people with HD. Design: We obtained cross-sectional data from Enroll-HD and included participants with a positive HD mutation of 36 or more CAG repeats. Results: Out of 16,120 participants in the Enroll-HD study, 536 were reported as deceased. The mean age at death was 60. The leading place of death was home (29%), followed by the hospital (23%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of dying at a skilled nursing facility was significantly lower for those partnered (aOR: 0.48, confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.26-0.86). The aOR for dying on hospice compared to home was increased in a person with some college and above (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.21-4.75). Conclusions: Our data further suggest that models that predict the place of death for serious illnesses do not appear to generalize to HD. The distribution in the places of death within HD was not uniform. Our findings may assist HD clinicians in communication during goals of care conversations.
19280185	Riluzole protects Huntington disease patients from brain glucose hypometabolism and grey matter volume loss and increases production of neurotrophins.	PURPOSE: Huntington disease (HD) mutation increases gain-of-toxic functions contributing to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Riluzole interferes with glutamatergic neurotransmission, thereby reducing excitotoxicity, enhancing neurite formation in damaged motoneurons and increasing serum concentrations of BDNF, a brain cortex neurotrophin protecting striatal neurons from degeneration. METHODS: We investigated metabolic and volumetric differences in distinct brain areas between 11 riluzole-treated and 12 placebo-treated patients by MRI and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET scanning, according to fully automated protocols. We also investigated the influence of riluzole on peripheral growth factor blood levels. RESULTS: Placebo-treated patients showed significantly greater proportional volume loss of grey matter and decrease in metabolic FDG uptake than patients treated with riluzole in all cortical areas (p<0.05). The decreased rate of metabolic FDG uptake correlated with worsening clinical scores in placebo-treated patients, compared to those who were treated with riluzole. The progressive decrease in metabolic FDG uptake observed in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex correlated linearly with the severity of motor scores calculated by Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-I) in placebo-treated patients. Similarly, the rate of metabolic changes in the frontal and temporal areas of the brain cortex correlated linearly with worsening behavioural scores calculated by UHDRS-III in the placebo-treated patients. Finally, BDNF and transforming growth factor beta-1 serum levels were significantly higher in patients treated with riluzole. CONCLUSION: The linear correlation between decreased metabolic FDG uptake and worsening clinical scores in the placebo-treated patients suggests that FDG-PET may be a valuable procedure to assess brain markers of HD.
32796930	Huntington disease: new insights into molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities.	Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) and involves a complex web of pathogenic mechanisms. Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.
31720865	Music Therapy and Music-Based Interventions for Movement Disorders.	"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is emerging evidence that music therapy and other methods using music and rhythm may meaningfully improve a broad range of symptoms in neurological and non-neurological disorders. This review highlights the findings of recent studies utilizing music and rhythm-based interventions for gait impairment, other motor symptoms, and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) and other movement disorders. Limitations of current studies as well as future research directions are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple studies have demonstrated short-term benefits of rhythmic auditory stimulation on gait parameters including gait freezing in PD, with recent studies indicating that it may reduce falls. Demonstration of benefits for gait in both dopaminergic ""on"" and ""off"" states suggests that this intervention can be a valuable addition to the current armamentarium of PD therapies. There is also emerging evidence of motor and non-motor benefits from group dancing, singing, and instrumental music performance in PD. Preliminary evidence for music therapy and music-based interventions in movement disorders other than PD (such as Huntington disease, Tourette syndrome, and progressive supranuclear palsy) is limited but promising. Music therapy and other music and rhythm-based interventions may offer a range of symptomatic benefits to patients with PD and other movement disorders. Studies investigating the potential mechanisms of music's effects and well-controlled multicenter trials of these interventions are urgently needed."
26863152	Development and Delivery of a Physical Activity Intervention for People With Huntington Disease: Facilitating Translation to Clinical Practice.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).
18578798	Exploring supportive care for individuals affected by Huntington disease and their family caregivers in a community setting.	AIM: The aim of this research was to identify the needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their family members/carers and to ascertain the extent to which they were supported by the type of specialised service provided in this unit. BACKGROUND: The duration of the illness may be up to 30 years and there are far reaching implications for the affected person, family members and carers. Services for families need to provide expert psychological and practical support, whilst remaining planned and flexible. The aim of this research was to identify needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their carers and ascertain the extent to which they were supported by a specialised community service. METHODS: Five focus groups and three individual interviews were used to gather data from affected individuals, family, carers and staff of the unit (n = 33). A semi-structured discussion guide was used in every case. Data were analysed using an inductive coding technique. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged; (i) Transitions and the journey, (ii) Challenges in finding and providing support and (iii) The role of the unit in providing supportive care. While the service was seen as supportive, the need for flexibility was emphasised to facilitate the transition from unaffected to affected status. Affected individuals felt it was important to be known as the person they had been, despite the changes due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of service in a dedicated unit is an appropriate way to support affected patients and their carers. Enhancing understanding of the disease and allowing the individual to make choices can assist coping with this challenging disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is helpful to allow patients control over timing and frequency of contact with professionals. Improving understanding of the condition in the public and health professionals may enable patients to access a greater range of social activities.
38394831	CRISPR-Based Gene Editing Techniques in Pediatric Neurological Disorders.	The emergence of gene editing technologies offers a unique opportunity to develop mutation-specific treatments for pediatric neurological disorders. Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.
18520979	A study of chorea after tetrabenazine withdrawal in patients with Huntington disease.	OBJECTIVE: To assess tetrabenazine (TBZ) efficacy by evaluating the change in Huntington disease-associated chorea resulting from TBZ treatment withdrawal. METHODS: Thirty patients treated in the long term were randomized to 1 of 3 groups assigned to withdraw from TBZ in a double-blind, staggered fashion during a 5-day period. RESULTS: The chorea scores of subjects withdrawn from TBZ treatment increased by 5.3 units from days 1 to 3, whereas the scores of the group with partial or no withdrawal of TBZ treatment increased by 3.0 units (P = 0.0773). A post hoc analysis of the linear trend was positive for reemergent chorea (P = 0.0486). No serious adverse events were reported after abrupt withdrawal of TBZ treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The trend for reemergence of chorea in patients with Huntington disease who were withdrawn from TBZ treatment is consistent with the findings from previous studies, thus showing the effectiveness of TBZ in reducing chorea.
21796039	Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care: lessons learned from a cohort of nursing home residents with advanced Huntington disease.	Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that progresses over decades and is ultimately terminal. As HD advances, patients are frequently placed in institutional care settings, including nursing homes and hospices where family, nursing staff, and interdisciplinary team members are challenged to help patients live to their highest potential and die with dignity. Edgemoor, a distinct part of the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital, is a regional referral facility for patients with HD. Over the past 8 years, we have cared for 53 patients with advanced HD and describe our experiences by presenting their demographic characteristics and the lessons we have learned in caring for them. Ultimately, we found that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care Initiative provided a meaningful framework for setting clinical priorities. This framework is used to summarize the clinical lessons that nursing staff and interdisciplinary team members learned about caring well for institutionalized individuals with advanced HD.
20178144	Lumbar puncture alleviates chorea in a patient with Huntington's disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus.	A 44-year-old African-American male was admitted to our hospital after a suicide attempt. He had depression, poor cognitive function, choreiform movements, difficulty pronouncing words, and difficulty walking. His symptoms had worsened markedly over several months. Chorea lead to genetic testing that confirmed a diagnosis of Huntington Disease (HD). A CT scan of the head showed wider ventricles than is typical of HD. The head CT and gait change suggested normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Lumbar puncture (LP) led to improved neuropsychologic test scores and walking thereby supporting the diagnosis of NPH. Surprisingly, the LP also led to an 80% improvement of chorea. There are two other reports of an association between HD and NPH. NPH should be considered in HD patients with atypical symptoms, such as the inability to walk or rapid progression, as its treatment may lead to improved cognition, gait, and chorea.
24375941	Results of the citalopram to enhance cognition in Huntington disease trial.	BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate citalopram for executive functioning in Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. Thirty-three adults with HD, cognitive complaints, and no depression (Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] rating scale <= 12) were administered citalopram 20 mg or placebo (7 visits, 20 weeks), with practice and placebo run-ins. The primary outcome was change in executive functioning. RESULTS: The intent to treat analysis was controlled for practice effects, comparing visits 1 and 2 to visits 5 and 6 for citalopram versus placebo. There were no significant benefits on the executive function composite (treatment-placebo mean difference -0.167; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.361 to 0.028; P = .092). Citalopram participants showed improved clinician-rated depression symptoms on the HAM-D (t = -2.02; P = 0.05). There were no group differences on motor ratings, self-reported executive functions, psychiatric symptoms, or functional status. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that short-term treatment with citalopram improved executive functions in HD. Despite excluding patients with active depression, participants on citalopram showed improved mood, raising the possibility of efficacy for subsyndromal depression in HD.

24792485	Perspectives of drug-based neuroprotection targeting mitochondria.	Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in most neurodegenerative diseases. These anomalies include bioenergetic defect, respiratory chain-induced oxidative stress, defects of mitochondrial dynamics, increase sensitivity to apoptosis, and accumulation of damaged mitochondria with instable mitochondrial DNA. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited mitochondrial disorders but most have no effective therapies. The development of new metabolic treatments will be useful not only for rare mitochondrial disorders but also for the wide spectrum of common age-related neurodegenerative diseases shown to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. A better understanding of the mitochondrial regulating pathways raised several promising perspectives of neuroprotection. This review focuses on the pharmacological approaches to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis, the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy, scavenging free radicals and also dietary measures such as ketogenic diet.

21209352	It wasn't Witchcraft--It was Huntington Disease!	Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, incurable, progressive disorder that manifests with chorea and behavioral and cognitive impairment. The disease usually occurs during the fourth or fifth decade of life; however, it may present at any age. Clinical suspicion is confirmed by genetic testing. Death occurs, on average, 15 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms. Here we report about a Hispanic woman and her family who were affected by the disease; this case illustrates the role of cultural values and beliefs in the decision-making process, as well as the importance of the physician's cultural competency in fostering a trusting relationship that may lessen the burden of catastrophic diseases on individuals, families, and society at-large.
21220204	Experience over fifteen years with a protocol for predictive testing for Huntington disease.	OBJECTIVE: To compile a comprehensive profile of the participants who had predictive testing from Huntington disease (HD) between 1994 and 2008 in Montreal, Canada. METHOD: This is a retrospective cohort study. The predictive testing protocol consisted of a telephone interview to give information about predictive testing and collect demographic data; a psychological assessment and counseling session; a session focused on medical and family history of HD; a session reserved for genetic counseling; a session where results were given to participants; and a follow-up telephone interview. RESULTS: A total of 181 applicants requested presymptomatic testing. 135 applicants (77 women and 58 men) completed the protocol and received test results while 40 withdrew. Of the latter, 3 manifested symptoms of the disease and were referred to a neurologist or psychiatrist, and 3 had previously been tested by linkage analysis. Participants usually mentioned more than one reason for requesting predictive testing but the most frequent was to put an end to uncertainty concerning their risk of illness. The proportion of positive and negatives test results was 40% and 54.1% respectively, significantly different from the expected 50% (p<0.01). Prenatal testing was not frequently requested. CONCLUSION: All the participants expressed satisfaction regarding their decision to be tested. None to our knowledge had a catastrophic reaction (major depressive disorder or psychiatric hospitalization, declared suicide attempt or suicide). Our study highlights that preparation for receiving test results is a psychologically complex process for which appropriate support in a timely fashion is critical. We feel that a cautious and ethical case by case approach remains essential and that high standards of testing should be maintained because of the far reaching impact of test results.

26333259	Relationship between Nutritional Status  and the Severity of Huntington's Disease.  A Spanish Multicenter Dietary Intake Study.	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of nutrition status on Huntington's disease (HD) severity. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of nutritional factors with HD severity. METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional, national multicenter study. Participants were selected from a Spanish cohort of patients who participate in the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN). The frequency of food consumption, caloric and nutrients intake in patients with HD were assessed using validated questionnaires for the Spanish population, and calculated using Alimentaci on and Salud, version 2.0, and the Spanish Dietary Recommended Intakes were used as the gold standard. Disease severity was assessed using the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) and Total Functional Capacity (TFC). Logistic regression models were performed using the TFC as the dependent variable, and the macro-micronutrients as the independent variables, adjusted for age, gender, education, physical activity, and intake of supplements. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty four patients with HD were included (59% women), mean age of 47.41+-14.26 years, median TFC 9 (3-13), median UHDRS motor score of 33.5 (3.75-56), 75.8% with normal-high caloric intake, 55.4% normal BMI, and 54.4% with medium-high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Compared to patients with mild-moderate HD, patients with severe HD had higher caloric intake (p = 0.02), and similar BMI (p = 0.33). Advanced HD was associated with higher intake of water-soluble vitamins (OR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.12-3.85, p = 0.02), and minerals (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.09- 3.19, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An adequate dietary intake prevents against weight loss in patients with advanced HD, but it is not associated with better functional state.
18087226	[Current cell therapy strategies for repairing the central nervous system].	"One of the chief contemporary goals of neurologists and neuroscientists is to find a way to overcome the debilitating effects of brain diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Since very few molecules have been found to be efficient in curing the patients and even halting the progression of the symptoms, cell therapy is now seen as an attractive alternative. Two therapeutic strategies are currently under investigation: i) the ""substitution"" strategy, based on grafts of cells capable of differentiating in the appropriate cells and restoring lost functions and ii) the ""neuroprotective"" or ""conservative"" strategy aiming to increase the resistance of spared cells to the toxicity of their environment and to reinforce the body's own mechanisms of healing. Twenty years ago, foetal neuroblasts were the first cells to be transplanted in the brains of patients with Parkinson's or Huntington disease. A phase II clinical trial is presently conducted in France for the latter disorder. However, the numerous ethical and technical issues raised by the use of embryonic and foetal cells have directed the focus of clinicians and researchers towards substitute cell types. In this review, we summarise the main findings of the most recent basic studies and clinical trials based on: i) the grafting of surrogate adult cells such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and olfactory ensheathing cells; ii) the potential therapeutic applications of neuropoiesis - the persistent neurogenesis in the brain - as a source for tissue engraftment and as self-repair by a person's own indigenous population of pluripotent cells and iii) immune-based therapy (autologous activated macrophages and T cell vaccination) as well as administration of immunomodulatory molecules. Unexpectedly, it has been found that undifferentiated adult stem cells can display immune-like functions when they home in on an inflamed brain area while immune cells and immunosuppressors can improve functional and morphological recovery when administered within the appropriate time-window. On the one hand, outcomes from substitution therapy trials are encouraging. They pave the way for an enlarged use of various adult cell types for various neurological disorders. On the other hand, clinical benefits of the neuroprotective therapy, still under close scrutiny, look rather promising. It is likely that, in a close future, the two strategies will be combined in order to efficiently repair the pathological, the damaged or the senescent brain."
30616867	Recent advances in the therapeutic development for Huntington disease.	INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.
22672573	Physical therapy in Huntington's disease--toward objective assessments?	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physical therapy is recommended for the treatment of Huntington's disease, but reliable studies investigating its efficacy are almost non-existent. This may in part be due to the lack of suitable outcome measures. Therefore, we investigated the applicability of novel quantitative and objective assessments of motor dysfunction in the evaluation of physical therapy interventions aimed at improving gait and posture. METHODS: Twelve patients with Huntington disease received a predefined twice-weekly intervention focusing on posture and gait over 6 weeks. The GAITRite mat and a force plate were used for objective and quantitative assessments. The Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score, the timed Up &Go test, and the Berg Balance Scale were used as clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen in GAITRite measures after therapy. Improvements were also seen in the Up & Go test and Berg Balance Scale, whereas force plate measures and Total Motor Scores did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that physical therapy has a positive effect on gait in Huntington's disease. The study shows that objective and quantitative measures of gait and posture may serve as endpoints in trials assessing the efficacy of physical therapy. They should be explored further in larger trials applying a randomized controlled setting.
28265888	Huntington Disease: Linking Pathogenesis to the Development of Experimental Therapeutics.	Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin gene. At present, the HD field is experiencing exciting times with the assessment for the first time in human subjects of interventions aimed at core disease mechanisms. Out of a portfolio of interventions that claim a potential disease-modifying effect in HD, the target huntingtin has more robust validation. In this review, we discuss the spectrum of huntingtin-lowering therapies that are currently being considered. We provide a critical appraisal of the validation of huntingtin as a drug target, describing the advantages, challenges, and limitations of the proposed therapeutic interventions. The development of these new therapies relies strongly on the knowledge of HD pathogenesis and the ability to translate this knowledge into validated pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Altogether, the goal is to support a rational drug development that is ethical and cost-effective. Among the pharmacodynamic biomarkers under development, the quantification of mutant huntingtin in the cerebral spinal fluid and PET imaging targeting huntingtin or phosphodiesterase 10A deserve special attention. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics are eagerly awaited as the first interventions that may be able to change the course of HD in a meaningful way.
24699718	Quadruple deep brain stimulation in Huntington's disease, targeting pallidum and subthalamic nucleus: case report and review of the literature.	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents an established treatment option in a growing number of movement disorders. Recent case reports suggest beneficial effect of globus pallidus internus (GPi)-DBS in selected patients suffering from Huntington's disease with marked disabling chorea. We present a 41-year-old man with genetically confirmed HD following quadruple GPi- and subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS. Motor function was assessed by Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and by Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) presurgery and postsurgery for up to 4 years. Furthermore, cognitive, neuropsychiatric state and quality of life (QoL) including life satisfaction (QLS) were annually evaluated. Chorea assessed by AIMS and UHDRS subscores improved by 52 and 55 %, 45 and 60 %, 35 and 45 % and 55-66 % at 1-4 years, respectively, compared to presurgical state following GPi-STN-DBS. During these time periods bradykinesia did not increase following separate STN- and combined GPi-STN-DBS compared to presurgical state. Mood, QoL and QLS were ameliorated. However, dysexecutive symptoms increased at 4 years postsurgery. The present case report suggests that bilateral GPi- and STN-DBS may represent a new treatment avenue in selected HD patients. Clinically, GPi-DBS attenuated chorea and was associated with a larger effect-adverse effect window compared to STN-DBS. However, GPi-DBS-induced bradykinesia may emerge as one main limitation of GPi-DBS in HD. Thus, quadruple GPi-STN-DBS may be indicated, if separate GPi-DBS does not result in sufficient control of motor symptoms. Future controlled studies need to confirm if the present anecdotal observation of additive beneficial effects of GPi- and STN-DBS in a HD patient with severe generalized chorea and relatively intact cognitive and affective functions indeed represents a new therapeutic option.
24646433	Personalized gene silencing therapeutics for Huntington disease.	Gene silencing offers a novel therapeutic strategy for dominant genetic disorders. In specific diseases, selective silencing of only one copy of a gene may be advantageous over non-selective silencing of both copies. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Silencing both expanded and normal copies of HTT may be therapeutically beneficial, but preservation of normal HTT expression is preferred. Allele-specific methods can selectively silence the mutant HTT transcript by targeting either the expanded CAG repeat or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with the expansion. Both approaches require personalized treatment strategies based on patient genotypes. We compare the prospect of safe treatment of HD by CAG- and SNP-specific silencing approaches and review HD population genetics used to guide target identification in the patient population. Clinical implementation of allele-specific HTT silencing faces challenges common to personalized genetic medicine, requiring novel solutions from clinical scientists and regulatory authorities.

20081136	Anesthetic management of patients with Huntington disease.	BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with symptoms of chorea, dystonia, incoordination, cognitive decline, and behavioral difficulties. Abnormal responses to anesthesia have been reported in case reports and raised concerns regarding the safety of anesthesia in this patient population. METHODS: We performed a computerized search of the Mayo Clinic medical records database searching for patients with HD who underwent general anesthesia. Medical records were reviewed for anesthetic technique, medications used, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: We identified 11 patients with genetically confirmed HD who underwent 17 general anesthetics. Psychiatric medication use was common, with 6 patients using antipsychotics, 7 patients using antidepressants, and 3 patients using benzodiazepines. Succinylcholine was used in 7 anesthetics, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs in 11 anesthetics, all without adverse effects. Patients had normal responses to induction and maintenance of anesthesia without adverse effects. Serious postoperative complications did not occur. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous case reports, we found that patients with HD have normal responses to general anesthesia. However, the anesthesiologist should be aware of interactions between anesthetics and psychiatric medications frequently used by these patients. Measures should also be taken to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration because bulbar dysfunction may be a manifestation of this disease.
32479211	Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in neurodegenerative disorders: from literature to clinical practice.	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided a promising tool for cell therapy. Umbilical cord (UC) is one of the best sources of MSCs since its collection is noninvasive, and effortless, and the cells from this source are more capable and prolific. It has been proven that the differentiation, migration and protective properties of UC-MSCs are superior compared with other kinds of stem cells. Moreover, incurable neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Huntington, encourage scientists to apply UC-MSCs transplantation in order to find a definite treatment. This review will focus on the preclinical and clinical use of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical cord in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
32427942	Hyperpolarization of the subthalamic nucleus alleviates hyperkinetic movement disorders.	Modulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) firing patterns with injections of depolarizing currents into the STN is an important advance for the treatment of hypokinetic movement disorders, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). Chorea, ballism and dystonia are prototypical examples of hyperkinetic movement disorders. In our previous study, normal rats without nigro-striatal lesion were rendered hypokinetic with hyperpolarizing currents injected into the STN. Therefore, modulation of the firing pattern by injection of a hyperpolarizing current into the STN could be an effective treatment for hyperkinetic movement disorders. We investigated the effect of injecting a hyperpolarizing current into the STNs of two different types of hyperkinetic animal models and a patient with an otherwise uncontrollable hyperkinetic disorder. The two animal models included levodopa-induced hyperkinetic movement in parkinsonian rats (L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia model) and hyperkinesia induced by an intrastriatal injection of 3-nitropropionic acid (Huntington disease model), covering neurodegeneration-related as well as neurotoxin-induced derangement in the cortico-subcortical re-entrant loops. Delivering hyperpolarizing currents into the STN readily alleviated the hyperkinetic behaviors in the two animal models and in the clinical case, with an evident increase in subthalamic burst discharges in electrophysiological recordings. Application of a hyperpolarizing current into the STN via a Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode could be an effective general therapy for a wide spectrum of hyperkinetic movement disorders.
37040787	[Gene Therapy for Huntington Disease].	Englisch: Being one of the most common genetic neurodegenerative disease, Huntington's disease has been a model disease - also for gene therapy. Among the various options, the development of antisense oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus. Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene therapy against Huntington's disease.

Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells hold great promise for therapy of a number of degenerative diseases such as ischemic heart failure, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, sickle cell anemia and Huntington disease. They also have the potential to accelerate drug discovery in 3 ways. The first involves the delineation of chemical components for efficient reprogramming of patient's blood cells or cells from biopsies, obviating the need for cellular delivery of reprogramming exogenous transgenes, thereby converting hope into reality for patients suffering from degenerative diseases. Patients worldwide stand to benefit from the clinical applicability of iPS cell-based cell replacement therapy for a number of degenerative diseases. The second is the potential for discovering novel drugs in a high throughput manner using patient-specific iPS cell-derived somatic cells possessing the etiology of the specific disease. The third is their suitability for toxicological testing of drugs and environmental factors. This review focuses on these potential applications of iPS cells with special emphasis on recent updates of iPS cell research contributing to the accelerated drug discovery.
28947117	Making a measurable difference in advanced Huntington disease care.	Neurologists' role in the care of people with advanced Huntington disease (HD) (total functional capacity <7), often limited by a lack of clinical research to support good practice, includes the following: (1) provide comprehensive health records to an interdisciplinary care staff before admission to a more intense care setting (home health services, day program, assisted living, group home, long-term skilled nursing facility, palliative care); (2) consult with and refer to rehabilitation (occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech and language pathology), behavioral and psychiatric professionals for problem-solving strategies, which must be reviewed with direct care staff before implementation; (3) encourage and support qualitative and quantitative interdisciplinary research studies, and randomized controlled studies of nonpharmacologic interventions; and (4) assist in the development of meaningful measures to further document what works to provide a good quality of life for the patient and family and a comfortable thoughtful approach to a good death. Collaborative models of care depend on: (1) clear communication; (2) ongoing education and support programs; with (3) pharmacologic and rehabilitation interventions, always in the context of respect for the person with HD, a preservation of the individuals' dignity, autonomy, and individual preferences.
33852093	[Which interventions are recommended in the last phase of Huntington disease?]	Huntington Disease is a chronically progressive and neurodegenerative disease, which leads to death after 10 to 30 years of suffering and worsening. When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.
12116316	Non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease.	OBJECTIVES: Individuals at risk for Huntington disease face difficult decisions regarding their reproductive options. Most do not wish to pass on the gene for Huntington disease to their children, but may not be prepared themselves to undergo presymptomatic testing and learn their genetic status. For these reasons, many at-risk individuals with a family history of HD would choose a method of genetic diagnosis that would assure them that they can have children unaffected with HD without revealing their own genetic status (non-disclosing). We have shown that, with a carefully designed and executed programme of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic testing, one can successfully assist at-risk couples to have their own biological children who are free from Huntington disease, without forcing parents to confront knowledge of their own genetic status. METHODS: Couples where one partner was at 50% risk for Huntington disease underwent in vitro fertilization with preimplantation embryo biopsy and molecular analysis for Huntington disease where appropriate. RESULTS: After extensive counselling and informed consent, 10 couples underwent 13 in vitro fertilization and two frozen embryo transfer cycles in a programme for non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease. In 11 cycles, embryos determined to be free of Huntington disease were transferred, resulting in five clinical pregnancies. One set of twins and three singleton pregnancies have delivered. One pregnancy resulted in a first-trimester loss. CONCLUSIONS: The option of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis should be reviewed, along with other relevant medical options, when counselling at-risk Huntington disease families.

29383957	Physician perceptions of pharmacologic treatment options for chorea associated with Huntington disease in the United States.	"OBJECTIVE: To survey neurologists and obtain clinical perceptions of tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in patients with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients ""often"" or ""almost always"". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice."
27380342	Effect of Deutetrabenazine on Chorea Among Patients With Huntington Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.	IMPORTANCE: Deutetrabenazine is a novel molecule containing deuterium, which attenuates CYP2D6 metabolism and increases active metabolite half-lives and may therefore lead to stable systemic exposure while preserving key pharmacological activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine treatment to control chorea associated with Huntington disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest Huntington disease and a baseline total maximal chorea score of 8 or higher (range, 0-28; lower score indicates less chorea) were enrolled from August 2013 to August 2014 and randomized to receive deutetrabenazine (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45) in a double-blind fashion at 34 Huntington Study Group sites. INTERVENTIONS: Deutetrabenazine or placebo was titrated to optimal dose level over 8 weeks and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was the total maximal chorea score change from baseline (the average of values from the screening and day-0 visits) to maintenance therapy (the average of values from the week 9 and 12 visits) obtained by in-person visits. This study was designed to detect a 2.7-unit treatment difference in scores. The secondary end points, assessed hierarchically, were the proportion of patients who achieved treatment success on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the change in 36-Item Short Form- physical functioning subscale score (SF-36), and the change in the Berg Balance Test. RESULTS: Ninety patients with Huntington disease (mean age, 53.7 years; 40 women [44.4%]) were enrolled. In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean total maximal chorea scores improved from 12.1 (95% CI, 11.2-12.9) to 7.7 (95% CI, 6.5-8.9), whereas in the placebo group, scores improved from 13.2 (95% CI, 12.2-14.3) to 11.3 (95% CI, 10.0-12.5); the mean between-group difference was -2.5 units (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.3) (P < .001). Treatment success, as measured by the PGIC, occurred in 23 patients (51%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 9 (20%) in the placebo group (P = .002). As measured by the CGIC, treatment success occurred in 19 patients (42%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 6 (13%) in the placebo group (P = .002). In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean SF-36 physical functioning subscale scores decreased from 47.5 (95% CI, 44.3-50.8) to 47.4 (44.3-50.5), whereas in the placebo group, scores decreased from 43.2 (95% CI, 40.2-46.3) to 39.9 (95% CI, 36.2-43.6), for a treatment benefit of 4.3 (95% CI, 0.4 to 8.3) (P = .03). There was no difference between groups (mean difference of 1.0 unit; 95% CI, -0.3 to 2.3; P = .14), for improvement in the Berg Balance Test, which improved by 2.2 units (95% CI, 1.3-3.1) in the deutetrabenazine group and by 1.3 units (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) in the placebo group. Adverse event rates were similar for deutetrabenazine and placebo, including depression, anxiety, and akathisia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in improved motor signs at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of the effect size and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01795859.
16340384	Efficacy of levetiracetam in Huntington disease.	OBJECTIVE: Levetiracetam (LEV) is a novel antiepileptic drug characterized by a wide spectrum of action; no pharmacologic interaction and poor adverse events are reported. In animal models, effects of LEV are observed in basal ganglia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of LEV in reducing involuntary movements in subjects affected by Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: This was a single-center, short-term, open-label, controlled study. Patients had LEV as add-on therapy for 6 months. In the first visit patients were rated according to the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale. Every 2 months they were submitted to all these tests. LEV was added at the dose of 500 mg twice daily for the first 2 months and then the dosage was increased until 1000 mg twice daily for the next 4 more months. The authors enrolled 22 patients: 15 were assigned to the LEV group and 7 were enrolled as control subjects. RESULTS: No serious adverse events were experienced by the treated patients. After 6 months of treatment patients on LEV showed a significant reduction of involuntary movements, with a slight improvement of functional capacity compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Results of this short-term, prospective, controlled study indicates that in HD patients, LEV is effective in reducing involuntary movements, thus improving the quality of life.
16682542	Testosterone therapy in men with Parkinson disease: results of the TEST-PD Study.	BACKGROUND: Testosterone deficiency has been reported in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease, and Huntington disease. It is not known whether testosterone therapy (TT) in men with borderline hypogonadism and neurodegenerative diseases will be of substantial benefit. Previously, we reported that testosterone deficiency is more common in patients with PD compared with age-matched control subjects, and we also reported in 2 small open-label studies that some nonmotor symptoms responded favorably to TT. OBJECTIVE: To define the effects of TT on nonmotor and motor symptoms in men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. DESIGN: Double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center trial. PATIENTS: Two experimental groups: patients with PD who were receiving either TT or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either the study drug by intramuscular injection (200 mg/mL of testosterone enanthate every 2 weeks for 8 weeks) or placebo (isotonic sodium chloride solution injections). In patients in each group, the testosterone serum concentration was obtained at each study visit. During 2 study visits, testosterone levels were blindly evaluated and the intramuscular testosterone dose was increased by 200 mg/mL if the free testosterone value failed to double from the baseline value. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Questionnaire, and secondary outcome measures included measures of mood, cognition, fatigue, motor function, and frequency of adverse events. At the end of the double-blind phase, all patients were offered open-label TT and were followed up after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Fifteen patients in the placebo group (mean age, 69.9 years), receiving a mean total levodopa equivalent dose of 924 mg/d, had a baseline free testosterone level of 47.91 pg/mL, compared with 15 patients in the TT group (mean age, 66.7 years), receiving an average total levodopa equivalent dose of 734 mg/d, who had a baseline free testosterone level of 63.49 pg/mL. Testosterone was generally well tolerated. More subjects in the TT group experienced lower extremity edema (40% vs 20%). In 2 patients, 1 in each group, prostate-specific antigen levels were elevated from baseline. The improvement in the TT group compared with the placebo group (1.7 vs 1.1) on the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Scale was not statistically significant. In addition, there were no significant differences in motor and nonmotor features of PD between the 2 groups, although a few subscales showed improvements (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, P<.04; and Backward Visual Span subtrial, P<.03). However, long-term open-label TT resulted in delayed but sustained improvement in subjects in the TT group who continued to receive treatment (n = 6) compared with subjects in the placebo group who elected not to receive TT (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone therapy was generally well tolerated in elderly men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. While there was no significant difference in the motor and nonmotor scales between the TT and placebo groups at the end of 8 weeks compared with baseline, this may be due to several study limitations, including small sample size, a strong placebo effect with intramuscular therapy, and short follow-up that did not allow measurement of delayed effects of TT in some subjects. Until more definitive studies are reported, practitioners should be particularly cautious in treatment of low testosterone concentrations in men with PD and borderline testosterone deficiency, and careful consideration should be given to the risks vs the benefits of TT.
16823111	Cell and tissue engineering and clinical applications: an overview.	Most human tissues do not regenerate spontaneously; this is why cell therapies and tissue engineering are promising alternatives. The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..). A large number of clinical areas stand as candidates for clinical applications: leukaemia and cancers, cardiac insufficiency and vascular diseases, cartilage and bone repair, ligaments and tendons, liver diseases, ophthalmology, diabetes, neurological diseases (Parkinson, Huntington disease, ..), .. Various aspects of this new regenerative therapeutic medicine are developed in this work.
16314222	Complementary therapy for the treatment of glaucoma: a perspective.	Although neuroprotective strategies and pharmaceutical agents have been initiated in the treatment of numerous disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including trauma, epilepsy, stroke, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,and AIDS dementia, none have yet been applied to the treatment of glaucoma. A prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.
24807843	Autophagy of mitochondria: a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disease.	The autophagic process is the only known mechanism for mitochondrial turnover and it has been speculated that dysfunction of autophagy may result in mitochondrial error and cellular stress. Emerging investigations have provided new understanding of how autophagy of mitochondria (also known as mitophagy) is associated with cellular oxidative stress and its impact on neurodegeneration. This impaired autophagic function may be considered as a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease. It can be suggested that autophagy dysfunction along with oxidative stress is considered main events in neurodegenerative disorders. New therapeutic approaches have now begun to target mitochondria as a potential drug target. This review discusses evidence supporting the notion that oxidative stress and autophagy are intimately associated with neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. This review also explores new approaches that can prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, improve neurodegenerative etiology, and also offer possible cures to the aforementioned neurodegenerative diseases.

8820402	Neurogenetic diseases: molecular diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.	A neurogenetic disorder is defined as a clinical disease caused by a defect in one or more genes which affect the differentiation and function of the neuroectoderm and its derivatives. Genetic findings in various neurogenetic disorders are discussed. Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant disorders caused by the expansion of trinucleotides (CAG) within disease genes. The CAG expansions appear to result in a gain of gene function. Prenatal, presymptomatic, and differential diagnostic tests are based on the detection of the repeat expansions. Point mutations within disease genes result in many additional neurogenetic disorders. An autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various types of craniosynostotic syndromes are described. The mutations in the disease genes also appear to result in a gain of gene function. Molecular diagnosis in these disorders is based on the direct examination of the mutated gene by methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing. In many neurogenetic disorders the disease gene has not yet been identified. Here molecular diagnosis relies on indirect approaches based on methods such as the analysis of linkage and of allelic association. Hereditary forms of dystonia are presented as examples. Common sporadic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases frequently have multifactorial causes. Investigations into the molecular basis and the development of diagnostic tests in these two important diseases are discussed. At present no curative therapies exist in neurogenetic disorders. Gene therapeutic approaches, however, provide promise for a cure in at least some of these diseases. Basic principles of gene therapy are explained and attempts at gene therapy in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are described. Finally, some of the many obstacles are summarized that must be overcome before gene therapy becomes feasible in most monogenic neurological diseases.
153484	Long term treatment of Huntington disease with L-glutamate and pyridoxine.	Decreased levels of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its synthetic enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase, have been found in the brains of patients with Huntington disease. In an attempt to augment GABA-mediated neurotransmission, daily doses of 25 gm of L-glutamate (the substrate for glutamic acid decarboxylase) and 500 mg of pyridoxine, its cofactor, were given to five patients with Huntington disease. This regimen was continued for 2 years. Assessment of motor and behavioral function indicated no improvement on this regimen.
27112684	Autoimmune movement disorders.	Autoimmune movement disorders encapsulate a large and diverse group of neurologic disorders occurring either in isolation or accompanying more diffuse autoimmune encephalitic illnesses. The full range of movement phenomena has been described and, as they often occur in adults, many of the presentations can mimic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington disease. Disorders may be ataxic, hypokinetic (parkinsonism), or hyperkinetic (myoclonus, chorea, tics, and other dyskinetic disorders). The autoantibody targets are diverse and include neuronal surface proteins such as leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) and glycine receptors, as well as antibodies (such as intracellular antigens) that are markers of a central nervous system process mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. However, there are two conditions, stiff-person syndrome (also known as stiff-man syndrome) and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), that are always autoimmune movement disorders. In some instances (such as Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody-1 (PCA-1) autoimmunity), antibodies detected in serum and cerebrospinal fluid can be indicative of a paraneoplastic cause, and may direct the cancer search. In other instances (such as 65kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) autoimmunity), a paraneoplastic cause is very unlikely, and early treatment with immunotherapy may promote improvement or recovery. Here we describe the different types of movement disorder and the clinical features and antibodies associated with them, and discuss treatment. 
6125919	Huntington disease: functional capacities in patients treated with neuroleptic and antidepressant drugs.	
25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management.	Huntington disease (HD) is a degenerative brain disease clinically manifested by the characteristic triad: physical symptoms including involuntary movements and poor coordination, cognitive changes with less ability to organize routine tasks, and some emotional and behavioral disturbances. For patients with HD, feeding is one of the problems they have to face. People with HD often have lower than average body weight and struggle with malnutrition. As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.

29687215	Agreement between clinician-rated versus patient-reported outcomes in Huntington disease.	BACKGROUND: Clinician-rated measures of functioning are often used as primary endpoints in clinical trials and other behavioral research in Huntington disease. As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible, there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM: The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures, differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related assessments are not feasible.
