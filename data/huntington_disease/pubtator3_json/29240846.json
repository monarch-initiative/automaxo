Recently, the number of studies with the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content as the determinant of mitochondrial abnormalities increased greatly and is still growing, therefore, optimization of technical conditions for this analysis is crucial. Despite using similar laboratory protocols, some results cannot be compared between research centers, thus causing discrepancies in the assessment of mtDNA content. The aim of this work was to test which conditions of biological sample collection and storage affect estimation of mtDNA level relative to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) in the blood samples and dermal fibroblasts. We found that the time and temperature of sample storage, as well as the type of the blood sample (whole blood or leukocytes) influence the estimate of mtDNA/nDNA ratio in the blood. In the case of dermal fibroblasts collected from healthy control and Huntington disease patients, our data indicate that the passage number of cells is essential to obtain reliable results.",
