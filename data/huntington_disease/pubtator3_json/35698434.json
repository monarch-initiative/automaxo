            "text": "INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a degeneration of the brain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004), the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p = 0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50 to 3.16; p = 0.007). No benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of programs PA were observed for walking endurance lower limb functionality strenght and cognition function in low and moderate stage of HD. However, no benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. All authors included aerobic exercises in their programs but is unclear if vigorous and intensive PA is optimal for individuals with HD.",
