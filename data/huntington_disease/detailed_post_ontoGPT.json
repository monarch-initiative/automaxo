Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a form of prenatal diagnosis applied to potential parents with known carrier status of a genetic disease, such as Huntington disease. It employs the use of polymerase chain reaction to amplify single cells from early embryos obtained with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques. PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring. Recent advances in sequencing may allow for higher success rates as the chromosomally abnormal embryos will be identified more easily and the embryos with the highest chance of survival will be transferred.",

BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that affects not only the motor but also the cognitive and the neuropsychiatric domain. In particular, deficits in mental state recognition may emerge already at early pre-manifest stages of the disease. The aim of this research was to explore the relation between visual scanning behavior and complex mental state recognition in individuals with pre-manifest HD (preHD). Eighteen preHD and eighteen age- and gender-matched healthy controls took the revised \"Reading the Mind in the Eyes\" test while their eye-movements were tracked. In addition to the expected deficits in mental state recognition, preHD showed abnormalities concerning all three scanning variables we considered, namely the absolute number of fixations (FC), the average fixation duration (AFD), and the percentage of time spent fixating (FTR). In preHD, FC and FTR but not AFD predicted mental state recognition over and beyond general disease-related declines in cognition and motor functioning. Notably, preHD showed abnormal vertical and horizontal fixation patterns, and these patterns predicted mental state recognition, suggesting the involvement of mechanisms related to the embodied processing of emotional stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that impaired facial mental state recognition in pre-manifest HD is partly due to emotional-motivational factors affecting the visual scanning of facial expressions.",

Synaptic dysfunction is a primary mechanism underlying Huntington disease (HD) progression. This study investigated changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density by means of 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging in the central nervous system of mice with HD. Methods: Dynamic 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging was performed at clinically relevant disease stages (at 3, 7, 10, and 16 mo) in the heterozygous knock-in Q175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates (16-18 mice per genotype and time point). Cerebral 11C-UCB-J analyses were performed to assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16 mo) disease stages. 11C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo. 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in mouse and human brain tissues. Results:11C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11C-UCB-J binding was detectable in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant reduction (P < 0.0001). 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice (P < 0.05). Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion:11C-UCB-J PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical application, 11C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.",

BACKGROUND: European studies identified the C9orf72 repeat expansion as the most frequent genetic alteration in patients with Huntington disease (HD)-like phenotypes but negative HD genetic testing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate C9orf72 repeat expansion frequency in individuals tested for HD in a North American tertiary referral laboratory. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three cases (115 positive and 258 negative for HD) were evaluated by genotyping PCR, with follow-up Southern blot and 5' repeat methylation status assessment by combined repeat-primed and methylation-specific PCR in a subset. RESULTS: Three cases (all HD-negative) tested positive: 2 had > 2,000 repeats and were methylated, 1 had 80-100 repeats and was unmethylated. Two cases (1 HD-positive and 1 HD-negative) had intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) and were unmethylated. The remaining 368 cases were negative (< 20 repeats). C9orf72 repeat expansion was absent in patients with HD and was identified in a small subset (1.2%) of patients with negative HD genetic testing. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C9orf72 repeat expansion does not coexist with HTT repeat expansion and that C9orf72 repeat expansion testing is unnecessary for patients with HD. In addition, C9orf72 evaluation may be considered for individuals negative for HD genetic testing. Similar to in previous studies, methylation of C9orf72 repeat expansion was limited to large expansions.",

Impairment of \"protein quality control\" in neurons is associated with etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The worn-out products of cell metabolism should be safely eliminated via the proteasome, autophago-lysosome and exocytosis. Insufficient activity of these degradation mechanisms within neurons leads to the accumulation of toxic protein oligomers, which represent a starting material for development of neurodegenerative proteinopathy. The spectrum of CNS linked proteinopathies is particularly broad and includes Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia, Pick disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many others. Although the primary events in etiopathogenesis of sporadic forms of these diseases are still unknown, it is clear that aging, in connection with decreased activity of ubiquitin proteasome system, is the most significant risk factor. In this review we discuss the pathogenic role and intracellular fate of the candidate molecules associated with onset and progression of AD and PD, the protein tau and alpha-synuclein in context with the function of ubiquitin proteasome system. We also discuss the possibility whether or not the strategies focused to re-establishment of neuroproteostasis via accelerated clearance of damaged proteins in proteasome could be a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of major neurodegenerative diseases.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

                    "text": "Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 Activation Improves Motor Performance and Reduces Pathology in Heterozygous zQ175 Huntington Disease Mice. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

Pridopidine is currently under clinical development for Huntington disease (HD), with on-going studies to better characterize its therapeutic benefit and mode of action. Pridopidine was administered either prior to the appearance of disease phenotypes or in advanced stages of disease in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. In the early treatment cohort, animals received 0, 10, or 30 mg/kg pridopidine for a period of 10.5 months. In the late treatment cohort, animals were treated for 8 weeks with 0 mg/kg or an escalating dose of pridopidine (10 to 30 mg/kg over 3 weeks). Early treatment improved motor coordination and reduced anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes in YAC128 mice, but it did not rescue striatal and corpus callosum atrophy. Late treatment, conversely, only improved depressive-like symptoms. RNA-seq analysis revealed that early pridopidine treatment reversed striatal transcriptional deficits, upregulating disease-specific genes that are known to be downregulated during HD, a finding that is experimentally confirmed herein. This suggests that pridopidine exerts beneficial effects at the transcriptional level. Taken together, our findings support continued clinical development of pridopidine for HD, particularly in the early stages of disease, and provide valuable insight into the potential therapeutic mode of action of pridopidine.",

Behavioral parameters (body weight, locomotor activity, grip strength, and narrow beam walk) observations were done on 1st, 7th, 14th, and 21st day after QA treatment. On 21st day, animals were sacrificed and rat striatum was isolated for biochemical (LPO, GSH, Nitrite), neuroinflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6), and neurochemical analysis (GABA, glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, DOPAC, HVA, 5-HIAA, adenosine, adenine, hypoxanthine, and inosine). QA treatment significantly altered body weight, locomotor activity, motor coordination, oxidative defense (increased LPO, nitrite, and decreased GSH), pro-inflammatory levels (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta), GABA, glutamate, catecholamines level (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin and their metabolites), and purines level (adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine). Spermidine (5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated these alterations in body weight, motor impairments, oxidative stress, neuroinflammatory markers, GABA, glutamate, catecholamines, adenosine, and their metabolites levels in striatum. The neuroprotective effect of spermidine against QA-induced excitotoxic cell death is attributed to its antioxidant, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonistic, anti-inflammatory properties, and prevention of neurotransmitters alteration in striatum.",

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical reliability of subjective sleep evaluation, based on sleep and psychometric questionnaires, by comparing the results with those obtained with laboratory-based video-polysomnography (V-PSG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty consecutive Huntington disease (HD) patients were enrolled. Subjective evaluation of sleep included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the sleep questionnaire for HD (HDQ), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Bologna questionnaire for sleepiness (BQ), the Berlin questionnaire, and the RBD questionnaire; the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group scale was administered to patients with positive screening. The psychometric evaluation included the Zung Anxiety Scale, the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory. All patients underwent V-PSG. RESULTS: In sleepiness evaluation, the Epworth score was above the cutoff in 6 subjects, and the BQ detected a \"high risk\" of sleepiness in 7 cases. The results were concordant in 24 and discordant in 5 cases. In the evaluation of sleep quality, the PSQI score was above the cutoff in 18 subjects. According to the HDQ, 10 subjects were poor sleepers. The results were concordant with the PSQI in 20 subjects. DISCUSSION: All comparisons between scale scores and PSG results showed poor or totally absent concordance between subjective and objective measures. SIGNIFICANCE: The subjective evaluation of sleep in HD patients shows a poor correlation with PSG results.",

IMPORTANCE: Greater body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is associated with improved survival among persons with Huntington disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Weight loss is common among persons with Parkinson disease (PD) and is associated with worse quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between change in BMI, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and total scores, and survival among persons with PD and to test whether there is a positive association between BMI at randomization and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analysis (from May 27, 2014, to October 13, 2015) of longitudinal data (3-6 years) from 1673 participants who started the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Exploratory Trials in PD Long-term Study-1 (NET-PD LS-1). This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of creatine monohydrate (10 g/d) that was performed at 45 sites throughout the United States and Canada. Participants with early (within 5 years of diagnosis) and treated (receiving dopaminergic therapy) PD were enrolled from March 2007 to May 2010 and followed up until September 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change across time in motor UPDRS score, change across time in total UPDRS score, and time to death. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of BMI on the change in motor and total UPDRS scores after controlling for covariates. Survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models of time to death. A participant's BMI was measured at randomization, and BMI trajectory groups were classified according to whether participants experienced weight loss (\"decreasing BMI\"), weight stability (\"stable BMI\"), or weight gain (\"increasing BMI\") during the study. RESULTS: Of the 1673 participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [9.6] years; 1074 [64.2%] were male), 158 (9.4%) experienced weight loss (decreasing BMI), whereas 233 (13.9%) experienced weight gain (increasing BMI). After adjusting for covariates, we found that the weight-loss group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score increased by 1.48 (0.28) (P < .001) more points per visit than the weight-stable group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score. The weight-gain group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score decreased by -0.51 (0.24) (P = .03) points per visit, relative to the weight-stable group. While there was an unadjusted difference in survival between the 3 BMI trajectory groups (log-rank P < .001), this was not significant after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Change in BMI was inversely associated with change in motor and total UPDRS scores in the NET-PD LS-1. Change in BMI was not associated with survival; however, these results were limited by the low number of deaths in the NET-PD LS-1. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00449865.",

Pridopidine is currently under clinical development for Huntington disease (HD), with on-going studies to better characterize its therapeutic benefit and mode of action. Pridopidine was administered either prior to the appearance of disease phenotypes or in advanced stages of disease in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. In the early treatment cohort, animals received 0, 10, or 30 mg/kg pridopidine for a period of 10.5 months. In the late treatment cohort, animals were treated for 8 weeks with 0 mg/kg or an escalating dose of pridopidine (10 to 30 mg/kg over 3 weeks). Early treatment improved motor coordination and reduced anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes in YAC128 mice, but it did not rescue striatal and corpus callosum atrophy. Late treatment, conversely, only improved depressive-like symptoms. RNA-seq analysis revealed that early pridopidine treatment reversed striatal transcriptional deficits, upregulating disease-specific genes that are known to be downregulated during HD, a finding that is experimentally confirmed herein. This suggests that pridopidine exerts beneficial effects at the transcriptional level. Taken together, our findings support continued clinical development of pridopidine for HD, particularly in the early stages of disease, and provide valuable insight into the potential therapeutic mode of action of pridopidine.",

Importance: Tetrabenazine is efficacious for chorea control; however, tolerability concerns exist. Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea, was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea control. Interventions: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales. Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled. Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment. Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1 and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively maintained chorea control.",

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical reliability of subjective sleep evaluation, based on sleep and psychometric questionnaires, by comparing the results with those obtained with laboratory-based video-polysomnography (V-PSG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty consecutive Huntington disease (HD) patients were enrolled. Subjective evaluation of sleep included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the sleep questionnaire for HD (HDQ), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Bologna questionnaire for sleepiness (BQ), the Berlin questionnaire, and the RBD questionnaire; the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group scale was administered to patients with positive screening. The psychometric evaluation included the Zung Anxiety Scale, the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory. All patients underwent V-PSG. RESULTS: In sleepiness evaluation, the Epworth score was above the cutoff in 6 subjects, and the BQ detected a \"high risk\" of sleepiness in 7 cases. The results were concordant in 24 and discordant in 5 cases. In the evaluation of sleep quality, the PSQI score was above the cutoff in 18 subjects. According to the HDQ, 10 subjects were poor sleepers. The results were concordant with the PSQI in 20 subjects. DISCUSSION: All comparisons between scale scores and PSG results showed poor or totally absent concordance between subjective and objective measures. SIGNIFICANCE: The subjective evaluation of sleep in HD patients shows a poor correlation with PSG results.",

When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.",

OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance.

INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a degeneration of the brain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004), the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p = 0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50 to 3.16; p = 0.007). No benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of programs PA were observed for walking endurance lower limb functionality strenght and cognition function in low and moderate stage of HD. However, no benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. All authors included aerobic exercises in their programs but is unclear if vigorous and intensive PA is optimal for individuals with HD.",

The role of rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a gain-of-function mutation in HTT. Suppression of mutant HTT has emerged as a leading therapeutic strategy for HD, with allele-selective approaches targeting HTT SNPs now in clinical trials. Haplotypes associated with the HD mutation (A1, A2, A3a) represent panels of allele-specific gene silencing targets for efficient treatment of individuals with HD of Northern European and indigenous South American ancestry. Here we extend comprehensive haplotype analysis of the HD mutation to key populations of Southern European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and admixed African ancestry. In each of these populations, the HD mutation occurs predominantly on the A2 HTT haplotype. Analysis of HD haplotypes across all affected population groups enables rational selection of candidate target SNPs for development of allele-selective gene silencing therapeutics worldwide. Targeting SNPs on the A1 and A2 haplotypes in parallel is essential to achieve treatment of the most HD-affected subjects in populations where HD is most prevalent. Current allele-specific approaches will leave a majority of individuals with HD untreated in populations where the HD mutation occurs most frequently on the A2 haplotype. We further demonstrate preclinical development of potent and selective ASOs targeting SNPs on the A2 HTT haplotype, representing an allele-specific treatment strategy for these individuals. On the basis of comprehensive haplotype analysis, we show the maximum proportion of HD-affected subjects that may be treated with three or four allele targets in different populations worldwide, informing current allele-specific HTT silencing strategies.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis with the mutation allow for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT transcript as a therapeutic strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise heterozygosity estimates are needed across diverse HD patient populations. Here we present the first comprehensive investigation of all common target alleles across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives in Canada, Sweden, France, and Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and A3a) define mutually exclusive sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy in the greatest number of patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80% are treatable using these three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion found exclusively on the A1 haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of mutant HTT in approximately 40% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the deletion reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78% in patient cells while sparing wild-type HTT expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG occurs, we demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific therapy for a monogenic disorder. ",

There is compelling evidence of abnormalities in some of the key mitochondrial enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes, which play a great significance role in the pathogenesis of AD.

Huntington disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

There are very limited treatments, and no cures, for most of these diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Disease, and Motor Neuron Diseases. Mouse and other animal models provide hope by analysing them to understand pathogenic mechanisms, to identify drug targets, and to develop gene therapies and stem cell therapies. However, despite many decades of research, virtually no new treatments have reached the clinic. Increasingly, it is apparent that human heterogeneity within clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders, and between patients with the same genetic mutations, significantly impacts disease presentation and, potentially, therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, stratifying patients according to genetics, lifestyle, disease presentation, ethnicity, and other parameters may hold the key to bringing effective therapies from the bench to the clinic. Here, we discuss genetic and cellular humanised mouse models, and how they help in defining the genetic and environmental parameters associated with neurodegenerative disease, and so help in developing effective precision medicine strategies for future healthcare.",

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology characterized by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism (MSA-P) and cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). The phenotypic spectrum may present overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders. To investigate the possible contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype, we analyzed the triplet repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients. As comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the basis of CAG repeat length as \"normal\", \"intermediate\" or \"expanded\" according to literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 years and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had significantly younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P (p < 0.0001). We identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 CAG), a SCA2 intermediate allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36 CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA alleles were detected in controls. The distribution of CAG repeat length was similar among groups except for SCA1 gene that showed a higher percentage of longer normal alleles in MSA-C as compared to MSA-P and controls (p < 0.0001). This study supports the utility of polyQ genetic testing in the differential diagnosis of MSA, and may suggest a possible role of SCA1 repeat length as risk factor for MSA-C. SCA1 and SCA2 genetic screening is recommended in MSA Italian patients.",

His neurological examination was compatible with HD as were all investigations. We diagnosed psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. While seizures are common in juvenile-onset HD, they are no more prevalent in adult-onset HD than in the general population.

Application of molecular neuroimaging using positron emission tomographic techniques to assess pediatric neurodegenerative disorders has been limited, unlike in adults where positron emission tomography has contributed to clinical diagnosis, monitoring of neurodegenerative disease progression, and assessment of novel therapeutic approaches. Yet, there is a huge unexplored potential of molecular imaging to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders in children and provide radiological biomarkers that can be applied clinically. The obstacles in performing PET scans on children include sedation, radiation exposure, and access but, as will be illustrated, these barriers can be easily overcome. This review summarizes findings from PET studies that have been performed over the past three decades on children with various neurodegenerative disorders, including the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, juvenile Huntington disease, Wilson disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Dravet syndrome, dystonia, mitochondrial disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, lysosomal storage diseases, dysmyelinating disorders, Rett syndrome, neurotransmitter disorders, glucose transporter Glut 1 deficiency, and Lesch-Nyhan disease. Because positron emission tomographic scans have often been clinically useful and have contributed to the management of these disorders, we suggest that the time has come for glucose metabolism positron emission tomographic scans to be reimbursed by insurance carriers for children with neurodegenerative disorders, and not restricted only to epilepsy surgery evaluation.",

The result of PST was not a relevant predictor. The application of an evaluation instrument of various psychopathological dimensions played a fundamental role in the detection of clinical situations that may arise several years later after PST. Attention should be paid to providing psychological support to persons at-risk who, at the pre-test phase, present some psychopathology indices before pursuing with genetic testing.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder most commonly manifesting in adulthood. Identification of biomarkers tracking neurodegeneration before the onset of motor symptoms is important for future interventional studies. Our study aimed to contribute in the phenotypic characterization of the premanifest HD phase. METHODS: 28 premanifest subjects (preHD), 25 age-matched controls, and 12 manifest HD patients were enrolled for the study. The participants underwent a multimodal protocol including cognitive evaluations, arithmetic ability test, posturography, composite cerebellar functional test (CCFS), and brain 3T-MRI. PreHD were divided at the group median for predicted years to expected onset into \"far-from-onset\" (>15 years, PreHD-far), and \"close-to-onset\" (<=15 years, preHD-close). Basal ganglia volumes and cortical thickness were computed using FreeSurfer. RESULTS: PreHD-close showed significantly lower scores than controls in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p = 0.017), Arithmetic subtraction task (p = 0.04), and MMSE (p < 0.006). At posturography, preHD-close showed increased sway velocity (<0.04) and distance (p < 0.02) compared to controls. PreHD-close had reduced striatum and globus pallidus volumes and left occipital cortical thinning compared to controls. Compared to PreHD far-from-onset, PreHD-close showed bilateral cortical thinning in occipital and parahippocampal regions, inversely correlating with burden score and prognostic index for HD. CCFS only differed between controls and manifest HD. PreHD far-from-onset did not show significant differences in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that quantitative brain MRI represents a valid biomarker of neurodegeneration in preHD. Posturography and Arithmentic tests seem promising tools for detecting early changes in premanifest HD, but need to be further confirmed in large cohorts.",

BACKGROUND: With the advent of smart sensing technology, mobile and wearable devices can provide continuous and objective monitoring and assessment of motor function outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the existing scientific literature on wearable and mobile technologies that are being used or tested for assessing motor functions in mobility-impaired and healthy adults and to evaluate the degree to which these devices provide clinically valid measures of motor function in these populations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL (January 1, 2015, to June 24, 2020), the United States and European Union clinical trial registries, and the United States Food and Drug Administration website using predefined study selection criteria. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 91 publications representing 87 unique studies were included. The most represented clinical conditions were Parkinson disease (n=51 studies), followed by stroke (n=5), Huntington disease (n=5), and multiple sclerosis (n=2). A total of 42 motion-detecting devices were identified, and the majority (n=27, 64%) were created for the purpose of health care-related data collection, although approximately 25% were personal electronic devices (eg, smartphones and watches) and 11% were entertainment consoles (eg, Microsoft Kinect or Xbox and Nintendo Wii). The primary motion outcomes were related to gait (n=30), gross motor movements (n=25), and fine motor movements (n=23). As a group, sensor-derived motion data showed a mean sensitivity of 0.83 (SD 7.27), a mean specificity of 0.84 (SD 15.40), a mean accuracy of 0.90 (SD 5.87) in discriminating between diseased individuals and healthy controls, and a mean Pearson r validity coefficient of 0.52 (SD 0.22) relative to clinical measures. We did not find significant differences in the degree of validity between in-laboratory and at-home sensor-based assessments nor between device class (ie, health care-related device, personal electronic devices, and entertainment consoles). CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-derived motion data can be leveraged to classify and quantify disease status for a variety of neurological conditions. However, most of the recent research on digital clinical measures is derived from proof-of-concept studies with considerable variation in methodological approaches, and much of the reviewed literature has focused on clinical validation, with less than one-quarter of the studies performing analytical validation. Overall, future research is crucially needed to further consolidate that sensor-derived motion data may lead to the development of robust and transformative digital measurements intended to predict, diagnose, and quantify neurological disease state and its longitudinal change.",

                    "text": "Movement disorders. Movement disorders can be hypokinetic (e.g., parkinsonism), hyperkinetic, or dystonic in nature and commonly arise from altered function in nuclei of the basal ganglia or their connections. As obvious structural changes are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism. Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli. In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions. Various approaches are reviewed here. ",

                    "text": "Current status of PET imaging in Huntington's disease. PURPOSE: To review the developments of recent decades and the current status of PET molecular imaging in Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: A systematic review of PET studies in HD was performed. The MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus databases were searched for articles in all languages published up to 19 August 2015 using the major medical subject heading \"Huntington Disease\" combined with text and key words \"Huntington Disease\", \"Neuroimaging\" and \"PET\". Only peer-reviewed, primary research studies in HD patients and premanifest HD carriers, and studies in which clinical features were described in association with PET neuroimaging results, were included in this review. Reviews, case reports and nonhuman studies were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 54 PET studies were identified and analysed in this review. Brain metabolism ([(18)F]FDG and [(15)O]H2O), presynaptic ([(18)F]fluorodopa, [(11)C]beta-CIT and [(11)C]DTBZ) and postsynaptic ([(11)C]SCH22390, [(11)C]FLB457 and [(11)C]raclopride) dopaminergic function, phosphodiesterases ([(18)F]JNJ42259152, [(18)F]MNI-659 and [(11)C]IMA107), and adenosine ([(18)F]CPFPX), cannabinoid ([(18)F]MK-9470), opioid ([(11)C]diprenorphine) and GABA ([(11)C]flumazenil) receptors were evaluated as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and for assessing the development and efficacy of novel disease-modifying drugs in premanifest HD carriers and HD patients. PET studies evaluating brain restoration and neuroprotection were also identified and described in detail. CONCLUSION: Brain metabolism, postsynaptic dopaminergic function and phosphodiesterase 10A levels were proven to be powerful in assessing disease progression. However, no single technique may be currently considered an optimal biomarker and an integrative multimodal imaging approach combining different techniques should be developed for monitoring potential neuroprotective and preventive treatment in HD.",

Patients with Huntington's disease suffer from disturbances in the perception of emotions; they do not correctly read the body, vocal and facial expressions of others. With regard to the expression of emotions, it has been shown that they are impaired in expressing emotions through face but up until now, little research has been conducted about their ability to express emotions through spoken language. To better understand emotion production in both voice and language in Huntington's Disease (HD), we tested 115 individuals: 68 patients (HD), 22 participants carrying the mutant HD gene without any motor symptoms (pre-manifest HD), and 25 controls in a single-centre prospective observational follow-up study. Participants were recorded in interviews in which they were asked to recall sad, angry, happy, and neutral stories. Emotion expression through voice and language was investigated by comparing the identifiability of emotions expressed by controls, preHD and HD patients in these interviews. To assess separately vocal and linguistic expression of emotions in a blind design, we used machine learning models instead of a human jury performing a forced-choice recognition test. Results from this study showed that patients with HD had difficulty expressing emotions through both voice and language compared to preHD participants and controls, who behaved similarly and above chance. In addition, we did not find any differences in expression of emotions between preHD and healthy controls. We further validated our newly proposed methodology with a human jury on the speech produced by the controls. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that emotional deficits in HD are caused by impaired sensori-motor representations of emotions, in line with embodied cognition theories. This study also shows how machine learning models can be leveraged to assess emotion expression in a blind and reproducible way.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is associated with increased risk of suicide. OBJECTIVE: This study compares suicide ideation in HD to the general population, assesses factors associated with increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts, and compares clinician-rated to self-reported assessments of suicidal ideation. METHODS: We examined 496 participants with premanifest or manifest HD. Clinician-rated suicidal ideation was measured using the Problem Behaviors Assessment - short form. Self-reported ideation was measured using two items from the HDQLIFE Concern with Death and Dying item bank.

Clinician-rated assessment had fair agreement (k = 0.2-0.4) with self-reported assessments, except in early stage HD where there was no overlap in the identification of participants with clinically significant suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: Assessment for suicidal ideation and clinically significant suicidal thoughts in HD with a multimodal approach that includes clinician-rated and self-report measures is critical at all stages of the disease.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess brain morphometry in a sample of patients with juvenile-onset Huntington disease (JOHD) and several mouse models of Huntington disease (HD) that likely represent the human JOHD phenotype. METHODS: Despite sharing the mutation in the Huntingtin gene, adult-onset HD characteristically presents as a hyperkinetic motor disorder, while JOHD typically presents as a hypokinetic motor disease. The University of Iowa Kids-JHD program enrolls individuals 5 to 25 years of age who have already received the clinical diagnosis. A total of 19 children with juvenile HD (JHD) (mean CAG = 72) were studied. Patients with JHD were compared to healthy controls (n = 234) using a cross-sectional study design. Volumetric data from structural MRI was compared between groups. In addition, we used the same procedure to evaluate brain morphology of R6/2, zQ175, HdhQ250 HD mice models. RESULTS: Participants with JHD had substantially reduced intracranial volumes. After controlling for the small intracranial volume size, the volumes of subcortical regions (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus) and of cortical white matter were significantly decreased in patients with JHD. However, the cerebellum was proportionately enlarged in the JHD sample. The cerebral cortex was largely unaffected. Likewise, HD mice had a lower volume of striatum and a higher volume of cerebellum, mirroring the human MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: The primary pathology of JOHD extends beyond changes in the striatal volume. Brain morphology in both mice and human patients with JHD shows proportional cerebellar enlargement.

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies. Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

                    "text": "Behavioral Symptoms in Premanifest Huntington Disease Correlate with Reduced Frontal CB1R Levels. Many Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers already have cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in the premanifest (premotor) phase of the disease (pre-HD), but the molecular underpinnings of these symptoms are not well understood. Previous work has shown reduced availability of the cerebral type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) in manifest HD. Here, we investigated whether CB1R binding is related to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in pre-HD mutation carriers. Methods: CB1R binding was measured with 18F-MK-9470 (N-[(2S,3S)-3-(3-cyanophenyl)-4-(4-ethoxyphenyl)butan-2-yl]-2-methyl-2-(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)oxypropanamide) PET in 15 pre-HD subjects (8 men, 7 women; age, 39.3 +- 9.9 y), 15 gene-negative controls from HD families (9 men, 6 women; age, 37.0 +- 10.6 y), and 12 community controls (6 men and 6 women; age, 39.9 +- 15.1 y). All subjects also underwent extensive assessment of motor and cognitive function, as well as a behavioral test battery including the Problem Behavior Assessment for HD (PBA-HD), and MRI. Parametric binding images of 18F-MK-9470 were corrected for partial-volume effect. Results: There was no difference in CB1R binding, gray matter volume, cognitive function, or psychiatric scores between gene-negative controls from HD families and community controls, which were therefore pooled to one control group. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects showed striatal atrophy, a decrease in CB1R binding in the prefrontal cortex, and higher PBA-HD scores on depression, apathy, and irritability (range, P = 0.01-0.005). The PBA-HD scores inversely correlated with CB1R binding in prefrontal regions and cingulate cortex in pre-HD (range: r = -0.64 to -0.72; P = 0.01-0.008). Conclusion: The association between behavioral symptoms and reduced prefrontal CB1R levels may provide new insight into the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pre-HD and suggest new therapeutic avenues.",

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular pathology of Huntington disease (HD) appears to be complex; while microvascular dysfunction seems to appear early, deaths from cardiomyopathy and stroke might occur in the late phase of HD. METHODS: Our study evaluated global risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), structure and function of precerebral arteries in 41 HD subjects and 41 matched controls. HD subjects were divided into groups by the United Huntington disease rating scale (presymptomatic-PHD, early-EHD, midstage-MHD and late-LHD). CHD risk factors assessment and Doppler examination of precerebral arteries were performed, including measurements of the carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), and parameters indicating local carotid artery distensibility (stiffness index beta, pulse wave velocity, pressure strain elasticity module and carotid artery compliance). RESULTS: In the HD and controls we identified a comparable number of non-obstructive plaques (<50% lumen narrowing). No obstructive plaques (>50% lumen narrowing) were found. There was significantly increased IMT in MHD. In PHD and EHD the parameters of arterial stiffness were significantly higher and the carotid artery compliance was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal functional vascular pathology in PHD, EHD, and MHD. Precerebral arteries dysfunction in HD therefore appears to be mostly functional and in agreement with recently described autonomic nervous system changes in HD.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative autosomal dominant genetic condition. Predictive testing (PT) is available through a defined protocol for at-risk individuals. We analyzed the over-24-years evolution of practices regarding PT for HD in a single center. METHODS: We gathered data from the files of all individuals seeking PT for HD in Lyon, France, from 1994 to 2017. RESULTS: 448 out of 567 participants had exploitable data. Age at consultation dichotomized over 24 years toward an eightfold increase in individuals aged >55 (2/94 vs. 30/183; 2% to 16%; p < .0001) and twice as many individuals aged 18-20 (3/94 vs. 12/183; 3%-7%; p < .05). Motives for testing remained stable. The rate of withdrawal doubled over 24 years (9/94 vs. 38/183; 9%-21%; p < .02). Independently of the time period, less withdrawal was observed for married, accompanied, at 50% risk, and symptomatic individuals, and in those able to explicit the motives for testing or taking the test to inform their children. We also assessed the consistency between the presence of subtle symptoms compatible with HD found before the test by the team's neurologist, and the positivity of the molecular test. The concordance was 100% (17/17) for associated motor and cognitive signs, 87% (27/31) for isolated motor signs, and 70% (7/10) for isolated cognitive signs. Furthermore, 91% (20/22) of individuals who requested testing because they thought they had symptoms, were indeed found carriers. CONCLUSION: This over-24 years study underlines an increasing withdrawal from protocol and a dichotomization of participants' age. We also show a strong concordance between symptoms perceived by the neurologist or by the patient, and the subsequent positivity of the predictive molecular test.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative autosomal dominant genetic condition. Predictive testing (PT) is available through a defined protocol for at-risk individuals. We analyzed the over-24-years evolution of practices regarding PT for HD in a single center. METHODS: We gathered data from the files of all individuals seeking PT for HD in Lyon, France, from 1994 to 2017. RESULTS: 448 out of 567 participants had exploitable data. Age at consultation dichotomized over 24 years toward an eightfold increase in individuals aged >55 (2/94 vs. 30/183; 2% to 16%; p < .0001) and twice as many individuals aged 18-20 (3/94 vs. 12/183; 3%-7%; p < .05). Motives for testing remained stable. The rate of withdrawal doubled over 24 years (9/94 vs. 38/183; 9%-21%; p < .02). Independently of the time period, less withdrawal was observed for married, accompanied, at 50% risk, and symptomatic individuals, and in those able to explicit the motives for testing or taking the test to inform their children.

BACKGROUND: Assisted dying is frequently debated publicly and research often includes the views of health professionals on this issue. However, the views of people with life-limiting conditions, for whom this issue is likely to have a different resonance, are less well represented. AIM: The purpose of this study was to explore the views of people who live with the inevitability of developing Huntington's disease, a genetically transmitted disease which significantly limits life, on assisted dying. DESIGN: Using thematic analysis methodology, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Seven participants (five women and two men) who were gene positive for Huntington's disease took part in the study. RESULTS: Four themes were extracted: (1) autonomy and kindness in assisted dying: the importance of moral principles; (2) Huntington's disease threatens life and emphasises issues relating to death; (3) dilemmas in decision-making on assisted dying: \"There are no winners\" and (4) the absence of explicit discussion on dying and Huntington's disease: \"Elephants in the room\". CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that talking to patients about assisted death may not cause harm and may even be invited by many patients with Huntington's disease. The perspectives of those who live with Huntington's disease, especially given its extended effects within families, add significant clinical and theoretical insights.",

BACKGROUND: Naringenin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory flavonoid which has been widely used as a therapeutic agent in various toxic models. However, few studies have clearly discussed the neuromodulatory effects of naringenin against different neurodegenerative disorders. AIM: We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of naringenin against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in rats. METHODS: Albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered group, received saline. Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received naringenin (50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP administration. On the 5th day, neurobehavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes and the striatum tissue was used for analysis of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and serotonin (5-HT) levels. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. RESULTS: Our results showed that naringenin co-treatment provides neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced neurological disorders. Naringenin also increased the MAO activity and 5-HT levels in the striatum. Moreover, co-treatment with naringenin reduced the expression of GFAP protein in the striatal part and significantly attenuated the neuronal cell death. The findings of the present study suggest that naringenin provides neuroprotection and mitigates neurobehavioral alterations in experimental rats. CONCLUSION: The results show that co-treatment with naringenin ameliorates 3-NP-induced HD-like symptoms in rats.",

OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by the mutant huntingtin gene (mHTT), which harbors expanded CAG repeats. We previously reported that the brain vessel density is higher in mice and patients with HD than in controls. The present study determines whether vascular function is altered in HD and characterizes the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The brain vessel density and vascular reactivity (VR) to carbogen challenge of HD mice were monitored by 3D DeltaR2 -mMRA and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)/flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. The amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and the pericyte coverage were determined by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in human and mouse brain sections, primary mouse astrocytes and pericytes, and human astrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. RESULTS: Expression of mHTT in astrocytes and neurons is sufficient to increase the brain vessel density in HD mice. BOLD and FAIR MRI revealed gradually impaired VR to carbogen in HD mice. Astrocytes from HD mice and patients contained more VEGF-A, which triggers proliferation of endothelial cells and may be responsible for the augmented neurovascular changes. Moreover, an astrocytic inflammatory response, which reduces the survival of pericytes through an IkappaB kinase-dependent pathway, mediates the low pericyte coverage of blood vessels in HD brains. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the inflammation-prone HD astrocytes provide less pericyte coverage by promoting angiogenesis and reducing the number of pericytes and that these changes can explain the inferior VR in HD mice. The resultant impaired VR might hinder cerebral hemodynamics and increase brain atrophy during HD progression.",

BACKGROUND: The imaging features of Huntington disease are well known in adults, unlike in juvenile-onset Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis in three juvenile Huntington disease patients (ages 2, 4 and 6 years old) to determine whether quantitative cerebral and cerebellar morphological metrics may provide diagnostically interesting patterns of cerebellar and cerebellar atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the cases of three siblings with extremely early presentations of juvenile Huntington disease associated with dramatic expansions of the morbid paternal allele from 43 to more than 100 CAG trinucleotide repeats. Automatic segmentation of MRI images of the cerebrum and cerebellum was performed and volumes of cerebral substructures and cerebellar lobules of juvenile Huntington disease patients were compared to those of 30 normal gender- and age-matched controls. Juvenile Huntington disease segmented volumes were compared to those of age-matched controls by using a z-score. RESULTS: Three cerebral substructures (caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus) demonstrated a reduction in size of more than three standard deviations from the normal mean although it was not salient in one of them at clinical reading and was not diagnosed. The size of cerebellum lobules, cerebellum grey matter and cerebellum cortex was reduced by more than two standard deviations in the three patients. The cerebellar atrophy was predominant in the posterior lobe. CONCLUSION: Our study sheds light on atrophic cerebral and cerebellar structures in juvenile Huntington disease. Automatic segmentations of the cerebellum provide patterns that may be of diagnostic interest in this disease.",

                    "text": "Behavioral Symptoms in Premanifest Huntington Disease Correlate with Reduced Frontal CB1R Levels. Many Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers already have cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in the premanifest (premotor) phase of the disease (pre-HD), but the molecular underpinnings of these symptoms are not well understood. Previous work has shown reduced availability of the cerebral type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) in manifest HD. Here, we investigated whether CB1R binding is related to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in pre-HD mutation carriers. Methods: CB1R binding was measured with 18F-MK-9470 (N-[(2S,3S)-3-(3-cyanophenyl)-4-(4-ethoxyphenyl)butan-2-yl]-2-methyl-2-(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)oxypropanamide) PET in 15 pre-HD subjects (8 men, 7 women; age, 39.3 +- 9.9 y), 15 gene-negative controls from HD families (9 men, 6 women; age, 37.0 +- 10.6 y), and 12 community controls (6 men and 6 women; age, 39.9 +- 15.1 y). All subjects also underwent extensive assessment of motor and cognitive function, as well as a behavioral test battery including the Problem Behavior Assessment for HD (PBA-HD), and MRI. Parametric binding images of 18F-MK-9470 were corrected for partial-volume effect. Results: There was no difference in CB1R binding, gray matter volume, cognitive function, or psychiatric scores between gene-negative controls from HD families and community controls, which were therefore pooled to one control group. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects showed striatal atrophy, a decrease in CB1R binding in the prefrontal cortex, and higher PBA-HD scores on depression, apathy, and irritability (range, P = 0.01-0.005). The PBA-HD scores inversely correlated with CB1R binding in prefrontal regions and cingulate cortex in pre-HD (range: r = -0.64 to -0.72; P = 0.01-0.008). Conclusion: The association between behavioral symptoms and reduced prefrontal CB1R levels may provide new insight into the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pre-HD and suggest new therapeutic avenues.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntington disease gene. The symptomatic stage of the disease is defined by the onset of motor symptoms. However, psychiatric disturbances, including depression, are common features of HD and can occur a decade before the manifestation of motor symptoms. We used the YAC128 transgenic mice (which develop motor deficits at a later stage, allowing more time to study depressive behaviors without the confounding effects of motor impairment) to test the effects of intranasal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment for 15 days in the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors. Using multiple well-validated behavioral tests, we found that BDNF treatment alleviated anhedonic and depressive-like behaviors in the YAC128 HD mice. Furthermore, we also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effects of BDNF were associated with an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, BDNF treatment only increased cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of wild-type (WT) mice, without altering these parameters in their YAC128 counterparts. Moreover, BDNF treatment did not cause an increase in the number of dendritic branches in the hippocampal DG when compared with animals treated with vehicle. In conclusion, our results suggest that non-invasive administration of BDNF via the intranasal route may have important therapeutic potential for treating mood disturbances in early-symptomatic HD patients.",

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sleep pattern and the motor activity during sleep in a cohort of patients affected by Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Thirty HD patients, 16 women and 14 men (mean age 57.3 +- 12.2 y); 30 matched healthy controls (mean age 56.5 +- 11.8 y). INTERVENTIONS: Subjective sleep evaluation: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); Berlin's Questionnaire, interview for restless legs syndrome (RLS), questionnaire for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Clinical evaluation: disease duration, clinical severity (unified Huntington disease motor rating scale [UHDMRS]), genetic tests. Laboratory-based full-night attended video-polysomnography (V-PSG). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The duration of the disease was 9.4 +- 4.4 y, UHMDRS score was 55.5 +- 23.4, CAG repeats were 44.3 +- 4.1. Body mass index was 21.9 +- 4.0 kg/m(2). No patients or caregivers reported poor sleep quality. Two patients reported symptoms of RLS. Eight patients had an ESS score >= 9. Eight patients had high risk of obstructive sleep apnea. At the RBD questionnaire, two patients had a pathological score. HD patients, compared to controls, showed shorter sleep, reduced sleep efficiency index, and increased arousals and awakenings. Four patients presented with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Periodic limb movements (PLMs) during wake and sleep were observed in all patients. No episode of RBD was observed in the V-PSG recordings, and no patients showed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia. The disease duration correlated with ESS score (P < 0.02). UHMDRS correlated positively with the ESS score (P < 0.005), and negatively with the percentage of REM sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Huntington disease showed a severe sleep disruption and a high prevalence of periodic limb movements, but no evidence of sleep disordered breathing or REM sleep behavior disorder.",

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were first generated in 2007, but the full translational potential of this valuable tool has yet to be realized. The potential applications of hiPSCs are especially relevant to neurology, as brain cells from patients are rarely available for research. hiPSCs from individuals with neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases have facilitated biological and multi-omics studies as well as large-scale screening of chemical libraries. However, researchers are struggling to improve the scalability, reproducibility and quality of this descriptive disease modelling. Addressing these limitations will be the first step towards a new era in hiPSC research - that of predictive disease modelling - involving the correlation and integration of in vitro experimental data with longitudinal clinical data. This approach is a key element of the emerging precision medicine paradigm, in which hiPSCs could become a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool.

Determination of mtDNA copy number in the cell is crucial to understand many cellular processes. Recently, the number of studies with the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content as the determinant of mitochondrial abnormalities increased greatly and is still growing, therefore, optimization of technical conditions for this analysis is crucial. Despite using similar laboratory protocols, some results cannot be compared between research centers, thus causing discrepancies in the assessment of mtDNA content. The aim of this work was to test which conditions of biological sample collection and storage affect estimation of mtDNA level relative to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) in the blood samples and dermal fibroblasts. We found that the time and temperature of sample storage, as well as the type of the blood sample (whole blood or leukocytes) influence the estimate of mtDNA/nDNA ratio in the blood. In the case of dermal fibroblasts collected from healthy control and Huntington disease patients, our data indicate that the passage number of cells is essential to obtain reliable results.",

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by multiple movement disorders, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline. As an insidious, progressive disorder, clinical phenoconversion in HD can be quite subtle and difficult to pinpoint. In light of this ambiguity, substantial interest has developed in HD research for biomarker identification, with the intent of establishing specific changes or \"stages\" of disease progression. Presumably, earlier stages of dysfunction offer greater chance for intervention or modification of disease mechanisms. As such, identifying disease processes as early as possible, in a prediagnostic period if possible, has been of paramount interest. Emerging evidence suggests motor dysfunction in HD long precedes clinical diagnosis, raising questions about the initiation of HD pathology and in turn our understanding of disease progression. This chapter summarizes advances in characterizing and understanding preclinical motor manifestations in HD, including changes in eye movements, gait, and fine motor performance. Development of the most sensitive and specific outcome measures for trial design is a rapidly evolving field in HD experimental therapeutics, with exciting implications for the study and treatment of this challenging disorder.",

In contrast to classic neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors, drugs that deplete presynaptic dopamine by blocking vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) seem to be safer and have little or no risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is one reason why there has been a recent emergence of novel VMAT2 inhibitors. Areas covered: Since the approval of tetrabenazine, the classic VMAT2 inhibitor, in the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD), other VMAT2 inhibitors (e.g. deutetrabenazine and valbenazine) have been studied in the treatment of HD-related chorea, tardive dyskinesia and tics associated with Tourette syndrome. This review, based largely on a detailed search of PubMed, will summarize the pharmacology and clinical experience with the various VMAT2 inhibitors. Expert commentary: Because of differences in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics these new VMAT2 inhibitors promise to be at least as effective as tetrabenazine but with a lower risk of adverse effects, such as sedation, insomnia, depression, parkinsonism, and akathisia.",

PURPOSE: Laquinimod is an orally dosed immuno-modulator currently under development for Huntington's disease (HD). Preclinical findings suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated. METHODS: In this randomized, phase-1 single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of 21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose. RESULTS: The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24 and Cmax of EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSION: The combination of COC and laquinimod treatment was found to be safe, tolerable, and devoid of any noticeable pharmacokinetic interaction.",

OBJECTIVE: Understanding the body composition (BC) of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) could help to delay disease progression and improve treatment efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess BC parameters, including bone mineral density (BMD), and to find new biomarkers that can be early indicators for weight loss in patients with HD. METHODS: Twenty-one age- and sex-matched patients with HD and 29 healthy controls (CT) were enrolled. For each patient, body weight (BW), height, and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. BC and BMD were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subsamples were created according to sex and percent fat mass (FM) (obese and nonobese). All analyses were carried out using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: In all comparisons, BMD and T-score were lower in the HD group, but were not correlated with lean body mass (LBM) or FM. In the HD group, LBM and truncal fat were mostly reduced, except in women with HD whose BC appeared to be less affected by the disease than men. Furthermore, LBM (r = 0.80) and truncal fat (r = 0.68) were better correlated with BW than BMI (r = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Complete BC assessment can be crucial for preventive interventions and prognosis definition in patients with HD. New biomarkers such as BMD, LBM, and truncal fat can be early indicators of weight loss in patients with HD.",

We created an excitotoxic striatal lesion model of Huntington disease (HD) in sheep, using the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor agonist, quinolinic acid (QA). Sixteen sheep received a bolus infusion of QA (75 microL, 180 mM) or saline, first into the left and then (4 weeks later) into the right striatum. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the striata were performed. Metabolite concentrations and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured at baseline, acutely (1 week after each surgery) and chronically (5 weeks or greater after the surgeries). There was a significant decrease in the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and in FA in acutely lesioned striata of the QA-lesioned sheep, followed by a recovery of NAA and FA in the chronically lesioned striata. NAA level changes indicate acute death and/or impairment of neurons immediately after surgery, with recovery of reversibly impaired neurons over time. The change in FA values of the QA-lesioned striata is consistent with acute structural disruption, followed by re-organization and glial cell infiltration with time. Our study demonstrates that MRS and DTI changes in QA-sheep are consistent with HD-like pathology shown in other model species and that the MR investigations can be performed in sheep using a clinically relevant human 3T MRI scanner.",

OBJECTIVE: Understanding the body composition (BC) of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) could help to delay disease progression and improve treatment efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess BC parameters, including bone mineral density (BMD), and to find new biomarkers that can be early indicators for weight loss in patients with HD. METHODS: Twenty-one age- and sex-matched patients with HD and 29 healthy controls (CT) were enrolled. For each patient, body weight (BW), height, and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. BC and BMD were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subsamples were created according to sex and percent fat mass (FM) (obese and nonobese). All analyses were carried out using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: In all comparisons, BMD and T-score were lower in the HD group, but were not correlated with lean body mass (LBM) or FM. In the HD group, LBM and truncal fat were mostly reduced, except in women with HD whose BC appeared to be less affected by the disease than men. Furthermore, LBM (r = 0.80) and truncal fat (r = 0.68) were better correlated with BW than BMI (r = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Complete BC assessment can be crucial for preventive interventions and prognosis definition in patients with HD. New biomarkers such as BMD, LBM, and truncal fat can be early indicators of weight loss in patients with HD.",

Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a marker of brain atrophy and predictor of disease progression in rare diseases such as Huntington Disease, but also in more common neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to measure NfL longitudinally in autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and establish correlation with clinical and imaging parameters. We enrolled 62 pathological expansions carriers (17 SCA1, 13 SCA2, 19 SCA3, and 13 SCA7) and 19 age-matched controls in a prospective biomarker study between 2011 and 2015 and followed for 24 months at the Paris Brain Institute. We performed neurological examination, brain 3 T MRI and plasma NfL measurements using an ultrasensitive single-molecule array at baseline and at the two-year follow-up visit. We evaluated NfL correlations with ages, CAG repeat sizes, clinical scores and volumetric brain MRIs. NfL levels were significantly higher in SCAs than controls at both time points (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted NfL levels were significantly correlated at baseline with clinical scores (p < 0.01). We identified optimal NfL cut-off concentrations to differentiate controls from carriers for each genotype (SCA1 16.87 pg/mL, SCA2, 19.1 pg/mL, SCA3 16.04 pg/mL, SCA7 16.67 pg/mL). For all SCAs, NfL concentration was stable over two years (p = 0.95) despite a clinical progression (p < 0.0001). Clinical progression between baseline and follow-up was associated with higher NfL concentrations at baseline (p = 0.04). Of note, all premanifest carriers with NfL levels close to cut off concentrations had signs of the disease at follow-up. For all SCAs, the higher the observed NfL, the lower the pons volume at baseline (p < 0.01) and follow-up (p = 0.02). Higher NfL levels at baseline in all SCAs predicted a decrease in cerebellar volume (p = 0.03). This result remained significant for SCA2 only among all genotypes (p = 0.02). Overall, plasma NfL levels at baseline in SCA expansion carriers predict cerebellar volume change and clinical score progression. NfL levels might help refine inclusion criteria for clinical trials in carriers with very subtle signs.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder most commonly manifesting in adulthood. Identification of biomarkers tracking neurodegeneration before the onset of motor symptoms is important for future interventional studies. Our study aimed to contribute in the phenotypic characterization of the premanifest HD phase. METHODS: 28 premanifest subjects (preHD), 25 age-matched controls, and 12 manifest HD patients were enrolled for the study. The participants underwent a multimodal protocol including cognitive evaluations, arithmetic ability test, posturography, composite cerebellar functional test (CCFS), and brain 3T-MRI. PreHD were divided at the group median for predicted years to expected onset into \"far-from-onset\" (>15 years, PreHD-far), and \"close-to-onset\" (<=15 years, preHD-close). Basal ganglia volumes and cortical thickness were computed using FreeSurfer. RESULTS: PreHD-close showed significantly lower scores than controls in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p = 0.017), Arithmetic subtraction task (p = 0.04), and MMSE (p < 0.006). At posturography, preHD-close showed increased sway velocity (<0.04) and distance (p < 0.02) compared to controls. PreHD-close had reduced striatum and globus pallidus volumes and left occipital cortical thinning compared to controls. Compared to PreHD far-from-onset, PreHD-close showed bilateral cortical thinning in occipital and parahippocampal regions, inversely correlating with burden score and prognostic index for HD. CCFS only differed between controls and manifest HD. PreHD far-from-onset did not show significant differences in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that quantitative brain MRI represents a valid biomarker of neurodegeneration in preHD. Posturography and Arithmentic tests seem promising tools for detecting early changes in premanifest HD, but need to be further confirmed in large cohorts.",

Quantitation of huntingtin protein in the brain is needed, both as a marker of Huntington disease (HD) progression and for use in clinical gene silencing trials. Measurement of huntingtin in cerebrospinal fluid could be a biomarker of brain huntingtin, but traditional protein quantitation methods have failed to detect huntingtin in cerebrospinal fluid. Using micro-bead based immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM), we have developed a highly sensitive mutant huntingtin detection assay. The sensitivity of huntingtin IP-FCM enables accurate detection of mutant huntingtin protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of HD patients and model mice, demonstrating that mutant huntingtin levels in cerebrospinal fluid reflect brain levels, increasing with disease stage and decreasing following brain huntingtin suppression. This technique has potential applications as a research tool and as a clinical biomarker. ",

PURPOSE: To review the developments of recent decades and the current status of PET molecular imaging in Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: A systematic review of PET studies in HD was performed. The MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus databases were searched for articles in all languages published up to 19 August 2015 using the major medical subject heading \"Huntington Disease\" combined with text and key words \"Huntington Disease\", \"Neuroimaging\" and \"PET\". Only peer-reviewed, primary research studies in HD patients and premanifest HD carriers, and studies in which clinical features were described in association with PET neuroimaging results, were included in this review. Reviews, case reports and nonhuman studies were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 54 PET studies were identified and analysed in this review. Brain metabolism ([(18)F]FDG and [(15)O]H2O), presynaptic ([(18)F]fluorodopa, [(11)C]beta-CIT and [(11)C]DTBZ) and postsynaptic ([(11)C]SCH22390, [(11)C]FLB457 and [(11)C]raclopride) dopaminergic function, phosphodiesterases ([(18)F]JNJ42259152, [(18)F]MNI-659 and [(11)C]IMA107), and adenosine ([(18)F]CPFPX), cannabinoid ([(18)F]MK-9470), opioid ([(11)C]diprenorphine) and GABA ([(11)C]flumazenil) receptors were evaluated as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and for assessing the development and efficacy of novel disease-modifying drugs in premanifest HD carriers and HD patients. PET studies evaluating brain restoration and neuroprotection were also identified and described in detail. CONCLUSION: Brain metabolism, postsynaptic dopaminergic function and phosphodiesterase 10A levels were proven to be powerful in assessing disease progression. However, no single technique may be currently considered an optimal biomarker and an integrative multimodal imaging approach combining different techniques should be developed for monitoring potential neuroprotective and preventive treatment in HD.",

These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization, multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted drug delivery with minimal side effects.",

BACKGROUND: European studies identified the C9orf72 repeat expansion as the most frequent genetic alteration in patients with Huntington disease (HD)-like phenotypes but negative HD genetic testing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate C9orf72 repeat expansion frequency in individuals tested for HD in a North American tertiary referral laboratory. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three cases (115 positive and 258 negative for HD) were evaluated by genotyping PCR, with follow-up Southern blot and 5' repeat methylation status assessment by combined repeat-primed and methylation-specific PCR in a subset. RESULTS: Three cases (all HD-negative) tested positive: 2 had > 2,000 repeats and were methylated, 1 had 80-100 repeats and was unmethylated. Two cases (1 HD-positive and 1 HD-negative) had intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) and were unmethylated. The remaining 368 cases were negative (< 20 repeats). C9orf72 repeat expansion was absent in patients with HD and was identified in a small subset (1.2%) of patients with negative HD genetic testing. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C9orf72 repeat expansion does not coexist with HTT repeat expansion and that C9orf72 repeat expansion testing is unnecessary for patients with HD. In addition, C9orf72 evaluation may be considered for individuals negative for HD genetic testing. Similar to in previous studies, methylation of C9orf72 repeat expansion was limited to large expansions.",

BACKGROUND: European studies identified the C9orf72 repeat expansion as the most frequent genetic alteration in patients with Huntington disease (HD)-like phenotypes but negative HD genetic testing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate C9orf72 repeat expansion frequency in individuals tested for HD in a North American tertiary referral laboratory. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three cases (115 positive and 258 negative for HD) were evaluated by genotyping PCR, with follow-up Southern blot and 5' repeat methylation status assessment by combined repeat-primed and methylation-specific PCR in a subset. RESULTS: Three cases (all HD-negative) tested positive: 2 had > 2,000 repeats and were methylated, 1 had 80-100 repeats and was unmethylated. Two cases (1 HD-positive and 1 HD-negative) had intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) and were unmethylated. The remaining 368 cases were negative (< 20 repeats). C9orf72 repeat expansion was absent in patients with HD and was identified in a small subset (1.2%) of patients with negative HD genetic testing. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C9orf72 repeat expansion does not coexist with HTT repeat expansion and that C9orf72 repeat expansion testing is unnecessary for patients with HD. In addition, C9orf72 evaluation may be considered for individuals negative for HD genetic testing. Similar to in previous studies, methylation of C9orf72 repeat expansion was limited to large expansions.",

                    "text": "In Vivo Cerebral Imaging of Mutant Huntingtin Aggregates Using 11C-CHDI-180R PET in a Nonhuman Primate Model of Huntington Disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q, n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001). No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically. Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.",

BACKGROUND: Deutetrabenazine is approved in the USA, China, Australia, Israel, Brazil, and South Korea for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington disease. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study included patients who completed a double-blind study (Rollover) and patients who converted overnight from a stable tetrabenazine dose (Switch). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (adverse events per person-year) were calculated. Efficacy was analyzed using a stable post-titration timepoint (8 weeks). Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score and total maximal chorea score from baseline to week 8, as well as those from week 8 to week 145 (or the last visit on the study drug if that occurred earlier), were evaluated as both efficacy and safety endpoints during the study. RESULTS: Of 119 patients (Rollover, n = 82; Switch, n = 37), 100 (84%) completed >= 1 year of treatment. End-of-study exposure-adjusted incidence rates for adverse events in Rollover and Switch, respectively, were: any, 2.57 and 4.02; serious, 0.11 and 0.14; leading to dose suspension, 0.05 and 0.04. Common adverse events (>= 4% either cohort) included somnolence (Rollover, 20%; Switch, 30%), depression (32%; 22%), anxiety (27%; 35%), insomnia (23%; 16%), and akathisia (6%; 11%). Adverse events of interest included suicidality (9%; 5%) and parkinsonism (4%; 8%). Mean dose at week 8 was 38.1 mg (Rollover) and 36.5 mg (Switch). Mean dose across cohorts after titration was 37.6 mg; at the final visit, mean dose across cohorts was 45.7 mg. Patients showed minimal change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea scores with stable dosing from weeks 8-145 or at the end of treatment, but total motor score increased versus week 8 (mean change [standard deviation]: 8.2 [11.9]). There were no unexpected adverse events upon drug withdrawal, and mean (standard deviation) total maximal chorea scores increased 4.7 (4.6) units from week 8 to 1-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events observed with long-term deutetrabenazine exposure were consistent with previous studies. Reductions in chorea persisted over time. Upon treatment cessation, there was no unexpected worsening of chorea. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01897896.",

Huntington disease (HD) is most widely known for its selective degeneration of striatal neurons but there is also growing evidence for white matter (WM) deterioration. The primary objective of this research was to conduct a large-scale analysis using multisite diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) tractography data to quantify diffusivity properties along major prefrontal cortex WM tracts in prodromal HD. Fifteen international sites participating in the PREDICT-HD study collected imaging and neuropsychological data on gene-positive HD participants without a clinical diagnosis (i.e., prodromal) and gene-negative control participants. The anatomical prefrontal WM tracts of the corpus callosum (PFCC), anterior thalamic radiations (ATRs), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFO), and uncinate fasciculi (UNC) were identified using streamline tractography of DWI. Within each of these tracts, tensor scalars for fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity coefficients were calculated. We divided prodromal HD subjects into three CAG-age product (CAP) groups having Low, Medium, or High probabilities of onset indexed by genetic exposure. We observed significant differences in WM properties for each of the four anatomical tracts for the High CAP group in comparison to controls. Additionally, the Medium CAP group presented differences in the ATR and IFO in comparison to controls. Furthermore, WM alterations in the PFCC, ATR, and IFO showed robust associations with neuropsychological measures of executive functioning. These results suggest long-range tracts essential for cross-region information transfer show early vulnerability in HD and may explain cognitive problems often present in the prodromal stage.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for two Chinese pedigrees affected with Huntington disease and provide prenatal diagnosis for them. METHODS: Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the probands. PCR and capillary gel electrophoresis were used to determine the number of CAG repeats in their IT15 gene. Pre-symptomatic testing was offered to their children and relatives, and prenatal diagnosis was provided to three pregnant women from the two pedigrees. RESULTS: The two probands, in addition with three asymptomatic members, were found to have a (CAG)n repeat number greater than 40. Upon prenatal diagnosis, the numbers of CAG repeats in two fetuses from pedigree 1 were determined as (16, 19) and (18, 19), both were within the normal range. A fetus from pedigree 2 was found to have a CAG repeat number of (15, 41), which exceeded the normal range.

The role of rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

BACKGROUND: Cell replacement therapy (CRT) for Huntington disease (HD) requires a source of striatal (STR) progenitors capable of restoring the function lost due to STR degeneration. Authentic STR progenitors can be collected from the fetal putative striatum, or whole ganglionic eminence (WGE), but these tissues remain impractical for widespread clinical application, and alternative donor sources are required. Here we begin exploring the possibility that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from WGE may retain an epigenetic memory of their tissue of origin, which could enhance their ability to differentiate into STR cells. RESULTS: We generate four iPSC lines from human WGE (hWGE) and establish that they have a capacity similar to human embryonic stem cells with regard to their ability to differentiate toward an STR phenotype, as measured by expression and demethylation of key STR genes, while maintaining an overall different methylome. Finally, we demonstrate that these STR-differentiated hWGE iPSCs share characteristics with hWGE (i.e., authentic STR tissues) both in vitro and following transplantation into an HD model. Overall, iPSCs derived from human WGE show promise as a donor source for CRT for HD.",

OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by the mutant huntingtin gene (mHTT), which harbors expanded CAG repeats. We previously reported that the brain vessel density is higher in mice and patients with HD than in controls. The present study determines whether vascular function is altered in HD and characterizes the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The brain vessel density and vascular reactivity (VR) to carbogen challenge of HD mice were monitored by 3D DeltaR2 -mMRA and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)/flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. The amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and the pericyte coverage were determined by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in human and mouse brain sections, primary mouse astrocytes and pericytes, and human astrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. RESULTS: Expression of mHTT in astrocytes and neurons is sufficient to increase the brain vessel density in HD mice. BOLD and FAIR MRI revealed gradually impaired VR to carbogen in HD mice. Astrocytes from HD mice and patients contained more VEGF-A, which triggers proliferation of endothelial cells and may be responsible for the augmented neurovascular changes. Moreover, an astrocytic inflammatory response, which reduces the survival of pericytes through an IkappaB kinase-dependent pathway, mediates the low pericyte coverage of blood vessels in HD brains.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular pathology of Huntington disease (HD) appears to be complex; while microvascular dysfunction seems to appear early, deaths from cardiomyopathy and stroke might occur in the late phase of HD. METHODS: Our study evaluated global risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), structure and function of precerebral arteries in 41 HD subjects and 41 matched controls. HD subjects were divided into groups by the United Huntington disease rating scale (presymptomatic-PHD, early-EHD, midstage-MHD and late-LHD). CHD risk factors assessment and Doppler examination of precerebral arteries were performed, including measurements of the carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), and parameters indicating local carotid artery distensibility (stiffness index beta, pulse wave velocity, pressure strain elasticity module and carotid artery compliance). RESULTS: In the HD and controls we identified a comparable number of non-obstructive plaques (<50% lumen narrowing). No obstructive plaques (>50% lumen narrowing) were found. There was significantly increased IMT in MHD. In PHD and EHD the parameters of arterial stiffness were significantly higher and the carotid artery compliance was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal functional vascular pathology in PHD, EHD, and MHD. Precerebral arteries dysfunction in HD therefore appears to be mostly functional and in agreement with recently described autonomic nervous system changes in HD.",

BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that chronic treatment of early-stage Huntington disease (HD) with high-dose coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) will slow the progressive functional decline of HD. METHODS: We performed a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with early-stage HD (n = 609) were enrolled at 48 sites in the United States, Canada, and Australia from 2008 to 2012. Patients were randomized to receive either CoQ 2,400 mg/d or matching placebo, then followed for 60 months. The primary outcome variable was the change from baseline to month 60 in Total Functional Capacity score (for patients who survived) combined with time to death (for patients who died) analyzed using a joint-rank analysis approach. RESULTS: An interim analysis for futility revealed a conditional power of <5% for the primary analysis, prompting premature conclusion in July 2014. No statistically significant differences were seen between treatment groups for the primary or secondary outcome measures. CoQ was generally safe and well-tolerated throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not justify use of CoQ as a treatment to slow functional decline in HD. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00608881.

Huntington Disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease which leads to involuntary movements and impaired balance. These changes have been quantified using footstep pressure sensor mats such as Protokinetics' Zeno Walkway. Drawing from distances between recorded footsteps, patients' disease severity have been measured in terms of high level gait characteristics such as gait width and stride length. However, little attention has been paid to the pressure data collected during formation of individual footsteps. This work investigates the potential of classifying patient disease severity based on individual footstep pressure data using deep learning techniques. Using the Motor Subscale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) as the gold standard, our experiments showed that using VGG16 and similar modules can achieve classification accuracy of 89%. Image pre-processing are key steps for better model performance. This classification accuracy is compared to results based on 3D CNN (82%) and SVM (86.9%).",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Synaptic damage has been proposed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of Huntington disease (HD), but in vivo evidence in humans is lacking. We performed a PET imaging study to assess synaptic damage and its clinical correlates in early HD in vivo. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, premanifest and early manifest (Shoulson-Fahn stage 1 and 2) HD mutation carriers and age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent clinical assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations and time-of-flight PET with 11C-UCB-J, a radioligand targeting the ubiquitous presynaptic terminal marker synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). We also performed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET in all participants because regional cerebral glucose consumption is thought to largely reflect synaptic activity. Volumes of interest were delineated on the basis of individual 3-dimensional T1 MRI. Standardized uptake value ratio-1 images were calculated for 11C-UCB-J with the centrum semiovale as reference region. 18F-FDG-PET activity was normalized to the pons. All PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. Volume of interest- and voxel-based analyses were performed. Correlations between clinical scores and 11C-UCB-J PET data were calculated. RESULTS: Eighteen HD mutation carriers (age 51.4 +- 11.6 years; 6 female; 7 premanifest, 11 early manifest) and 15 healthy controls (age 52.3 +- 3.5 years; 4 female) were included. In the HD group, significant loss of SV2A binding was found in putamen, caudate, pallidum, cerebellum, parietal, and temporal and frontal cortex, whereas reduced 18F-FDG uptake was restricted to caudate and putamen. In the premanifest subgroup, 11C-UCB-J and 18F-FDG-PET showed significant reductions in putamen and caudate only. In the total HD group, SV2A loss in the putamen correlated with motor impairment. DISCUSSION: Our data reveal loss of presynaptic terminal integrity in early HD, which begins in the striatum in the premanifest phase, spreads extensively to extrastriatal regions in the early manifest phase, and correlates with motor impairment. 11C-UCB-J PET is more sensitive than 18F-FDG-PET for detection of extrastriatal changes in early HD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that 11C-UCB-J PET accurately discriminates individuals HD from normal controls.",

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sleep pattern and the motor activity during sleep in a cohort of patients affected by Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Thirty HD patients, 16 women and 14 men (mean age 57.3 +- 12.2 y); 30 matched healthy controls (mean age 56.5 +- 11.8 y). INTERVENTIONS: Subjective sleep evaluation: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); Berlin's Questionnaire, interview for restless legs syndrome (RLS), questionnaire for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Clinical evaluation: disease duration, clinical severity (unified Huntington disease motor rating scale [UHDMRS]), genetic tests. Laboratory-based full-night attended video-polysomnography (V-PSG). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The duration of the disease was 9.4 +- 4.4 y, UHMDRS score was 55.5 +- 23.4, CAG repeats were 44.3 +- 4.1. Body mass index was 21.9 +- 4.0 kg/m(2). No patients or caregivers reported poor sleep quality. Two patients reported symptoms of RLS. Eight patients had an ESS score >= 9. Eight patients had high risk of obstructive sleep apnea. At the RBD questionnaire, two patients had a pathological score. HD patients, compared to controls, showed shorter sleep, reduced sleep efficiency index, and increased arousals and awakenings. Four patients presented with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Periodic limb movements (PLMs) during wake and sleep were observed in all patients. No episode of RBD was observed in the V-PSG recordings, and no patients showed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia. The disease duration correlated with ESS score (P < 0.02). UHMDRS correlated positively with the ESS score (P < 0.005), and negatively with the percentage of REM sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Huntington disease showed a severe sleep disruption and a high prevalence of periodic limb movements, but no evidence of sleep disordered breathing or REM sleep behavior disorder.",

In contrast to classic neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors, drugs that deplete presynaptic dopamine by blocking vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) seem to be safer and have little or no risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is one reason why there has been a recent emergence of novel VMAT2 inhibitors. Areas covered: Since the approval of tetrabenazine, the classic VMAT2 inhibitor, in the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD), other VMAT2 inhibitors (e.g. deutetrabenazine and valbenazine) have been studied in the treatment of HD-related chorea, tardive dyskinesia and tics associated with Tourette syndrome. This review, based largely on a detailed search of PubMed, will summarize the pharmacology and clinical experience with the various VMAT2 inhibitors. Expert commentary: Because of differences in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics these new VMAT2 inhibitors promise to be at least as effective as tetrabenazine but with a lower risk of adverse effects, such as sedation, insomnia, depression, parkinsonism, and akathisia.",

BACKGROUND: In Huntington disease (HD), cognitive changes due to disease-progression or treatment are potentially confounded by \"practice effects\" (PE)--performance improvement from prior exposure to test materials. OBJECTIVE: A practice run-in (\"dual baseline\") was used in an HD cognitive trial to determine if PE could be minimized and evaluate performance trajectories over multiple visits. METHODS: Non-depressed adults (N = 36) with mild to moderate HD-related cognitive deficits participated in a clinical trial to examine the efficacy of citalopram to enhance cognition. Cognitive tests were administered at three visits (2 weeks separating each visit), before active treatment randomization. Some tests were also administered at screening. Therefore 3-4 pre-treatment repetitions were available. We examined test improvement using repeated-measures ANOVAs with planned pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Despite the practice run-in and use of alternate test forms, results indicated ongoing improvements over at least three test sessions on all three UHDRS cognitive tests. Trails A and B showed improvements between the third and fourth session, which suggests that one pre-baseline visit may not be effective in reducing practice on this important and commonly used test. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 7 out of 13 variables showed some degree of short-term PE, even after multiple sessions and alternate forms. Tests assessing processing speed and memory may be particularly confounded by ongoing PE across at least 2-3 sessions. Practice run-in periods and alternate forms may help minimize the impact of such effects in HD clinical trials but awareness of which tests are most susceptible to PE is important in clinical trial design.",

CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

BACKGROUND: With the advent of smart sensing technology, mobile and wearable devices can provide continuous and objective monitoring and assessment of motor function outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the existing scientific literature on wearable and mobile technologies that are being used or tested for assessing motor functions in mobility-impaired and healthy adults and to evaluate the degree to which these devices provide clinically valid measures of motor function in these populations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL (January 1, 2015, to June 24, 2020), the United States and European Union clinical trial registries, and the United States Food and Drug Administration website using predefined study selection criteria. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 91 publications representing 87 unique studies were included. The most represented clinical conditions were Parkinson disease (n=51 studies), followed by stroke (n=5), Huntington disease (n=5), and multiple sclerosis (n=2). A total of 42 motion-detecting devices were identified, and the majority (n=27, 64%) were created for the purpose of health care-related data collection, although approximately 25% were personal electronic devices (eg, smartphones and watches) and 11% were entertainment consoles (eg, Microsoft Kinect or Xbox and Nintendo Wii). The primary motion outcomes were related to gait (n=30), gross motor movements (n=25), and fine motor movements (n=23). As a group, sensor-derived motion data showed a mean sensitivity of 0.83 (SD 7.27), a mean specificity of 0.84 (SD 15.40), a mean accuracy of 0.90 (SD 5.87) in discriminating between diseased individuals and healthy controls, and a mean Pearson r validity coefficient of 0.52 (SD 0.22) relative to clinical measures. We did not find significant differences in the degree of validity between in-laboratory and at-home sensor-based assessments nor between device class (ie, health care-related device, personal electronic devices, and entertainment consoles). CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-derived motion data can be leveraged to classify and quantify disease status for a variety of neurological conditions. However, most of the recent research on digital clinical measures is derived from proof-of-concept studies with considerable variation in methodological approaches, and much of the reviewed literature has focused on clinical validation, with less than one-quarter of the studies performing analytical validation. Overall, future research is crucially needed to further consolidate that sensor-derived motion data may lead to the development of robust and transformative digital measurements intended to predict, diagnose, and quantify neurological disease state and its longitudinal change.",

BACKGROUND: Naringenin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory flavonoid which has been widely used as a therapeutic agent in various toxic models. However, few studies have clearly discussed the neuromodulatory effects of naringenin against different neurodegenerative disorders. AIM: We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of naringenin against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in rats. METHODS: Albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered group, received saline. Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received naringenin (50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP administration. On the 5th day, neurobehavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes and the striatum tissue was used for analysis of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and serotonin (5-HT) levels. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. RESULTS: Our results showed that naringenin co-treatment provides neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced neurological disorders. Naringenin also increased the MAO activity and 5-HT levels in the striatum. Moreover, co-treatment with naringenin reduced the expression of GFAP protein in the striatal part and significantly attenuated the neuronal cell death. The findings of the present study suggest that naringenin provides neuroprotection and mitigates neurobehavioral alterations in experimental rats.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder most commonly manifesting in adulthood. Identification of biomarkers tracking neurodegeneration before the onset of motor symptoms is important for future interventional studies. Our study aimed to contribute in the phenotypic characterization of the premanifest HD phase. METHODS: 28 premanifest subjects (preHD), 25 age-matched controls, and 12 manifest HD patients were enrolled for the study. The participants underwent a multimodal protocol including cognitive evaluations, arithmetic ability test, posturography, composite cerebellar functional test (CCFS), and brain 3T-MRI. PreHD were divided at the group median for predicted years to expected onset into \"far-from-onset\" (>15 years, PreHD-far), and \"close-to-onset\" (<=15 years, preHD-close). Basal ganglia volumes and cortical thickness were computed using FreeSurfer. RESULTS: PreHD-close showed significantly lower scores than controls in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p = 0.017), Arithmetic subtraction task (p = 0.04), and MMSE (p < 0.006). At posturography, preHD-close showed increased sway velocity (<0.04) and distance (p < 0.02) compared to controls. PreHD-close had reduced striatum and globus pallidus volumes and left occipital cortical thinning compared to controls. Compared to PreHD far-from-onset, PreHD-close showed bilateral cortical thinning in occipital and parahippocampal regions, inversely correlating with burden score and prognostic index for HD. CCFS only differed between controls and manifest HD. PreHD far-from-onset did not show significant differences in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that quantitative brain MRI represents a valid biomarker of neurodegeneration in preHD. Posturography and Arithmentic tests seem promising tools for detecting early changes in premanifest HD, but need to be further confirmed in large cohorts.",

                    "text": "A liminal stage after predictive testing for Huntington disease. BACKGROUND: Following predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD), knowledge of one's carrier status may have consequences on disease onset. Our study aimed to address two questions. First, does knowledge of being a carrier of the pathological HD mutation trigger onset of the disease? Second, does this knowledge influence self-awareness and allow carriers to identify signs and symptoms of disease onset? METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 75 HD mutation carriers were examined using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score. Onset estimation made with the disease burden score was compared with UHDRS findings. We collected qualitative data with questionnaires and semistructured interviews. RESULTS: 38 women and 37 men, aged 43.7 years+-10.5 (20-68), were interviewed after a mean delay between test and study interview of 10.5 years+-4.7 (from 4 to 21 years). Estimation of age at onset was 4.5+-8.5 years earlier than data-derived age at onset. Participants were categorised according to their motor score: scores <5 were premanifest (n=35), and scores >5 were manifest carriers (n=40). Self-observation was a major preoccupation for all, independent of their clinical status (82% vs 74%, p=0.57). Among manifest carriers, 56% thought they showed symptoms, but only 33% felt ill. Interestingly, this was also observed in those without motor signs (20% and 9%). Being a mutation carrier did not significantly facilitate recognition of motor signs. Interviews with premanifest carriers allowed the burden of self-observation to be illustrated despite lack of motor signs. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating age at onset based on disease burden score may not be accurate. The transition to disease was experienced as an ambiguous or liminal experience. The view of mutation carriers is not always concordant with medical onset estimation, highlighting the difficulties involved in the concept of onset and its use as an outcome in future disease-modifying trials.",

The aim of the present review article is to summarize the role of nanodiamonds in various neurological diseases. We have taken related literature of making this review article from ScienceDirect, springer, Research gate, PubMed, Sci-finder, etc. The current approaches for treating neurological conditions such as glioblastoma includes chemotherapy or combination anti-retro viral therapy for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or use of anti-Alzheimer drugs during cognitive impairment. These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization, multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted drug delivery with minimal side effects.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene. Results from previous studies have suggested that transcriptional dysregulation is one of the key mechanisms underlying striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) degeneration in HD. However, some of the critical genes involved in HD etiology or pathology could be masked in a common expression profiling assay because of contamination with non-MSN cells. To gain insight into the MSN-specific gene expression changes in presymptomatic R6/2 mice, a common HD mouse model, here we used a transgenic fluorescent protein marker of MSNs for purification via FACS before profiling gene expression with gene microarrays and compared the results of this \"FACS-array\" with those obtained with homogenized striatal samples (STR-array). We identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enhanced detection of MSN-specific DEGs by comparing the results of the FACS-array with those of the STR-array. The gene sets obtained included genes ubiquitously expressed in both MSNs and non-MSN cells of the brain and associated with transcriptional regulation and DNA damage responses. We proposed that the comparative gene expression approach using the FACS-array may be useful for uncovering the gene cascades affected in MSNs during HD pathogenesis.",

Libido can affect the semen quality of male, and the sperm motility in semen quality parameters is a reliable index to evaluate the fertility of male. In drakes, the sperm motility is gradually acquired in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. However, the relationship between libido and sperm motility in drakes has not been reported and the mechanisms of testis, epididymis, and spermaduct regulating the sperm motility of drakes are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the semen quality of drakes with libido level 4 (LL4) and libido level 5 (LL5), and tried to identify the mechanisms regulating the sperm motility in drakes by performing RNA-seq in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. Phenotypically, the sperm motility of drakes (P < 0.01), weight of testis (P < 0.05), and organ index of epididymis (P < 0.05) in the LL5 group were significantly better than those in LL4 group. Moreover, compared with the LL4 group, the ductal square of seminiferous tubule (ST) in testis was significantly bigger in the LL5 group (P < 0.05), and the seminiferous epithelial thickness (P < 0.01) of ST in testis and lumenal diameter (P < 0.05) of ductuli conjugentes/dutus epididymidis in epididymis were significantly longer in the LL5 group. In transcriptional regulation, in addition to KEGG pathways related to metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, lots of KEGG pathways associated with immunity, proliferation, and signaling were also significantly enriched in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct, respectively. Furthermore, through the integrated analysis of coexpression network and protein-protein interaction network, 3 genes (including COL11A1, COL14A1, and C3AR1) involved in protein digestion and absorption pathway and Staphylococcus aureus infection pathway were identified in testis, 2 genes (including BUB1B and ESPL1) involved in cell cycle pathway were identified in epididymis, and 13 genes (including DNAH1, DNAH3, DNAH7, DNAH10, DNAH12, DNAI1, DNAI2, DNALI1, NTF3, ITGA1, TLR2, RELN, and PAK1) involved in Huntington disease pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were identified in spermaduct. These genes could play crucial roles in the sperm motility of drakes with different libido, and all data the present study obtained will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating sperm motility of drakes.",

INTRODUCTION: While individuals with Huntington disease (HD) show memory impairment that indicates hippocampal dysfunction, the available literature does not consistently identify structural evidence for involvement of the whole hippocampus but rather suggests that hippocampal atrophy may be confined to certain hippocampal subregions. METHODS: We processed T1-weighted MRI from IMAGE-HD study using FreeSurfer 7.0 and compared the volumes of the hippocampal subfields among 36 early motor symptomatic (symp-HD), 40 pre-symptomatic (pre-HD), and 36 healthy control individuals across three timepoints over 36 months. RESULTS: Mixed-model analyses revealed significantly lower subfield volumes in symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and control groups, in the subicular regions of the perforant-pathway: presubiculum, subiculum, dentate gyrus, tail, and right molecular layer. These adjoining subfields aggregated into a single principal component, which demonstrated an accelerated rate of atrophy in the symp-HD. Volumes between pre-HD and controls did not show any significant difference. In the combined HD groups, CAG repeat length and disease burden score were associated with presubiculum, molecular layer, tail, and perforant-pathway subfield volumes. Hippocampal left tail and perforant-pathway subfields were associated with motor onset in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal subfields atrophy in early symptomatic HD affects key regions of the perforant-pathway, which may implicate the distinctive memory impairment at this stage of illness. Their volumetric associations with genetic and clinical markers suggest the selective susceptibility of these subfields to mutant Huntingtin and disease progression.",

OBJECTIVE: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction has been described in adults with motor-manifest Huntington's Disease (HD) or those who are near their predicted motor onset. It is unclear if ANS dysfunction is present years prior to the onset of motor symptoms of HD. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we compared crude markers of ANS function between children with the gene-expansion that causes HD (GE group) who were decades from their predicted motor onset and gene-non-expanded children (GNE group). METHODS: We included participants from the Kids-HD study who were <18 years old. Linear mixed effects regression models were constructed that controlled for sex, age, and BMI, and included a random effect per participant and per family. We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84) and GNE (n = 238) groups. We then grouped participants from the GE group based on their predicted years to onset (YTO) and compared their vital signs to the GNE group. RESULTS: The GE group had higher rHR (  = 3.83, p = 0.0064), SBP (  = 2.38, p = 0.032), and CBT (  = 0.16, t = 2.92, p = 0.007). The mean rHR and CBT became significantly elevated compared to the GNE group in participants who had 15-25 YTO and those who had <15 YTO. The mean SBP of participants who had 25-35 YTO was significantly elevated compared to the GNE group.

Deutetrabenazine (Austedo) is indicated in adults for chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. Escalating deutetrabenazine doses were administered to healthy volunteers who were cytochrome P450 2D6 extensive/intermediate metabolizers (EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs) to determine pharmacokinetic exposure of parent drug and active metabolites (alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine [alpha-HTBZ] and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine [beta-HTBZ]), and collect corresponding electrocardiograms (ECGs) for evaluation of the cardiodynamic effect using concentration-QTc (C-QTc) modeling. Participants (12 EMs, 24 PMs) received placebo or single doses of deutetrabenazine (24, 48, and 72 mg) to achieve plasma concentrations exceeding therapeutic range in both cohorts. Pharmacokinetic samples were obtained over 72 hours after dosing and were time matched with 12-lead ECGs extracted from continuous ECG recordings. C-QTc analysis, using linear mixed-effects modeling and model selection procedure, characterized the relationship between plasma concentrations of deutetrabenazine, deuterated alpha-HTBZ and beta-HTBZ, and the change from baseline in QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula. Deutetrabenazine exhibited linear kinetics, and a C-QTc model with deuterated alpha-HTBZ and beta-HTBZ was selected to best describe the C-QTc relationship in pooled EM and PM data. This model predicted a placebo-corrected Fridericia corrected QT interval prolongation higher than 10 milliseconds can be excluded at concentrations associated with the maximum recommended doses in both populations. Adverse events increased with higher exposure as reflected by the higher event number in the PM cohort receiving 48 and 72 mg doses. No subject discontinued due to cardiac-related adverse events and no clinically relevant ECG findings were reported. Thus, this study found that deutetrabenazine does not have a clinically relevant effect on QT prolongation at maximum recommended doses in either cytochrome P450 2D6 EMs or PMs.",

BACKGROUND: Clinical care teams providing presymptomatic genetic testing often employ advanced confidentiality practices for documentation and result storage. However, patient requests for increased confidentiality may be in conflict with the legal obligations of medical providers to document patient care activities in the electronic health record (EHR). Huntington disease presents a representative case study for investigating the ways centers currently balance the requirements of EHRs with the privacy demands of patients seeking presymptomatic genetic testing. METHODS: We surveyed 23 HD centers (53% response rate) regarding their use of the EHR for presymptomatic HD testing. RESULTS: Our survey revealed that clinical care teams and laboratories have each developed their own practices, which are cumbersome and often include EHR avoidance. We found that a majority of HD care teams record appointments in the EHR (91%), often using vague notes. Approximately half of the care teams (52%) keep presymptomatic results of out of the EHR. CONCLUSION: As genetic knowledge grows, linking more genes to late-onset conditions, institutions will benefit from having professional recommendations to guide development of policies for EHR documentation of presymptomatic genetic results. Policies must be sensitive to the ethical differences and patient demands for presymptomatic genetic testing compared to those undergoing confirmatory genetic testing.",

Huntington Disease (HD) is a late-onset autosomal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the aggregations of mutant Huntingtin proteins (mHTT). A glutamine stretch (PolyQ) at the N-terminal of the Huntingtin protein is generated by the abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in exon 1 of the HTT gene. While the resulting polyQ aggregates are the predominate feature of HD, the intercellular spread of the expanded protein and the effect upon this transfer inside healthy cells have not yet fully understood. Here, we have employed the phasor Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) method to measure NADH fluorescence lifetime change after the internalization of the PolyQ protein. Based on our analysis, we have found a significant decrease in the fraction of bound NADH in both cytoplasmic and nucleus regions when cells are co-cultured or when healthy cells uptake the supernatant containing polyQ proteins and aggregates. Overall, our FLIM study combined with confocal fluorescence imaging visualizes the absorption of the mutant Htt protein aggregates which results in a distinct NADH fluorescence lifetime between control cells and acceptor cells. These studies show, for the first time, the influence of how neighboring cells expressing the expanded Htt protein can regulate energy metabolism in healthy cells.",

Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.",

BACKGROUND: The cohort-level risk of Huntington disease (HD) is related to the age and symptom level of the cohort, but this relationship has not been made precise. OBJECTIVE: To predict the evolving likelihood of carrying the Huntington disease (HD) gene for at-risk adults using age and sign level. METHODS: Using data from adults with early signs and symptoms of HD linked to information on genetic status, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that an undiagnosed individual of a certain age and sign level has an expanded CAG repeat. RESULTS: Both age and sign levels have substantial influence on the likelihood of HD onset, and the probability of eventual diagnosis changes as those at risk age and exhibit (or fail to exhibit) symptoms. For example, our data suggest that in a cohort of individuals age 26 with a Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score of 7-10 70% of them will carry the HD mutation. For individuals age 56, the same motor score suggests only a 40% chance of carrying the mutation. Early motor signs of HD, overall and the chorea subscore, were highly predictive of disease onset at any age. However, body mass index (BMI) and cognitive performance scores were not as highly predictive. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that if researchers or clinicians are looking for early clues of HD, it may be more foretelling to look at motor rather than cognitive signs. Application of similar approaches could be used with other adult-onset genetic conditions.",

CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral apathy expressed by these individuals was related to regions of the brain commonly associated with isolated apathy, and not a direct result of mood symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: Apathy is a debilitating symptom of Huntington's disease (HD) and manifests before motor diagnosis, making it an excellent therapeutic target in the preclinical phase of Huntington's disease (prHD). HD is a neurological genetic disorder characterized by cognitive and motor impairment, and psychiatric abnormalities. Apathy is not well characterized within the prHD. In previous literature, damage to the caudate and putamen has been correlated with increased apathy in other neurodegenerative and movement disorders. The objective of this study was to determine whether apathy severity in individuals with prHD is related to striatum volumes and cognitive control. We hypothesized that, within prHD individuals, striatum volumes and cognitive control scores would be related to apathy. METHODS: We constructed linear mixed models to analyze striatum volumes and cognitive control, a composite measure that includes tasks assessing with apathy scores from 797 prHD participants. The outcome variable for each model was apathy, and the independent variables for the four separate models were caudate volume, putamen volume, cognitive control score, and motor symptom score. We also included depression as a covariate to ensure that our results were not solely related to mood. RESULTS: Caudate and putamen volumes, as well as measures of cognitive control, were significantly related to apathy scores even after controlling for depression. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral apathy expressed by these individuals was related to regions of the brain commonly associated with isolated apathy, and not a direct result of mood symptoms.

BACKGROUND: With the advent of smart sensing technology, mobile and wearable devices can provide continuous and objective monitoring and assessment of motor function outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the existing scientific literature on wearable and mobile technologies that are being used or tested for assessing motor functions in mobility-impaired and healthy adults and to evaluate the degree to which these devices provide clinically valid measures of motor function in these populations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL (January 1, 2015, to June 24, 2020), the United States and European Union clinical trial registries, and the United States Food and Drug Administration website using predefined study selection criteria. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 91 publications representing 87 unique studies were included. The most represented clinical conditions were Parkinson disease (n=51 studies), followed by stroke (n=5), Huntington disease (n=5), and multiple sclerosis (n=2). A total of 42 motion-detecting devices were identified, and the majority (n=27, 64%) were created for the purpose of health care-related data collection, although approximately 25% were personal electronic devices (eg, smartphones and watches) and 11% were entertainment consoles (eg, Microsoft Kinect or Xbox and Nintendo Wii). The primary motion outcomes were related to gait (n=30), gross motor movements (n=25), and fine motor movements (n=23). As a group, sensor-derived motion data showed a mean sensitivity of 0.83 (SD 7.27), a mean specificity of 0.84 (SD 15.40), a mean accuracy of 0.90 (SD 5.87) in discriminating between diseased individuals and healthy controls, and a mean Pearson r validity coefficient of 0.52 (SD 0.22) relative to clinical measures. We did not find significant differences in the degree of validity between in-laboratory and at-home sensor-based assessments nor between device class (ie, health care-related device, personal electronic devices, and entertainment consoles). CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-derived motion data can be leveraged to classify and quantify disease status for a variety of neurological conditions. However, most of the recent research on digital clinical measures is derived from proof-of-concept studies with considerable variation in methodological approaches, and much of the reviewed literature has focused on clinical validation, with less than one-quarter of the studies performing analytical validation. Overall, future research is crucially needed to further consolidate that sensor-derived motion data may lead to the development of robust and transformative digital measurements intended to predict, diagnose, and quantify neurological disease state and its longitudinal change.",

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to study the changes in white matter integrity in R6/2, a well-established animal model of Huntington's disease (HD) that are captured by ex vivo diffusion imaging (DTI) using a high field MRI (17.6 T). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and continuous time random walk (CTRW) models were used to fit changes in the diffusion-weighted signal intensity in the corpus callosum of controls and in R6/2 mice. RESULTS: A significant 13% decrease in fractional anisotropy, a 7% increase in axial diffusion, and a 33% increase in radial diffusion were observed between R6/2 and control mice. No change was observed in the CTRW beta parameter, but a significant decrease in the alpha parameter (- 21%) was measured. Histological analysis of the corpus callosum showed a decrease in axonal organization, myelin alterations, and astrogliosis. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated ultrastructural changes in degenerating axons, such as an increase in tortuosity in the R6/2 mice. CONCLUSIONS: DTI and CTRW diffusion models display quantitative changes associated with the microstructural alterations observed in the corpus callosum of the R6/2 mice. The observed increase in the diffusivity and decrease in the alpha CTRW parameter providing support for the use of these diffusion models for non-invasive detection of white matter alterations in HD.",

Pediatric-onset Huntingtons disease (PoHD) presents differently from adult-onset disease. Children typically exhibit regression in school performance, psychiatric features such as inattention, and oral motor dysfunction. Unlike adult-onset HD, in which seizures occur at approximately the rate of the general public, at least half of children with HD develop epilepsy and seizures can be a presenting feature of PoHD. Here we present the case of a 10-year-old boy with a history of language delay, motor regression, oral motor dysfunction, and tremor who presented with a first lifetime seizure. Given a family history of Huntingtons disease in his father, PoHD was considered, and a pathogenic allele with 88 repeats was confirmed in the child. As symptoms progressed, history alone could not differentiate abnormal movements from seizures. Continuous video electroencephalography helped to demonstrate epileptic myoclonic jerks and guide treatment.",

Conventional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging depicts important anatomic information and helps to identify imaging patterns which may support diagnosis of a specific motor disorder. Advanced imaging techniques can provide further detail regarding volume, functional, or metabolic changes occurring in nervous system pathology. This chapter is an overview of the advances in neuroimaging with particular emphasis on both standard and less well-known advanced imaging techniques and findings, such as diffusion tensor imaging or volumetric studies, and their application to specific motor disorders. In addition, it provides reference to emerging imaging biomarkers in motor system disorders such as Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease, and briefly reviews the neuroimaging findings in different causes of myelopathy and peripheral nerve disorders.",

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were first generated in 2007, but the full translational potential of this valuable tool has yet to be realized. The potential applications of hiPSCs are especially relevant to neurology, as brain cells from patients are rarely available for research. hiPSCs from individuals with neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases have facilitated biological and multi-omics studies as well as large-scale screening of chemical libraries. However, researchers are struggling to improve the scalability, reproducibility and quality of this descriptive disease modelling. Addressing these limitations will be the first step towards a new era in hiPSC research - that of predictive disease modelling - involving the correlation and integration of in vitro experimental data with longitudinal clinical data. This approach is a key element of the emerging precision medicine paradigm, in which hiPSCs could become a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool. Here, we consider the steps necessary to achieve predictive modelling of neurodegenerative disease with hiPSCs, using Huntington disease as an example.",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Synaptic damage has been proposed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of Huntington disease (HD), but in vivo evidence in humans is lacking. We performed a PET imaging study to assess synaptic damage and its clinical correlates in early HD in vivo. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, premanifest and early manifest (Shoulson-Fahn stage 1 and 2) HD mutation carriers and age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent clinical assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations and time-of-flight PET with 11C-UCB-J, a radioligand targeting the ubiquitous presynaptic terminal marker synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). We also performed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET in all participants because regional cerebral glucose consumption is thought to largely reflect synaptic activity. Volumes of interest were delineated on the basis of individual 3-dimensional T1 MRI. Standardized uptake value ratio-1 images were calculated for 11C-UCB-J with the centrum semiovale as reference region. 18F-FDG-PET activity was normalized to the pons. All PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. Volume of interest- and voxel-based analyses were performed. Correlations between clinical scores and 11C-UCB-J PET data were calculated. RESULTS: Eighteen HD mutation carriers (age 51.4 +- 11.6 years; 6 female; 7 premanifest, 11 early manifest) and 15 healthy controls (age 52.3 +- 3.5 years; 4 female) were included. In the HD group, significant loss of SV2A binding was found in putamen, caudate, pallidum, cerebellum, parietal, and temporal and frontal cortex, whereas reduced 18F-FDG uptake was restricted to caudate and putamen. In the premanifest subgroup, 11C-UCB-J and 18F-FDG-PET showed significant reductions in putamen and caudate only. In the total HD group, SV2A loss in the putamen correlated with motor impairment. DISCUSSION: Our data reveal loss of presynaptic terminal integrity in early HD, which begins in the striatum in the premanifest phase, spreads extensively to extrastriatal regions in the early manifest phase, and correlates with motor impairment. 11C-UCB-J PET is more sensitive than 18F-FDG-PET for detection of extrastriatal changes in early HD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that 11C-UCB-J PET accurately discriminates individuals HD from normal controls.",

IMPORTANCE: Greater body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is associated with improved survival among persons with Huntington disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Weight loss is common among persons with Parkinson disease (PD) and is associated with worse quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between change in BMI, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and total scores, and survival among persons with PD and to test whether there is a positive association between BMI at randomization and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analysis (from May 27, 2014, to October 13, 2015) of longitudinal data (3-6 years) from 1673 participants who started the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Exploratory Trials in PD Long-term Study-1 (NET-PD LS-1). This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of creatine monohydrate (10 g/d) that was performed at 45 sites throughout the United States and Canada. Participants with early (within 5 years of diagnosis) and treated (receiving dopaminergic therapy) PD were enrolled from March 2007 to May 2010 and followed up until September 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change across time in motor UPDRS score, change across time in total UPDRS score, and time to death. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of BMI on the change in motor and total UPDRS scores after controlling for covariates. Survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models of time to death. A participant's BMI was measured at randomization, and BMI trajectory groups were classified according to whether participants experienced weight loss (\"decreasing BMI\"), weight stability (\"stable BMI\"), or weight gain (\"increasing BMI\") during the study. RESULTS: Of the 1673 participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [9.6] years; 1074 [64.2%] were male), 158 (9.4%) experienced weight loss (decreasing BMI), whereas 233 (13.9%) experienced weight gain (increasing BMI). After adjusting for covariates, we found that the weight-loss group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score increased by 1.48 (0.28) (P < .001) more points per visit than the weight-stable group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score. The weight-gain group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score decreased by -0.51 (0.24) (P = .03) points per visit, relative to the weight-stable group. While there was an unadjusted difference in survival between the 3 BMI trajectory groups (log-rank P < .001), this was not significant after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Change in BMI was inversely associated with change in motor and total UPDRS scores in the NET-PD LS-1. Change in BMI was not associated with survival; however, these results were limited by the low number of deaths in the NET-PD LS-1. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00449865.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).",

The emergence of gene editing technologies offers a unique opportunity to develop mutation-specific treatments for pediatric neurological disorders. Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess brain morphometry in a sample of patients with juvenile-onset Huntington disease (JOHD) and several mouse models of Huntington disease (HD) that likely represent the human JOHD phenotype. METHODS: Despite sharing the mutation in the Huntingtin gene, adult-onset HD characteristically presents as a hyperkinetic motor disorder, while JOHD typically presents as a hypokinetic motor disease. The University of Iowa Kids-JHD program enrolls individuals 5 to 25 years of age who have already received the clinical diagnosis. A total of 19 children with juvenile HD (JHD) (mean CAG = 72) were studied. Patients with JHD were compared to healthy controls (n = 234) using a cross-sectional study design. Volumetric data from structural MRI was compared between groups. In addition, we used the same procedure to evaluate brain morphology of R6/2, zQ175, HdhQ250 HD mice models. RESULTS: Participants with JHD had substantially reduced intracranial volumes. After controlling for the small intracranial volume size, the volumes of subcortical regions (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus) and of cortical white matter were significantly decreased in patients with JHD. However, the cerebellum was proportionately enlarged in the JHD sample. The cerebral cortex was largely unaffected. Likewise, HD mice had a lower volume of striatum and a higher volume of cerebellum, mirroring the human MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: The primary pathology of JOHD extends beyond changes in the striatal volume. Brain morphology in both mice and human patients with JHD shows proportional cerebellar enlargement. This pattern of brain changes may explain the unique picture of hypokinetic motor symptoms in JHD, which is not seen in the hyperkinetic chorea-like phenotype of adult-onset HD.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative trinucleotide repeat disorder caused by an expanded poly-glutamine (polyQ) tract in the mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. The formation and topology of filamentous mHTT inclusions in the brain (hallmarks of HD implicated in neurotoxicity) remain elusive. Using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, here we show that mHTT exon 1 and polyQ-only aggregates in vitro are structurally heterogenous and filamentous, similar to prior observations with other methods. Yet, we find filaments in both types of aggregates under ~2 nm in width, thinner than previously reported, and regions forming large sheets. In addition, our data show a prevalent subpopulation of filaments exhibiting a lumpy slab morphology in both aggregates, supportive of the polyQ core model. This provides a basis for future cryoET studies of various aggregated mHTT and polyQ constructs to improve their structure-based modeling as well as their identification in cells without fusion tags.",

BACKGROUND: Motor impairment appears as a characteristic symptom of several diseases and injuries. Therefore, tests for analyzing motor dysfunction are widely applied across preclinical models and disease stages. Among those, gait analysis tests are commonly used, but they generate a huge number of gait parameters. Thus, complications in data analysis and reporting raise, which often leads to premature parameter selection. NEW METHODS: In order to avoid arbitrary parameter selection, we present here a systematic initial data analysis by utilizing heat-maps for data reporting. We exemplified this approach within an intervention study, as well as applied it to two longitudinal studies in rodent models related to Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington disease (HD). RESULTS: The systematic initial data analysis (IDA) is feasible for exploring gait parameters, both in experimental and longitudinal studies. The resulting heat maps provided a visualization of gait parameters within a single chart, highlighting important clusters of differences. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Often, premature parameter selection is practiced, lacking comprehensiveness. Researchers often use multiple separated graphs on distinct gait parameters for reporting. Additionally, negative results are often not reported. CONCLUSIONS: Heat mapping utilized in initial data analysis is advantageous for reporting clustered gait parameter differences in one single chart and improves data mining.",

Modulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) firing patterns with injections of depolarizing currents into the STN is an important advance for the treatment of hypokinetic movement disorders, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). Chorea, ballism and dystonia are prototypical examples of hyperkinetic movement disorders. In our previous study, normal rats without nigro-striatal lesion were rendered hypokinetic with hyperpolarizing currents injected into the STN. Therefore, modulation of the firing pattern by injection of a hyperpolarizing current into the STN could be an effective treatment for hyperkinetic movement disorders. We investigated the effect of injecting a hyperpolarizing current into the STNs of two different types of hyperkinetic animal models and a patient with an otherwise uncontrollable hyperkinetic disorder. The two animal models included levodopa-induced hyperkinetic movement in parkinsonian rats (L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia model) and hyperkinesia induced by an intrastriatal injection of 3-nitropropionic acid (Huntington disease model), covering neurodegeneration-related as well as neurotoxin-induced derangement in the cortico-subcortical re-entrant loops. Delivering hyperpolarizing currents into the STN readily alleviated the hyperkinetic behaviors in the two animal models and in the clinical case, with an evident increase in subthalamic burst discharges in electrophysiological recordings. Application of a hyperpolarizing current into the STN via a Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode could be an effective general therapy for a wide spectrum of hyperkinetic movement disorders.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatment is available. A better understanding of the pathology, and identification of biomarkers will facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments. HD is potentially a good model of a neurodegenerative disease for development of biomarkers because it is an autosomal-dominant disease with complete penetrance, caused by a single gene mutation, in which the neurodegenerative process can be assessed many years before onset of signs and symptoms of manifest disease. Previous MRI studies have detected abnormalities in gray and white matter starting in premanifest stages. However, the understanding of how these abnormalities are related, both in time and space, is still incomplete. In this study, we combined deep gray matter shape diffeomorphometry and white matter DTI analysis in order to provide a better mapping of pathology in the deep gray matter and subcortical white matter in premanifest HD. We used 296 MRI scans from the PREDICT-HD database. Atrophy in the deep gray matter, thalamus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens was analyzed by surface based morphometry, and while white matter abnormalities were analyzed in (i) regions of interest surrounding these structures, using (ii) tractography-based analysis, and using (iii) whole brain atlas-based analysis. We detected atrophy in the deep gray matter, particularly in putamen, from early premanifest stages. The atrophy was greater both in extent and effect size in cases with longer exposure to the effects of the CAG expansion mutation (as assessed by greater CAP-scores), and preceded detectible abnormalities in the white matter. Near the predicted onset of manifest HD, the MD increase was widespread, with highest indices in the deep and posterior white matter. This type of in-vivo macroscopic mapping of HD brain abnormalities can potentially indicate when and where therapeutics could be targeted to delay the onset or slow the disease progression. ",

Huntingtin N-terminal fragments (Htt-NTFs) with expanded polyglutamine tracts form a range of neurotoxic aggregates that are associated with Huntington's disease. Here, we show that aggregation of Htt-NTFs, irrespective of polyglutamine length, yields at least three phases (designated M, S, and F) that are delineated by sharp concentration thresholds and distinct aggregate sizes and morphologies. We found that monomers and oligomers make up the soluble M phase, ~25-nm spheres dominate in the soluble S phase, and long, linear fibrils make up the insoluble F phase. Previous studies showed that profilin, an abundant cellular protein, reduces Htt-NTF aggregation and toxicity in cells. We confirm that profilin achieves its cellular effects through direct binding to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Htt-NTFs. We show that profilin preferentially binds to Htt-NTF M-phase species and destabilizes aggregation and phase separation by shifting the concentration boundaries for phase separation to higher values through a process known as polyphasic linkage. Our experiments, aided by coarse-grained computer simulations and theoretical analysis, suggest that preferential binding of profilin to the M-phase species of Htt-NTFs is enhanced through a combination of specific interactions between profilin and polyproline segments and auxiliary interactions between profilin and polyglutamine tracts. Polyphasic linkage may be a general strategy that cells utilize to regulate phase behavior of aggregation-prone proteins. Accordingly, detailed knowledge of phase behavior and an understanding of how ligands modulate phase boundaries may pave the way for developing new therapeutics against a variety of aggregation-prone proteins.",

Movement disorders can be hypokinetic (e.g., parkinsonism), hyperkinetic, or dystonic in nature and commonly arise from altered function in nuclei of the basal ganglia or their connections. As obvious structural changes are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism. Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli. In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions. Various approaches are reviewed here. ",

We present microLAS, a lab-on-chip system that concentrates, separates, and detects DNA fragments in a single module. microLAS speeds up DNA size analysis in minutes using femtomolar amounts of amplified DNA. Here we tested the relevance of microLAS for sizing expanded trinucleotide repeats, which cause over 20 different neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Because the length of trinucleotide repeats correlates with the severity of the diseases, it is crucial to be able to size repeat tract length accurately and efficiently. Expanded trinucleotide repeats are however genetically unstable and difficult to amplify. Thus, the amount of amplified material to work with is often limited, making its analysis labor-intensive. We report the detection of heterogeneous allele lengths in 8 samples from myotonic dystrophy type 1 and Huntington disease patients with up to 750 CAG/CTG repeats in five minutes or less. The high sensitivity of the method allowed us to minimize the number of amplification cycles and thus reduce amplification artefacts without compromising the detection of the expanded allele. These results suggest that microLAS can speed up routine molecular biology applications of repetitive sequences and may improve the molecular diagnostic of expanded repeat disorders.",

BACKGROUND: The study of emotion recognition could be crucial for detecting alterations in certain cognitive areas or as an early sign of neurological disorders. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the study is to characterize research development on emotion recognition, identifying the intellectual structure that supports this area of knowledge, and the main lines of research attracting investigators' interest. METHODS: We identified publications on emotion recognition and dementia included in the Web of Science Core Collection, analyzing the scientific output and main disciplines involved in generating knowledge in the area. A co-citation analysis and an analysis of the bibliographic coupling between the retrieved documents elucidated the thematic orientations of the research and the reference works that constitute the foundation for development in the field. RESULTS: A total of 345 documents, with 24,282 bibliographic references between them, were included. This is an emerging research area, attracting the interest of investigators in Neurosciences, Psychology, Clinical Neurology, and Psychiatry, among other disciplines. Four prominent topic areas were identified, linked to frontotemporal dementia, autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's and Huntington disease. Many recent papers focus on the detection of mild cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Impaired emotion recognition may be a key sign facilitating the diagnosis and early treatment of different neurodegenerative diseases as well as for triggering the necessary provision of social and family support, explaining the growing research interest in this area.",

Determination of mtDNA copy number in the cell is crucial to understand many cellular processes. Recently, the number of studies with the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content as the determinant of mitochondrial abnormalities increased greatly and is still growing, therefore, optimization of technical conditions for this analysis is crucial. Despite using similar laboratory protocols, some results cannot be compared between research centers, thus causing discrepancies in the assessment of mtDNA content. The aim of this work was to test which conditions of biological sample collection and storage affect estimation of mtDNA level relative to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) in the blood samples and dermal fibroblasts. We found that the time and temperature of sample storage, as well as the type of the blood sample (whole blood or leukocytes) influence the estimate of mtDNA/nDNA ratio in the blood. In the case of dermal fibroblasts collected from healthy control and Huntington disease patients, our data indicate that the passage number of cells is essential to obtain reliable results.",

UNLABELLED: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG sequence of the huntingtin (Htt) gene, which encodes a stretch of glutamines in the Htt protein. The mechanisms of neurodegeneration associated with the accumulation of Htt aggregates still remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine oxidative stress biomarkers in HD patients and their relationship with clinical, demographic and neuroimaging parameters. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients and 39 controls paired by age and sex participated in this study. Oxidative damage was assayed in blood by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidative protein products (AOPPs). Antioxidant status was determined by activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein thiols and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP). The Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and neuroimaging studies were also employed. RESULTS: MDA, AOPP and GPx were significantly increased in HD patients with respect to the control group, while GR activity was decreased. FRAP correlated with age of disease onset, AOPP with motor severity (UHDRS score), age of patients and age of disease onset. Caudate atrophy was associated with lower plasma concentrations of GSH. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a redox imbalance in HD patients. GR activity could be a potential biomarker for symptom onset in asymptomatic gene carriers, while plasmatic GSH could be useful in monitoring the progression of neurodegeneration - as an expression of caudate atrophy - during the course of the disease.",

                    "text": "Recent advances in the therapeutic development for Huntington disease. INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

For Huntington disease, identification of brain regions related to motor impairment can be useful for developing interventions to alleviate the motor symptom, the major symptom of the disease. However, the effects from the brain regions to motor impairment may vary for different groups of patients. Hence, our interest is not only to identify the brain regions but also to understand how their effects on motor impairment differ by patient groups. This can be cast as a model selection problem for a varying-coefficient regression. However, this is challenging when there is a pre-specified group structure among variables. We propose a novel variable selection method for a varying-coefficient regression with such structured variables and provide a publicly available R package svreg for implementation of our method. Our method is empirically shown to select relevant variables consistently. Also, our method screens irrelevant variables better than existing methods. Hence, our method leads to a model with higher sensitivity, lower false discovery rate and higher prediction accuracy than the existing methods. Finally, we found that the effects from the brain regions to motor impairment differ by disease severity of the patients. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to identify such interaction effects between the disease severity and brain regions, which indicates the need for customized intervention by disease severity.",

We queried 733 research subjects who chose not to learn their HD gene status when enrolling in the Prospective Huntington At-Risk Observational Study, carried out between 1999 and 2008. Lack of an effective cure or treatment (66% of subjects) and inability to undo knowledge (66%) were the major reasons cited for choosing not to undergo HD DNA testing. Most subjects were not concerned about the length or burden of the testing process (61% and 59%, respectively). Subjects were optimistic that a treatment to improve symptoms or postpone onset would be developed within the next 10 years (56% and 53%, respectively), but they had less certainty about the prospects to prevent HD onset (36%). This is the first large, systematic study of why people at risk for HD choose not to undergo genetic testing. Attitudes about how people at risk for HD approach this life-altering choice should be reassessed as new treatments develop, and as clinical trials now require genetic testing at entry.",

PURPOSE: Huntington disease (HD) is an incurable terminal disease. Thus, end of life (EOL) concerns are common in these individuals. A quantitative measure of EOL concerns in HD would enable a better understanding of how these concerns impact health-related quality of life. Therefore, we developed new measures of EOL for use in HD. METHODS: An EOL item pool of 45 items was field tested in 507 individuals with prodromal or manifest HD. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA, respectively) were conducted to establish unidimensional item pools. Item response theory (IRT) and differential item functioning analyses were applied to the identified unidimensional item pools to select the final items. RESULTS: EFA and CFA supported two separate unidimensional sets of items: Concern with Death and Dying (16 items), and Meaning and Purpose (14 items). IRT and DIF supported the retention of 12 Concern with Death and Dying items and 4 Meaning and Purpose items. IRT data supported the development of both a computer adaptive test (CAT) and a 6-item, static short form for Concern with Death and Dying. CONCLUSION: The HDQLIFE Concern with Death and Dying CAT and corresponding 6-item short form, and the 4-item calibrated HDQLIFE Meaning and Purpose scale demonstrate excellent psychometric properties. These new measures have the potential to provide clinically meaningful information about end-of-life preferences and concerns to clinicians and researchers working with individuals with HD. In addition, these measures may also be relevant and useful for other terminal conditions.",

                    "text": "A mobile, high-throughput semi-automated system for testing cognition in large non-primate animal models of Huntington disease. BACKGROUND: For reasons of cost and ethical concerns, models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) are currently being developed in farm animals, as an alternative to non-human primates. Developing reliable methods of testing cognitive function is essential to determining the usefulness of such models. Nevertheless, cognitive testing of farm animal species presents a unique set of challenges. The primary aims of this study were to develop and validate a mobile operant system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing of sheep. NEW METHOD: We designed a semi-automated testing system with the capability of presenting stimuli (visual, auditory) and reward at six spatial locations. Fourteen normal sheep were used to validate the system using a two-choice visual discrimination task. Four stages of training devised to acclimatise animals to the system are also presented. RESULTS: All sheep progressed rapidly through the training stages, over eight sessions. All sheep learned the 2CVDT and performed at least one reversal stage. The mean number of trials the sheep took to reach criterion in the first acquisition learning was 13.9+-1.5 and for the reversal learning was 19.1+-1.8. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): This is the first mobile semi-automated operant system developed for testing cognitive function in sheep. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed and validated an automated operant behavioural testing system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing in sheep and other medium-sized quadrupeds, such as pigs and dogs. Sheep performance in the two-choice visual discrimination task was very similar to that reported for non-human primates and strongly supports the use of farm animals as pre-clinical models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).",

OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of one's gene status for adult onset conditions provides opportunity to make advance end-of-life (EOL) plans. The purposes of these analyses were to (1) determine the prevalence of EOL plans, including advance directives (ADs) among persons across 3 stages of Huntington disease (HD) and (2) examine factors associated with having ADs in this sample. METHODS: Data are from 503 participants in the HD Quality of Life study. Participants completed an online health-related quality-of-life survey that included questions regarding EOL planning and self-reported HD symptoms. Frequencies were calculated for EOL planning by the HD stage. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to identify variables associated with having ADs. RESULTS: A total of 38.2% of participants stated they had ADs and fewer than half had other EOL plans. Being older, increased HD stage, more years of education, lower anxiety, more swallowing symptoms, and higher meaning and purpose were associated with having ADs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ADs in our sample is comparable to the general US population, but surprisingly low, considering the severity and long disease course of HD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health-care providers should develop specific interventions early in the disease process to increase ADs in this population.",

Englisch: Being one of the most common genetic neurodegenerative disease, Huntington's disease has been a model disease - also for gene therapy. Among the various options, the development of antisense oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus. Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene therapy against Huntington's disease.",

PURPOSE: Huntington disease (HD) is an incurable terminal disease. Thus, end of life (EOL) concerns are common in these individuals. A quantitative measure of EOL concerns in HD would enable a better understanding of how these concerns impact health-related quality of life. Therefore, we developed new measures of EOL for use in HD. METHODS: An EOL item pool of 45 items was field tested in 507 individuals with prodromal or manifest HD. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA, respectively) were conducted to establish unidimensional item pools. Item response theory (IRT) and differential item functioning analyses were applied to the identified unidimensional item pools to select the final items. RESULTS: EFA and CFA supported two separate unidimensional sets of items: Concern with Death and Dying (16 items), and Meaning and Purpose (14 items). IRT and DIF supported the retention of 12 Concern with Death and Dying items and 4 Meaning and Purpose items. IRT data supported the development of both a computer adaptive test (CAT) and a 6-item, static short form for Concern with Death and Dying. CONCLUSION: The HDQLIFE Concern with Death and Dying CAT and corresponding 6-item short form, and the 4-item calibrated HDQLIFE Meaning and Purpose scale demonstrate excellent psychometric properties. These new measures have the potential to provide clinically meaningful information about end-of-life preferences and concerns to clinicians and researchers working with individuals with HD. In addition, these measures may also be relevant and useful for other terminal conditions.",

The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of nine fatal, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of mutant proteins containing toxic expansions of CAG/polyQ tracts. The heat shock protein 90 and 70 (Hsp90/Hsp70) chaperone machinery is a key component of cellular protein quality control, playing a role in the regulation of folding, aggregation, and degradation of polyQ proteins. The ability of Hsp70 to facilitate disaggregation and degradation of misfolded proteins makes it an attractive therapeutic target in polyQ diseases. Genetic studies have demonstrated that manipulation of Hsp70 and related co-chaperones can enhance the disaggregation and/or degradation of misfolded proteins in models of polyQ disease. Therefore, the development of small molecules that enhance Hsp70 activity is of great interest. However, it is still unclear if currently available Hsp70 modulators can selectively enhance disaggregation or degradation of misfolded proteins without perturbing other Hsp70 functions essential for cellular homeostasis. This review discusses the multifaceted role of Hsp70 in protein quality control and the opportunities and challenges Hsp70 poses as a potential therapeutic target in polyQ disease.",

                    "text": "Imaging of Synaptic Density in Neurodegenerative Disorders. PET technology has produced many radiopharmaceuticals that target specific brain proteins and other measures of brain function. Recently, a new approach has emerged to image synaptic density by targeting the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), an integral glycoprotein in the membrane of synaptic vesicles and widely distributed throughout the brain. Multiple SV2A ligands have been developed and translated to human use. The most successful of these to date is 11C-UCB-J, because of its high uptake, moderate metabolism, and effective quantification with a 1-tissue-compartment model. Further, since SV2A is the target of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, human blocking studies have characterized specific binding and potential reference regions. Regional brain SV2A levels were shown to correlate with those of synaptophysin, another commonly used marker of synaptic density, providing the basis for SV2A PET imaging to have broad utility across neuropathologic diseases. In this review, we highlight the development of SV2A tracers and the evaluation of quantification methods, including compartment modeling and simple tissue ratios. Mouse and rat models of neurodegenerative diseases have been studied with small-animal PET, providing validation by comparison to direct tissue measures. Next, we review human PET imaging results in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Studies on Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease have progressed most rapidly at multiple centers, with generally consistent results of patterns of SV2A or synaptic loss. In Alzheimer disease, the synaptic loss patterns differ from those of amyloid, tau, and 18F-FDG, although intertracer and interregional correlations have been found. Smaller studies have been reported in other disorders, including Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In conclusion, PET imaging of SV2A has rapidly developed, and qualified radioligands are available. PET studies on humans indicate that SV2A loss might be specific to disease-associated brain regions and consistent with synaptic density loss. The recent availability of new 18F tracers, 18F-SynVesT-1 and 18F-SynVesT-2, will substantially broaden the application of SV2A PET. Future studies are needed in larger patient cohorts to establish the clinical value of SV2A PET and its potential for diagnosis and progression monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as efficacy assessment of disease-modifying therapies.",

BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarkers are increasingly used by neurologists, psychiatrists, and ophthalmologists for the diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of neurodegenerative diseases. Long-term data on OCT biomarkers of selected primary and secondary neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease, are already available in part. In addition, there are rare neurodegenerative diseases with early disease onset that may show OCT abnormalities. METHODS: A literature review on the association of OCT biomarkers with neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS beyond Alzheimer's disease is presented. Parkinson's disease, MS, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and lysosomal storage diseases are addressed. RESULTS: Relevant OCT biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness. Different sectors may be affected depending on the disease entity in addition to global pRFNL reduction. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) is also increasingly used as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography biomarkers are used in an interdisciplinary context. Retinal pathologies should be excluded by an ophthalmologist. While OCT biomarkers are increasingly used clinically in MS, the benefit in other neurodegenerative diseases, especially the rare ones, is less well documented. Further longitudinal studies are required.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the approach to chorea in clinical practice, beginning with a discussion of the phenomenologic features of chorea and how to differentiate it from other movement disorders. The diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas, and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats are included. RECENT FINDINGS: C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including NKX2-1, ADCY5, GNAO1, and PDE10A. New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing. SUMMARY: Clinical features remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.",

OBJECTIVE: With a shift towards noninvasive testing, we have explored and validated the use of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Fifteen couples have been included, assessing a total of n = 20 pregnancies. Fetal paternally inherited CAG repeat length was determined in total cell-free DNA from maternal plasma using a direct approach by PCR and subsequent fragment analysis. RESULTS: All fetal HD (n = 7) and intermediate (n = 3) CAG repeats could be detected in maternal plasma. Detection of repeats in the normal range (n = 10) was successful in n = 5 cases where the paternal repeat size could be distinguished from maternal repeat patterns after fragment analysis. In all other cases (n = 5), the paternal peaks coincided with the maternal peak pattern. All NIPD results were concordant with results from routine diagnostics on fetal genomic DNA from chorionic villi. CONCLUSION: In this validation study, we demonstrated that all fetuses at risk for HD could be identified noninvasively in maternal plasma. Additionally, we have confirmed results from previously described case reports that NIPD for HD can be performed using a direct approach by PCR. For future diagnostics, parental CAG profiles can be used to predict the success rate for NIPD prior to testing.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the approach to chorea in clinical practice, beginning with a discussion of the phenomenologic features of chorea and how to differentiate it from other movement disorders. The diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas, and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats are included. RECENT FINDINGS: C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including NKX2-1, ADCY5, GNAO1, and PDE10A. New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing. SUMMARY: Clinical features remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.",

                    "text": "Use of human stem cells in Huntington disease modeling and translational research. Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

We created an excitotoxic striatal lesion model of Huntington disease (HD) in sheep, using the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor agonist, quinolinic acid (QA). Sixteen sheep received a bolus infusion of QA (75 microL, 180 mM) or saline, first into the left and then (4 weeks later) into the right striatum. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the striata were performed. Metabolite concentrations and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured at baseline, acutely (1 week after each surgery) and chronically (5 weeks or greater after the surgeries). There was a significant decrease in the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and in FA in acutely lesioned striata of the QA-lesioned sheep, followed by a recovery of NAA and FA in the chronically lesioned striata. NAA level changes indicate acute death and/or impairment of neurons immediately after surgery, with recovery of reversibly impaired neurons over time. The change in FA values of the QA-lesioned striata is consistent with acute structural disruption, followed by re-organization and glial cell infiltration with time. Our study demonstrates that MRS and DTI changes in QA-sheep are consistent with HD-like pathology shown in other model species and that the MR investigations can be performed in sheep using a clinically relevant human 3T MRI scanner.",

Conventional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging depicts important anatomic information and helps to identify imaging patterns which may support diagnosis of a specific motor disorder. Advanced imaging techniques can provide further detail regarding volume, functional, or metabolic changes occurring in nervous system pathology. This chapter is an overview of the advances in neuroimaging with particular emphasis on both standard and less well-known advanced imaging techniques and findings, such as diffusion tensor imaging or volumetric studies, and their application to specific motor disorders. In addition, it provides reference to emerging imaging biomarkers in motor system disorders such as Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease, and briefly reviews the neuroimaging findings in different causes of myelopathy and peripheral nerve disorders.",

INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects striatal neurons. Striatal volume loss is present years before clinical diagnosis; however, white matter degradation may also occur prior to diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can measure microstructural changes associated with degeneration that precede macrostructural changes. DWI derived measures enhance understanding of degeneration in prodromal HD (pre-HD). METHODS: As part of the PREDICT-HD study, N = 191 pre-HD individuals and 70 healthy controls underwent two or more (baseline and 1-5 year follow-up) DWI, with n = 649 total sessions. Images were processed using cutting-edge DWI analysis methods for large multicenter studies. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were computed in selected tracts connecting the primary motor, primary somato-sensory, and premotor areas of the cortex with the subcortical caudate and putamen. Pre-HD participants were divided into three CAG-Age Product (CAP) score groups reflecting clinical diagnosis probability (low, medium, or high probabilities). Baseline and longitudinal group differences were examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in DTI measures were present in all three CAP groups compared with controls. The high CAP group was most affected. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest longitudinal DWI study of pre-HD to date. Findings showed DTI differences, consistent with white matter degeneration, were present up to a decade before predicted HD diagnosis. Our findings indicate a unique role for disrupted connectivity between the premotor area and the putamen, which may be closely tied to the onset of motor symptoms in HD.

White matter (WM) atrophy is a significant feature of Huntington disease (HD), although its aetiology and early pathological manifestations remain poorly defined. In this study, we aimed to characterize WM-related features in the transgenic YAC128 and BACHD models of HD. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), we demonstrate that microstructural WM abnormalities occur from an early age in YAC128 mice. Similarly, electron microscopy analysis of myelinated fibres of the corpus callosum indicated that myelin sheaths are thinner in YAC128 mice as early as 1.5 months of age, well before any neuronal loss can be detected. Transcript levels of myelin-related genes in striatal and cortical tissues were significantly lower in YAC128 mice from 2 weeks of age, and these findings were replicated in differentiated primary oligodendrocytes from YAC128 mice, suggesting a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed structural deficits. Concordant with these observations, we demonstrate reduced expression of myelin-related genes at 3 months of age and WM microstructural abnormalities using DT-MRI at 12 months of age in the BACHD rats. These findings indicate that WM deficits in HD are an early phenotype associated with cell-intrinsic effects of mutant huntingtin on myelin-related transcripts in oligodendrocytes, and raise the possibility that WM abnormalities may be an early contributing factor to the pathogenesis of HD.",

Although much prior work has focused on the basal ganglia and cortical pathology that defines Huntington's disease (HD), recent studies have also begun to characterize cerebral white matter damage (Rosas et al., 2006; Dumas et al., 2012; Poudel et al., 2014). In this study, we investigated differences in the large fascicular bundles of the cerebral white matter of gene-positive HD carriers, including pre-manifest individuals and early symptomatic patients, using recently developed diffusion tractography procedures. We examined eighteen major fiber bundles in 37 patients with early HD (average age 55.2 +- 11.5, 14 male, 23 female), 31 gene-positive, motor negative pre-symptomatic HD (PHD) (average age 48.1 +- 11.5, 13 male, 18 female), and 38 healthy age-matched controls (average age 55.7 +- 8.6, 14 male, 24 female), using the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) procedure available as part of the FreeSurfer image processing software package. We calculated the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean radial (RD) and axial diffusivities (AD) for each fiber bundle. We also evaluated the relationships between diffusion measures, cognition and regional cortical thinning. We found that early changes in RD of select tracts in PHD subjects were associated with impaired performance on neuropsychological tests, suggesting that early changes in myelin might underlie early cognitive dysfunction. Finally, we found that increases in AD of select tracts were associated with regionally select cortical thinning of areas known to atrophy in HD, including the sensorimotor, supramarginal and fusiform gyrus, suggesting that AD may be reflecting pyramidal cell degeneration in HD. Together, these results suggest that white matter microstructural changes in HD reflect a complex, clinically relevant and dynamic process.",

                    "text": "Longitudinal diffusion changes in prodromal and early HD: Evidence of white-matter tract deterioration. INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects striatal neurons. Striatal volume loss is present years before clinical diagnosis; however, white matter degradation may also occur prior to diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can measure microstructural changes associated with degeneration that precede macrostructural changes. DWI derived measures enhance understanding of degeneration in prodromal HD (pre-HD). METHODS: As part of the PREDICT-HD study, N = 191 pre-HD individuals and 70 healthy controls underwent two or more (baseline and 1-5 year follow-up) DWI, with n = 649 total sessions. Images were processed using cutting-edge DWI analysis methods for large multicenter studies. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were computed in selected tracts connecting the primary motor, primary somato-sensory, and premotor areas of the cortex with the subcortical caudate and putamen. Pre-HD participants were divided into three CAG-Age Product (CAP) score groups reflecting clinical diagnosis probability (low, medium, or high probabilities). Baseline and longitudinal group differences were examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in DTI measures were present in all three CAP groups compared with controls. The high CAP group was most affected. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest longitudinal DWI study of pre-HD to date. Findings showed DTI differences, consistent with white matter degeneration, were present up to a decade before predicted HD diagnosis. Our findings indicate a unique role for disrupted connectivity between the premotor area and the putamen, which may be closely tied to the onset of motor symptoms in HD.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) is an important diagnostic tool in Huntington disease (HD), a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. To clarify the nature of diffusivity changes in HD, we compared the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCW ) acquired by DW-MR with extracellular space volume fraction alpha and tortuosity lambda, measured by the iontophoretic method in the R6/2 mouse model of HD and in wild-type controls (WT). In anisotropic globus pallidus (GP), diffusion measurements were performed in the mediolateral (x), rostrocaudal (y), and ventrodorsal (z) axes. In HD animals, we detected an increase in ADCW in all axes and larger alpha than in WT mice. No significant difference between WT and HD mice was found in the values of tortuosity (lambdax , lambday , lambdaz ). Despite structural changes in GP, diffusion anisotropy was unaffected in HD mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed in HD mice weaker expression of extracellular matrix and a decrease in neuron numbers compared with WT mice. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining detected astrogliosis-like changes in the morphology of astrocytic processes in HD GP. In the somatosensory cortex, no significant differences in the studied parameters were found. We conclude that in the R6/2 model of HD, a decrease in the number of neurons in the GP results in increased ADCW and alpha values.

RESULTS: Dementia, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease are the neurological diseases that most frequently motivate requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Requests related to dementia constitute the largest group, are growing, and raise additional ethical and legal issues due to these patients' diminished decision-making capacity. In some countries, the ratios of euthanasia requests to all cases of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, or Huntington disease are higher than for any other disease.

RESULTS: All fetal HD (n = 7) and intermediate (n = 3) CAG repeats could be detected in maternal plasma. Detection of repeats in the normal range (n = 10) was successful in n = 5 cases where the paternal repeat size could be distinguished from maternal repeat patterns after fragment analysis. In all other cases (n = 5), the paternal peaks coincided with the maternal peak pattern. All NIPD results were concordant with results from routine diagnostics on fetal genomic DNA from chorionic villi. CONCLUSION: In this validation study, we demonstrated that all fetuses at risk for HD could be identified noninvasively in maternal plasma. Additionally, we have confirmed results from previously described case reports that NIPD for HD can be performed using a direct approach by PCR. For future diagnostics, parental CAG profiles can be used to predict the success rate for NIPD prior to testing.",

BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.",

This qualitative study gathered opinions about genetic testing from people who received presymptomatic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) 20-30 years ago and have lived with the implications of that testing for decades. During the last section of a semi-structured interview, participants were asked open-ended questions about their opinions on the importance of autonomy in the decision to be tested for HD, whether a formal HD testing protocol is necessary, whether physician ordering for HD is acceptable without a formal protocol, whether online direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for HD is acceptable, and whether incidental/secondary findings should be returned in the context of whole exome/genome sequencing. Most-but not all-participants were in favor of an individual's right to decide whether and when to pursue HD testing, use of a formal HD testing protocol, and returning medically actionable secondary findings. However, the majority of participants were opposed not only to physician ordering and DTC HD testing in the absence of a formal protocol but also to returning a secondary finding of an expanded HD allele. This study presents the opinions of a unique and extremely well-informed cohort on issues that need to be taken into careful consideration by genetic counselors and other medical professionals who are developing genetic testing protocols, making decisions about the availability of genetic tests, and making decisions about whether and how to return incidental findings.",

                    "text": "Tetrabenazine Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Chorea Associated with Huntington Disease: A Retrospective Chart Review. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

OBJECTIVE: After MRI studies suggested the efficacy of ethyl-EPA in reducing the progressive brain atrophy in Huntington disease (HD), trials were conducted to test its efficacy as a treatment for HD. Trials that continued for 6 months did not find any significant improvement, urging discontinuation of the drug. However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of motor functions in these patients. METHODS: We searched 12 electronic databases to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening, only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score-4 in both fixed and quality effect models [MD = -2.720, 95% CI (-4.76, -.68), p = 0.009; MD = -2.225, 95% CI (-3.842, -0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score showed significant results [MD = -1.013, 95% CI (-1.793, -0.233), p = 0.011] in only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming test or symbol digit modality. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement of motor scores only after 12 months. These results should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies had assessed the efficacy of ethyl-EPA after 12 months with one of them having a 6-month open-label phase.",

Predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD) in 25% at-risk individuals is testing with full knowledge, and sometimes assuming, that the parent does not want to know his status. The goal of this study was to understand: (1) the differences in the motivation between 25% and 50% at-risk individuals to be tested and (2) the consequences of \"double disclosure\", including parental reactions. Test requests from 25% at-risk individuals were rare (155/1611, 10%). We compared their motivation with those of 1456 50% at-risk individuals. The principal motivation to have the test for both groups was \"to know\" (48% versus 58%, p = 0.049), but the desire to have children was more frequent in the 25% at-risk group (32% versus 17%, p < 0.001). Sixty percent of the 25% at-risk group went through the testing procedure: 15% (n = 14) were variant positive for HD. Testees reported four adverse reactions of their parent (22%): one committed suicide and three became depressed. This result highlights the impact of \"double disclosure\", a bad result for the person themselves and the transmitting parent. It is the responsibility of the team to anticipate this outcome with the 25% at-risk individuals: children revealing the genetic status to their parent. They should help the testees and their family to find a satisfactory solution to help prevent adverse reactions. This includes ensuring that the candidate is well-infomed abour the testing options and consequences to her/himself but also to her/his parent. The at-risk parent should be offered to discuss the implications of their child's testing.",

In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed.

As obvious structural changes are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism. Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli. In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions. Various approaches are reviewed here. ",

INTRODUCTION: Huntington s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric, motor and cognitive manifestations. It is caused by expansion of the trinucleotide CAG on HTT. The molecular bases are not completely understood, DNA damage, such as double and single strand breaks and oxidative stress (OS) have been implicated. At telomeres, DNA breaks are less efficiently repaired. Double strand breaks evoke the break induced replication (BIR) mechanism. BIR, plus inefficient repair can produce telomere shortening and cellular senescence. Our aim was to investigate the correlation between leukocyte relative telomeric length (RTL) and HD. METHODS: 206 samples were analyzed, 71 patients with molecular diagnosis and symptomatology (HD), 29 individuals with positive molecular test but asymptomatic (PP) and 106 healthy individuals (NP). RESULTS: We found a significant difference in RTL between HD patients compared with both, PP and NP, independently of subjects' age. DISCUSSION: Here we present evidence supporting an association between telomere shortening and HD. Telomere shortening could be related to DNA damage caused by ROS and defective DNA repair mechanism. Both events have been probed to occur in the presence of a mutant Huntingtin. This study contributes with current evidence suggesting a potential role of telomere shortening as HD biomarker.",

We present microLAS, a lab-on-chip system that concentrates, separates, and detects DNA fragments in a single module. microLAS speeds up DNA size analysis in minutes using femtomolar amounts of amplified DNA. Here we tested the relevance of microLAS for sizing expanded trinucleotide repeats, which cause over 20 different neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Because the length of trinucleotide repeats correlates with the severity of the diseases, it is crucial to be able to size repeat tract length accurately and efficiently. Expanded trinucleotide repeats are however genetically unstable and difficult to amplify. Thus, the amount of amplified material to work with is often limited, making its analysis labor-intensive. We report the detection of heterogeneous allele lengths in 8 samples from myotonic dystrophy type 1 and Huntington disease patients with up to 750 CAG/CTG repeats in five minutes or less. The high sensitivity of the method allowed us to minimize the number of amplification cycles and thus reduce amplification artefacts without compromising the detection of the expanded allele. These results suggest that microLAS can speed up routine molecular biology applications of repetitive sequences and may improve the molecular diagnostic of expanded repeat disorders.",

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular pathology of Huntington disease (HD) appears to be complex; while microvascular dysfunction seems to appear early, deaths from cardiomyopathy and stroke might occur in the late phase of HD. METHODS: Our study evaluated global risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), structure and function of precerebral arteries in 41 HD subjects and 41 matched controls. HD subjects were divided into groups by the United Huntington disease rating scale (presymptomatic-PHD, early-EHD, midstage-MHD and late-LHD). CHD risk factors assessment and Doppler examination of precerebral arteries were performed, including measurements of the carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), and parameters indicating local carotid artery distensibility (stiffness index beta, pulse wave velocity, pressure strain elasticity module and carotid artery compliance). RESULTS: In the HD and controls we identified a comparable number of non-obstructive plaques (<50% lumen narrowing). No obstructive plaques (>50% lumen narrowing) were found. There was significantly increased IMT in MHD. In PHD and EHD the parameters of arterial stiffness were significantly higher and the carotid artery compliance was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal functional vascular pathology in PHD, EHD, and MHD. Precerebral arteries dysfunction in HD therefore appears to be mostly functional and in agreement with recently described autonomic nervous system changes in HD.",

                    "text": "Tetrabenazine Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Chorea Associated with Huntington Disease: A Retrospective Chart Review. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

PURPOSE: Pridopidine is an investigational drug for Huntington disease (HD). Pridopidine was originally thought to act as a dopamine stabilizer. However, pridopidine shows highest affinity to the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) and enhances neuroprotection via the S1R in preclinical studies. Using [18F] fluspidine and [18F] fallypride PET, the purpose of this study was to assess in vivo target engagement/receptor occupancy of pridopidine to the S1R and dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) at clinical relevant doses in healthy volunteers (HVs) and as proof-of-concept in a small number of patients with HD. METHODS: Using [18F] fluspidine PET (300 MBq, 0-90 min), 11 male HVs (pridopidine 0.5 to 90 mg; six dose groups) and three male patients with HD (pridopidine 90 mg) were investigated twice, without and 2 h after single dose of pridopidine. Using [18F] fallypride PET (200 MBq, 0-210 min), four male HVs were studied without and 2 h following pridopidine administration (90 mg). Receptor occupancy was analyzed by the Lassen plot. RESULTS: S1R occupancy as function of pridopidine dose (or plasma concentration) in HVs could be described by a three-parameter Hill equation with a Hill coefficient larger than one. A high degree of S1R occupancy (87% to 91%) was found throughout the brain at pridopidine doses ranging from 22.5 to 90 mg. S1R occupancy was 43% at 1 mg pridopidine. In contrast, at 90 mg pridopidine, the D2/D3R occupancy was only minimal (~ 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our PET findings indicate that at clinically relevant single dose of 90 mg, pridopidine acts as a selective S1R ligand showing near to complete S1R occupancy with negligible occupancy of the D2/D3R. The dose S1R occupancy relationship suggests cooperative binding of pridopidine to the S1R. Our findings provide significant clarification about pridopidine's mechanism of action and support further use of the 45-mg twice-daily dose to achieve full and selective targeting of the S1R in future clinical trials of neurodegenerative disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To survey neurologists and obtain clinical perceptions of tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in patients with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

OBJECTIVE: To survey neurologists and obtain clinical perceptions of tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in patients with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

Importance: Tetrabenazine is efficacious for chorea control; however, tolerability concerns exist. Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea, was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea control. Interventions: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales. Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled. Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment. Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1 and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively maintained chorea control.",

Importance: Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor and phonic tics; treatments for tics are associated with safety concerns. Deutetrabenazine is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia in adults. Objective: To examine whether deutetrabenazine is effective and safe for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in children and adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2/3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-titration study included children and adolescents (aged 6-16 years) with Tourette syndrome with active tics causing distress or impairment (ie, Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score [YGTSS-TTS] >=20). The trial was conducted over 12 weeks, with 1 week of follow-up from February 2018 to November 2019 at 36 centers in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Russia, Serbia, and Spain. Data analysis was conducted from January 31 to April 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive deutetrabenazine or placebo, titrated during 7 weeks to an optimal level, followed by a 5-week maintenance period. The maximum total daily deutetrabenazine dose was 48 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 12 in YGTSS-TTS. Key secondary end points included changes in Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression, Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, questionnaires, and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 119 participants were randomized to deutetrabenazine (59 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.5] years; 53 [90%] boys; 49 [83%] White; 3 [5%] Black) and placebo (60 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.6] years; 51 [85%] boys; 53 [88%] White; 3 [5%] Black). At week 12, the difference in YGTSS-TTS score was not significant between deutetrabenazine and placebo (least squares mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -4.1 to 2.8; P = .69; Cohen d, -0.07). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 38 patients (66%) and 33 patients (56%) receiving deutetrabenazine and placebo, respectively, and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. These results may be informative for future studies of treatments for tics in Tourette syndrome. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03452943.",

PURPOSE: Laquinimod is an orally dosed immuno-modulator currently under development for Huntington's disease (HD). Preclinical findings suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated. METHODS: In this randomized, phase-1 single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of 21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose. RESULTS: The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24 and Cmax of EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSION: The combination of COC and laquinimod treatment was found to be safe, tolerable, and devoid of any noticeable pharmacokinetic interaction.",

OBJECTIVE: Understanding the body composition (BC) of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) could help to delay disease progression and improve treatment efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess BC parameters, including bone mineral density (BMD), and to find new biomarkers that can be early indicators for weight loss in patients with HD. METHODS: Twenty-one age- and sex-matched patients with HD and 29 healthy controls (CT) were enrolled. For each patient, body weight (BW), height, and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. BC and BMD were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subsamples were created according to sex and percent fat mass (FM) (obese and nonobese). All analyses were carried out using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: In all comparisons, BMD and T-score were lower in the HD group, but were not correlated with lean body mass (LBM) or FM. In the HD group, LBM and truncal fat were mostly reduced, except in women with HD whose BC appeared to be less affected by the disease than men. Furthermore, LBM (r = 0.80) and truncal fat (r = 0.68) were better correlated with BW than BMI (r = 0.56). CONCLUSION: Complete BC assessment can be crucial for preventive interventions and prognosis definition in patients with HD. New biomarkers such as BMD, LBM, and truncal fat can be early indicators of weight loss in patients with HD.",

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to follow tonic and phasic autonomic nervous activity in Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers and patients. METHODS: Evaluation of motor functions and total functional capacity was performed in 30 HD mutation carriers or patients at the beginning and in 22 subjects after 8-10 years. Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress. There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of an outbreak of clinical disease phase.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the EEG modifications in patients with Huntington disease (HD) compared with controls, by means of the exact LOw REsolution Tomography (eLORETA) software. We evaluated EEG changes during wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Moreover, we reviewed the literature concerning EEG modifications in HD. Twenty-three consecutive adult patients affected by HD were enrolled, 14 women and 9 men, mean age was 57.0 +- 12.4 years. Control subjects were healthy volunteers (mean age 58.2 +- 14.6 years). EEG and polygraphic recordings were performed during wake (before sleep) and during sleep. Sources of EEG activities were determined using the eLORETA software. In wake EEG, significant differences between patients and controls were detected in the delta frequency band (threshold T = +-4.606; P < .01) in the Brodmann areas (BAs) 3, 4, and 6 bilaterally. In NREM sleep, HD patients showed increased alpha power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in BAs 4 and 6 bilaterally; decreased theta power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in the BAs 23, 29, and 30; and decreased beta power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in the left BA 30. During REM, HD patients presented decreased theta and alpha power (threshold T = +-4.640; P < .01) in the BAs 23, 29, 30, and 31 bilaterally. In conclusion, EEG data suggest a motor cortex dysfunction during wake and sleep in HD patients, which correlates with the clinical and polysomnographic evidence of increased motor activity during wake and NREM, and nearly absent motor abnormalities in REM.",

                    "text": "Using Actiwatch to monitor circadian rhythm disturbance in Huntington' disease: A cautionary note. Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is well recognised as producing progressive deterioration of motor function, including dyskinetic movements, as well as deterioration of cognition and ability to carry out activities of daily living. However, individuals with HD commonly suffer from a wide range of additional symptoms, including weight loss and sleep disturbance, possibly due to disruption of circadian rhythmicity. Disrupted circadian rhythms have been reported in mice models of HD and in humans with HD. One way of assessing an individual's circadian rhythmicity in a community setting is to monitor their sleep/wake cycles, and a convenient method for recording periods of wakefulness and sleep is to use accelerometers to discriminate between varied activity levels (including sleep) during daily life. Here we used Actiwatch( ) Activity monitors alongside ambulatory EEG and sleep diaries to record wake/sleep patterns in people with HD and normal volunteers. We report that periods of wakefulness during the night, as detected by activity monitors, agreed poorly with EEG recordings in HD subjects, and unsurprisingly sleep diary findings showed poor agreement with both EEG recordings and activity monitor derived sleep periods. One explanation for this is the occurrence of 'break through' involuntary movements during sleep in the HD patients, which are incorrectly assessed as wakeful periods by the activity monitor algorithms. Thus, care needs to be taken when using activity monitors to assess circadian activity in individuals with movement disorders.",

Autophagic defects are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disorder (PD). Enhancing autophagy to remove impaired mitochondria and toxic protein aggregation is an essential component of PD treatment. In particular, activation of autophagy confers neuroprotection in cellular and preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment in mice with established PD and evaluated the relationship between EA, autophagy, and different neurons in the mouse brain. We report that EA improves PD motor symptoms in mice and enhances (1) autophagy initiation (increased Beclin 1), (2) autophagosome biogenesis (increased Atg5, Atg7, Atg9A, Atg12, Atg16L, Atg3, and LC3-II), (3) autophagy flux/substrate degradation (decreased p62), and (4) mitophagy (increased PINK1 and DJ-1) in neurons of the substantia nigra, striatum, hippocampus, and cortex (affected brain areas of PD, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer's disease). EA enhances autophagy initiation, autophagosome biogenesis, mitophagy, and autophagy flux/substrate degradation in certain brain areas. Our findings are the first to show that EA regulates neuronal autophagy and suggest that this convenient, inexpensive treatment has exciting therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders.",

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to study the changes in white matter integrity in R6/2, a well-established animal model of Huntington's disease (HD) that are captured by ex vivo diffusion imaging (DTI) using a high field MRI (17.6 T). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and continuous time random walk (CTRW) models were used to fit changes in the diffusion-weighted signal intensity in the corpus callosum of controls and in R6/2 mice. RESULTS: A significant 13% decrease in fractional anisotropy, a 7% increase in axial diffusion, and a 33% increase in radial diffusion were observed between R6/2 and control mice. No change was observed in the CTRW beta parameter, but a significant decrease in the alpha parameter (- 21%) was measured. Histological analysis of the corpus callosum showed a decrease in axonal organization, myelin alterations, and astrogliosis. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated ultrastructural changes in degenerating axons, such as an increase in tortuosity in the R6/2 mice. CONCLUSIONS: DTI and CTRW diffusion models display quantitative changes associated with the microstructural alterations observed in the corpus callosum of the R6/2 mice. The observed increase in the diffusivity and decrease in the alpha CTRW parameter providing support for the use of these diffusion models for non-invasive detection of white matter alterations in HD.",

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to study the changes in white matter integrity in R6/2, a well-established animal model of Huntington's disease (HD) that are captured by ex vivo diffusion imaging (DTI) using a high field MRI (17.6 T). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and continuous time random walk (CTRW) models were used to fit changes in the diffusion-weighted signal intensity in the corpus callosum of controls and in R6/2 mice. RESULTS: A significant 13% decrease in fractional anisotropy, a 7% increase in axial diffusion, and a 33% increase in radial diffusion were observed between R6/2 and control mice. No change was observed in the CTRW beta parameter, but a significant decrease in the alpha parameter (- 21%) was measured. Histological analysis of the corpus callosum showed a decrease in axonal organization, myelin alterations, and astrogliosis. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated ultrastructural changes in degenerating axons, such as an increase in tortuosity in the R6/2 mice. CONCLUSIONS: DTI and CTRW diffusion models display quantitative changes associated with the microstructural alterations observed in the corpus callosum of the R6/2 mice. The observed increase in the diffusivity and decrease in the alpha CTRW parameter providing support for the use of these diffusion models for non-invasive detection of white matter alterations in HD.",

White matter (WM) atrophy is a significant feature of Huntington disease (HD), although its aetiology and early pathological manifestations remain poorly defined. In this study, we aimed to characterize WM-related features in the transgenic YAC128 and BACHD models of HD. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), we demonstrate that microstructural WM abnormalities occur from an early age in YAC128 mice. Similarly, electron microscopy analysis of myelinated fibres of the corpus callosum indicated that myelin sheaths are thinner in YAC128 mice as early as 1.5 months of age, well before any neuronal loss can be detected. Transcript levels of myelin-related genes in striatal and cortical tissues were significantly lower in YAC128 mice from 2 weeks of age, and these findings were replicated in differentiated primary oligodendrocytes from YAC128 mice, suggesting a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed structural deficits. Concordant with these observations, we demonstrate reduced expression of myelin-related genes at 3 months of age and WM microstructural abnormalities using DT-MRI at 12 months of age in the BACHD rats. These findings indicate that WM deficits in HD are an early phenotype associated with cell-intrinsic effects of mutant huntingtin on myelin-related transcripts in oligodendrocytes, and raise the possibility that WM abnormalities may be an early contributing factor to the pathogenesis of HD.",

BACKGROUND: Clinical care teams providing presymptomatic genetic testing often employ advanced confidentiality practices for documentation and result storage. However, patient requests for increased confidentiality may be in conflict with the legal obligations of medical providers to document patient care activities in the electronic health record (EHR). Huntington disease presents a representative case study for investigating the ways centers currently balance the requirements of EHRs with the privacy demands of patients seeking presymptomatic genetic testing. METHODS: We surveyed 23 HD centers (53% response rate) regarding their use of the EHR for presymptomatic HD testing. RESULTS: Our survey revealed that clinical care teams and laboratories have each developed their own practices, which are cumbersome and often include EHR avoidance. We found that a majority of HD care teams record appointments in the EHR (91%), often using vague notes. Approximately half of the care teams (52%) keep presymptomatic results of out of the EHR. CONCLUSION: As genetic knowledge grows, linking more genes to late-onset conditions, institutions will benefit from having professional recommendations to guide development of policies for EHR documentation of presymptomatic genetic results. Policies must be sensitive to the ethical differences and patient demands for presymptomatic genetic testing compared to those undergoing confirmatory genetic testing.",

Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.",

Nevertheless, the real impact of sex differences in movement disorders remains under-recognized. In this article, we provide an up-to-date review of sex-related differences in PD and the most common hyperkinetic movement disorders, namely, essential tremor, dystonia, Huntington disease and other chorea syndromes, and Tourette syndrome and other chronic tic disorders. We highlight the most relevant clinical aspects of movement disorders that differ between men and women.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the EEG modifications in patients with Huntington disease (HD) compared with controls, by means of the exact LOw REsolution Tomography (eLORETA) software. We evaluated EEG changes during wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Moreover, we reviewed the literature concerning EEG modifications in HD. Twenty-three consecutive adult patients affected by HD were enrolled, 14 women and 9 men, mean age was 57.0 +- 12.4 years. Control subjects were healthy volunteers (mean age 58.2 +- 14.6 years). EEG and polygraphic recordings were performed during wake (before sleep) and during sleep. Sources of EEG activities were determined using the eLORETA software. In wake EEG, significant differences between patients and controls were detected in the delta frequency band (threshold T = +-4.606; P < .01) in the Brodmann areas (BAs) 3, 4, and 6 bilaterally. In NREM sleep, HD patients showed increased alpha power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in BAs 4 and 6 bilaterally; decreased theta power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in the BAs 23, 29, and 30; and decreased beta power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in the left BA 30. During REM, HD patients presented decreased theta and alpha power (threshold T = +-4.640; P < .01) in the BAs 23, 29, 30, and 31 bilaterally. In conclusion, EEG data suggest a motor cortex dysfunction during wake and sleep in HD patients, which correlates with the clinical and polysomnographic evidence of increased motor activity during wake and NREM, and nearly absent motor abnormalities in REM.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

Catching primal functional changes in early, 'very far from disease onset' (VFDO) stages of Huntington's disease is likely to be the key to a successful therapy. Focusing on VFDO stages, we assessed neuronal microcircuits in premanifest Hdh150 knock-in mice. Employing in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we revealed an early pattern of circuit dysregulation in the visual cortex - one of the first regions affected in premanifest Huntington's disease - characterized by an increase in activity, an enhanced synchronicity and hyperactive neurons. These findings are accompanied by aberrations in animal behavior. We furthermore show that the antidiabetic drug metformin diminishes aberrant Huntingtin protein load and fully restores both early network activity patterns and behavioral aberrations. This network-centered approach reveals a critical window of vulnerability far before clinical manifestation and establishes metformin as a promising candidate for a chronic therapy starting early in premanifest Huntington's disease pathogenesis long before the onset of clinical symptoms.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms across a wide range of neurological domains, including cognitive and motor dysfunction. There is still no causative treatment for HD but environmental factors such as passive lifestyle may modulate disease onset and progression. In humans, multidisciplinary rehabilitation has a positive impact on cognitive functions. However, a specific role for exercise as a component of an environmental enrichment effect has been difficult to demonstrate. We aimed at investigating whether endurance training (ET) stabilizes the progression of motor and cognitive dysfunction and ameliorates cardiovascular function in HD patients. Twelve male HD patients (mean +- SD, 54.8 +- 7.1 years) and twelve male controls (49.1 +- 6.8 years) completed 26 weeks of endurance training. Before and after the training intervention, clinical assessments, exercise physiological tests, and a body composition measurement were conducted and a muscle biopsy was taken from M. vastus lateralis. To examine the natural course of the disease, HD patients were additionally assessed 6 months prior to ET. During the ET period, there was a motor deficit stabilization as indicated by the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor section score in HD patients (baseline: 18.6 +- 9.2, pre-training: 26.0 +- 13.7, post-training: 26.8 +- 16.4).

When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.",

                    "text": "Emerging Novel Approaches for the Enhanced Delivery of Natural Products for the Management of Neurodegenerative Diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease affect any part of the brain. The complete mechanism of ND is unknown, but there are some molecular mechanism and chemical process. Natural compounds have better compatibility with the human body along with lesser side effects. Moreover, several studies showed that various natural compounds have significant neuroprotective, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for treating the different type of ND. In ND, natural compounds act by various mechanisms such as preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating destructed biomolecules before their accumulation affects cell metabolism, and improving the disease conditions. But due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) layer and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds, their delivery into the brain is limited. To minimize this problem and enhance drug delivery into the brain with an effective therapeutic dose, there is a need to develop a practical novel approach. The various studies showed that nanoformulations and microneedles (MN) containing natural compounds such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, chrysin, piperine, ferulic acid, huperzine A, berberine, baicalein, hesperetin, and retinoic acid effectively improved many ND.

                    "text": "Emerging Novel Approaches for the Enhanced Delivery of Natural Products for the Management of Neurodegenerative Diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease affect any part of the brain. The complete mechanism of ND is unknown, but there are some molecular mechanism and chemical process. Natural compounds have better compatibility with the human body along with lesser side effects. Moreover, several studies showed that various natural compounds have significant neuroprotective, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for treating the different type of ND. In ND, natural compounds act by various mechanisms such as preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating destructed biomolecules before their accumulation affects cell metabolism, and improving the disease conditions. But due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) layer and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds, their delivery into the brain is limited. To minimize this problem and enhance drug delivery into the brain with an effective therapeutic dose, there is a need to develop a practical novel approach. The various studies showed that nanoformulations and microneedles (MN) containing natural compounds such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, chrysin, piperine, ferulic acid, huperzine A, berberine, baicalein, hesperetin, and retinoic acid effectively improved many ND. In this review, the effect of such natural drug-loaded nanoformulation and MN patches on ND management is discussed, along with their merits and demerits. This review aims to introduce different novel approaches for enhancing natural drug delivery into the brain to manage various neurodegenerative diseases.",

Autophagic defects are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disorder (PD).

In particular, activation of autophagy confers neuroprotection in cellular and preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment in mice with established PD and evaluated the relationship between EA, autophagy, and different neurons in the mouse brain. We report that EA improves PD motor symptoms in mice and enhances (1) autophagy initiation (increased Beclin 1), (2) autophagosome biogenesis (increased Atg5, Atg7, Atg9A, Atg12, Atg16L, Atg3, and LC3-II), (3) autophagy flux/substrate degradation (decreased p62), and (4) mitophagy (increased PINK1 and DJ-1) in neurons of the substantia nigra, striatum, hippocampus, and cortex (affected brain areas of PD, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer's disease).

Predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD) in 25% at-risk individuals is testing with full knowledge, and sometimes assuming, that the parent does not want to know his status. The goal of this study was to understand: (1) the differences in the motivation between 25% and 50% at-risk individuals to be tested and (2) the consequences of \"double disclosure\", including parental reactions. Test requests from 25% at-risk individuals were rare (155/1611, 10%). We compared their motivation with those of 1456 50% at-risk individuals. The principal motivation to have the test for both groups was \"to know\" (48% versus 58%, p = 0.049), but the desire to have children was more frequent in the 25% at-risk group (32% versus 17%, p < 0.001). Sixty percent of the 25% at-risk group went through the testing procedure: 15% (n = 14) were variant positive for HD. Testees reported four adverse reactions of their parent (22%): one committed suicide and three became depressed. This result highlights the impact of \"double disclosure\", a bad result for the person themselves and the transmitting parent. It is the responsibility of the team to anticipate this outcome with the 25% at-risk individuals: children revealing the genetic status to their parent. They should help the testees and their family to find a satisfactory solution to help prevent adverse reactions. This includes ensuring that the candidate is well-infomed abour the testing options and consequences to her/himself but also to her/his parent. The at-risk parent should be offered to discuss the implications of their child's testing.",

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sleep pattern and the motor activity during sleep in a cohort of patients affected by Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Thirty HD patients, 16 women and 14 men (mean age 57.3 +- 12.2 y); 30 matched healthy controls (mean age 56.5 +- 11.8 y). INTERVENTIONS: Subjective sleep evaluation: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); Berlin's Questionnaire, interview for restless legs syndrome (RLS), questionnaire for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Clinical evaluation: disease duration, clinical severity (unified Huntington disease motor rating scale [UHDMRS]), genetic tests. Laboratory-based full-night attended video-polysomnography (V-PSG). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The duration of the disease was 9.4 +- 4.4 y, UHMDRS score was 55.5 +- 23.4, CAG repeats were 44.3 +- 4.1. Body mass index was 21.9 +- 4.0 kg/m(2). No patients or caregivers reported poor sleep quality. Two patients reported symptoms of RLS. Eight patients had an ESS score >= 9. Eight patients had high risk of obstructive sleep apnea. At the RBD questionnaire, two patients had a pathological score. HD patients, compared to controls, showed shorter sleep, reduced sleep efficiency index, and increased arousals and awakenings. Four patients presented with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Periodic limb movements (PLMs) during wake and sleep were observed in all patients. No episode of RBD was observed in the V-PSG recordings, and no patients showed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia. The disease duration correlated with ESS score (P < 0.02). UHMDRS correlated positively with the ESS score (P < 0.005), and negatively with the percentage of REM sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Huntington disease showed a severe sleep disruption and a high prevalence of periodic limb movements, but no evidence of sleep disordered breathing or REM sleep behavior disorder.",

Determination of mtDNA copy number in the cell is crucial to understand many cellular processes. Recently, the number of studies with the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content as the determinant of mitochondrial abnormalities increased greatly and is still growing, therefore, optimization of technical conditions for this analysis is crucial. Despite using similar laboratory protocols, some results cannot be compared between research centers, thus causing discrepancies in the assessment of mtDNA content. The aim of this work was to test which conditions of biological sample collection and storage affect estimation of mtDNA level relative to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) in the blood samples and dermal fibroblasts. We found that the time and temperature of sample storage, as well as the type of the blood sample (whole blood or leukocytes) influence the estimate of mtDNA/nDNA ratio in the blood. In the case of dermal fibroblasts collected from healthy control and Huntington disease patients, our data indicate that the passage number of cells is essential to obtain reliable results.",

OBJECTIVE: The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD. METHODS: We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT-HD, TRACK-HD, and IMAGE-HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease-affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers. RESULTS: We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (>0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of >80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers. INTERPRETATION: Our findings provide the first cross-study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: After MRI studies suggested the efficacy of ethyl-EPA in reducing the progressive brain atrophy in Huntington disease (HD), trials were conducted to test its efficacy as a treatment for HD. Trials that continued for 6 months did not find any significant improvement, urging discontinuation of the drug. However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of motor functions in these patients. METHODS: We searched 12 electronic databases to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening, only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score-4 in both fixed and quality effect models [MD = -2.720, 95% CI (-4.76, -.68), p = 0.009; MD = -2.225, 95% CI (-3.842, -0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score showed significant results [MD = -1.013, 95% CI (-1.793, -0.233), p = 0.011] in only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming test or symbol digit modality. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement of motor scores only after 12 months. These results should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies had assessed the efficacy of ethyl-EPA after 12 months with one of them having a 6-month open-label phase.",

BACKGROUND: Deutetrabenazine is approved in the USA, China, Australia, Israel, Brazil, and South Korea for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington disease. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study included patients who completed a double-blind study (Rollover) and patients who converted overnight from a stable tetrabenazine dose (Switch). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (adverse events per person-year) were calculated. Efficacy was analyzed using a stable post-titration timepoint (8 weeks). Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score and total maximal chorea score from baseline to week 8, as well as those from week 8 to week 145 (or the last visit on the study drug if that occurred earlier), were evaluated as both efficacy and safety endpoints during the study. RESULTS: Of 119 patients (Rollover, n = 82; Switch, n = 37), 100 (84%) completed >= 1 year of treatment. End-of-study exposure-adjusted incidence rates for adverse events in Rollover and Switch, respectively, were: any, 2.57 and 4.02; serious, 0.11 and 0.14; leading to dose suspension, 0.05 and 0.04. Common adverse events (>= 4% either cohort) included somnolence (Rollover, 20%; Switch, 30%), depression (32%; 22%), anxiety (27%; 35%), insomnia (23%; 16%), and akathisia (6%; 11%). Adverse events of interest included suicidality (9%; 5%) and parkinsonism (4%; 8%). Mean dose at week 8 was 38.1 mg (Rollover) and 36.5 mg (Switch). Mean dose across cohorts after titration was 37.6 mg; at the final visit, mean dose across cohorts was 45.7 mg. Patients showed minimal change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea scores with stable dosing from weeks 8-145 or at the end of treatment, but total motor score increased versus week 8 (mean change [standard deviation]: 8.2 [11.9]). There were no unexpected adverse events upon drug withdrawal, and mean (standard deviation) total maximal chorea scores increased 4.7 (4.6) units from week 8 to 1-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events observed with long-term deutetrabenazine exposure were consistent with previous studies. Reductions in chorea persisted over time. Upon treatment cessation, there was no unexpected worsening of chorea. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01897896.",

OBJECTIVE: To define the role played by microglia in different stages of Huntington disease (HD), we used the TSPO radioligand [11C]-ER176 and PET to evaluate microglial activation in relation to neurodegeneration and in relation to the clinical features seen at premanifest and manifest stages of the disease. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study in which 18 subjects (6 controls, 6 premanifest, and 6 manifest HD gene carriers) underwent a [11C]-ER176 PET scan and an MRI for anatomic localization. Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) was performed, and group differences in [11C]-ER176 binding (used to evaluate the extent of microglial activation) were assessed by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Microglial activation was correlated with ROIs volumes, disease burden, and the scores obtained in the clinical scales. As an exploratory aim, we evaluated the dynamic functions of microglia in vitro, by using induced microglia-like (iMG) cells from peripheral blood monocytes. RESULTS: Individuals with manifest HD present higher [11C]-ER176 SUVR in both globi pallidi and putamina in comparison with controls. No differences were observed when we compared premanifest HD with controls or with manifest HD. We also found a significant correlation between increased microglial activation and cumulative disease burden, and with reduced volumes. iMG from controls, premanifest HD, and manifest HD patients showed similar phagocytic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data demonstrate that microglial activation is involved in HD pathophysiology and is associated with disease progression.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of microRNA (miRNA) levels in CSF as biomarkers for prodromal Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: miRNA levels were measured in CSF from 60 PREDICT-HD study participants using the HTG protocol. Using a CAG-Age Product score, 30 prodromal HD participants were selected based on estimated probability of imminent clinical diagnosis of HD (i.e., low, medium, high; n = 10/group). For comparison, participants already diagnosed (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were also selected. RESULTS: A total of 2,081 miRNAs were detected and 6 were significantly increased in the prodromal HD gene expansion carriers vs controls at false discovery rate q < 0.05 (miR-520f-3p, miR-135b-3p, miR-4317, miR-3928-5p, miR-8082, miR-140-5p). Evaluating the miRNA levels in each of the HD risk categories, all 6 revealed a pattern of increasing abundance from control to low risk, and from low risk to medium risk, which then leveled off from the medium to high risk and HD diagnosed groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports miRNAs as CSF biomarkers of prodromal and diagnosed HD. Importantly, miRNAs were detected in the prodromal HD groups furthest from diagnosis where treatments are likely to be most consequential and meaningful. The identification of potential biomarkers in the disease prodrome may prove useful in evaluating treatments that may postpone disease onset. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00051324.",

Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress. There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of an outbreak of clinical disease phase.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the retinal and choriocapillaris vascular networks in macular region and the central choroidal thickness (CCT) in patients affected by Huntington disease (HD), using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain OCT (EDI SD-OCT). METHODS: We assessed the vessel density (VD) in superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC) using OCTA, while CCT was measured by EDI SD-OCT. RESULTS: Sixteen HD patients (32 eyes) and thirteen healthy controls (26 eyes) were enrolled in this prospective study. No significant difference in retinal and choriocapillaris VD was found between HD patients and controls while CCT turned to be thinner in patients respect to controls. There were no significant relationships between OCTA findings and neurological parameters. CONCLUSION: The changes in choroidal structure provide useful information regarding the possible neurovascular involvement in the physiopathology of HD. Choroidal vascular network could be a useful parameter to evaluate the vascular impairment that occurs in this neurodegenerative disease.",

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited late-onset neurological disorder characterized by progressive neuronal loss and disruption of cortical and basal ganglia circuits. Cell replacement using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron. We have also shown that transplants elicited a significant improvement in sensory-motor tasks up to 2 months post-transplant further supporting the therapeutic potential of this approach.",

BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarkers are increasingly used by neurologists, psychiatrists, and ophthalmologists for the diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of neurodegenerative diseases. Long-term data on OCT biomarkers of selected primary and secondary neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease, are already available in part. In addition, there are rare neurodegenerative diseases with early disease onset that may show OCT abnormalities. METHODS: A literature review on the association of OCT biomarkers with neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS beyond Alzheimer's disease is presented. Parkinson's disease, MS, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and lysosomal storage diseases are addressed. RESULTS: Relevant OCT biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness. Different sectors may be affected depending on the disease entity in addition to global pRFNL reduction. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) is also increasingly used as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography biomarkers are used in an interdisciplinary context. Retinal pathologies should be excluded by an ophthalmologist. While OCT biomarkers are increasingly used clinically in MS, the benefit in other neurodegenerative diseases, especially the rare ones, is less well documented. Further longitudinal studies are required.",

BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.",

The role of rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement. RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

Currently there is no secured ongoing funding in Australia for next generation sequencing (NGS) such as exome sequencing (ES) for adult neurological disorders. Studies have focused on paediatric populations in research or highly specialised settings, utilised standard NGS pipelines focusing only on small insertions, deletions and single nucleotide variants, and not explored impacts on management in detail. This prospective multi-site study performed ES and an extended bioinformatics repeat expansion analysis pipeline, on patients with broad phenotypes (ataxia, dementia, dystonia, spastic paraparesis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease and complex/not-otherwise-specified), with symptom onset between 2 and 60 years. Genomic data analysis was phenotype-driven, using virtual gene panels, reported according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. One-hundred-and-sixty patients (51% female) were included, median age 52 years (range 14-79) and median 9 years of symptoms. 34/160 (21%) patients received a genetic diagnosis. Highest diagnostic rates were in spastic paraparesis (10/25, 40%), complex/not-otherwise-specified (10/38, 26%) and ataxia (7/28, 25%) groups. Findings were considered 'possible/uncertain' in 21/160 patients. Repeat expansion detection identified an unexpected diagnosis of Huntington disease in an ataxic patient with negative ES. Impacts on management, such as more precise and tailored care, were seen in most diagnosed patients (23/34, 68%). ES and a novel bioinformatics analysis pipepline had a substantial diagnostic yield (21%) and management impacts for most diagnosed patients, in heterogeneous, complex, mainly adult-onset neurological disorders in real-world settings in Australia, providing evidence for NGS and complementary multiple, new technologies as valuable diagnostic tools.",

The ability to anticipate events and execute motor commands prior to a sensory event is an essential capability for human's everyday life. This implicitly learned anticipatory behavior depends on the past performance of repeated sensorimotor interactions timed with external cues. This kind of predictive behavior has been shown to be compromised in neurological disorders such as Huntington disease (HD), in which neural atrophy includes key cortical and basal ganglia regions. To investigate the neural basis of the anticipatory behavioral deficits in HD we used a predictive-saccade paradigm that requires predictive control to generate saccades in a metronomic temporal pattern. This is ideal because the integrity of the oculomotor network that includes the striatum and prefrontal, parietal, occipital and temporal cortices can be analyzed using structural MRI. Our results showed that the HD patients had severe predictive saccade deficits (i.e., an inability to reduce saccade reaction time in predictive condition), which are accentuated in patients with more severe motor deterioration. Structural imaging analyses revealed that these anticipatory deficits correlated with grey-matter atrophy in frontal, parietal-occipital and striatal regions. These findings indicate that the predictive saccade control deficits in HD are related to an extended cortico-striatal atrophy. This suggests that eye movement measurement could be a reliable marker of the progression of cognitive deficits in HD.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that affects not only the motor but also the cognitive and the neuropsychiatric domain. In particular, deficits in mental state recognition may emerge already at early pre-manifest stages of the disease. The aim of this research was to explore the relation between visual scanning behavior and complex mental state recognition in individuals with pre-manifest HD (preHD). Eighteen preHD and eighteen age- and gender-matched healthy controls took the revised \"Reading the Mind in the Eyes\" test while their eye-movements were tracked. In addition to the expected deficits in mental state recognition, preHD showed abnormalities concerning all three scanning variables we considered, namely the absolute number of fixations (FC), the average fixation duration (AFD), and the percentage of time spent fixating (FTR). In preHD, FC and FTR but not AFD predicted mental state recognition over and beyond general disease-related declines in cognition and motor functioning. Notably, preHD showed abnormal vertical and horizontal fixation patterns, and these patterns predicted mental state recognition, suggesting the involvement of mechanisms related to the embodied processing of emotional stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that impaired facial mental state recognition in pre-manifest HD is partly due to emotional-motivational factors affecting the visual scanning of facial expressions.",

Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene. Results from previous studies have suggested that transcriptional dysregulation is one of the key mechanisms underlying striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) degeneration in HD. However, some of the critical genes involved in HD etiology or pathology could be masked in a common expression profiling assay because of contamination with non-MSN cells. To gain insight into the MSN-specific gene expression changes in presymptomatic R6/2 mice, a common HD mouse model, here we used a transgenic fluorescent protein marker of MSNs for purification via FACS before profiling gene expression with gene microarrays and compared the results of this \"FACS-array\" with those obtained with homogenized striatal samples (STR-array). We identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enhanced detection of MSN-specific DEGs by comparing the results of the FACS-array with those of the STR-array. The gene sets obtained included genes ubiquitously expressed in both MSNs and non-MSN cells of the brain and associated with transcriptional regulation and DNA damage responses. We proposed that the comparative gene expression approach using the FACS-array may be useful for uncovering the gene cascades affected in MSNs during HD pathogenesis.",

                    "text": "A Classification System to Guide Physical Therapy Management in Huntington Disease: A Case Series. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dysphagia is one of the most common and important complications in Huntington disease (HD), frequently leading to aspiration pneumonia and mortality. Objective estimates of prevalence using instrumental diagnostics and data on neural correlates of dysphagia in HD are scarce or lacking entirely. Similarly, its correlation with other clinical markers is still not fully known. We aimed at defining clinical risk factors and neural correlates for compromised swallowing safety in HD more precisely. METHODS: Thirty-four HD subjects (16 female, Shoulson & Fahn Stage I-IV, two premanifest) underwent a full clinical-neurological examination including the cranial nerves, the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was performed by a trained speech and language therapist. Twenty-six subjects additionally underwent a high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (T1, 3-T Siemens Prisma). Moreover, we correlated clinical and atrophy (MRI) measures with swallowing safety levels as judged by the validated Penetration-Aspiration Scale. RESULTS: FEES showed penetration or aspiration in 70.6%. Using partial correlation, no significant correlations were found between swallowing safety and any of the clinical markers after correcting for disease duration and CAG repeat length. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated atrophy associated with compromised swallowing safety in a network of parietothalamocerebellar areas related to sensorimotor communication, notably excluding striatum. CONCLUSIONS: Our results characterise dysphagia in HD as a disorder of communication between sensory and motor networks involved in swallowing. This finding and high rates of silent aspiration argue in favor of instrumental swallowing evaluation early in the disease.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic, fully penetrant neurodegenerative disorder. Widespread white matter damage affects the brain of patients with HD at very early stages of the disease. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) is a novel method to investigate the contribution of individual crossing fibers to the white matter damage and to detect possible alterations in both fiber density and fiber-bundle morphology. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS), on the other hand, quantifies the motion of brain metabolites in vivo, thus enabling the investigation of microstructural alteration of specific cell populations. The aim of this study was to identify novel specific microstructural imaging markers of white matter degeneration in HD, by combining FBA and DW-MRS. Twenty patients at an early stage of HD and 20 healthy controls were recruited in a monocentric study. Using diffusion imaging we observed alterations to the brain microstructure and their morphology in patients with HD. Furthermore, FBA revealed specific fiber populations that were affected by the disease. Moreover, the mean diffusivity of the intra-axonal metabolite N-acetylaspartate, co-measured with N-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA), was significantly reduced in the corpus callosum of patients compared to controls. FBA and DW-MRS of tNAA provided more specific information about the biological mechanisms underlying HD and showed promise for early investigation of white matter degeneration in HD.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a late-onset genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide in the exon 1 of the gene encoding the polyglutamine (polyQ). It has been shown that protein degradation and lipid metabolism is altered in HD. In many neurodegenerative disorders, impaired lipid homeostasis is one of the early events in the disease onset. Yet, little is known about how mutant huntingtin may affect phospholipids membrane fluidity. Here, we investigated how membrane fluidity in the living cells (differentiated PC12 and HEK293 cell lines) are affected using a hyperspectral imaging of widely used probes, LAURDAN. Using phasor approach, we characterized the fluorescence of LAURDAN that is sensitive to the polarity of the immediate environment. LAURDAN is affected by the physical order of phospholipids (lipid order) and reports the membrane fluidity. We also validated our results using a different fluorescent membrane probe, Nile Red (NR). The plasma membrane in the cells expressing expanded polyQ shows a shift toward increased membrane fluidity revealed by both LAURDAN and NR spectral phasors. This finding brings a new perspective in the understanding of the early stages of HD that can be used as a target for drug screening.",

                    "text": "The phasor-FLIM fingerprints reveal shifts from OXPHOS to enhanced glycolysis in Huntington Disease. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of Polyglutamine (polyQ) in exon 1 of the Huntingtin protein. Glutamine repeats below 36 are considered normal while repeats above 40 lead to HD. Impairment in energy metabolism is a common trend in Huntington pathogenesis; however, this effect is not fully understood. Here, we used the phasor approach and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to measure changes between free and bound fractions of NADH as a indirect measure of metabolic alteration in living cells. Using Phasor-FLIM, pixel maps of metabolic alteration in HEK293 cell lines and in transgenic Drosophila expressing expanded and unexpanded polyQ HTT exon1 in the eye disc were developed. We found a significant shift towards increased free NADH, indicating an increased glycolytic state for cells and tissues expressing the expanded polyQ compared to unexpanded control. In the nucleus, a further lifetime shift occurs towards higher free NADH suggesting a possible synergism between metabolic dysfunction and transcriptional regulation. Our results indicate that metabolic dysfunction in HD shifts to increased glycolysis leading to oxidative stress and cell death. This powerful label free method can be used to screen native HD tissue samples and for potential drug screening.",

Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.",

Disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is a common feature for different neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Although the interplay between perturbed BBB homeostasis and the pathogenesis of brain disorders needs further investigation, the development and validation of a reliable procedure to accurately detect BBB alterations may be crucial and represent a useful tool for potentially predicting disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we present an easy and efficient procedure for evaluating BBB leakage in a neurodegenerative condition like that occurring in a preclinical mouse model of Huntington disease, in which defects in the permeability of BBB are clearly detectable precociously in the disease. Specifically, the high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled (FITC)-albumin, which is able to cross the BBB only when the latter is impaired, is acutely infused into a mouse jugular vein and its distribution in the vascular or parenchymal districts is then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of green fluorescent-albumin in the brain parenchyma functions as an index of aberrant BBB permeability and, when quantitated by using Image J processing software, is reported as Green Fluorescence Intensity.",

BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarkers are increasingly used by neurologists, psychiatrists, and ophthalmologists for the diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of neurodegenerative diseases. Long-term data on OCT biomarkers of selected primary and secondary neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease, are already available in part. In addition, there are rare neurodegenerative diseases with early disease onset that may show OCT abnormalities. METHODS: A literature review on the association of OCT biomarkers with neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS beyond Alzheimer's disease is presented. Parkinson's disease, MS, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and lysosomal storage diseases are addressed. RESULTS: Relevant OCT biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness. Different sectors may be affected depending on the disease entity in addition to global pRFNL reduction. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) is also increasingly used as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography biomarkers are used in an interdisciplinary context. Retinal pathologies should be excluded by an ophthalmologist. While OCT biomarkers are increasingly used clinically in MS, the benefit in other neurodegenerative diseases, especially the rare ones, is less well documented.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive and fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the huntingtin gene (HTT). In spite of considerable efforts, there is currently no treatment to stop or delay the disease. Although HTT is expressed ubiquitously, most of our knowledge has been obtained on neurons. More recently, the impact of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) on other cell types, including glial cells, has received growing interest. It is currently unclear whether new pathological pathways could be identified in these cells compared to neurons. To address this question, we performed an in vivo screen for modifiers of mutant huntingtin (HTT-548-128Q) induced pathology in Drosophila adult glial cells and identified several putative therapeutic targets. Among them, we discovered that partial nej/dCBP depletion in these cells was protective, as revealed by strongly increased lifespan and restored locomotor activity. Thus, dCBP promotes the HD pathology in glial cells, in contrast to previous opposite findings in neurons. Further investigations implicated the transcriptional activator Foxo as a critical downstream player in this glial protective pathway. Our data suggest that combinatorial approaches combined to specific tissue targeting may be required to uncover efficient therapies in HD.",

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the percent volume of dilated perivascular space (PVS) in the subcortical forebrain in patients with early Huntington disease (HD) and to explore the relationship between PVS and disease severity. METHODS: MRI scans were performed on 25 patients with HD and 23 healthy age-matched controls at Massachusetts General Hospital. The imaging data were analyzed with a novel algorithm to determine regional PVS volume. A fractional logistic regression analysis was used to quantify the association between regional percent PVS volume and (1) disease designation (HD or control) and (2) disease severity as assessed by normalized caudate volume. RESULTS: Patients with HD had the greatest percent volume of dilated PVS in the putamen (left putamen: odds ratio 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-2.62], HD 3.27% [95% CI 2.83-3.78] vs controls 1.62% [95% CI 1.32-1.97], p fdr < 0.001; right putamen: odds ratio 1.66 [95% CI 1.33-2.08], HD 3.43% [95% CI 2.94-4.01] vs controls 2.09% [95% CI 1.79-2.45], p fdr < 0.001) and several subcortical white matter regions compared to controls. Dilated PVS increased with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The objective quantification of dilated PVS suggests that PVS burden is high, is associated with disease severity, and may affect the distribution and success of treatments administered either intrathecally such as antisense oligonucleotides or by intraparenchymal administration such as cell and gene therapies. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that increased dilated PVS is associated with worse HD severity. The study is rated Class II because of the cross-sectional design.",

OBJECTIVE: To isolate the neuroprotective component from Convolvulus pluricaulis Chois. (Convolvulaceae) which can be used as a lead molecule in the treatment of Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: The methanolic extract of whole plant was fractionated into four fractions; chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and aqueous fraction. The chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions were pooled on the basis of antioxidant activity and TLC profile and charged into silica gel column. Four subfractions were collected from column (FrA, FrB, FrC, and FrD) and further assessed for antioxidant potential by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl in vitro assay. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) was administered to Wister rats for induction of HD. Different fractions were administered for 14 days. Different behavioral alterations were assessed in between study period. Animals were euthanized immediately following the last behavioral session, and biochemical parameters were measured. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Systemic administration of 3-NP showed marked motor deficits and oxidative damage in rats. Only FrB showed significant antioxidant activity and on further purification gave pure compound (scopoletin). Our study showed that FrB (20 mg/kg) pre-treatment significantly attenuated the loss in body weight, improved the locomotor activity, grip strength, and gait abnormalities. It also has attenuated the increased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, and restored superoxide dismutase and reduced GSH enzyme activity in the striatum and cortex in 3-NP-treated groups. These results suggest that C. pluricaulis Chois. exhibits a neuroprotective effect by accelerating brain antioxidant defense mechanisms in 3-NP-treated rats.",

BACKGROUND: Clinician-rated measures of functioning are often used as primary endpoints in clinical trials and other behavioral research in Huntington disease. As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible, there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM: The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures, differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related assessments are not feasible.",

Huntington Disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease which leads to involuntary movements and impaired balance. These changes have been quantified using footstep pressure sensor mats such as Protokinetics' Zeno Walkway. Drawing from distances between recorded footsteps, patients' disease severity have been measured in terms of high level gait characteristics such as gait width and stride length. However, little attention has been paid to the pressure data collected during formation of individual footsteps. This work investigates the potential of classifying patient disease severity based on individual footstep pressure data using deep learning techniques. Using the Motor Subscale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) as the gold standard, our experiments showed that using VGG16 and similar modules can achieve classification accuracy of 89%. Image pre-processing are key steps for better model performance. This classification accuracy is compared to results based on 3D CNN (82%) and SVM (86.9%).",

Neurodegenerative diseases that affect serious gait abnormalities include Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington disease (HD). These diseases lead to gait rhythm distortion that can be determined by stride time interval of footfall contact times. In this paper, we present a new method for gait classification of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we utilize a symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm to convert left-foot stride-stride interval into a sequence of symbols using a symbolic aggregate approximation. We then find string prototypes of each class using the newly proposed string grammar unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy C-medians. Then in the testing process the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor is used. We implement the system on three 2-class problems, i.e., the classification of ALS against healthy patients, that of HD against healthy patients , and that of PD against healthy patients. The system is also implemented on one 4-class problem (the classification of ALS, HD, PD, and healthy patients altogether) called NDDs versus healthy. We found that our system yields a very good detection result. The average correct classification for ALS versus healthy is 96.88%, and that for HD versus healthy is 97.22%, whereas that for PD versus healthy is 96.43%. When the system is implemented on 4-class problem, the average accuracy is approximately 98.44%. It can provide prototypes of gait signals that are more understandable to human.",

BACKGROUND: Deficits in posture and gait are known to contribute to the complex motor phenotype of Huntington disease (HD). Objective and quantitative measures of posture and gait provided by posturography and GAITRite  assessments may supplement categorical rating scales such as the UHDRS-TMS and increase power and sensitivity of clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether posturography and GAITRite  measures reveal (1) changes in manifest or premanifest HD mutation-carriers, (2) a correlation to the UHDRS-TMS and functional measures in manifest HD, and (3) a correlation to the disease-burden-score (based on CAG-repeat-length and age). METHODS: Posturography and GAITRite  were applied in premanifest (n = 26) and manifest HD gene-mutation-carriers (n = 40) in different paradigms compared to age-matched controls (n = 30) in a cross-sectional multi-site study conducted in three centers. Subjects were assessed clinically with the UHDRS Total-Motor-Score, Total-Functional-Capacity and Functional-Assessment-Scale. RESULTS: Several posturography measures were able to discriminate between controls, premanifest, and manifest mutation-carriers in both conditions assessed. Only one GAITRite  measure separated controls and premanifest participants, while discrimination between controls and manifest same as between premanifest and manifest participants was possible in several measures. Correlation with all clinical measures was seen in only one measure per device while correlations to the disease-burden-score seen in posturography only. CONCLUSION: Overall the results suggests that posturography detects alterations in premanifest and manifest mutation-carriers more reliably than GAITRite  measures. Correlations with clinical assessment scores are limited; correlation with disease-burden-score is seen in posturography only. Data acquisition and analysis was easier with posturography than GAITRite  assessments in out-patient settings.",

BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication. We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease. RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1 out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100). They were less in favour of gamete donation (48.3+-39.8 out of 100) or pregnancy abstention (43.3+-40.3 out of 100). The greater the perceived severity of the disease, the more reproductive options were considered justified, except for gamete donation. Prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis was a motivation to inform relatives for only 55.3% of participants (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Self-estimated severity minimally impacts opinions towards reproductive options. Medically assisted reproduction procedures are rarely sought and do not motivate familial communication.",

The emergence of gene editing technologies offers a unique opportunity to develop mutation-specific treatments for pediatric neurological disorders. Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant rejection is considered as a vital factor of kidney transplant failure. Therefore, it's necessary to search for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study, we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network analysis.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant rejection is considered as a vital factor of kidney transplant failure. Therefore, it's necessary to search for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study, we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We reported several potential genes may be associated with the kidney transplant rejection, which should provide novel biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene. Results from previous studies have suggested that transcriptional dysregulation is one of the key mechanisms underlying striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) degeneration in HD. However, some of the critical genes involved in HD etiology or pathology could be masked in a common expression profiling assay because of contamination with non-MSN cells. To gain insight into the MSN-specific gene expression changes in presymptomatic R6/2 mice, a common HD mouse model, here we used a transgenic fluorescent protein marker of MSNs for purification via FACS before profiling gene expression with gene microarrays and compared the results of this \"FACS-array\" with those obtained with homogenized striatal samples (STR-array). We identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enhanced detection of MSN-specific DEGs by comparing the results of the FACS-array with those of the STR-array. The gene sets obtained included genes ubiquitously expressed in both MSNs and non-MSN cells of the brain and associated with transcriptional regulation and DNA damage responses. We proposed that the comparative gene expression approach using the FACS-array may be useful for uncovering the gene cascades affected in MSNs during HD pathogenesis.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a gain-of-function mutation in HTT. Suppression of mutant HTT has emerged as a leading therapeutic strategy for HD, with allele-selective approaches targeting HTT SNPs now in clinical trials. Haplotypes associated with the HD mutation (A1, A2, A3a) represent panels of allele-specific gene silencing targets for efficient treatment of individuals with HD of Northern European and indigenous South American ancestry. Here we extend comprehensive haplotype analysis of the HD mutation to key populations of Southern European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and admixed African ancestry. In each of these populations, the HD mutation occurs predominantly on the A2 HTT haplotype. Analysis of HD haplotypes across all affected population groups enables rational selection of candidate target SNPs for development of allele-selective gene silencing therapeutics worldwide. Targeting SNPs on the A1 and A2 haplotypes in parallel is essential to achieve treatment of the most HD-affected subjects in populations where HD is most prevalent. Current allele-specific approaches will leave a majority of individuals with HD untreated in populations where the HD mutation occurs most frequently on the A2 haplotype. We further demonstrate preclinical development of potent and selective ASOs targeting SNPs on the A2 HTT haplotype, representing an allele-specific treatment strategy for these individuals. On the basis of comprehensive haplotype analysis, we show the maximum proportion of HD-affected subjects that may be treated with three or four allele targets in different populations worldwide, informing current allele-specific HTT silencing strategies.",

HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines.

Neurological disorders are one of the major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

Recent studies have reported visual dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD). However, little is known about retinal structural changes in HD. METHODS: A total of 50 subjects, including 25 motor-manifest HD patients and 25 gender- and age-matched controls, were enrolled. Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Score-Motor part was assessed in HD patients. Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was used to evaluate the macular thickness and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). Superficial and deep capillary plexus densities were measured using OCT angiography (OCTA). To account for inter-eye correlation, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used. RESULTS: HD patients had a significant reduction in macular thickness in both inner and outer superior sectors and the inferior outer sector. Inferior pRNFLs were significantly decreased in thickness. There was no significant difference in retinal capillary plexus density between the two groups. Age and disease duration were negatively correlated with macular thickness in HD patients. However, the severity of motor involvement was not correlated with SD-OCT or OCTA parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We observed attenuated pRNFL and macular retinal thickness in patients with HD, independent of macular capillary plexus parameters. It can support the hypothesis that the retina may be a potential biomarker for monitoring the neurodegenerative process in HD.",

                    "text": "Association Between Change in Body Mass Index, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Scores, and Survival Among Persons With Parkinson Disease: Secondary Analysis of Longitudinal Data From NINDS Exploratory Trials in Parkinson Disease Long-term Study 1. IMPORTANCE: Greater body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is associated with improved survival among persons with Huntington disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Weight loss is common among persons with Parkinson disease (PD) and is associated with worse quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between change in BMI, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and total scores, and survival among persons with PD and to test whether there is a positive association between BMI at randomization and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analysis (from May 27, 2014, to October 13, 2015) of longitudinal data (3-6 years) from 1673 participants who started the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Exploratory Trials in PD Long-term Study-1 (NET-PD LS-1). This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of creatine monohydrate (10 g/d) that was performed at 45 sites throughout the United States and Canada. Participants with early (within 5 years of diagnosis) and treated (receiving dopaminergic therapy) PD were enrolled from March 2007 to May 2010 and followed up until September 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change across time in motor UPDRS score, change across time in total UPDRS score, and time to death. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of BMI on the change in motor and total UPDRS scores after controlling for covariates. Survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models of time to death. A participant's BMI was measured at randomization, and BMI trajectory groups were classified according to whether participants experienced weight loss (\"decreasing BMI\"), weight stability (\"stable BMI\"), or weight gain (\"increasing BMI\") during the study. RESULTS: Of the 1673 participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [9.6] years; 1074 [64.2%] were male), 158 (9.4%) experienced weight loss (decreasing BMI), whereas 233 (13.9%) experienced weight gain (increasing BMI). After adjusting for covariates, we found that the weight-loss group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score increased by 1.48 (0.28) (P < .001) more points per visit than the weight-stable group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score. The weight-gain group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score decreased by -0.51 (0.24) (P = .03) points per visit, relative to the weight-stable group. While there was an unadjusted difference in survival between the 3 BMI trajectory groups (log-rank P < .001), this was not significant after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Change in BMI was inversely associated with change in motor and total UPDRS scores in the NET-PD LS-1. Change in BMI was not associated with survival; however, these results were limited by the low number of deaths in the NET-PD LS-1. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00449865.",

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were first generated in 2007, but the full translational potential of this valuable tool has yet to be realized. The potential applications of hiPSCs are especially relevant to neurology, as brain cells from patients are rarely available for research. hiPSCs from individuals with neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases have facilitated biological and multi-omics studies as well as large-scale screening of chemical libraries. However, researchers are struggling to improve the scalability, reproducibility and quality of this descriptive disease modelling. Addressing these limitations will be the first step towards a new era in hiPSC research - that of predictive disease modelling - involving the correlation and integration of in vitro experimental data with longitudinal clinical data. This approach is a key element of the emerging precision medicine paradigm, in which hiPSCs could become a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool. Here, we consider the steps necessary to achieve predictive modelling of neurodegenerative disease with hiPSCs, using Huntington disease as an example.",

In the prodromal phase of neurodegenerative diseases, microglia switch to an activated state resulting in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. We reported that C - C chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), C - C chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) and C - C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) contained in the secretome of activated microglia inhibit neuronal autophagy via a non-cell autonomous mechanism. These chemokines bind and activate neuronal C - C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), which, in turn, promotes phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT) - mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway activation, which inhibits autophagy, thus causing the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins in the cytoplasm of neurons. The levels of CCR5 and its chemokine ligands are increased in the brains of pre-manifesting Huntington disease (HD) and tauopathy mouse models. CCR5 accumulation might be due to a self-amplifying mechanism, since CCR5 is a substrate of autophagy and CCL5-CCR5-mediated autophagy inhibition impairs CCR5 degradation. Furthermore, pharmacological, or genetic inhibition of CCR5 rescues mTORC1-autophagy dysfunction and improves neurodegeneration in HD and tauopathy mouse models, suggesting that CCR5 hyperactivation is a pathogenic signal driving the progression of these diseases.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the approach to chorea in clinical practice, beginning with a discussion of the phenomenologic features of chorea and how to differentiate it from other movement disorders. The diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas, and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats are included. RECENT FINDINGS: C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including NKX2-1, ADCY5, GNAO1, and PDE10A. New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing. SUMMARY: Clinical features remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.",

In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology characterized by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism (MSA-P) and cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). The phenotypic spectrum may present overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders. To investigate the possible contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype, we analyzed the triplet repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients. As comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the basis of CAG repeat length as \"normal\", \"intermediate\" or \"expanded\" according to literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 years and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had significantly younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P (p < 0.0001). We identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 CAG), a SCA2 intermediate allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36 CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA alleles were detected in controls. The distribution of CAG repeat length was similar among groups except for SCA1 gene that showed a higher percentage of longer normal alleles in MSA-C as compared to MSA-P and controls (p < 0.0001). This study supports the utility of polyQ genetic testing in the differential diagnosis of MSA, and may suggest a possible role of SCA1 repeat length as risk factor for MSA-C. SCA1 and SCA2 genetic screening is recommended in MSA Italian patients.",

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology characterized by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism (MSA-P) and cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). The phenotypic spectrum may present overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders. To investigate the possible contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype, we analyzed the triplet repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients. As comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the basis of CAG repeat length as \"normal\", \"intermediate\" or \"expanded\" according to literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 years and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had significantly younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P (p < 0.0001). We identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 CAG), a SCA2 intermediate allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36 CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA alleles were detected in controls. The distribution of CAG repeat length was similar among groups except for SCA1 gene that showed a higher percentage of longer normal alleles in MSA-C as compared to MSA-P and controls (p < 0.0001). This study supports the utility of polyQ genetic testing in the differential diagnosis of MSA, and may suggest a possible role of SCA1 repeat length as risk factor for MSA-C.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD phenocopies.",

Rates of genetic testing in Huntington disease (HD) are lower than was predicted before direct DNA testing became available. Clinicians often do not have in-depth conversations with people at risk who chose not to test. We queried 733 research subjects who chose not to learn their HD gene status when enrolling in the Prospective Huntington At-Risk Observational Study, carried out between 1999 and 2008. Lack of an effective cure or treatment (66% of subjects) and inability to undo knowledge (66%) were the major reasons cited for choosing not to undergo HD DNA testing. Most subjects were not concerned about the length or burden of the testing process (61% and 59%, respectively). Subjects were optimistic that a treatment to improve symptoms or postpone onset would be developed within the next 10 years (56% and 53%, respectively), but they had less certainty about the prospects to prevent HD onset (36%). This is the first large, systematic study of why people at risk for HD choose not to undergo genetic testing. Attitudes about how people at risk for HD approach this life-altering choice should be reassessed as new treatments develop, and as clinical trials now require genetic testing at entry.",

Participants were mainly at-risk for Huntington disease (n = 113), affected (n = 85), and spouses (n = 154). In 2019, participants had a higher mean education level (p < 0.01) and a mean age of 44.1 +- 15.1 years (vs 48.1 +- 11.4 years in 2000, p < 0.01). They had been informed about the risk of being a carrier at around 30 years of age (29.0 +- 14.2 in 2019 vs 32.2 +- 13.8 in 2000, p = 0.09). However, they would inform at an earlier age (<=18 years, 67% vs 59%, p = 0.16). Information on transmission risk had been given primarily by parents (45% vs 30%, p = 0.06). In addition, genetic testing for relatives unaware of their status was recommended more frequently in 2019 (46% vs 32%, p < 0.001). Respondents in 2019 recommended genetic testing more often but overall attitudes towards information and testing have not changed significantly over the 19-year time period since the questionnaire was first delivered even despite recent clinical trials potential disease modifying therapies.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene coding for the huntingtin protein (HTT). Mutant HTT (mHTT) has been proposed to cause neuronal dysfunction and neuronal loss through multiple mechanisms. Transcriptional changes may be a core pathogenic feature of HD. Utilizing the Affymetrix platform we performed a genome-wide RNA expression analysis in two BACHD transgenic rat lines (TG5 and TG9) at 12 months of age, both of which carry full-length human mHTT but with different expression levels. By defining the threshold of significance at p < 0.01, we found 1608 genes and 871 genes differentially expressed in both TG5 and TG9 rats when compared to the wild type littermates, respectively. We only chose the highly up-/down-regulated genes for further analysis by setting an additional threshold of 1.5 fold change. Comparing gene expression profiles of human HD brains and BACHD rats revealed a high concordance in both functional and IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) canonical pathways relevant to HD. In addition, we investigated the causes leading to gene expression changes at molecular and protein levels in BACHD rats including the involvement of polyQ-containing transcription factors TATA box-binding protein (TBP), Sp1 and CBP as well as the chromatin structure. We demonstrate that the BACHD rat model recapitulates the gene expression changes of the human disease supporting its role as a preclinical research animal model. We also show for the first time that TFIID complex formation is reduced, while soluble TBP is increased in an HD model. This finding suggests that mHTT is a competitor instead of a recruiter of polyQ-containing transcription factors in the transcription process in HD.",

Currently there is no secured ongoing funding in Australia for next generation sequencing (NGS) such as exome sequencing (ES) for adult neurological disorders. Studies have focused on paediatric populations in research or highly specialised settings, utilised standard NGS pipelines focusing only on small insertions, deletions and single nucleotide variants, and not explored impacts on management in detail. This prospective multi-site study performed ES and an extended bioinformatics repeat expansion analysis pipeline, on patients with broad phenotypes (ataxia, dementia, dystonia, spastic paraparesis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease and complex/not-otherwise-specified), with symptom onset between 2 and 60 years. Genomic data analysis was phenotype-driven, using virtual gene panels, reported according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. One-hundred-and-sixty patients (51% female) were included, median age 52 years (range 14-79) and median 9 years of symptoms. 34/160 (21%) patients received a genetic diagnosis. Highest diagnostic rates were in spastic paraparesis (10/25, 40%), complex/not-otherwise-specified (10/38, 26%) and ataxia (7/28, 25%) groups. Findings were considered 'possible/uncertain' in 21/160 patients. Repeat expansion detection identified an unexpected diagnosis of Huntington disease in an ataxic patient with negative ES. Impacts on management, such as more precise and tailored care, were seen in most diagnosed patients (23/34, 68%). ES and a novel bioinformatics analysis pipepline had a substantial diagnostic yield (21%) and management impacts for most diagnosed patients, in heterogeneous, complex, mainly adult-onset neurological disorders in real-world settings in Australia, providing evidence for NGS and complementary multiple, new technologies as valuable diagnostic tools.",

BACKGROUND: European studies identified the C9orf72 repeat expansion as the most frequent genetic alteration in patients with Huntington disease (HD)-like phenotypes but negative HD genetic testing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate C9orf72 repeat expansion frequency in individuals tested for HD in a North American tertiary referral laboratory. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three cases (115 positive and 258 negative for HD) were evaluated by genotyping PCR, with follow-up Southern blot and 5' repeat methylation status assessment by combined repeat-primed and methylation-specific PCR in a subset. RESULTS: Three cases (all HD-negative) tested positive: 2 had > 2,000 repeats and were methylated, 1 had 80-100 repeats and was unmethylated. Two cases (1 HD-positive and 1 HD-negative) had intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) and were unmethylated. The remaining 368 cases were negative (< 20 repeats). C9orf72 repeat expansion was absent in patients with HD and was identified in a small subset (1.2%) of patients with negative HD genetic testing. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C9orf72 repeat expansion does not coexist with HTT repeat expansion and that C9orf72 repeat expansion testing is unnecessary for patients with HD. In addition, C9orf72 evaluation may be considered for individuals negative for HD genetic testing. Similar to in previous studies, methylation of C9orf72 repeat expansion was limited to large expansions.",

OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) is an important diagnostic tool in Huntington disease (HD), a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. To clarify the nature of diffusivity changes in HD, we compared the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCW ) acquired by DW-MR with extracellular space volume fraction alpha and tortuosity lambda, measured by the iontophoretic method in the R6/2 mouse model of HD and in wild-type controls (WT). In anisotropic globus pallidus (GP), diffusion measurements were performed in the mediolateral (x), rostrocaudal (y), and ventrodorsal (z) axes. In HD animals, we detected an increase in ADCW in all axes and larger alpha than in WT mice. No significant difference between WT and HD mice was found in the values of tortuosity (lambdax , lambday , lambdaz ). Despite structural changes in GP, diffusion anisotropy was unaffected in HD mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed in HD mice weaker expression of extracellular matrix and a decrease in neuron numbers compared with WT mice. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining detected astrogliosis-like changes in the morphology of astrocytic processes in HD GP. In the somatosensory cortex, no significant differences in the studied parameters were found. We conclude that in the R6/2 model of HD, a decrease in the number of neurons in the GP results in increased ADCW and alpha values. Values of lambda were not significantly changed as the increase of diffusion obstacles formed by reactive astrocytes was compensated for by the extracellular matrix reduction.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron.

Cognitive, motor and psychiatric changes in prodromal Huntington's disease have nurtured the emergent need for early interventions. Preventive clinical trials for Huntington's disease, however, are limited by a shortage of suitable measures that could serve as surrogate outcomes. Measures of intrinsic functional connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging are of keen interest. Yet recent studies suggest circumscribed abnormalities in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity in prodromal Huntington's disease, despite the spectrum of behavioural changes preceding a manifest diagnosis. The present study used two complementary analytical approaches to examine whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity in prodromal Huntington's disease. Network topology was studied using graph theory and simple functional connectivity amongst brain regions was explored using the network-based statistic. Participants consisted of gene-negative controls (n = 16) and prodromal Huntington's disease individuals (n = 48) with various stages of disease progression to examine the influence of disease burden on intrinsic connectivity. Graph theory analyses showed that global network interconnectivity approximated a random network topology as proximity to diagnosis neared and this was associated with decreased connectivity amongst highly-connected rich-club network hubs, which integrate processing from diverse brain regions. However, functional segregation within the global network (average clustering) was preserved. Functional segregation was also largely maintained at the local level, except for the notable decrease in the diversity of anterior insula intermodular-interconnections (participation coefficient), irrespective of disease burden. In contrast, network-based statistic analyses revealed patterns of weakened frontostriatal connections and strengthened frontal-posterior connections that evolved as disease burden increased. These disturbances were often related to long-range connections involving peripheral nodes and interhemispheric connections. A strong association was found between weaker connectivity and decreased rich-club organization, indicating that whole-brain simple connectivity partially expressed disturbances in the communication of highly-connected hubs. However, network topology and network-based statistic connectivity metrics did not correlate with key markers of executive dysfunction (Stroop Test, Trail Making Test) in prodromal Huntington's disease, which instead were related to whole-brain connectivity disturbances in nodes (right inferior parietal, right thalamus, left anterior cingulate) that exhibited multiple aberrant connections and that mediate executive control. Altogether, our results show for the first time a largely disease burden-dependent functional reorganization of whole-brain networks in prodromal Huntington's disease. Both analytic approaches provided a unique window into brain reorganization that was not related to brain atrophy or motor symptoms. Longitudinal studies currently in progress will chart the course of functional changes to determine the most sensitive markers of disease progression. ",

These disturbances were often related to long-range connections involving peripheral nodes and interhemispheric connections. A strong association was found between weaker connectivity and decreased rich-club organization, indicating that whole-brain simple connectivity partially expressed disturbances in the communication of highly-connected hubs. However, network topology and network-based statistic connectivity metrics did not correlate with key markers of executive dysfunction (Stroop Test, Trail Making Test) in prodromal Huntington's disease, which instead were related to whole-brain connectivity disturbances in nodes (right inferior parietal, right thalamus, left anterior cingulate) that exhibited multiple aberrant connections and that mediate executive control. Altogether, our results show for the first time a largely disease burden-dependent functional reorganization of whole-brain networks in prodromal Huntington's disease. Both analytic approaches provided a unique window into brain reorganization that was not related to brain atrophy or motor symptoms. Longitudinal studies currently in progress will chart the course of functional changes to determine the most sensitive markers of disease progression. ",

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to follow tonic and phasic autonomic nervous activity in Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers and patients. METHODS: Evaluation of motor functions and total functional capacity was performed in 30 HD mutation carriers or patients at the beginning and in 22 subjects after 8-10 years. Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress. There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of an outbreak of clinical disease phase.",

                    "text": "Clinical predictors and neural correlates for compromised swallowing safety in Huntington disease. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dysphagia is one of the most common and important complications in Huntington disease (HD), frequently leading to aspiration pneumonia and mortality. Objective estimates of prevalence using instrumental diagnostics and data on neural correlates of dysphagia in HD are scarce or lacking entirely. Similarly, its correlation with other clinical markers is still not fully known. We aimed at defining clinical risk factors and neural correlates for compromised swallowing safety in HD more precisely. METHODS: Thirty-four HD subjects (16 female, Shoulson & Fahn Stage I-IV, two premanifest) underwent a full clinical-neurological examination including the cranial nerves, the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was performed by a trained speech and language therapist. Twenty-six subjects additionally underwent a high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (T1, 3-T Siemens Prisma). Moreover, we correlated clinical and atrophy (MRI) measures with swallowing safety levels as judged by the validated Penetration-Aspiration Scale. RESULTS: FEES showed penetration or aspiration in 70.6%. Using partial correlation, no significant correlations were found between swallowing safety and any of the clinical markers after correcting for disease duration and CAG repeat length. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated atrophy associated with compromised swallowing safety in a network of parietothalamocerebellar areas related to sensorimotor communication, notably excluding striatum. CONCLUSIONS: Our results characterise dysphagia in HD as a disorder of communication between sensory and motor networks involved in swallowing. This finding and high rates of silent aspiration argue in favor of instrumental swallowing evaluation early in the disease.",

Exercise in different settings has become a fundamental part of Huntington's disease (HD) management. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of home-based exercises (HBE) in HD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of HBE on motor, cognitive, or health-related quality of life (QoL) outcomes in HD were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD), the 95% confidence interval, and p-values were calculated by comparing the outcomes change between HBE and control groups. Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The included RCTs prescribed different types of HBEs, i.e., aerobic strengthening, walking, balance, and fine motor exercises. The HBE protocol length was between 6 and 36 weeks. The meta-analyses showed a significant effect of HBE intervention on motor function measure by Unified Huntington Disease Rating and overall QoL measure by Short Form-36 post-treatment respectively, [SMD = 0.481, p = 0.048], [SMD = 0.378, p = 0.003]. The pooled analysis did not detect significant changes in cognition, gait characteristics, or functional balance scales. The current study shows the positive effect of HBE in HD, especially on motor function and QoL. No significant adverse events were reported. The current results support the clinical effect of HBE intervention on motor function and QoL in HD patients. However, these results should be taken with caution due to the limited available evidence. Well-designed clinical studies that consider the disease severity and stages are required in the future.",

Hospice is the standard in end-of-life care for people with Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects people in middle adulthood. Yet, we have little knowledge regarding the place of death for people with HD. Therefore, the current state of knowledge limits HD clinicians' ability to conduct high-quality goals of care conversations. Objectives: We sought to determine the factors associated with the place of death in people with HD. Design: We obtained cross-sectional data from Enroll-HD and included participants with a positive HD mutation of 36 or more CAG repeats. Results: Out of 16,120 participants in the Enroll-HD study, 536 were reported as deceased. The mean age at death was 60. The leading place of death was home (29%), followed by the hospital (23%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of dying at a skilled nursing facility was significantly lower for those partnered (aOR: 0.48, confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.26-0.86). The aOR for dying on hospice compared to home was increased in a person with some college and above (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.21-4.75). Conclusions: Our data further suggest that models that predict the place of death for serious illnesses do not appear to generalize to HD. The distribution in the places of death within HD was not uniform. Our findings may assist HD clinicians in communication during goals of care conversations.",

BACKGROUND: People with Huntington's disease (HD) often become institutionalized and more frequently die away from the home setting. The reasons behind differences in end-of-life care are poorly understood. Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for this neurodegenerative disease. It is unknown what factors are associated with in-patient specialty PC consultation in this population and how PC might be related to discharge disposition. OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge disposition. DESIGN: We analyzed factors associated with PC consultation for people with HD using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. An anonymized, cross-sectional, and stratified sample of 20% of United States hospitalizations from 2007 through 2014 were included using ICD-9 codes. RESULTS: 8521 patients with HD were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 321 (3.8%) received specialty PC. Payer type, (specifically private insurer or other insurer as compared to Medicare), income, (specifically the top quartile as compared to the bottom quartile), mortality risk, D.N.R., aspiration pneumonia, and depression were significantly associated with PC in a multivariate model. Among those who received PC, the odds ratio (OR) of discharge to a facility was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.32-0.58), whereas the OR of discharge to home with services was 2.25 (95% CI 1.57-3.23), even after adjusting for possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HD, economic factors, depression, and serious illness-specific factors were associated with PC, and PC was associated with discharge disposition. These findings have implications for the adaptation of inpatient PC models to meet the needs of persons with HD.",

                    "text": "Huntington disease: new insights into molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities. Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) and involves a complex web of pathogenic mechanisms. Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.",

                    "text": "Imaging of Synaptic Density in Neurodegenerative Disorders. PET technology has produced many radiopharmaceuticals that target specific brain proteins and other measures of brain function. Recently, a new approach has emerged to image synaptic density by targeting the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), an integral glycoprotein in the membrane of synaptic vesicles and widely distributed throughout the brain. Multiple SV2A ligands have been developed and translated to human use. The most successful of these to date is 11C-UCB-J, because of its high uptake, moderate metabolism, and effective quantification with a 1-tissue-compartment model. Further, since SV2A is the target of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, human blocking studies have characterized specific binding and potential reference regions. Regional brain SV2A levels were shown to correlate with those of synaptophysin, another commonly used marker of synaptic density, providing the basis for SV2A PET imaging to have broad utility across neuropathologic diseases. In this review, we highlight the development of SV2A tracers and the evaluation of quantification methods, including compartment modeling and simple tissue ratios. Mouse and rat models of neurodegenerative diseases have been studied with small-animal PET, providing validation by comparison to direct tissue measures. Next, we review human PET imaging results in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Studies on Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease have progressed most rapidly at multiple centers, with generally consistent results of patterns of SV2A or synaptic loss. In Alzheimer disease, the synaptic loss patterns differ from those of amyloid, tau, and 18F-FDG, although intertracer and interregional correlations have been found. Smaller studies have been reported in other disorders, including Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In conclusion, PET imaging of SV2A has rapidly developed, and qualified radioligands are available. PET studies on humans indicate that SV2A loss might be specific to disease-associated brain regions and consistent with synaptic density loss. The recent availability of new 18F tracers, 18F-SynVesT-1 and 18F-SynVesT-2, will substantially broaden the application of SV2A PET. Future studies are needed in larger patient cohorts to establish the clinical value of SV2A PET and its potential for diagnosis and progression monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as efficacy assessment of disease-modifying therapies.",

                    "text": "Recent advances in the therapeutic development for Huntington disease. INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a late-onset genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide in the exon 1 of the gene encoding the polyglutamine (polyQ). It has been shown that protein degradation and lipid metabolism is altered in HD. In many neurodegenerative disorders, impaired lipid homeostasis is one of the early events in the disease onset. Yet, little is known about how mutant huntingtin may affect phospholipids membrane fluidity. Here, we investigated how membrane fluidity in the living cells (differentiated PC12 and HEK293 cell lines) are affected using a hyperspectral imaging of widely used probes, LAURDAN. Using phasor approach, we characterized the fluorescence of LAURDAN that is sensitive to the polarity of the immediate environment. LAURDAN is affected by the physical order of phospholipids (lipid order) and reports the membrane fluidity. We also validated our results using a different fluorescent membrane probe, Nile Red (NR). The plasma membrane in the cells expressing expanded polyQ shows a shift toward increased membrane fluidity revealed by both LAURDAN and NR spectral phasors. This finding brings a new perspective in the understanding of the early stages of HD that can be used as a target for drug screening.",

Excitotoxicity, due to overstimulation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), has a pivotal role in many neurological disorders. However, NMDAR antagonists often cause side effects, and identifying more druggable therapeutic targets for NMDAR excitotoxicity is an important goal. Activation of caspases is a downstream effect of excitotoxicity that may be critically involved in NMDAR-mediated cell death. Caspase-6 (casp6) in particular has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer disease. Using N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic injuries of primary rat neurons, we demonstrate that there is an early increase in caspase profiles after an excitotoxic event at the level of mRNA, protein, and activity. Casp6 is elevated and activated first, followed by caspase-8 and caspase-3. Similarly, known casp6 substrates huntingtin, as well as novel casp6 substrates serine/threonine kinase 3 and death domain-associated protein, are cleaved in similar temporal patterns post NMDA. On the basis of these data, we propose that casp6 may be an initiator caspase in apoptotic cascades leading to neuronal death after an excitotoxic event and suggest casp6 as a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders where NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity has been shown to play a role.",

                    "text": "Activation of caspase-6 and cleavage of caspase-6 substrates is an early event in NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity, due to overstimulation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), has a pivotal role in many neurological disorders. However, NMDAR antagonists often cause side effects, and identifying more druggable therapeutic targets for NMDAR excitotoxicity is an important goal. Activation of caspases is a downstream effect of excitotoxicity that may be critically involved in NMDAR-mediated cell death. Caspase-6 (casp6) in particular has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer disease. Using N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic injuries of primary rat neurons, we demonstrate that there is an early increase in caspase profiles after an excitotoxic event at the level of mRNA, protein, and activity. Casp6 is elevated and activated first, followed by caspase-8 and caspase-3. Similarly, known casp6 substrates huntingtin, as well as novel casp6 substrates serine/threonine kinase 3 and death domain-associated protein, are cleaved in similar temporal patterns post NMDA. On the basis of these data, we propose that casp6 may be an initiator caspase in apoptotic cascades leading to neuronal death after an excitotoxic event and suggest casp6 as a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders where NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity has been shown to play a role.",

                    "text": "Comparative transcriptome analysis identified crucial genes and pathways affecting sperm motility in the reproductive tract of drakes with different libido. Libido can affect the semen quality of male, and the sperm motility in semen quality parameters is a reliable index to evaluate the fertility of male. In drakes, the sperm motility is gradually acquired in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. However, the relationship between libido and sperm motility in drakes has not been reported and the mechanisms of testis, epididymis, and spermaduct regulating the sperm motility of drakes are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the semen quality of drakes with libido level 4 (LL4) and libido level 5 (LL5), and tried to identify the mechanisms regulating the sperm motility in drakes by performing RNA-seq in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. Phenotypically, the sperm motility of drakes (P < 0.01), weight of testis (P < 0.05), and organ index of epididymis (P < 0.05) in the LL5 group were significantly better than those in LL4 group. Moreover, compared with the LL4 group, the ductal square of seminiferous tubule (ST) in testis was significantly bigger in the LL5 group (P < 0.05), and the seminiferous epithelial thickness (P < 0.01) of ST in testis and lumenal diameter (P < 0.05) of ductuli conjugentes/dutus epididymidis in epididymis were significantly longer in the LL5 group. In transcriptional regulation, in addition to KEGG pathways related to metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, lots of KEGG pathways associated with immunity, proliferation, and signaling were also significantly enriched in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct, respectively. Furthermore, through the integrated analysis of coexpression network and protein-protein interaction network, 3 genes (including COL11A1, COL14A1, and C3AR1) involved in protein digestion and absorption pathway and Staphylococcus aureus infection pathway were identified in testis, 2 genes (including BUB1B and ESPL1) involved in cell cycle pathway were identified in epididymis, and 13 genes (including DNAH1, DNAH3, DNAH7, DNAH10, DNAH12, DNAI1, DNAI2, DNALI1, NTF3, ITGA1, TLR2, RELN, and PAK1) involved in Huntington disease pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were identified in spermaduct. These genes could play crucial roles in the sperm motility of drakes with different libido, and all data the present study obtained will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating sperm motility of drakes.",

A data table of aggregate information on a per cell basis, as well as a summary table, is provided for further data analysis. We demonstrate the versatility of AggreCount by analyzing a number of different cellular aggregates including aggresomes, stress granules, and inclusion bodies caused by huntingtin polyglutamine expansion.",

BACKGROUND: At the end of life, anxious attitudes concerning the dying process are common in patients in Palliative Care. Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

For Huntington disease, identification of brain regions related to motor impairment can be useful for developing interventions to alleviate the motor symptom, the major symptom of the disease. However, the effects from the brain regions to motor impairment may vary for different groups of patients. Hence, our interest is not only to identify the brain regions but also to understand how their effects on motor impairment differ by patient groups. This can be cast as a model selection problem for a varying-coefficient regression. However, this is challenging when there is a pre-specified group structure among variables. We propose a novel variable selection method for a varying-coefficient regression with such structured variables and provide a publicly available R package svreg for implementation of our method. Our method is empirically shown to select relevant variables consistently. Also, our method screens irrelevant variables better than existing methods. Hence, our method leads to a model with higher sensitivity, lower false discovery rate and higher prediction accuracy than the existing methods. Finally, we found that the effects from the brain regions to motor impairment differ by disease severity of the patients. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to identify such interaction effects between the disease severity and brain regions, which indicates the need for customized intervention by disease severity.",

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by multiple movement disorders, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline. As an insidious, progressive disorder, clinical phenoconversion in HD can be quite subtle and difficult to pinpoint. In light of this ambiguity, substantial interest has developed in HD research for biomarker identification, with the intent of establishing specific changes or \"stages\" of disease progression. Presumably, earlier stages of dysfunction offer greater chance for intervention or modification of disease mechanisms. As such, identifying disease processes as early as possible, in a prediagnostic period if possible, has been of paramount interest. Emerging evidence suggests motor dysfunction in HD long precedes clinical diagnosis, raising questions about the initiation of HD pathology and in turn our understanding of disease progression. This chapter summarizes advances in characterizing and understanding preclinical motor manifestations in HD, including changes in eye movements, gait, and fine motor performance. Development of the most sensitive and specific outcome measures for trial design is a rapidly evolving field in HD experimental therapeutics, with exciting implications for the study and treatment of this challenging disorder.",

Neurodegenerative disease encompasses a wide range of disorders afflicting the central and peripheral nervous systems and is a major unmet biomedical need of our time. There are very limited treatments, and no cures, for most of these diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Disease, and Motor Neuron Diseases. Mouse and other animal models provide hope by analysing them to understand pathogenic mechanisms, to identify drug targets, and to develop gene therapies and stem cell therapies. However, despite many decades of research, virtually no new treatments have reached the clinic. Increasingly, it is apparent that human heterogeneity within clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders, and between patients with the same genetic mutations, significantly impacts disease presentation and, potentially, therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, stratifying patients according to genetics, lifestyle, disease presentation, ethnicity, and other parameters may hold the key to bringing effective therapies from the bench to the clinic. Here, we discuss genetic and cellular humanised mouse models, and how they help in defining the genetic and environmental parameters associated with neurodegenerative disease, and so help in developing effective precision medicine strategies for future healthcare.",

However, little attention has been paid to the pressure data collected during formation of individual footsteps. This work investigates the potential of classifying patient disease severity based on individual footstep pressure data using deep learning techniques. Using the Motor Subscale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) as the gold standard, our experiments showed that using VGG16 and similar modules can achieve classification accuracy of 89%.

INTRODUCTION: Modulation of gene expression using gene therapy as well as modulation of immune activation using immunotherapy has attracted considerable attention as rapidly emerging potential therapeutic intervention for the treatment of HD. Several preclinical and clinical trials for gene-based therapy and immunotherapy/antibody-based have been conducted. AREAS COVERED: This review focused on the potential use of gene therapy and immuno-based therapies to treat HD, including the current status, the rationale for these approaches as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting it. Growing knowledge of HD pathogenesis has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets, some of which are now in clinical trials. Focus has been allocated to RNA and DNA-based gene therapies for the reduction of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), using Immuno/antibody-based therapies. EXPERT OPINION: While safety and efficacy of gene therapy and immunotherapy has been well demonstrated for HD, therefore much focus has now been shifted to disease-modifying therapies. This review defines the current status and future directions of gene therapy and immunotherapies. The review summarizes by what means HD genetic root cause modification and functional restoration of mHtt protein could be achieved by using targeted multimodality gene therapy and immunotherapy to target intracellular and extracellular mHtt.",

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) is an important diagnostic tool in Huntington disease (HD), a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. To clarify the nature of diffusivity changes in HD, we compared the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCW ) acquired by DW-MR with extracellular space volume fraction alpha and tortuosity lambda, measured by the iontophoretic method in the R6/2 mouse model of HD and in wild-type controls (WT). In anisotropic globus pallidus (GP), diffusion measurements were performed in the mediolateral (x), rostrocaudal (y), and ventrodorsal (z) axes. In HD animals, we detected an increase in ADCW in all axes and larger alpha than in WT mice. No significant difference between WT and HD mice was found in the values of tortuosity (lambdax , lambday , lambdaz ). Despite structural changes in GP, diffusion anisotropy was unaffected in HD mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed in HD mice weaker expression of extracellular matrix and a decrease in neuron numbers compared with WT mice. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining detected astrogliosis-like changes in the morphology of astrocytic processes in HD GP. In the somatosensory cortex, no significant differences in the studied parameters were found. We conclude that in the R6/2 model of HD, a decrease in the number of neurons in the GP results in increased ADCW and alpha values. Values of lambda were not significantly changed as the increase of diffusion obstacles formed by reactive astrocytes was compensated for by the extracellular matrix reduction.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) is an important diagnostic tool in Huntington disease (HD), a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. To clarify the nature of diffusivity changes in HD, we compared the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCW ) acquired by DW-MR with extracellular space volume fraction alpha and tortuosity lambda, measured by the iontophoretic method in the R6/2 mouse model of HD and in wild-type controls (WT). In anisotropic globus pallidus (GP), diffusion measurements were performed in the mediolateral (x), rostrocaudal (y), and ventrodorsal (z) axes. In HD animals, we detected an increase in ADCW in all axes and larger alpha than in WT mice. No significant difference between WT and HD mice was found in the values of tortuosity (lambdax , lambday , lambdaz ). Despite structural changes in GP, diffusion anisotropy was unaffected in HD mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed in HD mice weaker expression of extracellular matrix and a decrease in neuron numbers compared with WT mice. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining detected astrogliosis-like changes in the morphology of astrocytic processes in HD GP. In the somatosensory cortex, no significant differences in the studied parameters were found. We conclude that in the R6/2 model of HD, a decrease in the number of neurons in the GP results in increased ADCW and alpha values. Values of lambda were not significantly changed as the increase of diffusion obstacles formed by reactive astrocytes was compensated for by the extracellular matrix reduction.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

                    "text": "In Vivo Cerebral Imaging of Mutant Huntingtin Aggregates Using 11C-CHDI-180R PET in a Nonhuman Primate Model of Huntington Disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q, n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001). No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically. Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the approach to chorea in clinical practice, beginning with a discussion of the phenomenologic features of chorea and how to differentiate it from other movement disorders. The diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas, and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats are included. RECENT FINDINGS: C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including NKX2-1, ADCY5, GNAO1, and PDE10A. New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing. SUMMARY: Clinical features remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.",

BACKGROUND: Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length immunoglobulins and offer important advantages compared with conventional monoclonal antibodies: extreme specificity, higher affinity, superior stability and solubility, reduced immunogenicity as well as easy and inexpensive large-scale production. OBJECTIVE: In this article we will review and discuss recombinant antibodies that are being evaluated for neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical models and in clinical studies and will summarize new strategies that are being developed to optimize their stability, specificity and potency for advancing their use. METHODS: Articles describing recombinant antibody fragments used for neurological diseases were selected (PubMed) and evaluated for their significance.

When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.",

Neurodegenerative diseases that affect serious gait abnormalities include Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington disease (HD). These diseases lead to gait rhythm distortion that can be determined by stride time interval of footfall contact times. In this paper, we present a new method for gait classification of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we utilize a symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm to convert left-foot stride-stride interval into a sequence of symbols using a symbolic aggregate approximation. We then find string prototypes of each class using the newly proposed string grammar unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy C-medians. Then in the testing process the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor is used. We implement the system on three 2-class problems, i.e., the classification of ALS against healthy patients, that of HD against healthy patients , and that of PD against healthy patients. The system is also implemented on one 4-class problem (the classification of ALS, HD, PD, and healthy patients altogether) called NDDs versus healthy. We found that our system yields a very good detection result. The average correct classification for ALS versus healthy is 96.88%, and that for HD versus healthy is 97.22%, whereas that for PD versus healthy is 96.43%. When the system is implemented on 4-class problem, the average accuracy is approximately 98.44%. It can provide prototypes of gait signals that are more understandable to human.",

Based on several pharmacological activities of curcumin, it has been introduced as an ideal candidate for different neurological disorders. Despite the pleiotropic activities of curcumin, poor solubility, rapid clearance and low stability have limited its clinical application. In recent years, nano-based drug delivery system has effectively improved the aqueous solubility and bioavailability of curcumin. In this review article, the effects of curcumin nanoparticles and their possible mechanism/s of action has been elucidated in various central nervous system (CNS)-related diseases including Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease is cost effective for heterozygous individuals with Huntington disease vs. unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a theoretical cohort of 3,851 couples, where one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. SETTING: N/A. PATIENTS/ANIMALS: None. INTERVENTION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing for couples attempting conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both parents in addition to secondary outcomes of procedure-related loss, spontaneous abortion, termination of pregnancy, and early/normal/late-onset Huntington disease. A willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is lower in cost and higher in effectiveness compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis among couples with one heterozygous Huntington disease individual, making it the dominant strategy. In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing was associated with 77 more QALYs and a cost savings of $46,394,268. All measured outcomes were lower in the IVF preimplantation genetic testing strategy, including 39 fewer procedure-related losses, 39 fewer spontaneous abortions, and 462 fewer terminations of pregnancy. Most notably, in our theoretical cohort of couples, IVF preimplantation genetic testing resulted in 1,079 fewer Huntington disease-affected offspring. Our results were robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is a cost-effective conception strategy compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis when one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. Not only can morbidity and mortality incurred by Huntington disease be mitigated for the offspring with the use of IVF preimplantation genetic testing, but this study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of using IVF preimplantation genetic testing for those with Huntington disease.",

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a form of prenatal diagnosis applied to potential parents with known carrier status of a genetic disease, such as Huntington disease. It employs the use of polymerase chain reaction to amplify single cells from early embryos obtained with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques. PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring.

This allowed to separately quantify magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and hindered and restricted diffusion-weighted signal fractions, and assess how they drove WM microstructure differences between patients and controls. We used tractometry to investigate region-specific alterations across callosal segments with well-characterized early- and late-myelinating axon populations, while brain-wise differences were explored with tract-based cluster analysis (TBCA). Behavioral measures were included to explore disease-associated brain-function relationships. We detected lower MTR in patients' callosal rostrum (tractometry: p = .03; TBCA: p = .03), but higher MTR in their splenium (tractometry: p = .02). Importantly, patients' mutation-size and MTR were positively correlated (all p-values < .01), indicating that MTR alterations may directly result from the mutation. Further, MTR was higher in younger, but lower in older patients relative to controls (p = .003), suggesting that MTR increases are detrimental later in the disease. Finally, patients showed higher restricted diffusion signal fraction (FR) from the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED) in the cortico-spinal tract (p = .03), which correlated positively with MTR in the posterior callosum (p = .033), potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms. In summary, this first comprehensive, ultra-strong gradient MRI study in HD provides novel evidence of mutation-driven MTR alterations at the premanifest disease stage which may reflect neurodevelopmental changes in iron, myelin, or a combination of these.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

                    "text": "Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 Activation Improves Motor Performance and Reduces Pathology in Heterozygous zQ175 Huntington Disease Mice. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

BACKGROUND: Clinician-rated measures of functioning are often used as primary endpoints in clinical trials and other behavioral research in Huntington disease. As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible, there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM: The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures, differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related assessments are not feasible.",

                    "text": "Concurrent Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses of Multivariate White Matter Profiles and Clinical Functioning in Pre-Diagnosis Huntington Disease. BACKGROUND: Gray matter (GM) atrophy in the striatum and across the brain is a consistently reported feature of the Huntington Disease (HD) prodrome. More recently, widespread prodromal white matter (WM) degradation has also been detected. However, longitudinal WM studies are limited and conflicting, and most analyses comparing WM and clinical functioning have also been cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: We simultaneously assessed changes in WM and cognitive and motor functioning at various prodromal HD stages. METHODS: Data from 1,336 (1,047 prodromal, 289 control) PREDICT-HD participants were analyzed (3,700 sessions). MRI images were used to create GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid probability maps. Using source-based morphometry, independent component analysis was applied to WM probability maps to extract covarying spatial patterns and their subject profiles. WM profiles were analyzed in two sets of linear mixed model (LMM) analyses: one to compare WM profiles across groups cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and one to concurrently compare WM profiles and clinical variables cross-sectionally and longitudinally within each group. RESULTS: Findings illustrate widespread prodromal changes in GM-adjacent-WM, with premotor, supplementary motor, middle frontal and striatal changes early in the prodrome that subsequently extend sub-gyrally with progression. Motor functioning agreed most with WM until the near-onset prodromal stage, when Stroop interference was the best WM indicator. Across groups, Trail-Making Test part A outperformed other cognitive variables in its similarity to WM, particularly cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that distinct regions coincide with cognitive compared to motor functioning. Furthermore, at different prodromal stages, distinct regions appear to align best with clinical functioning. Thus, the informativeness of clinical measures may vary according to the type of data available (cross-sectional or longitudinal) as well as age and CAG-number.",

                    "text": "Concurrent Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses of Multivariate White Matter Profiles and Clinical Functioning in Pre-Diagnosis Huntington Disease. BACKGROUND: Gray matter (GM) atrophy in the striatum and across the brain is a consistently reported feature of the Huntington Disease (HD) prodrome. More recently, widespread prodromal white matter (WM) degradation has also been detected. However, longitudinal WM studies are limited and conflicting, and most analyses comparing WM and clinical functioning have also been cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: We simultaneously assessed changes in WM and cognitive and motor functioning at various prodromal HD stages. METHODS: Data from 1,336 (1,047 prodromal, 289 control) PREDICT-HD participants were analyzed (3,700 sessions). MRI images were used to create GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid probability maps. Using source-based morphometry, independent component analysis was applied to WM probability maps to extract covarying spatial patterns and their subject profiles. WM profiles were analyzed in two sets of linear mixed model (LMM) analyses: one to compare WM profiles across groups cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and one to concurrently compare WM profiles and clinical variables cross-sectionally and longitudinally within each group. RESULTS: Findings illustrate widespread prodromal changes in GM-adjacent-WM, with premotor, supplementary motor, middle frontal and striatal changes early in the prodrome that subsequently extend sub-gyrally with progression. Motor functioning agreed most with WM until the near-onset prodromal stage, when Stroop interference was the best WM indicator. Across groups, Trail-Making Test part A outperformed other cognitive variables in its similarity to WM, particularly cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that distinct regions coincide with cognitive compared to motor functioning. Furthermore, at different prodromal stages, distinct regions appear to align best with clinical functioning. Thus, the informativeness of clinical measures may vary according to the type of data available (cross-sectional or longitudinal) as well as age and CAG-number.",

Huntington disease (HD) is caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Molecular testing of Huntington disease for diagnostic confirmation and disease prediction requires detection of the CAG repeat expansion. There are three main types of HD genetic testing: (1) diagnostic testing to confirm or rule out disease, (2) presymptomatic testing to determine whether an at-risk individual inherited the expanded allele, and (3) prenatal testing to determine whether the fetus has inherited the expanded allele. This unit includes protocols that describe the complementary use of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and Southern blot hybridization to accurately measure the CAG trinucleotide repeat size and interpret the test results. In addition, an indirect linkage analysis that does not reveal the unwanted parental HD status in a prenatal testing will also be discussed.",

OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by the mutant huntingtin gene (mHTT), which harbors expanded CAG repeats. We previously reported that the brain vessel density is higher in mice and patients with HD than in controls. The present study determines whether vascular function is altered in HD and characterizes the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The brain vessel density and vascular reactivity (VR) to carbogen challenge of HD mice were monitored by 3D DeltaR2 -mMRA and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)/flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. The amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and the pericyte coverage were determined by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in human and mouse brain sections, primary mouse astrocytes and pericytes, and human astrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. RESULTS: Expression of mHTT in astrocytes and neurons is sufficient to increase the brain vessel density in HD mice. BOLD and FAIR MRI revealed gradually impaired VR to carbogen in HD mice. Astrocytes from HD mice and patients contained more VEGF-A, which triggers proliferation of endothelial cells and may be responsible for the augmented neurovascular changes. Moreover, an astrocytic inflammatory response, which reduces the survival of pericytes through an IkappaB kinase-dependent pathway, mediates the low pericyte coverage of blood vessels in HD brains. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the inflammation-prone HD astrocytes provide less pericyte coverage by promoting angiogenesis and reducing the number of pericytes and that these changes can explain the inferior VR in HD mice. The resultant impaired VR might hinder cerebral hemodynamics and increase brain atrophy during HD progression.",

PURPOSE: There is little long-term, population-based data on uptake of prenatal diagnosis for Huntington disease (HD), a late-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the effect of the availability of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) on families' decisions about conventional prenatal diagnosis is not known. We report trends in prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation diagnosis for HD in the United Kingdom since services commenced. METHODS: Long-term UK-wide prospective case record-based service evaluation in 23 UK Regional Genetic Centres 1988-2015, and four UK PGD centers 2002-2015. RESULTS: From 1988 to 2015, 479 prenatal diagnoses were performed in the UK for HD. An exclusion approach was used in 150 (31%). The annual rate of HD prenatal diagnosis has remained around 18 (3.5/million) over 27 years, despite a steady increase in the use of PGD for HD since 2002. CONCLUSION: Although increasing number of couples are choosing either direct or exclusion PGD to prevent HD in their offspring, both direct and exclusion prenatal diagnosis remain important options in a health system where both PGD and prenatal diagnosis are state funded. At-risk couples should be informed of all options available to them, preferably prepregnancy.",

                    "text": "Gene Therapy, A Novel Therapeutic Tool for Neurological Disorders: Current Progress, Challenges and Future Prospective. Neurological disorders are one of the major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

                    "text": "Current status of PET imaging in Huntington's disease. PURPOSE: To review the developments of recent decades and the current status of PET molecular imaging in Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: A systematic review of PET studies in HD was performed. The MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus databases were searched for articles in all languages published up to 19 August 2015 using the major medical subject heading \"Huntington Disease\" combined with text and key words \"Huntington Disease\", \"Neuroimaging\" and \"PET\". Only peer-reviewed, primary research studies in HD patients and premanifest HD carriers, and studies in which clinical features were described in association with PET neuroimaging results, were included in this review. Reviews, case reports and nonhuman studies were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 54 PET studies were identified and analysed in this review. Brain metabolism ([(18)F]FDG and [(15)O]H2O), presynaptic ([(18)F]fluorodopa, [(11)C]beta-CIT and [(11)C]DTBZ) and postsynaptic ([(11)C]SCH22390, [(11)C]FLB457 and [(11)C]raclopride) dopaminergic function, phosphodiesterases ([(18)F]JNJ42259152, [(18)F]MNI-659 and [(11)C]IMA107), and adenosine ([(18)F]CPFPX), cannabinoid ([(18)F]MK-9470), opioid ([(11)C]diprenorphine) and GABA ([(11)C]flumazenil) receptors were evaluated as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and for assessing the development and efficacy of novel disease-modifying drugs in premanifest HD carriers and HD patients. PET studies evaluating brain restoration and neuroprotection were also identified and described in detail. CONCLUSION: Brain metabolism, postsynaptic dopaminergic function and phosphodiesterase 10A levels were proven to be powerful in assessing disease progression. However, no single technique may be currently considered an optimal biomarker and an integrative multimodal imaging approach combining different techniques should be developed for monitoring potential neuroprotective and preventive treatment in HD.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).",

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by multiple movement disorders, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline. As an insidious, progressive disorder, clinical phenoconversion in HD can be quite subtle and difficult to pinpoint. In light of this ambiguity, substantial interest has developed in HD research for biomarker identification, with the intent of establishing specific changes or \"stages\" of disease progression. Presumably, earlier stages of dysfunction offer greater chance for intervention or modification of disease mechanisms. As such, identifying disease processes as early as possible, in a prediagnostic period if possible, has been of paramount interest. Emerging evidence suggests motor dysfunction in HD long precedes clinical diagnosis, raising questions about the initiation of HD pathology and in turn our understanding of disease progression. This chapter summarizes advances in characterizing and understanding preclinical motor manifestations in HD, including changes in eye movements, gait, and fine motor performance. Development of the most sensitive and specific outcome measures for trial design is a rapidly evolving field in HD experimental therapeutics, with exciting implications for the study and treatment of this challenging disorder.",

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sleep pattern and the motor activity during sleep in a cohort of patients affected by Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Thirty HD patients, 16 women and 14 men (mean age 57.3 +- 12.2 y); 30 matched healthy controls (mean age 56.5 +- 11.8 y). INTERVENTIONS: Subjective sleep evaluation: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); Berlin's Questionnaire, interview for restless legs syndrome (RLS), questionnaire for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Clinical evaluation: disease duration, clinical severity (unified Huntington disease motor rating scale [UHDMRS]), genetic tests. Laboratory-based full-night attended video-polysomnography (V-PSG). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The duration of the disease was 9.4 +- 4.4 y, UHMDRS score was 55.5 +- 23.4, CAG repeats were 44.3 +- 4.1. Body mass index was 21.9 +- 4.0 kg/m(2). No patients or caregivers reported poor sleep quality. Two patients reported symptoms of RLS. Eight patients had an ESS score >= 9. Eight patients had high risk of obstructive sleep apnea. At the RBD questionnaire, two patients had a pathological score. HD patients, compared to controls, showed shorter sleep, reduced sleep efficiency index, and increased arousals and awakenings. Four patients presented with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Periodic limb movements (PLMs) during wake and sleep were observed in all patients. No episode of RBD was observed in the V-PSG recordings, and no patients showed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia. The disease duration correlated with ESS score (P < 0.02). UHMDRS correlated positively with the ESS score (P < 0.005), and negatively with the percentage of REM sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Huntington disease showed a severe sleep disruption and a high prevalence of periodic limb movements, but no evidence of sleep disordered breathing or REM sleep behavior disorder.",

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited late-onset neurological disorder characterized by progressive neuronal loss and disruption of cortical and basal ganglia circuits. Cell replacement using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron. We have also shown that transplants elicited a significant improvement in sensory-motor tasks up to 2 months post-transplant further supporting the therapeutic potential of this approach.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Previously, we showed strong huntingtin reduction and prevention of neuronal dysfunction in HD rodents using an engineered microRNA targeting human huntingtin, delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 5 vector with a transgene encoding an engineered miRNA against HTT mRNA (AAV5-miHTT). One of the challenges of rodents as a model of neurodegenerative diseases is their relatively small brain, making successful translation to the HD patient difficult. This is particularly relevant for gene therapy approaches, where distribution achieved upon local administration into the parenchyma is likely dependent on brain size and structure. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the translation of huntingtin-lowering gene therapy to a large-animal brain. We investigated the feasibility, efficacy, and tolerability of one-time intracranial administration of AAV5-miHTT in the transgenic HD (tgHD) minipig model. We detected widespread dose-dependent distribution of AAV5-miHTT throughout the tgHD minipig brain that correlated with the engineered microRNA expression. Both human mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in all brain regions transduced by AAV5-miHTT. The combination of widespread vector distribution and extensive huntingtin lowering observed with AAV5-miHTT supports the translation of a huntingtin-lowering gene therapy for HD from preclinical studies into the clinic.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntington disease gene.

However, psychiatric disturbances, including depression, are common features of HD and can occur a decade before the manifestation of motor symptoms. We used the YAC128 transgenic mice (which develop motor deficits at a later stage, allowing more time to study depressive behaviors without the confounding effects of motor impairment) to test the effects of intranasal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment for 15 days in the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors. Using multiple well-validated behavioral tests, we found that BDNF treatment alleviated anhedonic and depressive-like behaviors in the YAC128 HD mice. Furthermore, we also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effects of BDNF were associated with an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, BDNF treatment only increased cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of wild-type (WT) mice, without altering these parameters in their YAC128 counterparts. Moreover, BDNF treatment did not cause an increase in the number of dendritic branches in the hippocampal DG when compared with animals treated with vehicle.

Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

Multiple targeted therapeutics for Huntington's disease are now in clinical trials, including intrathecally delivered compounds. Previous research suggests that CSF dynamics may be altered in Huntington's disease, which could be of paramount relevance to intrathecal drug delivery to the brain. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective cross-sectional study comparing people with early stage Huntington's disease with age- and gender-matched healthy controls. CSF peak velocity, mean velocity and mean flow at the level of the cerebral aqueduct, and sub-arachnoid space in the upper and lower spine, were quantified using phase contrast MRI. We calculated Spearman's rank correlations, and tested inter-group differences with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Ten people with early Huntington's disease, and 10 controls were included. None of the quantified measures was associated with potential modifiers of CSF dynamics (demographics, osmolality, and brain volumes), or by known modifiers of Huntington's disease (age and HTTCAG repeat length); and no significant differences were found between the two studied groups. While external validation is required, the attained results are sufficient to conclude tentatively that a clinically relevant alteration of CSF dynamics - that is, one that would justify dose-adjustments of intrathecal drugs - is unlikely to exist in Huntington's disease.",

Although the interplay between perturbed BBB homeostasis and the pathogenesis of brain disorders needs further investigation, the development and validation of a reliable procedure to accurately detect BBB alterations may be crucial and represent a useful tool for potentially predicting disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we present an easy and efficient procedure for evaluating BBB leakage in a neurodegenerative condition like that occurring in a preclinical mouse model of Huntington disease, in which defects in the permeability of BBB are clearly detectable precociously in the disease. Specifically, the high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled (FITC)-albumin, which is able to cross the BBB only when the latter is impaired, is acutely infused into a mouse jugular vein and its distribution in the vascular or parenchymal districts is then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of green fluorescent-albumin in the brain parenchyma functions as an index of aberrant BBB permeability and, when quantitated by using Image J processing software, is reported as Green Fluorescence Intensity.",

Using a CAG-Age Product score, 30 prodromal HD participants were selected based on estimated probability of imminent clinical diagnosis of HD (i.e., low, medium, high; n = 10/group). For comparison, participants already diagnosed (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were also selected. RESULTS: A total of 2,081 miRNAs were detected and 6 were significantly increased in the prodromal HD gene expansion carriers vs controls at false discovery rate q < 0.05 (miR-520f-3p, miR-135b-3p, miR-4317, miR-3928-5p, miR-8082, miR-140-5p). Evaluating the miRNA levels in each of the HD risk categories, all 6 revealed a pattern of increasing abundance from control to low risk, and from low risk to medium risk, which then leveled off from the medium to high risk and HD diagnosed groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports miRNAs as CSF biomarkers of prodromal and diagnosed HD. Importantly, miRNAs were detected in the prodromal HD groups furthest from diagnosis where treatments are likely to be most consequential and meaningful. The identification of potential biomarkers in the disease prodrome may prove useful in evaluating treatments that may postpone disease onset. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00051324.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine tract at the N-terminus of the huntingtin protein. Typical disease onset is around mid-life (adult-onset HD) whereas onset below 21 years is classified as juvenile HD. While much research has been done on the underlying HD disease mechanisms, little is known about regulation and expression levels of huntingtin RNA and protein. RESULTS: In this study we used 15 human post-mortem HD brain samples to investigate the expression of wild-type and mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein. In adult-onset HD brain samples, there was a small but significantly lower expression of mutant huntingtin mRNA compared to wild-type huntingtin mRNA, while wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein expression levels did not differ significantly. Juvenile HD subjects did show a lower expression of mutant huntingtin protein compared to wild-type huntingtin protein. Our results in HD brain and fibroblasts suggest that protein aggregation does not affect levels of huntingtin RNA and protein. Additionally, we did not find any evidence for a reduced expression of huntingtin antisense in fibroblasts derived from a homozygous HD patient. CONCLUSIONS: We found small differences in allelic huntingtin mRNA levels in adult-onset HD brain, with significantly lower mutant huntingtin mRNA levels.

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies. Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development of CRC. With the deep understanding of TME function, growing studies have demonstrated that alteration in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and gene expressions are associated with clinical outcomes of various tumors. In this study, we aimed to recognize critical prognostic genes involved in immune states in TME of CRC. Hence, the proportion of TICs and the number of immune and stromal components in CRC samples from TCGA datasets were calculated by the use of CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE calculation methods. Different assays were applied to collect differential expression genes (DEGs) shared by the ImmuneScore and StromalScore. DEGs were further analyzed by the use of univariate Cox regression. Our attention focused on neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) which was highly expressed in CRC specimens and associated with an advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis of CRC patients. KEGG assays revealed that NAV3 may be involved in Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, FoxO signaling pathway, and human papillomavirus infection. Correlation assays showed that macrophage M0 and B cells memory, NK cells activated, dendritic cells resting, T cells CD4 memory activated, and T cells CD8 were correlated with NAV3 expression, indicating that NAV3 may represent the immune status of TME. Finally, RT-PCR confirmed that NAV3 expression was distinctly increased in CRC cells, and its knockdown suppressed the proliferation of CRC cells. Overall, NAV3 could be used as a novel predictor for TME of CRC and might be a novel prognostic biomarker. In the future, drugs targeting NAV3 might be developed as a potential immunotherapy for CRC patients.",

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sleep pattern and the motor activity during sleep in a cohort of patients affected by Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Thirty HD patients, 16 women and 14 men (mean age 57.3 +- 12.2 y); 30 matched healthy controls (mean age 56.5 +- 11.8 y). INTERVENTIONS: Subjective sleep evaluation: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); Berlin's Questionnaire, interview for restless legs syndrome (RLS), questionnaire for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Clinical evaluation: disease duration, clinical severity (unified Huntington disease motor rating scale [UHDMRS]), genetic tests. Laboratory-based full-night attended video-polysomnography (V-PSG). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The duration of the disease was 9.4 +- 4.4 y, UHMDRS score was 55.5 +- 23.4, CAG repeats were 44.3 +- 4.1. Body mass index was 21.9 +- 4.0 kg/m(2). No patients or caregivers reported poor sleep quality. Two patients reported symptoms of RLS. Eight patients had an ESS score >= 9. Eight patients had high risk of obstructive sleep apnea. At the RBD questionnaire, two patients had a pathological score. HD patients, compared to controls, showed shorter sleep, reduced sleep efficiency index, and increased arousals and awakenings. Four patients presented with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Periodic limb movements (PLMs) during wake and sleep were observed in all patients. No episode of RBD was observed in the V-PSG recordings, and no patients showed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia. The disease duration correlated with ESS score (P < 0.02). UHMDRS correlated positively with the ESS score (P < 0.005), and negatively with the percentage of REM sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Huntington disease showed a severe sleep disruption and a high prevalence of periodic limb movements, but no evidence of sleep disordered breathing or REM sleep behavior disorder.",

PURPOSE: Laquinimod is an orally dosed immuno-modulator currently under development for Huntington's disease (HD). Preclinical findings suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated. METHODS: In this randomized, phase-1 single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of 21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose. RESULTS: The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24 and Cmax of EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSION: The combination of COC and laquinimod treatment was found to be safe, tolerable, and devoid of any noticeable pharmacokinetic interaction.",

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were first generated in 2007, but the full translational potential of this valuable tool has yet to be realized. The potential applications of hiPSCs are especially relevant to neurology, as brain cells from patients are rarely available for research. hiPSCs from individuals with neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases have facilitated biological and multi-omics studies as well as large-scale screening of chemical libraries. However, researchers are struggling to improve the scalability, reproducibility and quality of this descriptive disease modelling. Addressing these limitations will be the first step towards a new era in hiPSC research - that of predictive disease modelling - involving the correlation and integration of in vitro experimental data with longitudinal clinical data. This approach is a key element of the emerging precision medicine paradigm, in which hiPSCs could become a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool. Here, we consider the steps necessary to achieve predictive modelling of neurodegenerative disease with hiPSCs, using Huntington disease as an example.",

To bridge this gap in knowledge, we compared crude markers of ANS function between children with the gene-expansion that causes HD (GE group) who were decades from their predicted motor onset and gene-non-expanded children (GNE group). METHODS: We included participants from the Kids-HD study who were <18 years old. Linear mixed effects regression models were constructed that controlled for sex, age, and BMI, and included a random effect per participant and per family. We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84) and GNE (n = 238) groups. We then grouped participants from the GE group based on their predicted years to onset (YTO) and compared their vital signs to the GNE group. RESULTS: The GE group had higher rHR (  = 3.83, p = 0.0064), SBP (  = 2.38, p = 0.032), and CBT (  = 0.16, t = 2.92, p = 0.007). The mean rHR and CBT became significantly elevated compared to the GNE group in participants who had 15-25 YTO and those who had <15 YTO.

We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84) and GNE (n = 238) groups. We then grouped participants from the GE group based on their predicted years to onset (YTO) and compared their vital signs to the GNE group. RESULTS: The GE group had higher rHR (  = 3.83, p = 0.0064), SBP (  = 2.38, p = 0.032), and CBT (  = 0.16, t = 2.92, p = 0.007). The mean rHR and CBT became significantly elevated compared to the GNE group in participants who had 15-25 YTO and those who had <15 YTO. The mean SBP of participants who had 25-35 YTO was significantly elevated compared to the GNE group. CONCLUSION: ANS dysfunction in HD seems to occur approximately 20 years prior to the predicted onset of motor symptoms of HD.",

OBJECTIVE: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction has been described in adults with motor-manifest Huntington's Disease (HD) or those who are near their predicted motor onset. It is unclear if ANS dysfunction is present years prior to the onset of motor symptoms of HD. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we compared crude markers of ANS function between children with the gene-expansion that causes HD (GE group) who were decades from their predicted motor onset and gene-non-expanded children (GNE group). METHODS: We included participants from the Kids-HD study who were <18 years old. Linear mixed effects regression models were constructed that controlled for sex, age, and BMI, and included a random effect per participant and per family. We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84) and GNE (n = 238) groups.

BACKGROUND: Gray matter (GM) atrophy in the striatum and across the brain is a consistently reported feature of the Huntington Disease (HD) prodrome. More recently, widespread prodromal white matter (WM) degradation has also been detected. However, longitudinal WM studies are limited and conflicting, and most analyses comparing WM and clinical functioning have also been cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: We simultaneously assessed changes in WM and cognitive and motor functioning at various prodromal HD stages. METHODS: Data from 1,336 (1,047 prodromal, 289 control) PREDICT-HD participants were analyzed (3,700 sessions). MRI images were used to create GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid probability maps. Using source-based morphometry, independent component analysis was applied to WM probability maps to extract covarying spatial patterns and their subject profiles. WM profiles were analyzed in two sets of linear mixed model (LMM) analyses: one to compare WM profiles across groups cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and one to concurrently compare WM profiles and clinical variables cross-sectionally and longitudinally within each group. RESULTS: Findings illustrate widespread prodromal changes in GM-adjacent-WM, with premotor, supplementary motor, middle frontal and striatal changes early in the prodrome that subsequently extend sub-gyrally with progression. Motor functioning agreed most with WM until the near-onset prodromal stage, when Stroop interference was the best WM indicator. Across groups, Trail-Making Test part A outperformed other cognitive variables in its similarity to WM, particularly cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that distinct regions coincide with cognitive compared to motor functioning. Furthermore, at different prodromal stages, distinct regions appear to align best with clinical functioning. Thus, the informativeness of clinical measures may vary according to the type of data available (cross-sectional or longitudinal) as well as age and CAG-number.",

BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

                    "text": "Molecular Imaging of Huntington's Disease. The onset and the clinical progression of Huntington Disease (HD) is influenced by several events prompted by a genetic mutation that affects several organs tissues including different regions of the brain. In the last decades years, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) helped to deepen the knowledge of neurodegenerative mechanisms that guide to clinical symptoms. Brain imaging with PET represents a tool to investigate the physiopathology occurring in the brain and it has been used to predict the age of onset of the disease and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of new drugs. This article reviews the contribution of PET and MRI in the research field on Huntington's disease, focusing in particular on some most relevant achievements that have helped recognize the molecular changes, the clinical symptoms and evolution of the disease.

Movement disorders can be hypokinetic (e.g., parkinsonism), hyperkinetic, or dystonic in nature and commonly arise from altered function in nuclei of the basal ganglia or their connections. As obvious structural changes are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism. Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli. In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions. Various approaches are reviewed here. ",

Sixteen sheep received a bolus infusion of QA (75 microL, 180 mM) or saline, first into the left and then (4 weeks later) into the right striatum.

BACKGROUND: There is limited understanding of the feasibility of conducting long-term research among undiagnosed (pre-symptomatic) adults at risk to develop Huntington disease (HD), while protecting their emotional well-being and safety. OBJECTIVE: To assess pre-specified events pertaining to emotional well-being, safety, and feasibility among healthy consenting adults at risk for developing HD who have chosen not to undergo genetic testing. METHODS: PHAROS research participants prospectively reported the occurrence of events pertaining to psychological distress (psychiatric evaluations, depression, suicidality) and feasibility (maintaining confidentiality, study attrition). PHAROS enrolled 1001 participants. RESULTS: Events pertaining to psychological distress were reported by 35% of participants. The most common events included heightened suicide risk (26%), new onset depression (12%), and new mental health evaluation (9%); all occurred significantly more frequently among participants with expanded trinucleotide CAG repeats (>=37). Five deaths occurred, none related to suicide. Forty-one percent of participants reported self-disclosure of their HD at-risk status, and 15% reported that someone else (usually a family member) had done so. Confidentiality of CAG test results was maintained by investigators. The withdrawal rate was largely uniform over the study period and did not differ significantly by gender or CAG status. CONCLUSIONS: The potentially vulnerable research participants in PHAROS showed good emotional tolerability and safety. Individual CAG data were not disclosed, and confidentiality about disclosure of at-risk HD status was well maintained by others (family, friends, etc.). Long-term research participation of adults at risk for HD who choose not to undergo pre-symptomatic DNA testing is well tolerated, safe and feasible.",

The polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of nine fatal, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of mutant proteins containing toxic expansions of CAG/polyQ tracts. The heat shock protein 90 and 70 (Hsp90/Hsp70) chaperone machinery is a key component of cellular protein quality control, playing a role in the regulation of folding, aggregation, and degradation of polyQ proteins. The ability of Hsp70 to facilitate disaggregation and degradation of misfolded proteins makes it an attractive therapeutic target in polyQ diseases. Genetic studies have demonstrated that manipulation of Hsp70 and related co-chaperones can enhance the disaggregation and/or degradation of misfolded proteins in models of polyQ disease. Therefore, the development of small molecules that enhance Hsp70 activity is of great interest. However, it is still unclear if currently available Hsp70 modulators can selectively enhance disaggregation or degradation of misfolded proteins without perturbing other Hsp70 functions essential for cellular homeostasis. This review discusses the multifaceted role of Hsp70 in protein quality control and the opportunities and challenges Hsp70 poses as a potential therapeutic target in polyQ disease.",

We created an excitotoxic striatal lesion model of Huntington disease (HD) in sheep, using the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor agonist, quinolinic acid (QA). Sixteen sheep received a bolus infusion of QA (75 microL, 180 mM) or saline, first into the left and then (4 weeks later) into the right striatum. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the striata were performed. Metabolite concentrations and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured at baseline, acutely (1 week after each surgery) and chronically (5 weeks or greater after the surgeries). There was a significant decrease in the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and in FA in acutely lesioned striata of the QA-lesioned sheep, followed by a recovery of NAA and FA in the chronically lesioned striata. NAA level changes indicate acute death and/or impairment of neurons immediately after surgery, with recovery of reversibly impaired neurons over time. The change in FA values of the QA-lesioned striata is consistent with acute structural disruption, followed by re-organization and glial cell infiltration with time. Our study demonstrates that MRS and DTI changes in QA-sheep are consistent with HD-like pathology shown in other model species and that the MR investigations can be performed in sheep using a clinically relevant human 3T MRI scanner.",

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to follow tonic and phasic autonomic nervous activity in Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers and patients. METHODS: Evaluation of motor functions and total functional capacity was performed in 30 HD mutation carriers or patients at the beginning and in 22 subjects after 8-10 years. Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress. There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of an outbreak of clinical disease phase.",

We created an excitotoxic striatal lesion model of Huntington disease (HD) in sheep, using the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor agonist, quinolinic acid (QA). Sixteen sheep received a bolus infusion of QA (75 microL, 180 mM) or saline, first into the left and then (4 weeks later) into the right striatum. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the striata were performed. Metabolite concentrations and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured at baseline, acutely (1 week after each surgery) and chronically (5 weeks or greater after the surgeries). There was a significant decrease in the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and in FA in acutely lesioned striata of the QA-lesioned sheep, followed by a recovery of NAA and FA in the chronically lesioned striata. NAA level changes indicate acute death and/or impairment of neurons immediately after surgery, with recovery of reversibly impaired neurons over time. The change in FA values of the QA-lesioned striata is consistent with acute structural disruption, followed by re-organization and glial cell infiltration with time. Our study demonstrates that MRS and DTI changes in QA-sheep are consistent with HD-like pathology shown in other model species and that the MR investigations can be performed in sheep using a clinically relevant human 3T MRI scanner.",

BACKGROUND: At the end of life, anxious attitudes concerning the dying process are common in patients in Palliative Care. Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

METHODS: We assessed the vessel density (VD) in superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC) using OCTA, while CCT was measured by EDI SD-OCT. RESULTS: Sixteen HD patients (32 eyes) and thirteen healthy controls (26 eyes) were enrolled in this prospective study. No significant difference in retinal and choriocapillaris VD was found between HD patients and controls while CCT turned to be thinner in patients respect to controls. There were no significant relationships between OCTA findings and neurological parameters. CONCLUSION: The changes in choroidal structure provide useful information regarding the possible neurovascular involvement in the physiopathology of HD.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular pathology of Huntington disease (HD) appears to be complex; while microvascular dysfunction seems to appear early, deaths from cardiomyopathy and stroke might occur in the late phase of HD. METHODS: Our study evaluated global risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), structure and function of precerebral arteries in 41 HD subjects and 41 matched controls. HD subjects were divided into groups by the United Huntington disease rating scale (presymptomatic-PHD, early-EHD, midstage-MHD and late-LHD). CHD risk factors assessment and Doppler examination of precerebral arteries were performed, including measurements of the carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), and parameters indicating local carotid artery distensibility (stiffness index beta, pulse wave velocity, pressure strain elasticity module and carotid artery compliance). RESULTS: In the HD and controls we identified a comparable number of non-obstructive plaques (<50% lumen narrowing). No obstructive plaques (>50% lumen narrowing) were found. There was significantly increased IMT in MHD. In PHD and EHD the parameters of arterial stiffness were significantly higher and the carotid artery compliance was significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal functional vascular pathology in PHD, EHD, and MHD. Precerebral arteries dysfunction in HD therefore appears to be mostly functional and in agreement with recently described autonomic nervous system changes in HD.",

OBJECTIVE: Although Huntington's disease (HD) is a disease of the central nervous system, HD mortality surveys indicate heart disease as a major cause of death. Cardiac dysfunction in HD might be a primary consequence of peripherally expressed mutant huntingtin or secondary to either a general decline in health or the onset of neurological dysfunction. The aim of the study was to clarify the heart muscle involvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured conventional and advanced resting ECG indices. Thirty-one subjects with a confirmed huntingtin gene mutation and 31 age- and gender-matched controls were included. The HD subjects were divided into four groups based on their Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score. RESULTS: We detected changes in advanced ECG variables connected with electrical ventricular remodeling (t test, p < 0.01). The increase in the unexplained part of both QT variability and the standard deviation of normal-to-normal QT intervals, presumably reflecting beat-to-beat changes in repolarization, was most pronounced. Further, both variables correlated with the product of the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) triplets' repeat length and the subjects' age (CAP), the former R = 0.423 (p = 0.018) and the latter R = 0.499 (p = 0.004). There was no correlation between the CAP score and any of variables representing autonomic nervous system activity. CONCLUSIONS: Both autonomic nervous system dysfunction and cardiac electrical remodeling are present in patients with HD. The changes in advanced ECG variables observed in the study evolve with HD progression. The increased values of QT unexplained variability may be a marker of temporal inhomogeneity in ventricular repolarization associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias.",

UNLABELLED: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG sequence of the huntingtin (Htt) gene, which encodes a stretch of glutamines in the Htt protein. The mechanisms of neurodegeneration associated with the accumulation of Htt aggregates still remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine oxidative stress biomarkers in HD patients and their relationship with clinical, demographic and neuroimaging parameters. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients and 39 controls paired by age and sex participated in this study. Oxidative damage was assayed in blood by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidative protein products (AOPPs). Antioxidant status was determined by activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein thiols and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP). The Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and neuroimaging studies were also employed. RESULTS: MDA, AOPP and GPx were significantly increased in HD patients with respect to the control group, while GR activity was decreased. FRAP correlated with age of disease onset, AOPP with motor severity (UHDRS score), age of patients and age of disease onset. Caudate atrophy was associated with lower plasma concentrations of GSH. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to a redox imbalance in HD patients.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of microRNA (miRNA) levels in CSF as biomarkers for prodromal Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: miRNA levels were measured in CSF from 60 PREDICT-HD study participants using the HTG protocol. Using a CAG-Age Product score, 30 prodromal HD participants were selected based on estimated probability of imminent clinical diagnosis of HD (i.e., low, medium, high; n = 10/group). For comparison, participants already diagnosed (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were also selected. RESULTS: A total of 2,081 miRNAs were detected and 6 were significantly increased in the prodromal HD gene expansion carriers vs controls at false discovery rate q < 0.05 (miR-520f-3p, miR-135b-3p, miR-4317, miR-3928-5p, miR-8082, miR-140-5p). Evaluating the miRNA levels in each of the HD risk categories, all 6 revealed a pattern of increasing abundance from control to low risk, and from low risk to medium risk, which then leveled off from the medium to high risk and HD diagnosed groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports miRNAs as CSF biomarkers of prodromal and diagnosed HD. Importantly, miRNAs were detected in the prodromal HD groups furthest from diagnosis where treatments are likely to be most consequential and meaningful. The identification of potential biomarkers in the disease prodrome may prove useful in evaluating treatments that may postpone disease onset. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00051324.",

BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication. We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease. RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1 out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100). They were less in favour of gamete donation (48.3+-39.8 out of 100) or pregnancy abstention (43.3+-40.3 out of 100). The greater the perceived severity of the disease, the more reproductive options were considered justified, except for gamete donation. Prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis was a motivation to inform relatives for only 55.3% of participants (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Self-estimated severity minimally impacts opinions towards reproductive options. Medically assisted reproduction procedures are rarely sought and do not motivate familial communication.",

The basis for region-specific neuronal toxicity in Huntington disease is unknown. Here, we show that region-specific neuronal vulnerability is a substrate-driven response in astrocytes. Glucose is low in HdhQ(150/150) animals, and astrocytes in each brain region adapt by metabolically reprogramming their mitochondria to use endogenous, non-glycolytic metabolites as an alternative fuel. Each region is characterized by distinct metabolic pools, and astrocytes adapt accordingly. The vulnerable striatum is enriched in fatty acids, and mitochondria reprogram by oxidizing them as an energy source but at the cost of escalating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage. The cerebellum is replete with amino acids, which are precursors for glucose regeneration through the pentose phosphate shunt or gluconeogenesis pathways. ROS is not elevated, and this region sustains little damage. While mhtt expression imposes disease stress throughout the brain, sensitivity or resistance arises from an adaptive stress response, which is inherently region specific. Metabolic reprogramming may have relevance to other diseases.",

Using micro-bead based immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM), we have developed a highly sensitive mutant huntingtin detection assay. The sensitivity of huntingtin IP-FCM enables accurate detection of mutant huntingtin protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of HD patients and model mice, demonstrating that mutant huntingtin levels in cerebrospinal fluid reflect brain levels, increasing with disease stage and decreasing following brain huntingtin suppression.

Englisch: Being one of the most common genetic neurodegenerative disease, Huntington's disease has been a model disease - also for gene therapy. Among the various options, the development of antisense oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus. Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene therapy against Huntington's disease.",

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease affect any part of the brain. The complete mechanism of ND is unknown, but there are some molecular mechanism and chemical process. Natural compounds have better compatibility with the human body along with lesser side effects. Moreover, several studies showed that various natural compounds have significant neuroprotective, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for treating the different type of ND. In ND, natural compounds act by various mechanisms such as preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating destructed biomolecules before their accumulation affects cell metabolism, and improving the disease conditions. But due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) layer and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds, their delivery into the brain is limited. To minimize this problem and enhance drug delivery into the brain with an effective therapeutic dose, there is a need to develop a practical novel approach. The various studies showed that nanoformulations and microneedles (MN) containing natural compounds such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, chrysin, piperine, ferulic acid, huperzine A, berberine, baicalein, hesperetin, and retinoic acid effectively improved many ND. In this review, the effect of such natural drug-loaded nanoformulation and MN patches on ND management is discussed, along with their merits and demerits. This review aims to introduce different novel approaches for enhancing natural drug delivery into the brain to manage various neurodegenerative diseases.",

INTRODUCTION: While individuals with Huntington disease (HD) show memory impairment that indicates hippocampal dysfunction, the available literature does not consistently identify structural evidence for involvement of the whole hippocampus but rather suggests that hippocampal atrophy may be confined to certain hippocampal subregions. METHODS: We processed T1-weighted MRI from IMAGE-HD study using FreeSurfer 7.0 and compared the volumes of the hippocampal subfields among 36 early motor symptomatic (symp-HD), 40 pre-symptomatic (pre-HD), and 36 healthy control individuals across three timepoints over 36 months. RESULTS: Mixed-model analyses revealed significantly lower subfield volumes in symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and control groups, in the subicular regions of the perforant-pathway: presubiculum, subiculum, dentate gyrus, tail, and right molecular layer. These adjoining subfields aggregated into a single principal component, which demonstrated an accelerated rate of atrophy in the symp-HD. Volumes between pre-HD and controls did not show any significant difference. In the combined HD groups, CAG repeat length and disease burden score were associated with presubiculum, molecular layer, tail, and perforant-pathway subfield volumes. Hippocampal left tail and perforant-pathway subfields were associated with motor onset in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal subfields atrophy in early symptomatic HD affects key regions of the perforant-pathway, which may implicate the distinctive memory impairment at this stage of illness. Their volumetric associations with genetic and clinical markers suggest the selective susceptibility of these subfields to mutant Huntingtin and disease progression.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) and involves a complex web of pathogenic mechanisms. Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.",

Englisch: Being one of the most common genetic neurodegenerative disease, Huntington's disease has been a model disease - also for gene therapy. Among the various options, the development of antisense oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus. Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene therapy against Huntington's disease.",

                    "text": "Using Actiwatch to monitor circadian rhythm disturbance in Huntington' disease: A cautionary note. Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is well recognised as producing progressive deterioration of motor function, including dyskinetic movements, as well as deterioration of cognition and ability to carry out activities of daily living. However, individuals with HD commonly suffer from a wide range of additional symptoms, including weight loss and sleep disturbance, possibly due to disruption of circadian rhythmicity. Disrupted circadian rhythms have been reported in mice models of HD and in humans with HD. One way of assessing an individual's circadian rhythmicity in a community setting is to monitor their sleep/wake cycles, and a convenient method for recording periods of wakefulness and sleep is to use accelerometers to discriminate between varied activity levels (including sleep) during daily life. Here we used Actiwatch( ) Activity monitors alongside ambulatory EEG and sleep diaries to record wake/sleep patterns in people with HD and normal volunteers. We report that periods of wakefulness during the night, as detected by activity monitors, agreed poorly with EEG recordings in HD subjects, and unsurprisingly sleep diary findings showed poor agreement with both EEG recordings and activity monitor derived sleep periods. One explanation for this is the occurrence of 'break through' involuntary movements during sleep in the HD patients, which are incorrectly assessed as wakeful periods by the activity monitor algorithms. Thus, care needs to be taken when using activity monitors to assess circadian activity in individuals with movement disorders.",

                    "text": "Current status of PET imaging in Huntington's disease. PURPOSE: To review the developments of recent decades and the current status of PET molecular imaging in Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: A systematic review of PET studies in HD was performed. The MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus databases were searched for articles in all languages published up to 19 August 2015 using the major medical subject heading \"Huntington Disease\" combined with text and key words \"Huntington Disease\", \"Neuroimaging\" and \"PET\". Only peer-reviewed, primary research studies in HD patients and premanifest HD carriers, and studies in which clinical features were described in association with PET neuroimaging results, were included in this review. Reviews, case reports and nonhuman studies were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 54 PET studies were identified and analysed in this review. Brain metabolism ([(18)F]FDG and [(15)O]H2O), presynaptic ([(18)F]fluorodopa, [(11)C]beta-CIT and [(11)C]DTBZ) and postsynaptic ([(11)C]SCH22390, [(11)C]FLB457 and [(11)C]raclopride) dopaminergic function, phosphodiesterases ([(18)F]JNJ42259152, [(18)F]MNI-659 and [(11)C]IMA107), and adenosine ([(18)F]CPFPX), cannabinoid ([(18)F]MK-9470), opioid ([(11)C]diprenorphine) and GABA ([(11)C]flumazenil) receptors were evaluated as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and for assessing the development and efficacy of novel disease-modifying drugs in premanifest HD carriers and HD patients. PET studies evaluating brain restoration and neuroprotection were also identified and described in detail. CONCLUSION: Brain metabolism, postsynaptic dopaminergic function and phosphodiesterase 10A levels were proven to be powerful in assessing disease progression. However, no single technique may be currently considered an optimal biomarker and an integrative multimodal imaging approach combining different techniques should be developed for monitoring potential neuroprotective and preventive treatment in HD.",

The present study determines whether vascular function is altered in HD and characterizes the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The brain vessel density and vascular reactivity (VR) to carbogen challenge of HD mice were monitored by 3D DeltaR2 -mMRA and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)/flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively.

RESULTS: Expression of mHTT in astrocytes and neurons is sufficient to increase the brain vessel density in HD mice. BOLD and FAIR MRI revealed gradually impaired VR to carbogen in HD mice. Astrocytes from HD mice and patients contained more VEGF-A, which triggers proliferation of endothelial cells and may be responsible for the augmented neurovascular changes. Moreover, an astrocytic inflammatory response, which reduces the survival of pericytes through an IkappaB kinase-dependent pathway, mediates the low pericyte coverage of blood vessels in HD brains.

Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies in Huntington disease (HD) have suggested a role for the cerebellum. Our goal was to perform a detailed evaluation of cerebellar morphology. We performed the Unified HD rating scale (UHDRS) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) in 26 HD patients and 26 healthy controls. We created a two-sample test to analyze cerebellar gray matter (GM) differences between groups and another to correlate GM alterations with UHDRS and MOCA, corrected for age, expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats, and disease duration using the spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT)-SPM-toolbox which preserves anatomical detailing. We found increased GM density in the anterior cerebellum compared to controls. Higher GM density in the postero-superior lobe correlated with mood symptoms. Worse motor function and better cognitive function correlated with GM changes in the posterior cerebellum (false discovery rate (FDR) correction p < 0.05 and k > 100 voxels). In this detailed study of the in vivo cerebellar morphology in HD, we observed GM changes in regions involved in sensorimotor integration, motor planning, and emotional processing, supporting cerebellar involvement in the neuropathological process of HD.",

OBJECTIVES: People with Huntington's disease (HD) experience poor social quality of life, relationship breakdown, and social withdrawal, which are mediated to some extent by socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy and disinhibition. Social cognitive symptoms, such as impaired emotion recognition, also occur in HD, however, the extent of their association with these socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms is unknown. Our study examined the relationship between emotion recognition and symptom ratings of apathy and disinhibition in HD. METHODS: Thirty-two people with premanifest or symptomatic-HD completed Part 1 of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT), which is a facial emotion recognition task. In addition, we obtained severity ratings for apathy and disinhibition on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) from a close family member. Our analyses used motor symptom severity as a proxy for disease progression. RESULTS: Emotion recognition performance was significantly associated with family-ratings of apathy, above and beyond their shared association with disease severity. We found a similar pattern for disinhibition ratings, which fell short of statistical significance. As expected, worse emotion recognition performance was correlated with higher severity in FrSBe symptom ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emotion recognition abilities relate to key socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. Our results help to understand the functional significance of emotion recognition impairments in HD, and may have implications for the development of remediation programs aimed at improving patients' social quality of life.

The role of rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

Many Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers already have cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in the premanifest (premotor) phase of the disease (pre-HD), but the molecular underpinnings of these symptoms are not well understood. Previous work has shown reduced availability of the cerebral type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) in manifest HD. Here, we investigated whether CB1R binding is related to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in pre-HD mutation carriers. Methods: CB1R binding was measured with 18F-MK-9470 (N-[(2S,3S)-3-(3-cyanophenyl)-4-(4-ethoxyphenyl)butan-2-yl]-2-methyl-2-(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)oxypropanamide) PET in 15 pre-HD subjects (8 men, 7 women; age, 39.3 +- 9.9 y), 15 gene-negative controls from HD families (9 men, 6 women; age, 37.0 +- 10.6 y), and 12 community controls (6 men and 6 women; age, 39.9 +- 15.1 y). All subjects also underwent extensive assessment of motor and cognitive function, as well as a behavioral test battery including the Problem Behavior Assessment for HD (PBA-HD), and MRI. Parametric binding images of 18F-MK-9470 were corrected for partial-volume effect. Results: There was no difference in CB1R binding, gray matter volume, cognitive function, or psychiatric scores between gene-negative controls from HD families and community controls, which were therefore pooled to one control group. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects showed striatal atrophy, a decrease in CB1R binding in the prefrontal cortex, and higher PBA-HD scores on depression, apathy, and irritability (range, P = 0.01-0.005). The PBA-HD scores inversely correlated with CB1R binding in prefrontal regions and cingulate cortex in pre-HD (range: r = -0.64 to -0.72; P = 0.01-0.008). Conclusion: The association between behavioral symptoms and reduced prefrontal CB1R levels may provide new insight into the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pre-HD and suggest new therapeutic avenues.",

Recent studies suggest that neurodegenerative diseases could affect brain structure and function in disease-specific network patterns; however, how spontaneous activity affects structural covariance network (SC) is not clear. We hypothesized that hyper-excitability in Huntington disease (HD) disrupts the coordinated structural and functional connectivity, and treatment with memantine helps to reduce excitotoxicity and normalize the connectivity. MRI was conducted to measure somatosensory activation, resting-state functional-connectivity (rsFC), SC, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and ALFF covariance (ALFFC) in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. We found somatosensory activation was unchanged but the subcortical ALFF was increased in HD mice, indicating subcortical but not cortical hyperactivity. The reduced sensorimotor rsFC but spared hippocampal and default mode networks in the HD mice was consistent with the more pronounced impairment in motor function compared with cognitive performance. The disease suppressed SC globally and reduced ALFFC in the basal ganglia network as well as its anti-correlation with the default mode network. By comparing these connectivity measures, we found that the originally coupled rsFC-SC relationship was impaired whereas SC-ALFFC correlation was increased by HD, suggesting disease facilitated covariation of brain volume and activity amplitude but not neural synchrony. The comparison with mono-synaptic axonal projection supports the hypothesis that rsFC, but not SC or ALFFC, is highly dependent on structural connectivity under healthy conditions. Treatment with memantine had a strong effect on normalizing the SC and reducing ALFF while slightly increasing other connectivity measures and restoring the rsFC-SC coupling, which is consistent with its effect on alleviating hyper-excitability and improving the coordinated neural growth. These results indicate that HD affects the cerebral structure-function relationship which could be partially reverted by NMDA antagonism. These connectivity measures provide unique insights into pathological and pharmaceutical effects in brain circuitry, and could be translatable biomarkers for evaluating drug effect and refining its efficacy.",

                    "text": "Abnormal brain development in child and adolescent carriers of mutant huntingtin. OBJECTIVE: The huntingtin gene is critical for the formation and differentiation of the CNS, which raises questions about the neurodevelopmental effect of CAG expansion mutations within this gene (mHTT) that cause Huntington disease (HD). We sought to test the hypothesis that child and adolescent carriers of mHTT exhibit different brain growth compared to peers without the mutation by conducting structural MRI in youth who are at risk for HD. We also explored whether the length of CAG expansion affects brain development. METHODS: Children and adolescents (age 6-18) with a parent or grandparent diagnosed with HD underwent MRI and blinded genetic testing to confirm the presence or absence of mHTT. Seventy-five individuals were gene-expanded (GE) and 97 individuals were gene-nonexpanded (GNE). The GE group was estimated to be on average 35 years from clinical onset. Following an accelerated longitudinal design, age-related changes in brain regions were estimated. RESULTS: Age-related striatal volume changes differed significantly between the GE and GNE groups, with initial hypertrophy and more rapid volume decline in GE. This pattern was exaggerated with CAG expansion length for CAG > 50. A similar age-dependent group difference was observed for the globus pallidus, but not in other major regions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pathogenesis of HD begins with abnormal brain development. An understanding of potential neurodevelopmental features associated with mHTT may be needed for optimized implementation of preventative gene silencing therapies, such that normal aspects of neurodevelopment are preserved as neurodegeneration is forestalled.",

                    "text": "Brain structure in juvenile-onset Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess brain morphometry in a sample of patients with juvenile-onset Huntington disease (JOHD) and several mouse models of Huntington disease (HD) that likely represent the human JOHD phenotype. METHODS: Despite sharing the mutation in the Huntingtin gene, adult-onset HD characteristically presents as a hyperkinetic motor disorder, while JOHD typically presents as a hypokinetic motor disease. The University of Iowa Kids-JHD program enrolls individuals 5 to 25 years of age who have already received the clinical diagnosis. A total of 19 children with juvenile HD (JHD) (mean CAG = 72) were studied. Patients with JHD were compared to healthy controls (n = 234) using a cross-sectional study design. Volumetric data from structural MRI was compared between groups. In addition, we used the same procedure to evaluate brain morphology of R6/2, zQ175, HdhQ250 HD mice models. RESULTS: Participants with JHD had substantially reduced intracranial volumes. After controlling for the small intracranial volume size, the volumes of subcortical regions (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus) and of cortical white matter were significantly decreased in patients with JHD. However, the cerebellum was proportionately enlarged in the JHD sample. The cerebral cortex was largely unaffected. Likewise, HD mice had a lower volume of striatum and a higher volume of cerebellum, mirroring the human MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: The primary pathology of JOHD extends beyond changes in the striatal volume. Brain morphology in both mice and human patients with JHD shows proportional cerebellar enlargement. This pattern of brain changes may explain the unique picture of hypokinetic motor symptoms in JHD, which is not seen in the hyperkinetic chorea-like phenotype of adult-onset HD.",

Movement disorders and neurodegenerative diseases are a variety of conditions that involve progressive neuronal degeneration, injury, or death. Establishing the correct diagnosis of a movement disorder or neurodegenerative process can be difficult due to the variable features of these conditions, unusual clinical presentations, and overlapping symptoms and characteristics. MRI has an important role in the initial assessment of these patients, although a combination of imaging and laboratory and genetic tests is often needed for complete evaluation and management. This document summarizes the imaging appropriateness data for rapidly progressive dementia, chorea, Parkinsonian syndromes, suspected neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, and suspected motor neuron disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

                    "text": "Selective perforant-pathway atrophy in Huntington disease: MRI analysis of hippocampal subfields. INTRODUCTION: While individuals with Huntington disease (HD) show memory impairment that indicates hippocampal dysfunction, the available literature does not consistently identify structural evidence for involvement of the whole hippocampus but rather suggests that hippocampal atrophy may be confined to certain hippocampal subregions. METHODS: We processed T1-weighted MRI from IMAGE-HD study using FreeSurfer 7.0 and compared the volumes of the hippocampal subfields among 36 early motor symptomatic (symp-HD), 40 pre-symptomatic (pre-HD), and 36 healthy control individuals across three timepoints over 36 months. RESULTS: Mixed-model analyses revealed significantly lower subfield volumes in symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and control groups, in the subicular regions of the perforant-pathway: presubiculum, subiculum, dentate gyrus, tail, and right molecular layer. These adjoining subfields aggregated into a single principal component, which demonstrated an accelerated rate of atrophy in the symp-HD. Volumes between pre-HD and controls did not show any significant difference. In the combined HD groups, CAG repeat length and disease burden score were associated with presubiculum, molecular layer, tail, and perforant-pathway subfield volumes. Hippocampal left tail and perforant-pathway subfields were associated with motor onset in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal subfields atrophy in early symptomatic HD affects key regions of the perforant-pathway, which may implicate the distinctive memory impairment at this stage of illness. Their volumetric associations with genetic and clinical markers suggest the selective susceptibility of these subfields to mutant Huntingtin and disease progression.",

OBJECTIVE: To define the role played by microglia in different stages of Huntington disease (HD), we used the TSPO radioligand [11C]-ER176 and PET to evaluate microglial activation in relation to neurodegeneration and in relation to the clinical features seen at premanifest and manifest stages of the disease. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study in which 18 subjects (6 controls, 6 premanifest, and 6 manifest HD gene carriers) underwent a [11C]-ER176 PET scan and an MRI for anatomic localization. Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) was performed, and group differences in [11C]-ER176 binding (used to evaluate the extent of microglial activation) were assessed by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Microglial activation was correlated with ROIs volumes, disease burden, and the scores obtained in the clinical scales. As an exploratory aim, we evaluated the dynamic functions of microglia in vitro, by using induced microglia-like (iMG) cells from peripheral blood monocytes. RESULTS: Individuals with manifest HD present higher [11C]-ER176 SUVR in both globi pallidi and putamina in comparison with controls. No differences were observed when we compared premanifest HD with controls or with manifest HD. We also found a significant correlation between increased microglial activation and cumulative disease burden, and with reduced volumes. iMG from controls, premanifest HD, and manifest HD patients showed similar phagocytic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data demonstrate that microglial activation is involved in HD pathophysiology and is associated with disease progression.",

BACKGROUND: Gray matter (GM) atrophy in the striatum and across the brain is a consistently reported feature of the Huntington Disease (HD) prodrome. More recently, widespread prodromal white matter (WM) degradation has also been detected. However, longitudinal WM studies are limited and conflicting, and most analyses comparing WM and clinical functioning have also been cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: We simultaneously assessed changes in WM and cognitive and motor functioning at various prodromal HD stages. METHODS: Data from 1,336 (1,047 prodromal, 289 control) PREDICT-HD participants were analyzed (3,700 sessions). MRI images were used to create GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid probability maps. Using source-based morphometry, independent component analysis was applied to WM probability maps to extract covarying spatial patterns and their subject profiles. WM profiles were analyzed in two sets of linear mixed model (LMM) analyses: one to compare WM profiles across groups cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and one to concurrently compare WM profiles and clinical variables cross-sectionally and longitudinally within each group. RESULTS: Findings illustrate widespread prodromal changes in GM-adjacent-WM, with premotor, supplementary motor, middle frontal and striatal changes early in the prodrome that subsequently extend sub-gyrally with progression. Motor functioning agreed most with WM until the near-onset prodromal stage, when Stroop interference was the best WM indicator. Across groups, Trail-Making Test part A outperformed other cognitive variables in its similarity to WM, particularly cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that distinct regions coincide with cognitive compared to motor functioning. Furthermore, at different prodromal stages, distinct regions appear to align best with clinical functioning. Thus, the informativeness of clinical measures may vary according to the type of data available (cross-sectional or longitudinal) as well as age and CAG-number.",

Extrapyramidal movement disorders, for instance, are a rare manifestation of vitamin B12 deficiency. MRI of the brain frequently remains without conclusive findings. However, 18 F-FDG PET/CT may reveal characteristic changes in the metabolism of the basal ganglia and thus contribute to an accurate diagnosis. We demonstrate the case of a woman with left-sided hemichoreatic movements due to vitamin B12 deficiency showing a contralateral putaminal hypermetabolism, which normalized after vitamin B12 supplementation, ruling out other deviating causes, particularly Huntington disease.",

                    "text": "Association of Dilated Perivascular Spaces and Disease Severity in Patients With Huntington Disease. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the percent volume of dilated perivascular space (PVS) in the subcortical forebrain in patients with early Huntington disease (HD) and to explore the relationship between PVS and disease severity. METHODS: MRI scans were performed on 25 patients with HD and 23 healthy age-matched controls at Massachusetts General Hospital. The imaging data were analyzed with a novel algorithm to determine regional PVS volume. A fractional logistic regression analysis was used to quantify the association between regional percent PVS volume and (1) disease designation (HD or control) and (2) disease severity as assessed by normalized caudate volume. RESULTS: Patients with HD had the greatest percent volume of dilated PVS in the putamen (left putamen: odds ratio 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-2.62], HD 3.27% [95% CI 2.83-3.78] vs controls 1.62% [95% CI 1.32-1.97], p fdr < 0.001; right putamen: odds ratio 1.66 [95% CI 1.33-2.08], HD 3.43% [95% CI 2.94-4.01] vs controls 2.09% [95% CI 1.79-2.45], p fdr < 0.001) and several subcortical white matter regions compared to controls. Dilated PVS increased with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The objective quantification of dilated PVS suggests that PVS burden is high, is associated with disease severity, and may affect the distribution and success of treatments administered either intrathecally such as antisense oligonucleotides or by intraparenchymal administration such as cell and gene therapies. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that increased dilated PVS is associated with worse HD severity. The study is rated Class II because of the cross-sectional design.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatment is available. A better understanding of the pathology, and identification of biomarkers will facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments. HD is potentially a good model of a neurodegenerative disease for development of biomarkers because it is an autosomal-dominant disease with complete penetrance, caused by a single gene mutation, in which the neurodegenerative process can be assessed many years before onset of signs and symptoms of manifest disease. Previous MRI studies have detected abnormalities in gray and white matter starting in premanifest stages. However, the understanding of how these abnormalities are related, both in time and space, is still incomplete. In this study, we combined deep gray matter shape diffeomorphometry and white matter DTI analysis in order to provide a better mapping of pathology in the deep gray matter and subcortical white matter in premanifest HD. We used 296 MRI scans from the PREDICT-HD database. Atrophy in the deep gray matter, thalamus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens was analyzed by surface based morphometry, and while white matter abnormalities were analyzed in (i) regions of interest surrounding these structures, using (ii) tractography-based analysis, and using (iii) whole brain atlas-based analysis. We detected atrophy in the deep gray matter, particularly in putamen, from early premanifest stages. The atrophy was greater both in extent and effect size in cases with longer exposure to the effects of the CAG expansion mutation (as assessed by greater CAP-scores), and preceded detectible abnormalities in the white matter. Near the predicted onset of manifest HD, the MD increase was widespread, with highest indices in the deep and posterior white matter. This type of in-vivo macroscopic mapping of HD brain abnormalities can potentially indicate when and where therapeutics could be targeted to delay the onset or slow the disease progression. ",

OBJECTIVE: After MRI studies suggested the efficacy of ethyl-EPA in reducing the progressive brain atrophy in Huntington disease (HD), trials were conducted to test its efficacy as a treatment for HD. Trials that continued for 6 months did not find any significant improvement, urging discontinuation of the drug. However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of motor functions in these patients. METHODS: We searched 12 electronic databases to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening, only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score-4 in both fixed and quality effect models [MD = -2.720, 95% CI (-4.76, -.68), p = 0.009; MD = -2.225, 95% CI (-3.842, -0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score showed significant results [MD = -1.013, 95% CI (-1.793, -0.233), p = 0.011] in only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming test or symbol digit modality. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement of motor scores only after 12 months. These results should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies had assessed the efficacy of ethyl-EPA after 12 months with one of them having a 6-month open-label phase.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q, n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001). No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically. Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.",

Synaptic structure and function are compromised prior to cell death and symptom onset in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In Huntington disease (HD), a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein results in a presymptomatic stage that typically spans multiple decades and is followed by striking degeneration of striatal tissue and the progression of debilitating motor symptoms. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that the HD presymptomatic window is associated with injurious effects to striatal synapses, many of which appear to be prerequisites to subsequent cell death. While the striatum is the most vulnerable region in the HD brain, it is widely recognized that HD is a brain-wide disease, affecting numerous extrastriatal regions that contribute to debilitating non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction. Currently, we have a poor understanding of the synaptic integrity, or lack thereof, in extrastriatal regions in the presymptomatic HD brain. If early therapeutic intervention seeks to maintain healthy synaptic function, it is important to understand early HD-associated synaptopathy at a brain-wide, rather than striatal-exclusive, level. Here, we focused on the hippocampus as this structure is generally thought to be affected only in manifest HD despite the subtle cognitive deficits known to emerge in prodromal HD. We used super-resolution microscopy and multi-electrode array electrophysiology as sensitive measures of excitatory synapse structure and function, respectively, in the hippocampus of presymptomatic heterozygous HD mice (Q175FDN model). We found clear evidence for enhanced AMPA receptor subunit clustering and hyperexcitability well before the onset of a detectable HD-like behavioral phenotype. In addition, activity-dependent re-organization of synaptic protein nanostructure, and functional measures of synaptic plasticity were impaired in presymptomatic HD mice. These data demonstrate that synaptic abnormalities in the presymptomatic HD brain are not exclusive to the striatum, and highlight the need to better understand the region-dependent complexities of early synaptopathy in the HD brain.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

Huntington disease (HD) is most widely known for its selective degeneration of striatal neurons but there is also growing evidence for white matter (WM) deterioration. The primary objective of this research was to conduct a large-scale analysis using multisite diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) tractography data to quantify diffusivity properties along major prefrontal cortex WM tracts in prodromal HD. Fifteen international sites participating in the PREDICT-HD study collected imaging and neuropsychological data on gene-positive HD participants without a clinical diagnosis (i.e., prodromal) and gene-negative control participants. The anatomical prefrontal WM tracts of the corpus callosum (PFCC), anterior thalamic radiations (ATRs), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFO), and uncinate fasciculi (UNC) were identified using streamline tractography of DWI. Within each of these tracts, tensor scalars for fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity coefficients were calculated. We divided prodromal HD subjects into three CAG-age product (CAP) groups having Low, Medium, or High probabilities of onset indexed by genetic exposure. We observed significant differences in WM properties for each of the four anatomical tracts for the High CAP group in comparison to controls. Additionally, the Medium CAP group presented differences in the ATR and IFO in comparison to controls. Furthermore, WM alterations in the PFCC, ATR, and IFO showed robust associations with neuropsychological measures of executive functioning. These results suggest long-range tracts essential for cross-region information transfer show early vulnerability in HD and may explain cognitive problems often present in the prodromal stage.

BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease affect any part of the brain. The complete mechanism of ND is unknown, but there are some molecular mechanism and chemical process. Natural compounds have better compatibility with the human body along with lesser side effects. Moreover, several studies showed that various natural compounds have significant neuroprotective, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for treating the different type of ND. In ND, natural compounds act by various mechanisms such as preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating destructed biomolecules before their accumulation affects cell metabolism, and improving the disease conditions. But due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) layer and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds, their delivery into the brain is limited. To minimize this problem and enhance drug delivery into the brain with an effective therapeutic dose, there is a need to develop a practical novel approach. The various studies showed that nanoformulations and microneedles (MN) containing natural compounds such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, chrysin, piperine, ferulic acid, huperzine A, berberine, baicalein, hesperetin, and retinoic acid effectively improved many ND. In this review, the effect of such natural drug-loaded nanoformulation and MN patches on ND management is discussed, along with their merits and demerits. This review aims to introduce different novel approaches for enhancing natural drug delivery into the brain to manage various neurodegenerative diseases.",

Cognitive, motor and psychiatric changes in prodromal Huntington's disease have nurtured the emergent need for early interventions. Preventive clinical trials for Huntington's disease, however, are limited by a shortage of suitable measures that could serve as surrogate outcomes. Measures of intrinsic functional connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging are of keen interest. Yet recent studies suggest circumscribed abnormalities in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity in prodromal Huntington's disease, despite the spectrum of behavioural changes preceding a manifest diagnosis. The present study used two complementary analytical approaches to examine whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity in prodromal Huntington's disease. Network topology was studied using graph theory and simple functional connectivity amongst brain regions was explored using the network-based statistic. Participants consisted of gene-negative controls (n = 16) and prodromal Huntington's disease individuals (n = 48) with various stages of disease progression to examine the influence of disease burden on intrinsic connectivity. Graph theory analyses showed that global network interconnectivity approximated a random network topology as proximity to diagnosis neared and this was associated with decreased connectivity amongst highly-connected rich-club network hubs, which integrate processing from diverse brain regions. However, functional segregation within the global network (average clustering) was preserved. Functional segregation was also largely maintained at the local level, except for the notable decrease in the diversity of anterior insula intermodular-interconnections (participation coefficient), irrespective of disease burden. In contrast, network-based statistic analyses revealed patterns of weakened frontostriatal connections and strengthened frontal-posterior connections that evolved as disease burden increased. These disturbances were often related to long-range connections involving peripheral nodes and interhemispheric connections. A strong association was found between weaker connectivity and decreased rich-club organization, indicating that whole-brain simple connectivity partially expressed disturbances in the communication of highly-connected hubs. However, network topology and network-based statistic connectivity metrics did not correlate with key markers of executive dysfunction (Stroop Test, Trail Making Test) in prodromal Huntington's disease, which instead were related to whole-brain connectivity disturbances in nodes (right inferior parietal, right thalamus, left anterior cingulate) that exhibited multiple aberrant connections and that mediate executive control. Altogether, our results show for the first time a largely disease burden-dependent functional reorganization of whole-brain networks in prodromal Huntington's disease. Both analytic approaches provided a unique window into brain reorganization that was not related to brain atrophy or motor symptoms. Longitudinal studies currently in progress will chart the course of functional changes to determine the most sensitive markers of disease progression. ",

Network topology was studied using graph theory and simple functional connectivity amongst brain regions was explored using the network-based statistic. Participants consisted of gene-negative controls (n = 16) and prodromal Huntington's disease individuals (n = 48) with various stages of disease progression to examine the influence of disease burden on intrinsic connectivity. Graph theory analyses showed that global network interconnectivity approximated a random network topology as proximity to diagnosis neared and this was associated with decreased connectivity amongst highly-connected rich-club network hubs, which integrate processing from diverse brain regions. However, functional segregation within the global network (average clustering) was preserved. Functional segregation was also largely maintained at the local level, except for the notable decrease in the diversity of anterior insula intermodular-interconnections (participation coefficient), irrespective of disease burden. In contrast, network-based statistic analyses revealed patterns of weakened frontostriatal connections and strengthened frontal-posterior connections that evolved as disease burden increased. These disturbances were often related to long-range connections involving peripheral nodes and interhemispheric connections. A strong association was found between weaker connectivity and decreased rich-club organization, indicating that whole-brain simple connectivity partially expressed disturbances in the communication of highly-connected hubs. However, network topology and network-based statistic connectivity metrics did not correlate with key markers of executive dysfunction (Stroop Test, Trail Making Test) in prodromal Huntington's disease, which instead were related to whole-brain connectivity disturbances in nodes (right inferior parietal, right thalamus, left anterior cingulate) that exhibited multiple aberrant connections and that mediate executive control. Altogether, our results show for the first time a largely disease burden-dependent functional reorganization of whole-brain networks in prodromal Huntington's disease. Both analytic approaches provided a unique window into brain reorganization that was not related to brain atrophy or motor symptoms. Longitudinal studies currently in progress will chart the course of functional changes to determine the most sensitive markers of disease progression. ",

Conventional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging depicts important anatomic information and helps to identify imaging patterns which may support diagnosis of a specific motor disorder. Advanced imaging techniques can provide further detail regarding volume, functional, or metabolic changes occurring in nervous system pathology. This chapter is an overview of the advances in neuroimaging with particular emphasis on both standard and less well-known advanced imaging techniques and findings, such as diffusion tensor imaging or volumetric studies, and their application to specific motor disorders. In addition, it provides reference to emerging imaging biomarkers in motor system disorders such as Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease, and briefly reviews the neuroimaging findings in different causes of myelopathy and peripheral nerve disorders.",

Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a marker of brain atrophy and predictor of disease progression in rare diseases such as Huntington Disease, but also in more common neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to measure NfL longitudinally in autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and establish correlation with clinical and imaging parameters. We enrolled 62 pathological expansions carriers (17 SCA1, 13 SCA2, 19 SCA3, and 13 SCA7) and 19 age-matched controls in a prospective biomarker study between 2011 and 2015 and followed for 24 months at the Paris Brain Institute. We performed neurological examination, brain 3 T MRI and plasma NfL measurements using an ultrasensitive single-molecule array at baseline and at the two-year follow-up visit. We evaluated NfL correlations with ages, CAG repeat sizes, clinical scores and volumetric brain MRIs. NfL levels were significantly higher in SCAs than controls at both time points (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted NfL levels were significantly correlated at baseline with clinical scores (p < 0.01). We identified optimal NfL cut-off concentrations to differentiate controls from carriers for each genotype (SCA1 16.87 pg/mL, SCA2, 19.1 pg/mL, SCA3 16.04 pg/mL, SCA7 16.67 pg/mL). For all SCAs, NfL concentration was stable over two years (p = 0.95) despite a clinical progression (p < 0.0001). Clinical progression between baseline and follow-up was associated with higher NfL concentrations at baseline (p = 0.04). Of note, all premanifest carriers with NfL levels close to cut off concentrations had signs of the disease at follow-up. For all SCAs, the higher the observed NfL, the lower the pons volume at baseline (p < 0.01) and follow-up (p = 0.02). Higher NfL levels at baseline in all SCAs predicted a decrease in cerebellar volume (p = 0.03). This result remained significant for SCA2 only among all genotypes (p = 0.02). Overall, plasma NfL levels at baseline in SCA expansion carriers predict cerebellar volume change and clinical score progression. NfL levels might help refine inclusion criteria for clinical trials in carriers with very subtle signs.",

PURPOSE: To review the developments of recent decades and the current status of PET molecular imaging in Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: A systematic review of PET studies in HD was performed. The MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus databases were searched for articles in all languages published up to 19 August 2015 using the major medical subject heading \"Huntington Disease\" combined with text and key words \"Huntington Disease\", \"Neuroimaging\" and \"PET\". Only peer-reviewed, primary research studies in HD patients and premanifest HD carriers, and studies in which clinical features were described in association with PET neuroimaging results, were included in this review. Reviews, case reports and nonhuman studies were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 54 PET studies were identified and analysed in this review. Brain metabolism ([(18)F]FDG and [(15)O]H2O), presynaptic ([(18)F]fluorodopa, [(11)C]beta-CIT and [(11)C]DTBZ) and postsynaptic ([(11)C]SCH22390, [(11)C]FLB457 and [(11)C]raclopride) dopaminergic function, phosphodiesterases ([(18)F]JNJ42259152, [(18)F]MNI-659 and [(11)C]IMA107), and adenosine ([(18)F]CPFPX), cannabinoid ([(18)F]MK-9470), opioid ([(11)C]diprenorphine) and GABA ([(11)C]flumazenil) receptors were evaluated as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and for assessing the development and efficacy of novel disease-modifying drugs in premanifest HD carriers and HD patients. PET studies evaluating brain restoration and neuroprotection were also identified and described in detail. CONCLUSION: Brain metabolism, postsynaptic dopaminergic function and phosphodiesterase 10A levels were proven to be powerful in assessing disease progression. However, no single technique may be currently considered an optimal biomarker and an integrative multimodal imaging approach combining different techniques should be developed for monitoring potential neuroprotective and preventive treatment in HD.",

Although much prior work has focused on the basal ganglia and cortical pathology that defines Huntington's disease (HD), recent studies have also begun to characterize cerebral white matter damage (Rosas et al., 2006; Dumas et al., 2012; Poudel et al., 2014). In this study, we investigated differences in the large fascicular bundles of the cerebral white matter of gene-positive HD carriers, including pre-manifest individuals and early symptomatic patients, using recently developed diffusion tractography procedures. We examined eighteen major fiber bundles in 37 patients with early HD (average age 55.2 +- 11.5, 14 male, 23 female), 31 gene-positive, motor negative pre-symptomatic HD (PHD) (average age 48.1 +- 11.5, 13 male, 18 female), and 38 healthy age-matched controls (average age 55.7 +- 8.6, 14 male, 24 female), using the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) procedure available as part of the FreeSurfer image processing software package. We calculated the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean radial (RD) and axial diffusivities (AD) for each fiber bundle. We also evaluated the relationships between diffusion measures, cognition and regional cortical thinning. We found that early changes in RD of select tracts in PHD subjects were associated with impaired performance on neuropsychological tests, suggesting that early changes in myelin might underlie early cognitive dysfunction. Finally, we found that increases in AD of select tracts were associated with regionally select cortical thinning of areas known to atrophy in HD, including the sensorimotor, supramarginal and fusiform gyrus, suggesting that AD may be reflecting pyramidal cell degeneration in HD. Together, these results suggest that white matter microstructural changes in HD reflect a complex, clinically relevant and dynamic process.",

                    "text": "Recombinant Antibody Fragments for Neurodegenerative Diseases. BACKGROUND: Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length immunoglobulins and offer important advantages compared with conventional monoclonal antibodies: extreme specificity, higher affinity, superior stability and solubility, reduced immunogenicity as well as easy and inexpensive large-scale production. OBJECTIVE: In this article we will review and discuss recombinant antibodies that are being evaluated for neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical models and in clinical studies and will summarize new strategies that are being developed to optimize their stability, specificity and potency for advancing their use. METHODS: Articles describing recombinant antibody fragments used for neurological diseases were selected (PubMed) and evaluated for their significance. RESULTS: Different antibody formats such as single-chain fragment variable (scFv), single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs or sdAbs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), intrabodies and nanobodies, are currently being studied in pre-clinical models of cancer as well as infectious and autoimmune diseases and many of them are being tested as therapeutics in clinical trials. Immunotherapy approaches have shown therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of Alzheimer s disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington disease (HD), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that recombinant antibody fragments may neutralize toxic extra- and intracellular misfolded proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, DLB, FTD, HD or TSEs and may target toxic immune cells participating in the pathogenesis of MS. CONCLUSION: Recombinant antibody fragments represent a promising tool for the development of antibody-based immunotherapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the approach to chorea in clinical practice, beginning with a discussion of the phenomenologic features of chorea and how to differentiate it from other movement disorders. The diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas, and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats are included. RECENT FINDINGS: C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including NKX2-1, ADCY5, GNAO1, and PDE10A. New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing. SUMMARY: Clinical features remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.",

                    "text": "Tetrabenazine Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Chorea Associated with Huntington Disease: A Retrospective Chart Review. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

OBJECTIVE: With a shift towards noninvasive testing, we have explored and validated the use of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Fifteen couples have been included, assessing a total of n = 20 pregnancies. Fetal paternally inherited CAG repeat length was determined in total cell-free DNA from maternal plasma using a direct approach by PCR and subsequent fragment analysis. RESULTS: All fetal HD (n = 7) and intermediate (n = 3) CAG repeats could be detected in maternal plasma. Detection of repeats in the normal range (n = 10) was successful in n = 5 cases where the paternal repeat size could be distinguished from maternal repeat patterns after fragment analysis. In all other cases (n = 5), the paternal peaks coincided with the maternal peak pattern. All NIPD results were concordant with results from routine diagnostics on fetal genomic DNA from chorionic villi. CONCLUSION: In this validation study, we demonstrated that all fetuses at risk for HD could be identified noninvasively in maternal plasma. Additionally, we have confirmed results from previously described case reports that NIPD for HD can be performed using a direct approach by PCR. For future diagnostics, parental CAG profiles can be used to predict the success rate for NIPD prior to testing.",

OBJECTIVE: Normalization to an appropriate reference region in F-FDG PET imaging may enhance diagnostic performance in Huntington disease (HD). We aimed to identify stable brain areas that could be used to model neurometabolic degeneration in HD correlating imaging (SUVrvalues at the basal ganglia [BBGG]) and clinical parameters (disease burden score [DBS]). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed brain F-FDG PET/CT in 38 manifest HD patients (meanage +- SD, 54 +- 14.3 years; CAGrepeats +- SD, 44.2 +- 3.1), 20 premanifest HD patients (meanage +- SD, 42.7 +- 11.7 years; CAGrepeats +- SD, 40 +- 3.8), and 18 healthy controls (NC; meanage +- SD, 45 +- 13.2 years). For quantitative analysis, we selected (a) defined reference regions from the Montreal Neurological Institute space atlas (pons, whole cerebellum, cerebral white matter, thalamus, and a pons-cerebellar vermis region of interest), and (b) reference clusters obtained by voxelwise statistical comparison across groups (P < 0.05 FWE; extent voxel threshold k = 200). Each candidate reference region and reference cluster was quantitatively assessed using imaging and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Comparing HD and NC groups, we obtained a reference cluster in the cerebellum, and in temporal and frontal lobes. Comparing manifest HD and premanifest HD patients, we observed reference clusters in the cerebellum, pons, thalamus, parietal lobe, and cuneus. The set of reference regions showed a significant correlation between SUVrvalues at the BBGG and DBS in all HD patients. In premanifest HD patients, the correlation between SUVrvalues at the BBGG and DBS was significant using the pons-cerebellar vermis region of interest, the thalamus as defined reference regions, and the pons and thalamus as reference clusters. In manifest HD patients, the correlation was significant using the temporal and white matter frontal lobe clusters. Variance between SUVrvalues in the set of reference regions and reference clusters was minimal within NC. CONCLUSIONS: The pons may be a stable and reliable region to calculate SUVrvalues to model the neurometabolic degeneration in quantitative F-FDG PET imaging in HD.",

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the most common subtype of SCA worldwide, is caused by mutation of CAG repeats expansion in ATXN3. Body mass index (BMI) is an important modulatory factor in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, its relevance in SCA3 is not well understood. In this study, BMI was investigated in 134 molecularly confirmed SCA3 patients and 136 healthy controls from China. The multivariable linear regression models were performed to establish the putative risk factors for BMI, and whether BMI could affect the severity of ataxia. We found that BMI was significantly lower in the case group than that in the control group. The age at onset (positive correlation) and severity of ataxia (negative correlation) were the risk factors affecting BMI. Conversely, BMI along with the disease duration, the age at onset, and the numbers of CAG repeats could also have influence on the severity of ataxia. In conclusion, SCA3 patients had lower BMI than matched controls and BMI is a predictor of disease progression in SCA3. Nutritional intervention to promote weight gain could be a promising strategy to impede SCA3 progression.",

BACKGROUND: Laquinimod is an oral immunomodulator in clinical development to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Laquinimod is in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Huntington Disease (HD). The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and cytoimmunologic effects following escalating doses of laquinimod in patients with RRMS. METHODS: One hundred twelve patients were randomly assigned to laquinimod/placebo in a series of separate dose-escalating cohorts starting from a daily oral dose of 0.9 mg/1.2 mg escalating to 2.7 mg, in 0.3 mg increments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 mg. No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported, which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9 mg). There was no increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses. Laquinimod-treated patients showed more abnormal laboratory levels in liver enzymes, P-amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, but most shifts were clinically non-significant.

The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and cytoimmunologic effects following escalating doses of laquinimod in patients with RRMS.

RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 mg. No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported, which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9 mg). There was no increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses.

                    "text": "Live-Cell Bioorthogonal Chemical Imaging: Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy of Vibrational Probes. Innovations in light microscopy have tremendously revolutionized the way researchers study biological systems with subcellular resolution. In particular, fluorescence microscopy with the expanding choices of fluorescent probes has provided a comprehensive toolkit to tag and visualize various molecules of interest with exquisite specificity and high sensitivity. Although fluorescence microscopy is currently the method of choice for cellular imaging, it faces fundamental limitations for studying the vast number of small biomolecules. This is because common fluorescent labels, which are relatively bulky, could introduce considerable perturbation to or even completely alter the native functions of vital small biomolecules. Hence, despite their immense functional importance, these small biomolecules remain largely undetectable by fluorescence microscopy. To address this challenge, a bioorthogonal chemical imaging platform has recently been introduced. By coupling stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, an emerging nonlinear Raman microscopy technique, with tiny and Raman-active vibrational probes (e.g., alkynes and stable isotopes), bioorthogonal chemical imaging exhibits superb sensitivity, specificity, and biocompatibility for imaging small biomolecules in live systems. In this Account, we review recent technical achievements for visualizing a broad spectrum of small biomolecules, including ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, amino acids, fatty acids, choline, glucose, cholesterol, and small-molecule drugs in live biological systems ranging from individual cells to animal tissues and model organisms. Importantly, this platform is compatible with live-cell biology, thus allowing real-time imaging of small-molecule dynamics. Moreover, we discuss further chemical and spectroscopic strategies for multicolor bioorthogonal chemical imaging, a valuable technique in the era of \"omics\". As a unique tool for biological discovery, this platform has been applied to studying various metabolic processes under both physiological and pathological states, including protein synthesis activity of neuronal systems, protein aggregations in Huntington disease models, glucose uptake in tumor xenografts, and drug penetration through skin tissues. We envision that the coupling of SRS microscopy with vibrational probes would do for small biomolecules what fluorescence microscopy of fluorophores has done for larger molecular species.",

Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.",

Recent studies have reported visual dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD). However, little is known about retinal structural changes in HD. METHODS: A total of 50 subjects, including 25 motor-manifest HD patients and 25 gender- and age-matched controls, were enrolled. Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Score-Motor part was assessed in HD patients. Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was used to evaluate the macular thickness and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). Superficial and deep capillary plexus densities were measured using OCT angiography (OCTA). To account for inter-eye correlation, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used. RESULTS: HD patients had a significant reduction in macular thickness in both inner and outer superior sectors and the inferior outer sector. Inferior pRNFLs were significantly decreased in thickness. There was no significant difference in retinal capillary plexus density between the two groups. Age and disease duration were negatively correlated with macular thickness in HD patients. However, the severity of motor involvement was not correlated with SD-OCT or OCTA parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We observed attenuated pRNFL and macular retinal thickness in patients with HD, independent of macular capillary plexus parameters. It can support the hypothesis that the retina may be a potential biomarker for monitoring the neurodegenerative process in HD.",

PURPOSE: To employ an off-resonance saturation method to measure the mineral-iron pool in the postmortem brain, which is an endogenous contrast agent that can give information on cellular iron status. METHODS: An off-resonance saturation acquisition protocol was implemented on a 7 Tesla preclinical scanner, and the contrast maps were fitted to an established analytical model. The method was validated by correlation and Bland-Altman analysis on a ferritin-containing phantom. Mineral-iron maps were obtained from postmortem tissue of patients with neurological diseases characterized by brain iron accumulation, that is, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and aceruloplasminemia, and validated with histology. Transverse relaxation rate and magnetic susceptibility values were used for comparison. RESULTS: In postmortem tissue, the mineral-iron contrast colocalizes with histological iron staining in all the cases. Iron concentrations obtained via the off-resonance saturation method are in agreement with literature. CONCLUSIONS: Off-resonance saturation is an effective way to detect iron in gray matter structures and partially mitigate for the presence of myelin. If a reference region with little iron is available in the tissue, the method can produce quantitative iron maps.

OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of one's gene status for adult onset conditions provides opportunity to make advance end-of-life (EOL) plans. The purposes of these analyses were to (1) determine the prevalence of EOL plans, including advance directives (ADs) among persons across 3 stages of Huntington disease (HD) and (2) examine factors associated with having ADs in this sample. METHODS: Data are from 503 participants in the HD Quality of Life study. Participants completed an online health-related quality-of-life survey that included questions regarding EOL planning and self-reported HD symptoms. Frequencies were calculated for EOL planning by the HD stage. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to identify variables associated with having ADs. RESULTS: A total of 38.2% of participants stated they had ADs and fewer than half had other EOL plans. Being older, increased HD stage, more years of education, lower anxiety, more swallowing symptoms, and higher meaning and purpose were associated with having ADs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ADs in our sample is comparable to the general US population, but surprisingly low, considering the severity and long disease course of HD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health-care providers should develop specific interventions early in the disease process to increase ADs in this population.",

Each of these GPCRs is coupled to multiple effector proteins mediating divergent cellular signals. The ligand bias of cannabinoid-targeted compounds is only beginning to be quantified. Research into cannabinoid bias is now revealing correlations between bias in cell culture and functional outcomes in vivo. We present an example study of cannabinoid bias in the context of Huntington disease. In future, an understanding of cannabinoid receptor structure and quantification of ligand bias will optimize drug selection matched to patient population and disease.",

Determination of mtDNA copy number in the cell is crucial to understand many cellular processes. Recently, the number of studies with the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content as the determinant of mitochondrial abnormalities increased greatly and is still growing, therefore, optimization of technical conditions for this analysis is crucial. Despite using similar laboratory protocols, some results cannot be compared between research centers, thus causing discrepancies in the assessment of mtDNA content. The aim of this work was to test which conditions of biological sample collection and storage affect estimation of mtDNA level relative to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) in the blood samples and dermal fibroblasts. We found that the time and temperature of sample storage, as well as the type of the blood sample (whole blood or leukocytes) influence the estimate of mtDNA/nDNA ratio in the blood. In the case of dermal fibroblasts collected from healthy control and Huntington disease patients, our data indicate that the passage number of cells is essential to obtain reliable results.",

BACKGROUND: Laquinimod is an oral immunomodulator in clinical development to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Laquinimod is in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Huntington Disease (HD). The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and cytoimmunologic effects following escalating doses of laquinimod in patients with RRMS. METHODS: One hundred twelve patients were randomly assigned to laquinimod/placebo in a series of separate dose-escalating cohorts starting from a daily oral dose of 0.9 mg/1.2 mg escalating to 2.7 mg, in 0.3 mg increments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 mg. No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported, which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9 mg). There was no increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses. Laquinimod-treated patients showed more abnormal laboratory levels in liver enzymes, P-amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, but most shifts were clinically non-significant. The exposure of laquinimod was dose proportional and linear in the tested dose range. An immunological substudy showed significant dose-dependent decreases in 6-sulpho LacNAc + dendritic cell (slanDC) frequency following laquinimod compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Laquinimod doses up to 2.7 mg were safely administered to patients with RRMS. An in vivo effect of laquinimod on the innate immune system was demonstrated.

In this randomized double-blind study, 4 groups of healthy subjects (50 per arm) participated to evaluate the effect of laquinimod, an oral treatment in development for multiple sclerosis and Huntington disease, on the QTc interval. Subjects received a dose of either 0.6 or 1.2 mg/day laquinimod for 14 days, placebo for 14 days, or 13 days of placebo followed by a dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin on day 14. Continuous 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded on day -1 (baseline) and days 14 to 17,  and quadruplicate electrocardiograms were extracted at predefined time points. The primary measure was time-matched change from baseline in individual QTc (QTcI), and an analysis of variance was conducted on the placebo-corrected change from baseline data (ddQTcI). Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and safety assessments were included. Results showed that the upper limits of the 2-sided 90%CI for ddQTcI for both laquinimod doses were below 10 millisconds at all time points, whereas lower limits for moxifloxacin were above 5 milliseconds. No notable changes in ECG parameters were observed. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis showed no positive correlation between laquinimod plasma levels and QTcI. In conclusion, laquinimod was not found to affect cardiac repolarization or to cause prolongation of QTcI at doses of 0.6 and 1.2 mg/day.",

Application of molecular neuroimaging using positron emission tomographic techniques to assess pediatric neurodegenerative disorders has been limited, unlike in adults where positron emission tomography has contributed to clinical diagnosis, monitoring of neurodegenerative disease progression, and assessment of novel therapeutic approaches. Yet, there is a huge unexplored potential of molecular imaging to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders in children and provide radiological biomarkers that can be applied clinically. The obstacles in performing PET scans on children include sedation, radiation exposure, and access but, as will be illustrated, these barriers can be easily overcome. This review summarizes findings from PET studies that have been performed over the past three decades on children with various neurodegenerative disorders, including the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, juvenile Huntington disease, Wilson disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Dravet syndrome, dystonia, mitochondrial disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, lysosomal storage diseases, dysmyelinating disorders, Rett syndrome, neurotransmitter disorders, glucose transporter Glut 1 deficiency, and Lesch-Nyhan disease. Because positron emission tomographic scans have often been clinically useful and have contributed to the management of these disorders, we suggest that the time has come for glucose metabolism positron emission tomographic scans to be reimbursed by insurance carriers for children with neurodegenerative disorders, and not restricted only to epilepsy surgery evaluation.",

Intracellular aggregates are a common pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Aggregates are mainly formed by aberrant disease-specific proteins and are accompanied by accumulation of other aggregate-interacting proteins. Although aggregate-interacting proteins have been considered to modulate the formation of aggregates and to be involved in molecular mechanisms of disease progression, the components of aggregate-interacting proteins remain unknown. In this study, we showed that small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alfa (SGTA) is an aggregate-interacting protein in neurodegenerative diseases. Immunohistochemistry showed that SGTA interacted with intracellular aggregates in Huntington disease (HD) cell models and neurons of HD model mice. We also revealed that SGTA colocalized with intracellular aggregates in postmortem brains of patients with polyQ diseases including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. In addition, SGTA colocalized with glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the brains of MSA patients, whereas no accumulation of SGTA was observed in neurons of PD and ALS patients. In vitro study showed that SGTA bound to polyQ aggregates through its C-terminal domain and SGTA overexpression reduced intracellular aggregates. These results suggest that SGTA may play a role in the formation of aggregates and may act as potential modifier of molecular pathological mechanisms of polyQ diseases and MSA.",

INTRODUCTION: Huntington s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric, motor and cognitive manifestations. It is caused by expansion of the trinucleotide CAG on HTT. The molecular bases are not completely understood, DNA damage, such as double and single strand breaks and oxidative stress (OS) have been implicated. At telomeres, DNA breaks are less efficiently repaired. Double strand breaks evoke the break induced replication (BIR) mechanism. BIR, plus inefficient repair can produce telomere shortening and cellular senescence. Our aim was to investigate the correlation between leukocyte relative telomeric length (RTL) and HD. METHODS: 206 samples were analyzed, 71 patients with molecular diagnosis and symptomatology (HD), 29 individuals with positive molecular test but asymptomatic (PP) and 106 healthy individuals (NP). RESULTS: We found a significant difference in RTL between HD patients compared with both, PP and NP, independently of subjects' age. DISCUSSION: Here we present evidence supporting an association between telomere shortening and HD. Telomere shortening could be related to DNA damage caused by ROS and defective DNA repair mechanism. Both events have been probed to occur in the presence of a mutant Huntingtin. This study contributes with current evidence suggesting a potential role of telomere shortening as HD biomarker.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Electrophysiologic abnormalities of the globus pallidus externus have been shown in several disease processes including Parkinson disease, dystonia, and Huntington disease. However, the connectivity, nuclear structure, and function of the globus pallidus externus are still not well-understood. Increasing evidence for the existence of direct corticopallidal connections challenges traditional understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus; nevertheless, these corticopallidal connections have yet to be fully characterized in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the corticopallidal connections of the globus pallidus externus by means of probabilistic diffusion-weighted MR imaging tractography using high-resolution, multishell data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging data from the open-access Human Connectome Project data base were used to perform probabilistic tractography between the globus pallidus externus and the cerebral cortex using 34 distinct cortical regions. Group averages were calculated for normalized percentages of tracts reaching each of the cortical targets, and side-to-side comparison was made. RESULTS: Cortical connectivity was demonstrated between the globus pallidus externus and multiple cortical regions, including direct connection to putative sensorimotor, associative, and limbic areas. Connectivity patterns were not significantly different between the right and left hemispheres with the exception of the frontal pole, which showed a greater number of connections on the right (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo study of the human globus pallidus externus using probabilistic tractography supports the existence of extensive corticopallidal connections and a tripartite functional division, as found in animal studies. A better understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus may help to understand its function and elucidate the effects of programming the higher contacts in pallidal deep brain stimulation.",

The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

His neurological examination was compatible with HD as were all investigations. We diagnosed psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. While seizures are common in juvenile-onset HD, they are no more prevalent in adult-onset HD than in the general population. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in HD and can involve a number of different complaints. Patients may experience dissociative attacks soon after manifesting a HD diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for two Chinese pedigrees affected with Huntington disease and provide prenatal diagnosis for them. METHODS: Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the probands. PCR and capillary gel electrophoresis were used to determine the number of CAG repeats in their IT15 gene. Pre-symptomatic testing was offered to their children and relatives, and prenatal diagnosis was provided to three pregnant women from the two pedigrees. RESULTS: The two probands, in addition with three asymptomatic members, were found to have a (CAG)n repeat number greater than 40. Upon prenatal diagnosis, the numbers of CAG repeats in two fetuses from pedigree 1 were determined as (16, 19) and (18, 19), both were within the normal range. A fetus from pedigree 2 was found to have a CAG repeat number of (15, 41), which exceeded the normal range.

The expanded CAG repeat number in HTT gene causes Huntington disease (HD), which is a severe, dominant neurodegenerative illness. The accurate determination of the expanded allele size is crucial to confirm the genetic status in symptomatic and presymptomatic at-risk subjects and avoid genetic polymorphism-related false-negative diagnoses. Precise CAG repeat number determination is critical to discriminate the cutoff between unexpanded and intermediate mutable alleles (IAs, 27-35 CAG) as well as between IAs and pathological, low-penetrance alleles (i.e., 36-39 CAG repeats), and it is also critical to detect large repeat expansions causing pediatric HD variants. We analyzed the HTT-CAG repeat number of 14 DNA reference materials and of a DNA collection of 43 additional samples carrying unexpanded, IAs, low and complete penetrance alleles, including large (>60 repeats) and very large (>100 repeats) expansions using a novel triplet-primed PCR-based assay, the AmplideX PCR/CE HTT Kit. The results demonstrate that the method accurately genotypes both normal and expanded HTT-CAG repeat numbers and reveals previously undisclosed and very large CAG expansions >200 repeats. We also show that this technique can improve genetic test reliability and accuracy by detecting CAG expansions in samples with sequence variations within or adjacent to the repeat tract that cause allele drop-outs or inaccuracies using other PCR methods.",

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) represents a potential therapeutic target for Huntington disease. Using 11C-ABP688 (3-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-ylethynyl)-cyclohex-2-enone-O-11C-methyl-oxime), a noncompetitive and highly selective antagonist for mGluR5, we aimed to longitudinally characterize in vivo changes in mGluR5 by means of PET imaging in the Q175 mouse model of Huntington disease. Methods:11C-ABP688 PET imaging, followed by a CT scan, was performed on 18 heterozygous mice and 18 wild-type (WT) littermates at 3 different time points (6, 9, and 13 mo old). 11C-ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated for each time point in striatum and cortex using the cerebellum as the reference region. In addition, voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was performed on BPND images. Postmortem validation of mGluR5 level and neuronal density was performed on the mice at 6 mo old. Results: The 11C-ABP688 BPND of heterozygous animals was significantly reduced at all time points in the striatum (-13.1%, -13.5%, and -14.2% at 6, 9, and 13 mo, respectively; P < 0.001 for all) and in the cortex (-9.8%, -10.2%, and -10.6%, respectively; P < 0.01 for all), when compared with WT animals. Longitudinal changes in 11C-ABP688 BPND were also found in heterozygous mice, showing a reduction at 13 mo compared with 6 mo (-10.4%, P < 0.05). SPM analysis confirmed reduced BPND in heterozygous compared with WT mice, as well as a time-related decline in 11C-ABP688 binding in the striatum of heterozygous mice. Postmortem analysis confirmed a mGluR5 decrease in both striatum (-36.6%; P < 0.01) and cortex (-16.6%; P < 0.05) in heterozygous mice, whereas no difference in neuronal density was found. Conclusion: In vivo imaging of mGluR5 using 11C-ABP688 PET/CT revealed a marked reduction in ligand binding in the striatum and cortex of heterozygous mice, compared with WT mice, as well as a temporal decline. This study suggests that 11C-ABP688 PET imaging is a potential biomarker to monitor the progression of, and therapeutic strategies for, Huntington disease.",

                    "text": "Imaging of Synaptic Density in Neurodegenerative Disorders. PET technology has produced many radiopharmaceuticals that target specific brain proteins and other measures of brain function. Recently, a new approach has emerged to image synaptic density by targeting the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), an integral glycoprotein in the membrane of synaptic vesicles and widely distributed throughout the brain. Multiple SV2A ligands have been developed and translated to human use. The most successful of these to date is 11C-UCB-J, because of its high uptake, moderate metabolism, and effective quantification with a 1-tissue-compartment model. Further, since SV2A is the target of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, human blocking studies have characterized specific binding and potential reference regions. Regional brain SV2A levels were shown to correlate with those of synaptophysin, another commonly used marker of synaptic density, providing the basis for SV2A PET imaging to have broad utility across neuropathologic diseases. In this review, we highlight the development of SV2A tracers and the evaluation of quantification methods, including compartment modeling and simple tissue ratios. Mouse and rat models of neurodegenerative diseases have been studied with small-animal PET, providing validation by comparison to direct tissue measures. Next, we review human PET imaging results in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Studies on Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease have progressed most rapidly at multiple centers, with generally consistent results of patterns of SV2A or synaptic loss. In Alzheimer disease, the synaptic loss patterns differ from those of amyloid, tau, and 18F-FDG, although intertracer and interregional correlations have been found. Smaller studies have been reported in other disorders, including Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In conclusion, PET imaging of SV2A has rapidly developed, and qualified radioligands are available. PET studies on humans indicate that SV2A loss might be specific to disease-associated brain regions and consistent with synaptic density loss. The recent availability of new 18F tracers, 18F-SynVesT-1 and 18F-SynVesT-2, will substantially broaden the application of SV2A PET. Future studies are needed in larger patient cohorts to establish the clinical value of SV2A PET and its potential for diagnosis and progression monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as efficacy assessment of disease-modifying therapies.",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Synaptic damage has been proposed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of Huntington disease (HD), but in vivo evidence in humans is lacking. We performed a PET imaging study to assess synaptic damage and its clinical correlates in early HD in vivo. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, premanifest and early manifest (Shoulson-Fahn stage 1 and 2) HD mutation carriers and age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent clinical assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations and time-of-flight PET with 11C-UCB-J, a radioligand targeting the ubiquitous presynaptic terminal marker synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). We also performed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET in all participants because regional cerebral glucose consumption is thought to largely reflect synaptic activity. Volumes of interest were delineated on the basis of individual 3-dimensional T1 MRI. Standardized uptake value ratio-1 images were calculated for 11C-UCB-J with the centrum semiovale as reference region. 18F-FDG-PET activity was normalized to the pons. All PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. Volume of interest- and voxel-based analyses were performed. Correlations between clinical scores and 11C-UCB-J PET data were calculated. RESULTS: Eighteen HD mutation carriers (age 51.4 +- 11.6 years; 6 female; 7 premanifest, 11 early manifest) and 15 healthy controls (age 52.3 +- 3.5 years; 4 female) were included. In the HD group, significant loss of SV2A binding was found in putamen, caudate, pallidum, cerebellum, parietal, and temporal and frontal cortex, whereas reduced 18F-FDG uptake was restricted to caudate and putamen. In the premanifest subgroup, 11C-UCB-J and 18F-FDG-PET showed significant reductions in putamen and caudate only. In the total HD group, SV2A loss in the putamen correlated with motor impairment. DISCUSSION: Our data reveal loss of presynaptic terminal integrity in early HD, which begins in the striatum in the premanifest phase, spreads extensively to extrastriatal regions in the early manifest phase, and correlates with motor impairment. 11C-UCB-J PET is more sensitive than 18F-FDG-PET for detection of extrastriatal changes in early HD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that 11C-UCB-J PET accurately discriminates individuals HD from normal controls.",

Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q, n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001). No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically. Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.",

Deutetrabenazine (Austedo) is indicated in adults for chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. Escalating deutetrabenazine doses were administered to healthy volunteers who were cytochrome P450 2D6 extensive/intermediate metabolizers (EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs) to determine pharmacokinetic exposure of parent drug and active metabolites (alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine [alpha-HTBZ] and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine [beta-HTBZ]), and collect corresponding electrocardiograms (ECGs) for evaluation of the cardiodynamic effect using concentration-QTc (C-QTc) modeling. Participants (12 EMs, 24 PMs) received placebo or single doses of deutetrabenazine (24, 48, and 72 mg) to achieve plasma concentrations exceeding therapeutic range in both cohorts. Pharmacokinetic samples were obtained over 72 hours after dosing and were time matched with 12-lead ECGs extracted from continuous ECG recordings. C-QTc analysis, using linear mixed-effects modeling and model selection procedure, characterized the relationship between plasma concentrations of deutetrabenazine, deuterated alpha-HTBZ and beta-HTBZ, and the change from baseline in QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula. Deutetrabenazine exhibited linear kinetics, and a C-QTc model with deuterated alpha-HTBZ and beta-HTBZ was selected to best describe the C-QTc relationship in pooled EM and PM data. This model predicted a placebo-corrected Fridericia corrected QT interval prolongation higher than 10 milliseconds can be excluded at concentrations associated with the maximum recommended doses in both populations. Adverse events increased with higher exposure as reflected by the higher event number in the PM cohort receiving 48 and 72 mg doses. No subject discontinued due to cardiac-related adverse events and no clinically relevant ECG findings were reported. Thus, this study found that deutetrabenazine does not have a clinically relevant effect on QT prolongation at maximum recommended doses in either cytochrome P450 2D6 EMs or PMs.",

OBJECTIVE: To survey neurologists and obtain clinical perceptions of tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in patients with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

In the prodromal phase of neurodegenerative diseases, microglia switch to an activated state resulting in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. We reported that C - C chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), C - C chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) and C - C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) contained in the secretome of activated microglia inhibit neuronal autophagy via a non-cell autonomous mechanism. These chemokines bind and activate neuronal C - C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), which, in turn, promotes phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT) - mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway activation, which inhibits autophagy, thus causing the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins in the cytoplasm of neurons. The levels of CCR5 and its chemokine ligands are increased in the brains of pre-manifesting Huntington disease (HD) and tauopathy mouse models. CCR5 accumulation might be due to a self-amplifying mechanism, since CCR5 is a substrate of autophagy and CCL5-CCR5-mediated autophagy inhibition impairs CCR5 degradation. Furthermore, pharmacological, or genetic inhibition of CCR5 rescues mTORC1-autophagy dysfunction and improves neurodegeneration in HD and tauopathy mouse models, suggesting that CCR5 hyperactivation is a pathogenic signal driving the progression of these diseases.",

In contrast to classic neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors, drugs that deplete presynaptic dopamine by blocking vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) seem to be safer and have little or no risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is one reason why there has been a recent emergence of novel VMAT2 inhibitors. Areas covered: Since the approval of tetrabenazine, the classic VMAT2 inhibitor, in the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD), other VMAT2 inhibitors (e.g. deutetrabenazine and valbenazine) have been studied in the treatment of HD-related chorea, tardive dyskinesia and tics associated with Tourette syndrome. This review, based largely on a detailed search of PubMed, will summarize the pharmacology and clinical experience with the various VMAT2 inhibitors. Expert commentary: Because of differences in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics these new VMAT2 inhibitors promise to be at least as effective as tetrabenazine but with a lower risk of adverse effects, such as sedation, insomnia, depression, parkinsonism, and akathisia.",

Multiple targeted therapeutics for Huntington's disease are now in clinical trials, including intrathecally delivered compounds. Previous research suggests that CSF dynamics may be altered in Huntington's disease, which could be of paramount relevance to intrathecal drug delivery to the brain. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective cross-sectional study comparing people with early stage Huntington's disease with age- and gender-matched healthy controls. CSF peak velocity, mean velocity and mean flow at the level of the cerebral aqueduct, and sub-arachnoid space in the upper and lower spine, were quantified using phase contrast MRI. We calculated Spearman's rank correlations, and tested inter-group differences with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Ten people with early Huntington's disease, and 10 controls were included. None of the quantified measures was associated with potential modifiers of CSF dynamics (demographics, osmolality, and brain volumes), or by known modifiers of Huntington's disease (age and HTTCAG repeat length); and no significant differences were found between the two studied groups. While external validation is required, the attained results are sufficient to conclude tentatively that a clinically relevant alteration of CSF dynamics - that is, one that would justify dose-adjustments of intrathecal drugs - is unlikely to exist in Huntington's disease.",

Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of Polyglutamine (polyQ) in exon 1 of the Huntingtin protein. Glutamine repeats below 36 are considered normal while repeats above 40 lead to HD. Impairment in energy metabolism is a common trend in Huntington pathogenesis; however, this effect is not fully understood. Here, we used the phasor approach and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to measure changes between free and bound fractions of NADH as a indirect measure of metabolic alteration in living cells. Using Phasor-FLIM, pixel maps of metabolic alteration in HEK293 cell lines and in transgenic Drosophila expressing expanded and unexpanded polyQ HTT exon1 in the eye disc were developed. We found a significant shift towards increased free NADH, indicating an increased glycolytic state for cells and tissues expressing the expanded polyQ compared to unexpanded control. In the nucleus, a further lifetime shift occurs towards higher free NADH suggesting a possible synergism between metabolic dysfunction and transcriptional regulation. Our results indicate that metabolic dysfunction in HD shifts to increased glycolysis leading to oxidative stress and cell death. This powerful label free method can be used to screen native HD tissue samples and for potential drug screening.",

The role of rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

BACKGROUND: Self-management and self-efficacy for physical activity is not routinely considered in neurologic rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed feasibility and outcomes of a 14-week physical activity self-management and coaching intervention compared with social contact in Huntington disease (HD) to inform the design of a future full-scale trial. DESIGN: Assessor blind, multisite, randomized pilot feasibility trial. SETTING: Participants were recruited and assessed at baseline, 16 weeks following randomization, and then again at 26 weeks in HD specialist clinics with intervention delivery by trained coaches in the participants' homes. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: People with HD were allocated to the ENGAGE-HD physical activity coaching intervention or a social interaction intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Eligibility, recruitment, retention, and intervention participation were determined at 16 weeks. Other outcomes of interest included measures of mobility, self-efficacy, physical activity, and disease-specific measures of motor and cognition. Fidelity and costs for both the physical activity and social comparator interventions were established. RESULTS: Forty percent ( n = 46) of eligible patients were enrolled; 22 were randomized to the physical intervention and 24 to social intervention. Retention rates in the physical intervention and social intervention were 77% and 92%, respectively. Minimum participation criteria were achieved by 82% of participants in the physical intervention and 100% in the social intervention. There was no indication of between-group treatment effects on function; however, increases in self-efficacy for exercise and self-reported levels of physical activity in the physical intervention lend support to our predefined intervention logic model. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures may have introduced bias. CONCLUSIONS: An HD physical activity self-management and coaching intervention is feasible and worthy of further investigation.",

BACKGROUND: Self-management and self-efficacy for physical activity is not routinely considered in neurologic rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed feasibility and outcomes of a 14-week physical activity self-management and coaching intervention compared with social contact in Huntington disease (HD) to inform the design of a future full-scale trial. DESIGN: Assessor blind, multisite, randomized pilot feasibility trial. SETTING: Participants were recruited and assessed at baseline, 16 weeks following randomization, and then again at 26 weeks in HD specialist clinics with intervention delivery by trained coaches in the participants' homes. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: People with HD were allocated to the ENGAGE-HD physical activity coaching intervention or a social interaction intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Eligibility, recruitment, retention, and intervention participation were determined at 16 weeks. Other outcomes of interest included measures of mobility, self-efficacy, physical activity, and disease-specific measures of motor and cognition. Fidelity and costs for both the physical activity and social comparator interventions were established. RESULTS: Forty percent ( n = 46) of eligible patients were enrolled; 22 were randomized to the physical intervention and 24 to social intervention. Retention rates in the physical intervention and social intervention were 77% and 92%, respectively. Minimum participation criteria were achieved by 82% of participants in the physical intervention and 100% in the social intervention.

Cognitive impairment is prevalent in Huntington's disease (HD), with no treatments currently available. While cognition-oriented treatments and physical exercise have shown efficacy in improving cognition in other populations, they have not been systematically reviewed in HD. This systematic review aims to examine the effects of cognitive and exercise interventions on cognition in HD, along with effects on psychosocial function, functional independence, and neuroimaging outcomes. Seventeen studies (three cognitive, seven exercise, seven combining cognitive and physical exercise) were included. While there was generally low certainty of evidence, interventions that included cognitive training appeared to have larger effect sizes on cognition, while physical exercise (alone or combined with cognitive rehabilitation or stimulation) showed negligible effect sizes. On the other hand, combined interventions had larger effects on psychosocial function. Finally, effects on functional independence appeared negligible following exercise and combined interventions, and effects on neuroimaging outcomes were inconclusive. Larger studies should seek to confirm the benefits of cognitive and physical interventions, and further explore changes in functional independence and neural outcomes.",

This qualitative study gathered opinions about genetic testing from people who received presymptomatic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) 20-30 years ago and have lived with the implications of that testing for decades. During the last section of a semi-structured interview, participants were asked open-ended questions about their opinions on the importance of autonomy in the decision to be tested for HD, whether a formal HD testing protocol is necessary, whether physician ordering for HD is acceptable without a formal protocol, whether online direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for HD is acceptable, and whether incidental/secondary findings should be returned in the context of whole exome/genome sequencing. Most-but not all-participants were in favor of an individual's right to decide whether and when to pursue HD testing, use of a formal HD testing protocol, and returning medically actionable secondary findings. However, the majority of participants were opposed not only to physician ordering and DTC HD testing in the absence of a formal protocol but also to returning a secondary finding of an expanded HD allele. This study presents the opinions of a unique and extremely well-informed cohort on issues that need to be taken into careful consideration by genetic counselors and other medical professionals who are developing genetic testing protocols, making decisions about the availability of genetic tests, and making decisions about whether and how to return incidental findings.",

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that chronic treatment of early-stage Huntington disease (HD) with high-dose coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) will slow the progressive functional decline of HD. METHODS: We performed a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with early-stage HD (n = 609) were enrolled at 48 sites in the United States, Canada, and Australia from 2008 to 2012. Patients were randomized to receive either CoQ 2,400 mg/d or matching placebo, then followed for 60 months. The primary outcome variable was the change from baseline to month 60 in Total Functional Capacity score (for patients who survived) combined with time to death (for patients who died) analyzed using a joint-rank analysis approach. RESULTS: An interim analysis for futility revealed a conditional power of <5% for the primary analysis, prompting premature conclusion in July 2014. No statistically significant differences were seen between treatment groups for the primary or secondary outcome measures. CoQ was generally safe and well-tolerated throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not justify use of CoQ as a treatment to slow functional decline in HD. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00608881.

Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a marker of brain atrophy and predictor of disease progression in rare diseases such as Huntington Disease, but also in more common neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to measure NfL longitudinally in autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and establish correlation with clinical and imaging parameters. We enrolled 62 pathological expansions carriers (17 SCA1, 13 SCA2, 19 SCA3, and 13 SCA7) and 19 age-matched controls in a prospective biomarker study between 2011 and 2015 and followed for 24 months at the Paris Brain Institute. We performed neurological examination, brain 3 T MRI and plasma NfL measurements using an ultrasensitive single-molecule array at baseline and at the two-year follow-up visit. We evaluated NfL correlations with ages, CAG repeat sizes, clinical scores and volumetric brain MRIs. NfL levels were significantly higher in SCAs than controls at both time points (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted NfL levels were significantly correlated at baseline with clinical scores (p < 0.01). We identified optimal NfL cut-off concentrations to differentiate controls from carriers for each genotype (SCA1 16.87 pg/mL, SCA2, 19.1 pg/mL, SCA3 16.04 pg/mL, SCA7 16.67 pg/mL). For all SCAs, NfL concentration was stable over two years (p = 0.95) despite a clinical progression (p < 0.0001). Clinical progression between baseline and follow-up was associated with higher NfL concentrations at baseline (p = 0.04). Of note, all premanifest carriers with NfL levels close to cut off concentrations had signs of the disease at follow-up. For all SCAs, the higher the observed NfL, the lower the pons volume at baseline (p < 0.01) and follow-up (p = 0.02). Higher NfL levels at baseline in all SCAs predicted a decrease in cerebellar volume (p = 0.03). This result remained significant for SCA2 only among all genotypes (p = 0.02). Overall, plasma NfL levels at baseline in SCA expansion carriers predict cerebellar volume change and clinical score progression. NfL levels might help refine inclusion criteria for clinical trials in carriers with very subtle signs.",

BACKGROUND: Clinical care teams providing presymptomatic genetic testing often employ advanced confidentiality practices for documentation and result storage. However, patient requests for increased confidentiality may be in conflict with the legal obligations of medical providers to document patient care activities in the electronic health record (EHR). Huntington disease presents a representative case study for investigating the ways centers currently balance the requirements of EHRs with the privacy demands of patients seeking presymptomatic genetic testing. METHODS: We surveyed 23 HD centers (53% response rate) regarding their use of the EHR for presymptomatic HD testing. RESULTS: Our survey revealed that clinical care teams and laboratories have each developed their own practices, which are cumbersome and often include EHR avoidance. We found that a majority of HD care teams record appointments in the EHR (91%), often using vague notes. Approximately half of the care teams (52%) keep presymptomatic results of out of the EHR. CONCLUSION: As genetic knowledge grows, linking more genes to late-onset conditions, institutions will benefit from having professional recommendations to guide development of policies for EHR documentation of presymptomatic genetic results. Policies must be sensitive to the ethical differences and patient demands for presymptomatic genetic testing compared to those undergoing confirmatory genetic testing.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the EEG modifications in patients with Huntington disease (HD) compared with controls, by means of the exact LOw REsolution Tomography (eLORETA) software. We evaluated EEG changes during wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Moreover, we reviewed the literature concerning EEG modifications in HD. Twenty-three consecutive adult patients affected by HD were enrolled, 14 women and 9 men, mean age was 57.0 +- 12.4 years. Control subjects were healthy volunteers (mean age 58.2 +- 14.6 years). EEG and polygraphic recordings were performed during wake (before sleep) and during sleep. Sources of EEG activities were determined using the eLORETA software. In wake EEG, significant differences between patients and controls were detected in the delta frequency band (threshold T = +-4.606; P < .01) in the Brodmann areas (BAs) 3, 4, and 6 bilaterally. In NREM sleep, HD patients showed increased alpha power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in BAs 4 and 6 bilaterally; decreased theta power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in the BAs 23, 29, and 30; and decreased beta power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in the left BA 30. During REM, HD patients presented decreased theta and alpha power (threshold T = +-4.640; P < .01) in the BAs 23, 29, 30, and 31 bilaterally. In conclusion, EEG data suggest a motor cortex dysfunction during wake and sleep in HD patients, which correlates with the clinical and polysomnographic evidence of increased motor activity during wake and NREM, and nearly absent motor abnormalities in REM.",

PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring.

BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.",

Movement disorders can be hypokinetic (e.g., parkinsonism), hyperkinetic, or dystonic in nature and commonly arise from altered function in nuclei of the basal ganglia or their connections. As obvious structural changes are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism. Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli. In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) represents a potential therapeutic target for Huntington disease. Using 11C-ABP688 (3-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-ylethynyl)-cyclohex-2-enone-O-11C-methyl-oxime), a noncompetitive and highly selective antagonist for mGluR5, we aimed to longitudinally characterize in vivo changes in mGluR5 by means of PET imaging in the Q175 mouse model of Huntington disease. Methods:11C-ABP688 PET imaging, followed by a CT scan, was performed on 18 heterozygous mice and 18 wild-type (WT) littermates at 3 different time points (6, 9, and 13 mo old). 11C-ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated for each time point in striatum and cortex using the cerebellum as the reference region. In addition, voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was performed on BPND images. Postmortem validation of mGluR5 level and neuronal density was performed on the mice at 6 mo old. Results: The 11C-ABP688 BPND of heterozygous animals was significantly reduced at all time points in the striatum (-13.1%, -13.5%, and -14.2% at 6, 9, and 13 mo, respectively; P < 0.001 for all) and in the cortex (-9.8%, -10.2%, and -10.6%, respectively; P < 0.01 for all), when compared with WT animals. Longitudinal changes in 11C-ABP688 BPND were also found in heterozygous mice, showing a reduction at 13 mo compared with 6 mo (-10.4%, P < 0.05). SPM analysis confirmed reduced BPND in heterozygous compared with WT mice, as well as a time-related decline in 11C-ABP688 binding in the striatum of heterozygous mice. Postmortem analysis confirmed a mGluR5 decrease in both striatum (-36.6%; P < 0.01) and cortex (-16.6%; P < 0.05) in heterozygous mice, whereas no difference in neuronal density was found. Conclusion: In vivo imaging of mGluR5 using 11C-ABP688 PET/CT revealed a marked reduction in ligand binding in the striatum and cortex of heterozygous mice, compared with WT mice, as well as a temporal decline. This study suggests that 11C-ABP688 PET imaging is a potential biomarker to monitor the progression of, and therapeutic strategies for, Huntington disease.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder most commonly manifesting in adulthood. Identification of biomarkers tracking neurodegeneration before the onset of motor symptoms is important for future interventional studies. Our study aimed to contribute in the phenotypic characterization of the premanifest HD phase. METHODS: 28 premanifest subjects (preHD), 25 age-matched controls, and 12 manifest HD patients were enrolled for the study. The participants underwent a multimodal protocol including cognitive evaluations, arithmetic ability test, posturography, composite cerebellar functional test (CCFS), and brain 3T-MRI. PreHD were divided at the group median for predicted years to expected onset into \"far-from-onset\" (>15 years, PreHD-far), and \"close-to-onset\" (<=15 years, preHD-close). Basal ganglia volumes and cortical thickness were computed using FreeSurfer. RESULTS: PreHD-close showed significantly lower scores than controls in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p = 0.017), Arithmetic subtraction task (p = 0.04), and MMSE (p < 0.006). At posturography, preHD-close showed increased sway velocity (<0.04) and distance (p < 0.02) compared to controls. PreHD-close had reduced striatum and globus pallidus volumes and left occipital cortical thinning compared to controls. Compared to PreHD far-from-onset, PreHD-close showed bilateral cortical thinning in occipital and parahippocampal regions, inversely correlating with burden score and prognostic index for HD. CCFS only differed between controls and manifest HD. PreHD far-from-onset did not show significant differences in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that quantitative brain MRI represents a valid biomarker of neurodegeneration in preHD. Posturography and Arithmentic tests seem promising tools for detecting early changes in premanifest HD, but need to be further confirmed in large cohorts.",

BACKGROUND: Deficits in posture and gait are known to contribute to the complex motor phenotype of Huntington disease (HD). Objective and quantitative measures of posture and gait provided by posturography and GAITRite  assessments may supplement categorical rating scales such as the UHDRS-TMS and increase power and sensitivity of clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether posturography and GAITRite  measures reveal (1) changes in manifest or premanifest HD mutation-carriers, (2) a correlation to the UHDRS-TMS and functional measures in manifest HD, and (3) a correlation to the disease-burden-score (based on CAG-repeat-length and age). METHODS: Posturography and GAITRite  were applied in premanifest (n = 26) and manifest HD gene-mutation-carriers (n = 40) in different paradigms compared to age-matched controls (n = 30) in a cross-sectional multi-site study conducted in three centers. Subjects were assessed clinically with the UHDRS Total-Motor-Score, Total-Functional-Capacity and Functional-Assessment-Scale. RESULTS: Several posturography measures were able to discriminate between controls, premanifest, and manifest mutation-carriers in both conditions assessed. Only one GAITRite  measure separated controls and premanifest participants, while discrimination between controls and manifest same as between premanifest and manifest participants was possible in several measures. Correlation with all clinical measures was seen in only one measure per device while correlations to the disease-burden-score seen in posturography only. CONCLUSION: Overall the results suggests that posturography detects alterations in premanifest and manifest mutation-carriers more reliably than GAITRite  measures. Correlations with clinical assessment scores are limited; correlation with disease-burden-score is seen in posturography only. Data acquisition and analysis was easier with posturography than GAITRite  assessments in out-patient settings.",

BACKGROUND: In Huntington disease (HD), cognitive changes due to disease-progression or treatment are potentially confounded by \"practice effects\" (PE)--performance improvement from prior exposure to test materials. OBJECTIVE: A practice run-in (\"dual baseline\") was used in an HD cognitive trial to determine if PE could be minimized and evaluate performance trajectories over multiple visits. METHODS: Non-depressed adults (N = 36) with mild to moderate HD-related cognitive deficits participated in a clinical trial to examine the efficacy of citalopram to enhance cognition. Cognitive tests were administered at three visits (2 weeks separating each visit), before active treatment randomization. Some tests were also administered at screening. Therefore 3-4 pre-treatment repetitions were available. We examined test improvement using repeated-measures ANOVAs with planned pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Despite the practice run-in and use of alternate test forms, results indicated ongoing improvements over at least three test sessions on all three UHDRS cognitive tests. Trails A and B showed improvements between the third and fourth session, which suggests that one pre-baseline visit may not be effective in reducing practice on this important and commonly used test. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 7 out of 13 variables showed some degree of short-term PE, even after multiple sessions and alternate forms. Tests assessing processing speed and memory may be particularly confounded by ongoing PE across at least 2-3 sessions. Practice run-in periods and alternate forms may help minimize the impact of such effects in HD clinical trials but awareness of which tests are most susceptible to PE is important in clinical trial design.",

Pre-symptomatic testing was offered to their children and relatives, and prenatal diagnosis was provided to three pregnant women from the two pedigrees. RESULTS: The two probands, in addition with three asymptomatic members, were found to have a (CAG)n repeat number greater than 40. Upon prenatal diagnosis, the numbers of CAG repeats in two fetuses from pedigree 1 were determined as (16, 19) and (18, 19), both were within the normal range. A fetus from pedigree 2 was found to have a CAG repeat number of (15, 41), which exceeded the normal range.

For this purpose, regression analysis was performed, showing that the Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), psychoticism, somatization and paranoid ideation dimensions assume predictive value in the middle and long-term impact for total anxiety and PSDI. The result of PST was not a relevant predictor. The application of an evaluation instrument of various psychopathological dimensions played a fundamental role in the detection of clinical situations that may arise several years later after PST. Attention should be paid to providing psychological support to persons at-risk who, at the pre-test phase, present some psychopathology indices before pursuing with genetic testing.",

Lithium, a well-known drug for the treatment of bipolar disorder, may also have the ability to reduce neurodegeneration and stimulate cell proliferation. Systemic injection of mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NPA) is known to induce a relatively selective, Huntington disease-like brain injury. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) on brain injury caused by 3NPA. Female adult Wistar rats were pre-treated with LiCl (127 mg/kg) 1 day before the first injection of 3NPA (28 mg/kg), and then for 8 days with the same treatment but receiving LiCl 1 hour before 3NPA. Control groups were pre-treated accordingly, with LiCl or with normal saline, but were not treated with 3NPA. Staining for cytochrome c oxidase activity and in situ hybridization autoradiography of synaptotagmin-4 and -7 mRNAs were used to evaluate brain injury caused by 3NPA. There was a significant reduction of body weight in the 3NPA+LiCl group (79%) compared to the 3NPA group (90%, p = 0.031) and both control groups (100%, p = 0.000). Densitometric evaluation of cytochrome c oxidase staining and in situ hybridization autoradiograms revealed that the pre-treatment with LiCl caused an increase in striatal lesion for about 40% (p = 0.049). Moreover, the lesion was observed also in the hippocampus of three animals from the 3NPA+LiCl group and in two animals from the 3NPA group. However, there were no differences between the LiCl and saline group in any of the measured parameters. We concluded that the pre-treatment with a relatively nontoxic dose of LiCl could aggravate brain injury caused by 3NPA.",

Four subfractions were collected from column (FrA, FrB, FrC, and FrD) and further assessed for antioxidant potential by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl in vitro assay. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) was administered to Wister rats for induction of HD. Different fractions were administered for 14 days. Different behavioral alterations were assessed in between study period. Animals were euthanized immediately following the last behavioral session, and biochemical parameters were measured. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Systemic administration of 3-NP showed marked motor deficits and oxidative damage in rats. Only FrB showed significant antioxidant activity and on further purification gave pure compound (scopoletin). Our study showed that FrB (20 mg/kg) pre-treatment significantly attenuated the loss in body weight, improved the locomotor activity, grip strength, and gait abnormalities. It also has attenuated the increased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, and restored superoxide dismutase and reduced GSH enzyme activity in the striatum and cortex in 3-NP-treated groups. These results suggest that C. pluricaulis Chois. exhibits a neuroprotective effect by accelerating brain antioxidant defense mechanisms in 3-NP-treated rats.",

Lithium, a well-known drug for the treatment of bipolar disorder, may also have the ability to reduce neurodegeneration and stimulate cell proliferation. Systemic injection of mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NPA) is known to induce a relatively selective, Huntington disease-like brain injury. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) on brain injury caused by 3NPA. Female adult Wistar rats were pre-treated with LiCl (127 mg/kg) 1 day before the first injection of 3NPA (28 mg/kg), and then for 8 days with the same treatment but receiving LiCl 1 hour before 3NPA. Control groups were pre-treated accordingly, with LiCl or with normal saline, but were not treated with 3NPA. Staining for cytochrome c oxidase activity and in situ hybridization autoradiography of synaptotagmin-4 and -7 mRNAs were used to evaluate brain injury caused by 3NPA. There was a significant reduction of body weight in the 3NPA+LiCl group (79%) compared to the 3NPA group (90%, p = 0.031) and both control groups (100%, p = 0.000). Densitometric evaluation of cytochrome c oxidase staining and in situ hybridization autoradiograms revealed that the pre-treatment with LiCl caused an increase in striatal lesion for about 40% (p = 0.049). Moreover, the lesion was observed also in the hippocampus of three animals from the 3NPA+LiCl group and in two animals from the 3NPA group. However, there were no differences between the LiCl and saline group in any of the measured parameters. We concluded that the pre-treatment with a relatively nontoxic dose of LiCl could aggravate brain injury caused by 3NPA.",

The expanded CAG repeat number in HTT gene causes Huntington disease (HD), which is a severe, dominant neurodegenerative illness. The accurate determination of the expanded allele size is crucial to confirm the genetic status in symptomatic and presymptomatic at-risk subjects and avoid genetic polymorphism-related false-negative diagnoses. Precise CAG repeat number determination is critical to discriminate the cutoff between unexpanded and intermediate mutable alleles (IAs, 27-35 CAG) as well as between IAs and pathological, low-penetrance alleles (i.e., 36-39 CAG repeats), and it is also critical to detect large repeat expansions causing pediatric HD variants. We analyzed the HTT-CAG repeat number of 14 DNA reference materials and of a DNA collection of 43 additional samples carrying unexpanded, IAs, low and complete penetrance alleles, including large (>60 repeats) and very large (>100 repeats) expansions using a novel triplet-primed PCR-based assay, the AmplideX PCR/CE HTT Kit. The results demonstrate that the method accurately genotypes both normal and expanded HTT-CAG repeat numbers and reveals previously undisclosed and very large CAG expansions >200 repeats. We also show that this technique can improve genetic test reliability and accuracy by detecting CAG expansions in samples with sequence variations within or adjacent to the repeat tract that cause allele drop-outs or inaccuracies using other PCR methods.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a gain-of-function mutation in HTT. Suppression of mutant HTT has emerged as a leading therapeutic strategy for HD, with allele-selective approaches targeting HTT SNPs now in clinical trials. Haplotypes associated with the HD mutation (A1, A2, A3a) represent panels of allele-specific gene silencing targets for efficient treatment of individuals with HD of Northern European and indigenous South American ancestry. Here we extend comprehensive haplotype analysis of the HD mutation to key populations of Southern European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and admixed African ancestry. In each of these populations, the HD mutation occurs predominantly on the A2 HTT haplotype. Analysis of HD haplotypes across all affected population groups enables rational selection of candidate target SNPs for development of allele-selective gene silencing therapeutics worldwide. Targeting SNPs on the A1 and A2 haplotypes in parallel is essential to achieve treatment of the most HD-affected subjects in populations where HD is most prevalent. Current allele-specific approaches will leave a majority of individuals with HD untreated in populations where the HD mutation occurs most frequently on the A2 haplotype. We further demonstrate preclinical development of potent and selective ASOs targeting SNPs on the A2 HTT haplotype, representing an allele-specific treatment strategy for these individuals. On the basis of comprehensive haplotype analysis, we show the maximum proportion of HD-affected subjects that may be treated with three or four allele targets in different populations worldwide, informing current allele-specific HTT silencing strategies.",

Importance: Predictive genetic testing in Huntington disease (HD) enables therapeutic trials in HTT gene expansion mutation carriers prior to a motor diagnosis. Progression-free survival (PFS) is the composite of a motor diagnosis or a progression event, whichever comes first. Objective: To determine if PFS provides feasible sample sizes for trials with mutation carriers who have not yet received a motor diagnosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study uses data from the 2-phase, longitudinal cohort studies called Track and from a longitudinal cohort study called the Cooperative Huntington Observational Research Trial (COHORT). Track had 167 prediagnosis mutation carriers and 156 noncarriers, whereas COHORT had 366 prediagnosis mutation carriers and noncarriers. Track studies were conducted at 4 sites in 4 countries (Canada, France, England, and the Netherlands) from which data were collected from January 17, 2008, through November 17, 2014. The COHORT was conducted at 38 sites in 3 countries (Australia, Canada, and the United States) from which data were collected from February 14, 2006, through December 31, 2009. Results from the Track data were externally validated with data from the COHORT. The required sample size was estimated for a 2-arm prediagnosis clinical trial. Data analysis took place from May 1, 2016, to June 10, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point is PFS. Huntington disease progression events are defined for the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score, total functional capacity, symbol digit modalities test, and Stroop word test. Results: Of Track's 167 prediagnosis mutation carriers, 93 (55.6%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 40.06 (8.92) years; of the 156 noncarriers, 87 (55.7%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 45.58 (10.30) years. Of the 366 COHORT participants, 229 (62.5%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 42.21 (12.48) years. The PFS curves of the Track mutation carriers showed good external validity with the COHORT mutation carriers after adjusting for initial progression. For required sample size, PFS with a motor diagnosis or total motor score progression required about 4 times fewer participants than a motor diagnosis alone. Including additional cognitive progression events further reduced the number. For example, a 3-year trial with 10% attrition and a treatment effect of 50% requires a total of 661 with motor diagnosis as the survival end point but only 177 with a total motor score PFS. Conclusions and Relevance: Reasonably sized prediagnosis Huntington disease trials can be planned with PFS, and there is evidence of generalizability of this approach.",

                    "text": "A liminal stage after predictive testing for Huntington disease. BACKGROUND: Following predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD), knowledge of one's carrier status may have consequences on disease onset. Our study aimed to address two questions. First, does knowledge of being a carrier of the pathological HD mutation trigger onset of the disease? Second, does this knowledge influence self-awareness and allow carriers to identify signs and symptoms of disease onset? METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 75 HD mutation carriers were examined using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score. Onset estimation made with the disease burden score was compared with UHDRS findings. We collected qualitative data with questionnaires and semistructured interviews. RESULTS: 38 women and 37 men, aged 43.7 years+-10.5 (20-68), were interviewed after a mean delay between test and study interview of 10.5 years+-4.7 (from 4 to 21 years). Estimation of age at onset was 4.5+-8.5 years earlier than data-derived age at onset. Participants were categorised according to their motor score: scores <5 were premanifest (n=35), and scores >5 were manifest carriers (n=40). Self-observation was a major preoccupation for all, independent of their clinical status (82% vs 74%, p=0.57). Among manifest carriers, 56% thought they showed symptoms, but only 33% felt ill. Interestingly, this was also observed in those without motor signs (20% and 9%). Being a mutation carrier did not significantly facilitate recognition of motor signs. Interviews with premanifest carriers allowed the burden of self-observation to be illustrated despite lack of motor signs. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating age at onset based on disease burden score may not be accurate. The transition to disease was experienced as an ambiguous or liminal experience. The view of mutation carriers is not always concordant with medical onset estimation, highlighting the difficulties involved in the concept of onset and its use as an outcome in future disease-modifying trials.",

Predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD) in 25% at-risk individuals is testing with full knowledge, and sometimes assuming, that the parent does not want to know his status. The goal of this study was to understand: (1) the differences in the motivation between 25% and 50% at-risk individuals to be tested and (2) the consequences of \"double disclosure\", including parental reactions. Test requests from 25% at-risk individuals were rare (155/1611, 10%). We compared their motivation with those of 1456 50% at-risk individuals. The principal motivation to have the test for both groups was \"to know\" (48% versus 58%, p = 0.049), but the desire to have children was more frequent in the 25% at-risk group (32% versus 17%, p < 0.001). Sixty percent of the 25% at-risk group went through the testing procedure: 15% (n = 14) were variant positive for HD. Testees reported four adverse reactions of their parent (22%): one committed suicide and three became depressed. This result highlights the impact of \"double disclosure\", a bad result for the person themselves and the transmitting parent. It is the responsibility of the team to anticipate this outcome with the 25% at-risk individuals: children revealing the genetic status to their parent. They should help the testees and their family to find a satisfactory solution to help prevent adverse reactions. This includes ensuring that the candidate is well-infomed abour the testing options and consequences to her/himself but also to her/his parent. The at-risk parent should be offered to discuss the implications of their child's testing.",

Huntington disease (HD) is most prevalent among populations of western European descent and isolated populations where founder effects may operate. The aim of this study was to examine the epidemiology of HD in Cyprus, an island in southern Europe with extensive western European colonization in the past. All registered HD patients in the Cyprus, since 1994, were included. Detailed pedigrees and clinical information were recorded and maps, showing the geographic distribution of HD, were constructed. Requests for genetic testing were also examined. The project identified 58 clinically manifested cases of HD belonging to 19 families. The 16 families of Cypriot origin were concentrated in a confined geographical cluster in southeast Cyprus. In 2015, prevalence of symptomatic HD was 4.64/100 000 population, while incidence was 0.12/100 000 person-years. Prevalence displayed a marked increase during the past 20 years. Disease characteristics of HD patients were similar to those reported in western European populations. Lastly, the uptake of predictive and/or prenatal testing was limited. HD disease characteristics, incidence and prevalence in Cyprus were comparable to western European populations. Together with the geographical clustering observed, these results support the possibility for a relatively recent founder effect of HD in Cyprus, potentially of western European origin.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative autosomal dominant genetic condition. Predictive testing (PT) is available through a defined protocol for at-risk individuals. We analyzed the over-24-years evolution of practices regarding PT for HD in a single center. METHODS: We gathered data from the files of all individuals seeking PT for HD in Lyon, France, from 1994 to 2017. RESULTS: 448 out of 567 participants had exploitable data. Age at consultation dichotomized over 24 years toward an eightfold increase in individuals aged >55 (2/94 vs. 30/183; 2% to 16%; p < .0001) and twice as many individuals aged 18-20 (3/94 vs. 12/183; 3%-7%; p < .05). Motives for testing remained stable. The rate of withdrawal doubled over 24 years (9/94 vs. 38/183; 9%-21%; p < .02). Independently of the time period, less withdrawal was observed for married, accompanied, at 50% risk, and symptomatic individuals, and in those able to explicit the motives for testing or taking the test to inform their children. We also assessed the consistency between the presence of subtle symptoms compatible with HD found before the test by the team's neurologist, and the positivity of the molecular test. The concordance was 100% (17/17) for associated motor and cognitive signs, 87% (27/31) for isolated motor signs, and 70% (7/10) for isolated cognitive signs. Furthermore, 91% (20/22) of individuals who requested testing because they thought they had symptoms, were indeed found carriers. CONCLUSION: This over-24 years study underlines an increasing withdrawal from protocol and a dichotomization of participants' age. We also show a strong concordance between symptoms perceived by the neurologist or by the patient, and the subsequent positivity of the predictive molecular test.",

Legitimate reasons may exist for moving forward with testing. Additionally predicting the consequences of testing is unrealistic so that the clinicians must do their best to prepare patients for both positive and negative results. A multidisciplinary team following the Huntington disease protocol remains the gold standard care for predictive testing for such patients.

The ability to anticipate events and execute motor commands prior to a sensory event is an essential capability for human's everyday life. This implicitly learned anticipatory behavior depends on the past performance of repeated sensorimotor interactions timed with external cues. This kind of predictive behavior has been shown to be compromised in neurological disorders such as Huntington disease (HD), in which neural atrophy includes key cortical and basal ganglia regions. To investigate the neural basis of the anticipatory behavioral deficits in HD we used a predictive-saccade paradigm that requires predictive control to generate saccades in a metronomic temporal pattern. This is ideal because the integrity of the oculomotor network that includes the striatum and prefrontal, parietal, occipital and temporal cortices can be analyzed using structural MRI. Our results showed that the HD patients had severe predictive saccade deficits (i.e., an inability to reduce saccade reaction time in predictive condition), which are accentuated in patients with more severe motor deterioration. Structural imaging analyses revealed that these anticipatory deficits correlated with grey-matter atrophy in frontal, parietal-occipital and striatal regions. These findings indicate that the predictive saccade control deficits in HD are related to an extended cortico-striatal atrophy. This suggests that eye movement measurement could be a reliable marker of the progression of cognitive deficits in HD.",

Huntingtin N-terminal fragments (Htt-NTFs) with expanded polyglutamine tracts form a range of neurotoxic aggregates that are associated with Huntington's disease. Here, we show that aggregation of Htt-NTFs, irrespective of polyglutamine length, yields at least three phases (designated M, S, and F) that are delineated by sharp concentration thresholds and distinct aggregate sizes and morphologies. We found that monomers and oligomers make up the soluble M phase, ~25-nm spheres dominate in the soluble S phase, and long, linear fibrils make up the insoluble F phase. Previous studies showed that profilin, an abundant cellular protein, reduces Htt-NTF aggregation and toxicity in cells. We confirm that profilin achieves its cellular effects through direct binding to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Htt-NTFs. We show that profilin preferentially binds to Htt-NTF M-phase species and destabilizes aggregation and phase separation by shifting the concentration boundaries for phase separation to higher values through a process known as polyphasic linkage. Our experiments, aided by coarse-grained computer simulations and theoretical analysis, suggest that preferential binding of profilin to the M-phase species of Htt-NTFs is enhanced through a combination of specific interactions between profilin and polyproline segments and auxiliary interactions between profilin and polyglutamine tracts. Polyphasic linkage may be a general strategy that cells utilize to regulate phase behavior of aggregation-prone proteins. Accordingly, detailed knowledge of phase behavior and an understanding of how ligands modulate phase boundaries may pave the way for developing new therapeutics against a variety of aggregation-prone proteins.",

BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication. We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease. RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1 out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100).

Huntington disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

The low uptake of presymptomatic testing in Huntington disease prompted us to question family members on how they handle the transmission of information regarding genetic risk. We hypothesised that in 2019, parents would inform their at-risk children about their genetic risk more and at a younger age than in 2000, given the availability of prenatal diagnosis, French legislation changes since 2011, and recent therapeutic advances. We made a questionnaire available about the transmission of genetic information within families with Huntington disease in 2000 and 2019. We obtained 443 questionnaires (295 in 2019 and 148 in 2000). Participants were mainly at-risk for Huntington disease (n = 113), affected (n = 85), and spouses (n = 154). In 2019, participants had a higher mean education level (p < 0.01) and a mean age of 44.1 +- 15.1 years (vs 48.1 +- 11.4 years in 2000, p < 0.01). They had been informed about the risk of being a carrier at around 30 years of age (29.0 +- 14.2 in 2019 vs 32.2 +- 13.8 in 2000, p = 0.09). However, they would inform at an earlier age (<=18 years, 67% vs 59%, p = 0.16). Information on transmission risk had been given primarily by parents (45% vs 30%, p = 0.06). In addition, genetic testing for relatives unaware of their status was recommended more frequently in 2019 (46% vs 32%, p < 0.001). Respondents in 2019 recommended genetic testing more often but overall attitudes towards information and testing have not changed significantly over the 19-year time period since the questionnaire was first delivered even despite recent clinical trials potential disease modifying therapies.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease is cost effective for heterozygous individuals with Huntington disease vs. unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a theoretical cohort of 3,851 couples, where one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. SETTING: N/A. PATIENTS/ANIMALS: None. INTERVENTION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing for couples attempting conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both parents in addition to secondary outcomes of procedure-related loss, spontaneous abortion, termination of pregnancy, and early/normal/late-onset Huntington disease. A willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is lower in cost and higher in effectiveness compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis among couples with one heterozygous Huntington disease individual, making it the dominant strategy. In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing was associated with 77 more QALYs and a cost savings of $46,394,268. All measured outcomes were lower in the IVF preimplantation genetic testing strategy, including 39 fewer procedure-related losses, 39 fewer spontaneous abortions, and 462 fewer terminations of pregnancy. Most notably, in our theoretical cohort of couples, IVF preimplantation genetic testing resulted in 1,079 fewer Huntington disease-affected offspring. Our results were robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is a cost-effective conception strategy compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis when one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. Not only can morbidity and mortality incurred by Huntington disease be mitigated for the offspring with the use of IVF preimplantation genetic testing, but this study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of using IVF preimplantation genetic testing for those with Huntington disease.",

PURPOSE: There is little long-term, population-based data on uptake of prenatal diagnosis for Huntington disease (HD), a late-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the effect of the availability of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) on families' decisions about conventional prenatal diagnosis is not known. We report trends in prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation diagnosis for HD in the United Kingdom since services commenced. METHODS: Long-term UK-wide prospective case record-based service evaluation in 23 UK Regional Genetic Centres 1988-2015, and four UK PGD centers 2002-2015. RESULTS: From 1988 to 2015, 479 prenatal diagnoses were performed in the UK for HD. An exclusion approach was used in 150 (31%). The annual rate of HD prenatal diagnosis has remained around 18 (3.5/million) over 27 years, despite a steady increase in the use of PGD for HD since 2002. CONCLUSION: Although increasing number of couples are choosing either direct or exclusion PGD to prevent HD in their offspring, both direct and exclusion prenatal diagnosis remain important options in a health system where both PGD and prenatal diagnosis are state funded. At-risk couples should be informed of all options available to them, preferably prepregnancy.",

BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication. We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease. RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1 out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100). They were less in favour of gamete donation (48.3+-39.8 out of 100) or pregnancy abstention (43.3+-40.3 out of 100). The greater the perceived severity of the disease, the more reproductive options were considered justified, except for gamete donation. Prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis was a motivation to inform relatives for only 55.3% of participants (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Self-estimated severity minimally impacts opinions towards reproductive options. Medically assisted reproduction procedures are rarely sought and do not motivate familial communication.",

The multidisciplinary study of HD has been the focus of an international collaborating effort of basic and applied research for several decades. HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low.

All registered HD patients in the Cyprus, since 1994, were included. Detailed pedigrees and clinical information were recorded and maps, showing the geographic distribution of HD, were constructed. Requests for genetic testing were also examined. The project identified 58 clinically manifested cases of HD belonging to 19 families. The 16 families of Cypriot origin were concentrated in a confined geographical cluster in southeast Cyprus. In 2015, prevalence of symptomatic HD was 4.64/100 000 population, while incidence was 0.12/100 000 person-years. Prevalence displayed a marked increase during the past 20 years. Disease characteristics of HD patients were similar to those reported in western European populations. Lastly, the uptake of predictive and/or prenatal testing was limited. HD disease characteristics, incidence and prevalence in Cyprus were comparable to western European populations. Together with the geographical clustering observed, these results support the possibility for a relatively recent founder effect of HD in Cyprus, potentially of western European origin.",

OBJECTIVE: To survey neurologists and obtain clinical perceptions of tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in patients with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

Presymptomatic genetic testing allows at-risk individuals to clarify their risk status. Understanding the characteristics and motivations of individuals seeking HD presymptomatic genetic testing better equips genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive and personalized care. The aims of this study were to (1) determine whether the average age when individuals seek presymptomatic HD genetic testing has decreased over time, (2) assess motivations for seeking testing, (3) explore whether there is a relationship between age and motivations, and (4) explore genetic counselors' perceptions of the shift in age. Data from the US HD testing centers (N = 4) were analyzed. A small but statistically significant decrease in age of individuals seeking presymptomatic testing was observed (p = 0.045). HD community members (N = 77) were surveyed regarding presymptomatic testing motivations. Younger individuals were more likely than older individuals to cite \"To learn whether or not you would develop HD\" and \"To make choices about further education or a career\" compared to older individuals (p < 0.05). Conversely, older individuals more frequently cited \"To give children a better idea of their risk\" (p < 0.002). Sixteen percent of genetic counselors surveyed (6/37) perceived a change in age of testing. All of these respondents had provided HD testing for ten or more years and anecdotally believed the age at testing has decreased over time. Study results help providers personalize counseling based on patient's age and serve as a starting point for more research into the relationship between age at testing and motivations for testing.",

BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication. We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease. RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1 out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100). They were less in favour of gamete donation (48.3+-39.8 out of 100) or pregnancy abstention (43.3+-40.3 out of 100). The greater the perceived severity of the disease, the more reproductive options were considered justified, except for gamete donation. Prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis was a motivation to inform relatives for only 55.3% of participants (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Self-estimated severity minimally impacts opinions towards reproductive options. Medically assisted reproduction procedures are rarely sought and do not motivate familial communication.",

The multidisciplinary study of HD has been the focus of an international collaborating effort of basic and applied research for several decades. HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low.

OBJECTIVE: The huntingtin gene is critical for the formation and differentiation of the CNS, which raises questions about the neurodevelopmental effect of CAG expansion mutations within this gene (mHTT) that cause Huntington disease (HD). We sought to test the hypothesis that child and adolescent carriers of mHTT exhibit different brain growth compared to peers without the mutation by conducting structural MRI in youth who are at risk for HD. We also explored whether the length of CAG expansion affects brain development. METHODS: Children and adolescents (age 6-18) with a parent or grandparent diagnosed with HD underwent MRI and blinded genetic testing to confirm the presence or absence of mHTT. Seventy-five individuals were gene-expanded (GE) and 97 individuals were gene-nonexpanded (GNE). The GE group was estimated to be on average 35 years from clinical onset. Following an accelerated longitudinal design, age-related changes in brain regions were estimated. RESULTS: Age-related striatal volume changes differed significantly between the GE and GNE groups, with initial hypertrophy and more rapid volume decline in GE. This pattern was exaggerated with CAG expansion length for CAG > 50. A similar age-dependent group difference was observed for the globus pallidus, but not in other major regions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pathogenesis of HD begins with abnormal brain development. An understanding of potential neurodevelopmental features associated with mHTT may be needed for optimized implementation of preventative gene silencing therapies, such that normal aspects of neurodevelopment are preserved as neurodegeneration is forestalled.",

BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Electrophysiologic abnormalities of the globus pallidus externus have been shown in several disease processes including Parkinson disease, dystonia, and Huntington disease. However, the connectivity, nuclear structure, and function of the globus pallidus externus are still not well-understood. Increasing evidence for the existence of direct corticopallidal connections challenges traditional understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus; nevertheless, these corticopallidal connections have yet to be fully characterized in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the corticopallidal connections of the globus pallidus externus by means of probabilistic diffusion-weighted MR imaging tractography using high-resolution, multishell data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging data from the open-access Human Connectome Project data base were used to perform probabilistic tractography between the globus pallidus externus and the cerebral cortex using 34 distinct cortical regions. Group averages were calculated for normalized percentages of tracts reaching each of the cortical targets, and side-to-side comparison was made. RESULTS: Cortical connectivity was demonstrated between the globus pallidus externus and multiple cortical regions, including direct connection to putative sensorimotor, associative, and limbic areas. Connectivity patterns were not significantly different between the right and left hemispheres with the exception of the frontal pole, which showed a greater number of connections on the right (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo study of the human globus pallidus externus using probabilistic tractography supports the existence of extensive corticopallidal connections and a tripartite functional division, as found in animal studies. A better understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus may help to understand its function and elucidate the effects of programming the higher contacts in pallidal deep brain stimulation.",

Increasing evidence for the existence of direct corticopallidal connections challenges traditional understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus; nevertheless, these corticopallidal connections have yet to be fully characterized in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the corticopallidal connections of the globus pallidus externus by means of probabilistic diffusion-weighted MR imaging tractography using high-resolution, multishell data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging data from the open-access Human Connectome Project data base were used to perform probabilistic tractography between the globus pallidus externus and the cerebral cortex using 34 distinct cortical regions. Group averages were calculated for normalized percentages of tracts reaching each of the cortical targets, and side-to-side comparison was made. RESULTS: Cortical connectivity was demonstrated between the globus pallidus externus and multiple cortical regions, including direct connection to putative sensorimotor, associative, and limbic areas. Connectivity patterns were not significantly different between the right and left hemispheres with the exception of the frontal pole, which showed a greater number of connections on the right (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo study of the human globus pallidus externus using probabilistic tractography supports the existence of extensive corticopallidal connections and a tripartite functional division, as found in animal studies. A better understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus may help to understand its function and elucidate the effects of programming the higher contacts in pallidal deep brain stimulation.",

INTRODUCTION: While individuals with Huntington disease (HD) show memory impairment that indicates hippocampal dysfunction, the available literature does not consistently identify structural evidence for involvement of the whole hippocampus but rather suggests that hippocampal atrophy may be confined to certain hippocampal subregions. METHODS: We processed T1-weighted MRI from IMAGE-HD study using FreeSurfer 7.0 and compared the volumes of the hippocampal subfields among 36 early motor symptomatic (symp-HD), 40 pre-symptomatic (pre-HD), and 36 healthy control individuals across three timepoints over 36 months. RESULTS: Mixed-model analyses revealed significantly lower subfield volumes in symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and control groups, in the subicular regions of the perforant-pathway: presubiculum, subiculum, dentate gyrus, tail, and right molecular layer. These adjoining subfields aggregated into a single principal component, which demonstrated an accelerated rate of atrophy in the symp-HD. Volumes between pre-HD and controls did not show any significant difference. In the combined HD groups, CAG repeat length and disease burden score were associated with presubiculum, molecular layer, tail, and perforant-pathway subfield volumes. Hippocampal left tail and perforant-pathway subfields were associated with motor onset in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal subfields atrophy in early symptomatic HD affects key regions of the perforant-pathway, which may implicate the distinctive memory impairment at this stage of illness. Their volumetric associations with genetic and clinical markers suggest the selective susceptibility of these subfields to mutant Huntingtin and disease progression.",

BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarkers are increasingly used by neurologists, psychiatrists, and ophthalmologists for the diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of neurodegenerative diseases. Long-term data on OCT biomarkers of selected primary and secondary neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease, are already available in part. In addition, there are rare neurodegenerative diseases with early disease onset that may show OCT abnormalities. METHODS: A literature review on the association of OCT biomarkers with neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS beyond Alzheimer's disease is presented. Parkinson's disease, MS, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and lysosomal storage diseases are addressed. RESULTS: Relevant OCT biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases are the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness. Different sectors may be affected depending on the disease entity in addition to global pRFNL reduction. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) is also increasingly used as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography biomarkers are used in an interdisciplinary context. Retinal pathologies should be excluded by an ophthalmologist. While OCT biomarkers are increasingly used clinically in MS, the benefit in other neurodegenerative diseases, especially the rare ones, is less well documented. Further longitudinal studies are required.",

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies. Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant rejection is considered as a vital factor of kidney transplant failure. Therefore, it's necessary to search for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study, we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network analysis.

Providing medical care for people and families affected by Huntington disease (HD) can be a rewarding effort when realistic goals of improved quality of life and optimized functional status are set. Multiple disease symptoms can remit or improve with currently available pharmacologic and behavioral interventions, even though barriers exist that interfere with access to treatment. Connecting expert multidisciplinary teams with community-based care, developing treatment guidelines, and involving the HD family community in quality improvements can achieve an integrated system of health care delivery. Engaging people with HD in high-quality compassionate care will not only improve lives, it will also encourage participation in clinical trials that search for disease-modifying treatments that will reduce or bring the suffering of HD to an end.",

Cognitive and behavioral (psychiatric) changes in HD are summarized and implications for ongoing advancement in our knowledge of prodromal HD are suggested. The earliest detected cognitive changes are observed in the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Interference, Stroop Color and Word Test-interference condition, and Trail Making Test. Cognitive changes in the middle and near motor diagnostic stages of prodromal HD involve nearly every cognitive test administered and the greatest changes over time (i.e., slopes) are found in those prodromal HD participants who are nearest to motor diagnosis. Psychiatric changes demonstrate significant worsening over time and remain elevated compared with healthy controls throughout the prodromal disease course. Psychiatric and behavior changes in prodromal HD are much lower than that obtained using cognitive assessment, although the psychiatric and behavioral changes represent symptoms most debilitating to independent capacity and wellness.",

For this purpose, regression analysis was performed, showing that the Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), psychoticism, somatization and paranoid ideation dimensions assume predictive value in the middle and long-term impact for total anxiety and PSDI. The result of PST was not a relevant predictor. The application of an evaluation instrument of various psychopathological dimensions played a fundamental role in the detection of clinical situations that may arise several years later after PST. Attention should be paid to providing psychological support to persons at-risk who, at the pre-test phase, present some psychopathology indices before pursuing with genetic testing.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a late onset ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine ( CAG) triplet repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene which was discovered in 1993. The PHAROS study is a unique observational study of 1001 individuals at risk for HD who had not been previously tested for HD and who had no plans to do so. In this cohort, 104 (10%) individuals changed their minds and chose to be tested during the course of the study but outside of the study protocol. Baseline behavioral scores, especially apathy, were more strongly associated with later genetic testing than motor and chorea scores, particularly among subjects with expanded CAG repeat length. In the CAG expanded group, those choosing to be tested were older and had more chorea and higher scores on the behavioral section of the unified Huntington's disease rating scale at baseline than those not choosing to be tested. Following genetic testing, 56% of subjects with CAG < 37 had less depression when compared to prior to testing, but depression generally stayed the same or increased for 64% of subjects in the expanded group. This finding suggests that approaches to testing must continue to be cautious, with appropriate medical, psychological and social support.",

OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioral symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilizes postmortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles. METHODS: Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorized into 2 groups: \"motor\" or \"mood.\" RESULTS: The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, postmortem delay, CAG repeat in the IT15 gene, or age at death. INTERPRETATION: This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provides novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia, and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain.

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

Quantitation of huntingtin protein in the brain is needed, both as a marker of Huntington disease (HD) progression and for use in clinical gene silencing trials. Measurement of huntingtin in cerebrospinal fluid could be a biomarker of brain huntingtin, but traditional protein quantitation methods have failed to detect huntingtin in cerebrospinal fluid. Using micro-bead based immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM), we have developed a highly sensitive mutant huntingtin detection assay. The sensitivity of huntingtin IP-FCM enables accurate detection of mutant huntingtin protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of HD patients and model mice, demonstrating that mutant huntingtin levels in cerebrospinal fluid reflect brain levels, increasing with disease stage and decreasing following brain huntingtin suppression. This technique has potential applications as a research tool and as a clinical biomarker. ",

BACKGROUND: Imaging biomarkers sensitive to Huntington's disease (HD) during the premanifest phase preceding motor diagnosis may accelerate identification and evaluation of potential therapies. For this purpose, quantitative MRI sensitive to tissue microstructure and metabolism may hold great potential. We investigated the potential value of T1rho relaxation to detect pathological changes in premanifest HD (preHD) relative to other quantitative relaxation parameters. METHODS: Quantitative MR parametric mapping was used to assess differences between 50 preHD subjects and 26 age- and sex-matched controls. Subjects with preHD were classified into two progression groups based on their CAG-age product (CAP) score; a high and a low/moderate CAP group. Voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses were used to assess changes in the quantitative relaxation times. RESULTS: T1rho showed a significant increase in the relaxation times in the high-CAP group, as compared to controls, largely in the striatum. The T1rho changes in the preHD subjects showed a significant relationship with CAP score. No significant changes in T2 or T2* relaxation times were found in the striatum. T2* relaxation changes were found in the globus pallidus, but no significant changes with disease progression were found. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that quantitative T1rho mapping may provide a useful marker for assessing disease progression in HD. The absence of T2 changes suggests that the T1rho abnormalities are unlikely owing to altered water content or tissue structure. The established sensitivity of T1rho to pH and glucose suggests that these factors are altered in HD perhaps owing to abnormal mitochondrial function.",

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sleep pattern and the motor activity during sleep in a cohort of patients affected by Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Thirty HD patients, 16 women and 14 men (mean age 57.3 +- 12.2 y); 30 matched healthy controls (mean age 56.5 +- 11.8 y). INTERVENTIONS: Subjective sleep evaluation: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); Berlin's Questionnaire, interview for restless legs syndrome (RLS), questionnaire for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Clinical evaluation: disease duration, clinical severity (unified Huntington disease motor rating scale [UHDMRS]), genetic tests. Laboratory-based full-night attended video-polysomnography (V-PSG). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The duration of the disease was 9.4 +- 4.4 y, UHMDRS score was 55.5 +- 23.4, CAG repeats were 44.3 +- 4.1. Body mass index was 21.9 +- 4.0 kg/m(2). No patients or caregivers reported poor sleep quality. Two patients reported symptoms of RLS. Eight patients had an ESS score >= 9. Eight patients had high risk of obstructive sleep apnea. At the RBD questionnaire, two patients had a pathological score. HD patients, compared to controls, showed shorter sleep, reduced sleep efficiency index, and increased arousals and awakenings. Four patients presented with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Periodic limb movements (PLMs) during wake and sleep were observed in all patients. No episode of RBD was observed in the V-PSG recordings, and no patients showed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia. The disease duration correlated with ESS score (P < 0.02). UHMDRS correlated positively with the ESS score (P < 0.005), and negatively with the percentage of REM sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Huntington disease showed a severe sleep disruption and a high prevalence of periodic limb movements, but no evidence of sleep disordered breathing or REM sleep behavior disorder.",

Cell replacement using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron.

Application of molecular neuroimaging using positron emission tomographic techniques to assess pediatric neurodegenerative disorders has been limited, unlike in adults where positron emission tomography has contributed to clinical diagnosis, monitoring of neurodegenerative disease progression, and assessment of novel therapeutic approaches. Yet, there is a huge unexplored potential of molecular imaging to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders in children and provide radiological biomarkers that can be applied clinically. The obstacles in performing PET scans on children include sedation, radiation exposure, and access but, as will be illustrated, these barriers can be easily overcome. This review summarizes findings from PET studies that have been performed over the past three decades on children with various neurodegenerative disorders, including the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, juvenile Huntington disease, Wilson disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Dravet syndrome, dystonia, mitochondrial disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, lysosomal storage diseases, dysmyelinating disorders, Rett syndrome, neurotransmitter disorders, glucose transporter Glut 1 deficiency, and Lesch-Nyhan disease. Because positron emission tomographic scans have often been clinically useful and have contributed to the management of these disorders, we suggest that the time has come for glucose metabolism positron emission tomographic scans to be reimbursed by insurance carriers for children with neurodegenerative disorders, and not restricted only to epilepsy surgery evaluation.",

OBJECTIVE: After MRI studies suggested the efficacy of ethyl-EPA in reducing the progressive brain atrophy in Huntington disease (HD), trials were conducted to test its efficacy as a treatment for HD. Trials that continued for 6 months did not find any significant improvement, urging discontinuation of the drug. However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of motor functions in these patients. METHODS: We searched 12 electronic databases to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening, only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score-4 in both fixed and quality effect models [MD = -2.720, 95% CI (-4.76, -.68), p = 0.009; MD = -2.225, 95% CI (-3.842, -0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score showed significant results [MD = -1.013, 95% CI (-1.793, -0.233), p = 0.011] in only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming test or symbol digit modality. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement of motor scores only after 12 months. These results should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies had assessed the efficacy of ethyl-EPA after 12 months with one of them having a 6-month open-label phase.",

                    "text": "Efficacy and Safety of Fixed-Dose Deutetrabenazine in Children and Adolescents for Tics Associated With Tourette Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor and phonic tics, often accompanied by behavioral and psychiatric comorbidities. Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved in the US for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. Objective: To report results of the ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in Tourette Syndrome 2) study examining deutetrabenazine for treatment of Tourette syndrome. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted over 8 weeks with a 1-week follow-up (June 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019). Children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and active tics causing distress or impairment were enrolled in the study. Children were recruited from 52 sites in 10 countries. Data were analyzed from February 4 to April 22, 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/d), high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/d), or a matching placebo, which were titrated over 4 weeks to the target dose followed by a 4-week maintenance period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine. Key secondary end points included changes in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine, Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression score, Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact score, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and questionnaires. Results: The study included 158 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 11.7 [2.6] years). A total of 119 participants (75%) were boys; 7 (4%), Asian; 1 (1%), Black; 32 (20%), Hispanic; 4 (3%), Native American; 135 (85%), White; 2 (1%), multiracial; 9 (6%), other race; and 1 (0.6%), of unknown ethnic origin. Fifty-two participants were randomized to the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 54 to the low-dose deutetrabenazine group, and 52 to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics for participants were similar between groups. Of the total 158 participants, 64 (41%) were aged 6 to 11 years, and 94 (59%) were aged 12 to 16 years at baseline. Mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 (2.8) years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 (6.6) points. At week 8, the difference in YGTSS-TTS was not significant between the high-dose deutetrabenazine and placebo groups (least-squares mean difference, -0.8 points; 95% CI, -3.9 to 2.3 points; P = .60; Cohen d, -0.11). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 34 participants (65%) treated with high-dose deutetrabenazine, 24 (44%) treated with low-dose deutetrabenazine, and 25 (49%) treated with placebo and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this fixed-dose randomized clinical trial of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03571256.",

Impairment of \"protein quality control\" in neurons is associated with etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The worn-out products of cell metabolism should be safely eliminated via the proteasome, autophago-lysosome and exocytosis. Insufficient activity of these degradation mechanisms within neurons leads to the accumulation of toxic protein oligomers, which represent a starting material for development of neurodegenerative proteinopathy. The spectrum of CNS linked proteinopathies is particularly broad and includes Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia, Pick disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many others. Although the primary events in etiopathogenesis of sporadic forms of these diseases are still unknown, it is clear that aging, in connection with decreased activity of ubiquitin proteasome system, is the most significant risk factor. In this review we discuss the pathogenic role and intracellular fate of the candidate molecules associated with onset and progression of AD and PD, the protein tau and alpha-synuclein in context with the function of ubiquitin proteasome system. We also discuss the possibility whether or not the strategies focused to re-establishment of neuroproteostasis via accelerated clearance of damaged proteins in proteasome could be a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of major neurodegenerative diseases.",

PURPOSE: Pridopidine is an investigational drug for Huntington disease (HD). Pridopidine was originally thought to act as a dopamine stabilizer. However, pridopidine shows highest affinity to the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) and enhances neuroprotection via the S1R in preclinical studies. Using [18F] fluspidine and [18F] fallypride PET, the purpose of this study was to assess in vivo target engagement/receptor occupancy of pridopidine to the S1R and dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) at clinical relevant doses in healthy volunteers (HVs) and as proof-of-concept in a small number of patients with HD. METHODS: Using [18F] fluspidine PET (300 MBq, 0-90 min), 11 male HVs (pridopidine 0.5 to 90 mg; six dose groups) and three male patients with HD (pridopidine 90 mg) were investigated twice, without and 2 h after single dose of pridopidine. Using [18F] fallypride PET (200 MBq, 0-210 min), four male HVs were studied without and 2 h following pridopidine administration (90 mg). Receptor occupancy was analyzed by the Lassen plot. RESULTS: S1R occupancy as function of pridopidine dose (or plasma concentration) in HVs could be described by a three-parameter Hill equation with a Hill coefficient larger than one. A high degree of S1R occupancy (87% to 91%) was found throughout the brain at pridopidine doses ranging from 22.5 to 90 mg. S1R occupancy was 43% at 1 mg pridopidine. In contrast, at 90 mg pridopidine, the D2/D3R occupancy was only minimal (~ 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our PET findings indicate that at clinically relevant single dose of 90 mg, pridopidine acts as a selective S1R ligand showing near to complete S1R occupancy with negligible occupancy of the D2/D3R. The dose S1R occupancy relationship suggests cooperative binding of pridopidine to the S1R. Our findings provide significant clarification about pridopidine's mechanism of action and support further use of the 45-mg twice-daily dose to achieve full and selective targeting of the S1R in future clinical trials of neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) have impairments in performing dual-tasks, however, there is limited information about the effects of changing postural and cognitive demands as well as which measures are best suited as markers of underlying motor-cognitive interference. METHODS: Forty-three individuals with HD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed single tasks of walking (Timed Up & Go (TUG), 7 m walk), standing (feet together, feet apart and foam surface) and seated cognitive performance (Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting test) and dual cognitive-motor tasks while standing (+ Stroop) and walking (+ DKEFS, TUG cognitive). APDM Opal sensors recorded measures of postural sway and time to complete motor tasks. RESULTS: Individuals with HD had a greater increase in standing postural sway compared to HC from single to dual-tasks and with changes to support surface. Both groups demonstrated a decrease in gait performance during the TUG cognitive, however, this difference was greater in people with HD compared to HC. While those with HD showed a greater dual-task motor cost compared to HC, both groups behaved similarly as condition complexity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Standing postural sway is a more sensitive marker of instability than change in standard gait speed, particularly under dual-task conditions. The more complex TUG cognitive is a sensitive measure of walking dual-task performance.

                    "text": "Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 Activation Improves Motor Performance and Reduces Pathology in Heterozygous zQ175 Huntington Disease Mice. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

BACKGROUND: Naringenin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory flavonoid which has been widely used as a therapeutic agent in various toxic models. However, few studies have clearly discussed the neuromodulatory effects of naringenin against different neurodegenerative disorders. AIM: We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of naringenin against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in rats. METHODS: Albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered group, received saline. Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received naringenin (50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP administration. On the 5th day, neurobehavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes and the striatum tissue was used for analysis of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and serotonin (5-HT) levels. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. RESULTS: Our results showed that naringenin co-treatment provides neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced neurological disorders. Naringenin also increased the MAO activity and 5-HT levels in the striatum. Moreover, co-treatment with naringenin reduced the expression of GFAP protein in the striatal part and significantly attenuated the neuronal cell death. The findings of the present study suggest that naringenin provides neuroprotection and mitigates neurobehavioral alterations in experimental rats. CONCLUSION: The results show that co-treatment with naringenin ameliorates 3-NP-induced HD-like symptoms in rats.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q, n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001). No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically. Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatment is available. A better understanding of the pathology, and identification of biomarkers will facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments. HD is potentially a good model of a neurodegenerative disease for development of biomarkers because it is an autosomal-dominant disease with complete penetrance, caused by a single gene mutation, in which the neurodegenerative process can be assessed many years before onset of signs and symptoms of manifest disease. Previous MRI studies have detected abnormalities in gray and white matter starting in premanifest stages. However, the understanding of how these abnormalities are related, both in time and space, is still incomplete. In this study, we combined deep gray matter shape diffeomorphometry and white matter DTI analysis in order to provide a better mapping of pathology in the deep gray matter and subcortical white matter in premanifest HD. We used 296 MRI scans from the PREDICT-HD database. Atrophy in the deep gray matter, thalamus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens was analyzed by surface based morphometry, and while white matter abnormalities were analyzed in (i) regions of interest surrounding these structures, using (ii) tractography-based analysis, and using (iii) whole brain atlas-based analysis. We detected atrophy in the deep gray matter, particularly in putamen, from early premanifest stages. The atrophy was greater both in extent and effect size in cases with longer exposure to the effects of the CAG expansion mutation (as assessed by greater CAP-scores), and preceded detectible abnormalities in the white matter. Near the predicted onset of manifest HD, the MD increase was widespread, with highest indices in the deep and posterior white matter. This type of in-vivo macroscopic mapping of HD brain abnormalities can potentially indicate when and where therapeutics could be targeted to delay the onset or slow the disease progression. ",

For this purpose, regression analysis was performed, showing that the Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI), psychoticism, somatization and paranoid ideation dimensions assume predictive value in the middle and long-term impact for total anxiety and PSDI. The result of PST was not a relevant predictor. The application of an evaluation instrument of various psychopathological dimensions played a fundamental role in the detection of clinical situations that may arise several years later after PST.

In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: At the end of life, anxious attitudes concerning the dying process are common in patients in Palliative Care. Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

                    "text": "Clinical recommendations to guide physical therapy practice for Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological disorder that causes severe motor symptoms that adversely impact health-related quality of life. Patient-reported physical function outcome measures in HD have shown cross-sectional evidence of validity, but responsiveness has not yet been assessed. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the responsiveness of the Huntington Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (HDQLIFE) and the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) physical function measures in persons with HD. METHODS: A total of 347 participants completed baseline and at least 1 follow-up (12-month and 24-month) measure (HDQLIFE Chorea, HDQLIFE Swallowing Difficulties, HDQLIFE Speech Difficulties, Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function, and/or Neuro-QoL Lower Extremity Function). Of the participants that completed the baseline assessment, 338 (90.9%) completed the 12-month assessment, and 293 (78.8%) completed the 24-month assessment. Standardized response means and general linear models evaluated whether the physical function measures were responsive to self-reported and clinician-rated change over time. RESULTS: Small to moderate effect sizes for the standardized response means supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness of the HDQLIFE and Neuro-QoL measures for those with either self-reported or clinician-rated declines in function. General linear models supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness for all HRQOL measures relative to self-reported declines in health, but generally only 24-month responsiveness was supported relative to clinician-rated declines in function. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analyses indicate that the HDQLIFE and the Neuro-QoL physical function measures are sensitive to change over time in individuals with HD. Thus, these scales exhibit evidence of responsiveness and may be useful outcome measures in future clinical trials.   2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

General linear models supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness for all HRQOL measures relative to self-reported declines in health, but generally only 24-month responsiveness was supported relative to clinician-rated declines in function. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analyses indicate that the HDQLIFE and the Neuro-QoL physical function measures are sensitive to change over time in individuals with HD. Thus, these scales exhibit evidence of responsiveness and may be useful outcome measures in future clinical trials.   2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological disorder that causes severe motor symptoms that adversely impact health-related quality of life. Patient-reported physical function outcome measures in HD have shown cross-sectional evidence of validity, but responsiveness has not yet been assessed. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the responsiveness of the Huntington Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (HDQLIFE) and the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) physical function measures in persons with HD. METHODS: A total of 347 participants completed baseline and at least 1 follow-up (12-month and 24-month) measure (HDQLIFE Chorea, HDQLIFE Swallowing Difficulties, HDQLIFE Speech Difficulties, Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function, and/or Neuro-QoL Lower Extremity Function). Of the participants that completed the baseline assessment, 338 (90.9%) completed the 12-month assessment, and 293 (78.8%) completed the 24-month assessment. Standardized response means and general linear models evaluated whether the physical function measures were responsive to self-reported and clinician-rated change over time. RESULTS: Small to moderate effect sizes for the standardized response means supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness of the HDQLIFE and Neuro-QoL measures for those with either self-reported or clinician-rated declines in function. General linear models supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness for all HRQOL measures relative to self-reported declines in health, but generally only 24-month responsiveness was supported relative to clinician-rated declines in function.

Cognitive, motor and psychiatric changes in prodromal Huntington's disease have nurtured the emergent need for early interventions. Preventive clinical trials for Huntington's disease, however, are limited by a shortage of suitable measures that could serve as surrogate outcomes. Measures of intrinsic functional connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging are of keen interest. Yet recent studies suggest circumscribed abnormalities in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity in prodromal Huntington's disease, despite the spectrum of behavioural changes preceding a manifest diagnosis. The present study used two complementary analytical approaches to examine whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity in prodromal Huntington's disease. Network topology was studied using graph theory and simple functional connectivity amongst brain regions was explored using the network-based statistic. Participants consisted of gene-negative controls (n = 16) and prodromal Huntington's disease individuals (n = 48) with various stages of disease progression to examine the influence of disease burden on intrinsic connectivity. Graph theory analyses showed that global network interconnectivity approximated a random network topology as proximity to diagnosis neared and this was associated with decreased connectivity amongst highly-connected rich-club network hubs, which integrate processing from diverse brain regions. However, functional segregation within the global network (average clustering) was preserved. Functional segregation was also largely maintained at the local level, except for the notable decrease in the diversity of anterior insula intermodular-interconnections (participation coefficient), irrespective of disease burden. In contrast, network-based statistic analyses revealed patterns of weakened frontostriatal connections and strengthened frontal-posterior connections that evolved as disease burden increased. These disturbances were often related to long-range connections involving peripheral nodes and interhemispheric connections. A strong association was found between weaker connectivity and decreased rich-club organization, indicating that whole-brain simple connectivity partially expressed disturbances in the communication of highly-connected hubs. However, network topology and network-based statistic connectivity metrics did not correlate with key markers of executive dysfunction (Stroop Test, Trail Making Test) in prodromal Huntington's disease, which instead were related to whole-brain connectivity disturbances in nodes (right inferior parietal, right thalamus, left anterior cingulate) that exhibited multiple aberrant connections and that mediate executive control. Altogether, our results show for the first time a largely disease burden-dependent functional reorganization of whole-brain networks in prodromal Huntington's disease. Both analytic approaches provided a unique window into brain reorganization that was not related to brain atrophy or motor symptoms. Longitudinal studies currently in progress will chart the course of functional changes to determine the most sensitive markers of disease progression. ",

This qualitative study gathered opinions about genetic testing from people who received presymptomatic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) 20-30 years ago and have lived with the implications of that testing for decades. During the last section of a semi-structured interview, participants were asked open-ended questions about their opinions on the importance of autonomy in the decision to be tested for HD, whether a formal HD testing protocol is necessary, whether physician ordering for HD is acceptable without a formal protocol, whether online direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for HD is acceptable, and whether incidental/secondary findings should be returned in the context of whole exome/genome sequencing. Most-but not all-participants were in favor of an individual's right to decide whether and when to pursue HD testing, use of a formal HD testing protocol, and returning medically actionable secondary findings. However, the majority of participants were opposed not only to physician ordering and DTC HD testing in the absence of a formal protocol but also to returning a secondary finding of an expanded HD allele. This study presents the opinions of a unique and extremely well-informed cohort on issues that need to be taken into careful consideration by genetic counselors and other medical professionals who are developing genetic testing protocols, making decisions about the availability of genetic tests, and making decisions about whether and how to return incidental findings.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the EEG modifications in patients with Huntington disease (HD) compared with controls, by means of the exact LOw REsolution Tomography (eLORETA) software. We evaluated EEG changes during wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Moreover, we reviewed the literature concerning EEG modifications in HD. Twenty-three consecutive adult patients affected by HD were enrolled, 14 women and 9 men, mean age was 57.0 +- 12.4 years. Control subjects were healthy volunteers (mean age 58.2 +- 14.6 years). EEG and polygraphic recordings were performed during wake (before sleep) and during sleep. Sources of EEG activities were determined using the eLORETA software. In wake EEG, significant differences between patients and controls were detected in the delta frequency band (threshold T = +-4.606; P < .01) in the Brodmann areas (BAs) 3, 4, and 6 bilaterally. In NREM sleep, HD patients showed increased alpha power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in BAs 4 and 6 bilaterally; decreased theta power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in the BAs 23, 29, and 30; and decreased beta power (T = +-4.516; P < .01) in the left BA 30. During REM, HD patients presented decreased theta and alpha power (threshold T = +-4.640; P < .01) in the BAs 23, 29, 30, and 31 bilaterally. In conclusion, EEG data suggest a motor cortex dysfunction during wake and sleep in HD patients, which correlates with the clinical and polysomnographic evidence of increased motor activity during wake and NREM, and nearly absent motor abnormalities in REM.",

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development of CRC. With the deep understanding of TME function, growing studies have demonstrated that alteration in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and gene expressions are associated with clinical outcomes of various tumors. In this study, we aimed to recognize critical prognostic genes involved in immune states in TME of CRC. Hence, the proportion of TICs and the number of immune and stromal components in CRC samples from TCGA datasets were calculated by the use of CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE calculation methods. Different assays were applied to collect differential expression genes (DEGs) shared by the ImmuneScore and StromalScore. DEGs were further analyzed by the use of univariate Cox regression. Our attention focused on neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) which was highly expressed in CRC specimens and associated with an advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis of CRC patients. KEGG assays revealed that NAV3 may be involved in Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, FoxO signaling pathway, and human papillomavirus infection. Correlation assays showed that macrophage M0 and B cells memory, NK cells activated, dendritic cells resting, T cells CD4 memory activated, and T cells CD8 were correlated with NAV3 expression, indicating that NAV3 may represent the immune status of TME. Finally, RT-PCR confirmed that NAV3 expression was distinctly increased in CRC cells, and its knockdown suppressed the proliferation of CRC cells. Overall, NAV3 could be used as a novel predictor for TME of CRC and might be a novel prognostic biomarker. In the future, drugs targeting NAV3 might be developed as a potential immunotherapy for CRC patients.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between substances of abuse and age at motor onset (AMO) in patients with Huntington disease (HD) in a large and diverse patient population. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study of the Enroll-HD database. Participants were determined to belong to 1 of 3 substance abuse groups: (1) tobacco abusers, (2) alcohol abusers, and (3) drug abusers. A group of participants who had never abused substances served as a control group. The average AMO of patients in the substance abuse groups was compared to the control group. The number of CAG repeats was used as a covariate in all analyses. RESULTS: The average difference in AMOs of participants in the tobacco (n = 566), alcohol (n = 374), and drug abuse groups (n = 217) compared to the control group (n = 692) were 2.3 (F1, 1,258 = 33.8, p < 0.0001), 1.0 (F1, 1,066 = 4.2, p = 0.04), and 3.3 (F1, 909 = 29.7, p < 0.0001) years earlier, respectively. In all substance abuse groups, the AMO was lowered to a greater degree in female participants than it was in male participants. CONCLUSIONS: Substances of abuse have a strong effect on the AMO in patients with HD. These effects seem to be amplified in women with HD compared to men. These results may provide a safe intervention capable of adding disease-free years to patients with HD.",

The results from this Ionis trial have gained much attention from the patient community and the oligonucleotide therapeutics field, since it is the first trial targeting the cause of HD, namely the mutant huntingtin protein, using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The press release also states that the primary endpoints of the study (safety and tolerability) were met, but does not contain data.

                    "text": "Safety and Efficacy of Flexible-Dose Deutetrabenazine in Children and Adolescents With Tourette Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor and phonic tics; treatments for tics are associated with safety concerns. Deutetrabenazine is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia in adults. Objective: To examine whether deutetrabenazine is effective and safe for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in children and adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2/3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-titration study included children and adolescents (aged 6-16 years) with Tourette syndrome with active tics causing distress or impairment (ie, Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score [YGTSS-TTS] >=20). The trial was conducted over 12 weeks, with 1 week of follow-up from February 2018 to November 2019 at 36 centers in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Russia, Serbia, and Spain. Data analysis was conducted from January 31 to April 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive deutetrabenazine or placebo, titrated during 7 weeks to an optimal level, followed by a 5-week maintenance period. The maximum total daily deutetrabenazine dose was 48 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 12 in YGTSS-TTS. Key secondary end points included changes in Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression, Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, questionnaires, and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 119 participants were randomized to deutetrabenazine (59 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.5] years; 53 [90%] boys; 49 [83%] White; 3 [5%] Black) and placebo (60 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.6] years; 51 [85%] boys; 53 [88%] White; 3 [5%] Black). At week 12, the difference in YGTSS-TTS score was not significant between deutetrabenazine and placebo (least squares mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -4.1 to 2.8; P = .69; Cohen d, -0.07). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 38 patients (66%) and 33 patients (56%) receiving deutetrabenazine and placebo, respectively, and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. These results may be informative for future studies of treatments for tics in Tourette syndrome. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03452943.",

The scope of our study is to investigate the expansion frequency in a Greek HD-L cohort and the meta-analysis of all published cases. This will be of use in genetic counseling of these cases. Methods: A cohort of 74 patients with HD-L and 67 healthy controls were screened for the C9orf72 expansion status. Case-controls comparison was assessed with the Pearson's chi-square statistic for a 2 x 2 table.A systematic database search was conducted and seven studies, including the current study, were considered eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis considering a total of 812 patients with HD phenocopies. Pooled mutation frequency was calculated using a Random Effects model or the Mantel-Haezsel fixed effects model, depending on the observed heterogeneity. Results: In our cohort, one patient was found to have a pathologic expansion of C9orf72, and none from the control group (chi-square: 0.91, p-value: 0.34). Pooled mutation frequency was found at 2% (CI: 1-3%) with low heterogeneity (I2:15%).

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) have impairments in performing dual-tasks, however, there is limited information about the effects of changing postural and cognitive demands as well as which measures are best suited as markers of underlying motor-cognitive interference. METHODS: Forty-three individuals with HD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed single tasks of walking (Timed Up & Go (TUG), 7 m walk), standing (feet together, feet apart and foam surface) and seated cognitive performance (Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting test) and dual cognitive-motor tasks while standing (+ Stroop) and walking (+ DKEFS, TUG cognitive). APDM Opal sensors recorded measures of postural sway and time to complete motor tasks. RESULTS: Individuals with HD had a greater increase in standing postural sway compared to HC from single to dual-tasks and with changes to support surface. Both groups demonstrated a decrease in gait performance during the TUG cognitive, however, this difference was greater in people with HD compared to HC. While those with HD showed a greater dual-task motor cost compared to HC, both groups behaved similarly as condition complexity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Standing postural sway is a more sensitive marker of instability than change in standard gait speed, particularly under dual-task conditions. The more complex TUG cognitive is a sensitive measure of walking dual-task performance. The results of this study provide insights about the nature of motor-cognitive impairments in HD and provide support for a distinction between static and dynamic postural control mechanisms during performance of dual-tasks.",

IMPORTANCE: Greater body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is associated with improved survival among persons with Huntington disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Weight loss is common among persons with Parkinson disease (PD) and is associated with worse quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between change in BMI, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and total scores, and survival among persons with PD and to test whether there is a positive association between BMI at randomization and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analysis (from May 27, 2014, to October 13, 2015) of longitudinal data (3-6 years) from 1673 participants who started the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Exploratory Trials in PD Long-term Study-1 (NET-PD LS-1). This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of creatine monohydrate (10 g/d) that was performed at 45 sites throughout the United States and Canada. Participants with early (within 5 years of diagnosis) and treated (receiving dopaminergic therapy) PD were enrolled from March 2007 to May 2010 and followed up until September 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change across time in motor UPDRS score, change across time in total UPDRS score, and time to death. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of BMI on the change in motor and total UPDRS scores after controlling for covariates. Survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models of time to death. A participant's BMI was measured at randomization, and BMI trajectory groups were classified according to whether participants experienced weight loss (\"decreasing BMI\"), weight stability (\"stable BMI\"), or weight gain (\"increasing BMI\") during the study. RESULTS: Of the 1673 participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [9.6] years; 1074 [64.2%] were male), 158 (9.4%) experienced weight loss (decreasing BMI), whereas 233 (13.9%) experienced weight gain (increasing BMI). After adjusting for covariates, we found that the weight-loss group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score increased by 1.48 (0.28) (P < .001) more points per visit than the weight-stable group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score. The weight-gain group's mean (SE) motor UPDRS score decreased by -0.51 (0.24) (P = .03) points per visit, relative to the weight-stable group. While there was an unadjusted difference in survival between the 3 BMI trajectory groups (log-rank P < .001), this was not significant after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Change in BMI was inversely associated with change in motor and total UPDRS scores in the NET-PD LS-1. Change in BMI was not associated with survival; however, these results were limited by the low number of deaths in the NET-PD LS-1. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00449865.",

Application of molecular neuroimaging using positron emission tomographic techniques to assess pediatric neurodegenerative disorders has been limited, unlike in adults where positron emission tomography has contributed to clinical diagnosis, monitoring of neurodegenerative disease progression, and assessment of novel therapeutic approaches. Yet, there is a huge unexplored potential of molecular imaging to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders in children and provide radiological biomarkers that can be applied clinically. The obstacles in performing PET scans on children include sedation, radiation exposure, and access but, as will be illustrated, these barriers can be easily overcome. This review summarizes findings from PET studies that have been performed over the past three decades on children with various neurodegenerative disorders, including the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, juvenile Huntington disease, Wilson disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, Dravet syndrome, dystonia, mitochondrial disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, lysosomal storage diseases, dysmyelinating disorders, Rett syndrome, neurotransmitter disorders, glucose transporter Glut 1 deficiency, and Lesch-Nyhan disease. Because positron emission tomographic scans have often been clinically useful and have contributed to the management of these disorders, we suggest that the time has come for glucose metabolism positron emission tomographic scans to be reimbursed by insurance carriers for children with neurodegenerative disorders, and not restricted only to epilepsy surgery evaluation.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of microRNA (miRNA) levels in CSF as biomarkers for prodromal Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: miRNA levels were measured in CSF from 60 PREDICT-HD study participants using the HTG protocol. Using a CAG-Age Product score, 30 prodromal HD participants were selected based on estimated probability of imminent clinical diagnosis of HD (i.e., low, medium, high; n = 10/group). For comparison, participants already diagnosed (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were also selected. RESULTS: A total of 2,081 miRNAs were detected and 6 were significantly increased in the prodromal HD gene expansion carriers vs controls at false discovery rate q < 0.05 (miR-520f-3p, miR-135b-3p, miR-4317, miR-3928-5p, miR-8082, miR-140-5p). Evaluating the miRNA levels in each of the HD risk categories, all 6 revealed a pattern of increasing abundance from control to low risk, and from low risk to medium risk, which then leveled off from the medium to high risk and HD diagnosed groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports miRNAs as CSF biomarkers of prodromal and diagnosed HD. Importantly, miRNAs were detected in the prodromal HD groups furthest from diagnosis where treatments are likely to be most consequential and meaningful. The identification of potential biomarkers in the disease prodrome may prove useful in evaluating treatments that may postpone disease onset. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00051324.",

OBJECTIVE: Normalization to an appropriate reference region in F-FDG PET imaging may enhance diagnostic performance in Huntington disease (HD). We aimed to identify stable brain areas that could be used to model neurometabolic degeneration in HD correlating imaging (SUVrvalues at the basal ganglia [BBGG]) and clinical parameters (disease burden score [DBS]). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed brain F-FDG PET/CT in 38 manifest HD patients (meanage +- SD, 54 +- 14.3 years; CAGrepeats +- SD, 44.2 +- 3.1), 20 premanifest HD patients (meanage +- SD, 42.7 +- 11.7 years; CAGrepeats +- SD, 40 +- 3.8), and 18 healthy controls (NC; meanage +- SD, 45 +- 13.2 years). For quantitative analysis, we selected (a) defined reference regions from the Montreal Neurological Institute space atlas (pons, whole cerebellum, cerebral white matter, thalamus, and a pons-cerebellar vermis region of interest), and (b) reference clusters obtained by voxelwise statistical comparison across groups (P < 0.05 FWE; extent voxel threshold k = 200). Each candidate reference region and reference cluster was quantitatively assessed using imaging and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Comparing HD and NC groups, we obtained a reference cluster in the cerebellum, and in temporal and frontal lobes. Comparing manifest HD and premanifest HD patients, we observed reference clusters in the cerebellum, pons, thalamus, parietal lobe, and cuneus. The set of reference regions showed a significant correlation between SUVrvalues at the BBGG and DBS in all HD patients. In premanifest HD patients, the correlation between SUVrvalues at the BBGG and DBS was significant using the pons-cerebellar vermis region of interest, the thalamus as defined reference regions, and the pons and thalamus as reference clusters. In manifest HD patients, the correlation was significant using the temporal and white matter frontal lobe clusters. Variance between SUVrvalues in the set of reference regions and reference clusters was minimal within NC. CONCLUSIONS: The pons may be a stable and reliable region to calculate SUVrvalues to model the neurometabolic degeneration in quantitative F-FDG PET imaging in HD.",

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a form of prenatal diagnosis applied to potential parents with known carrier status of a genetic disease, such as Huntington disease. It employs the use of polymerase chain reaction to amplify single cells from early embryos obtained with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques. PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring. Recent advances in sequencing may allow for higher success rates as the chromosomally abnormal embryos will be identified more easily and the embryos with the highest chance of survival will be transferred.",

OBJECTIVES: People with Huntington's disease (HD) experience poor social quality of life, relationship breakdown, and social withdrawal, which are mediated to some extent by socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy and disinhibition. Social cognitive symptoms, such as impaired emotion recognition, also occur in HD, however, the extent of their association with these socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms is unknown. Our study examined the relationship between emotion recognition and symptom ratings of apathy and disinhibition in HD. METHODS: Thirty-two people with premanifest or symptomatic-HD completed Part 1 of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT), which is a facial emotion recognition task. In addition, we obtained severity ratings for apathy and disinhibition on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) from a close family member. Our analyses used motor symptom severity as a proxy for disease progression. RESULTS: Emotion recognition performance was significantly associated with family-ratings of apathy, above and beyond their shared association with disease severity. We found a similar pattern for disinhibition ratings, which fell short of statistical significance. As expected, worse emotion recognition performance was correlated with higher severity in FrSBe symptom ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emotion recognition abilities relate to key socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. Our results help to understand the functional significance of emotion recognition impairments in HD, and may have implications for the development of remediation programs aimed at improving patients' social quality of life.

Huntingtin N-terminal fragments (Htt-NTFs) with expanded polyglutamine tracts form a range of neurotoxic aggregates that are associated with Huntington's disease. Here, we show that aggregation of Htt-NTFs, irrespective of polyglutamine length, yields at least three phases (designated M, S, and F) that are delineated by sharp concentration thresholds and distinct aggregate sizes and morphologies. We found that monomers and oligomers make up the soluble M phase, ~25-nm spheres dominate in the soluble S phase, and long, linear fibrils make up the insoluble F phase. Previous studies showed that profilin, an abundant cellular protein, reduces Htt-NTF aggregation and toxicity in cells. We confirm that profilin achieves its cellular effects through direct binding to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Htt-NTFs. We show that profilin preferentially binds to Htt-NTF M-phase species and destabilizes aggregation and phase separation by shifting the concentration boundaries for phase separation to higher values through a process known as polyphasic linkage. Our experiments, aided by coarse-grained computer simulations and theoretical analysis, suggest that preferential binding of profilin to the M-phase species of Htt-NTFs is enhanced through a combination of specific interactions between profilin and polyproline segments and auxiliary interactions between profilin and polyglutamine tracts. Polyphasic linkage may be a general strategy that cells utilize to regulate phase behavior of aggregation-prone proteins. Accordingly, detailed knowledge of phase behavior and an understanding of how ligands modulate phase boundaries may pave the way for developing new therapeutics against a variety of aggregation-prone proteins.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating illness, associated with progressive motor, behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions. However, some studies emphasized that social cognition impairment could occur prior to the onset of these other symptoms. Here, we report the case of a 47 years old patient with early manifest HD, whose complaint was mainly related to the behavioral sphere. He exhibited a significant impairment of Theory of Mind abilities as well as behavioral, and discrete motor symptoms without noticeable cognitive decline. This case study suggests that social cognition impairments and behavioral changes could be in some cases a feature of the disease and may represent a major disability, in early stages of manifest HD.",

We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD. METHODS: We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT-HD, TRACK-HD, and IMAGE-HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease-affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers. RESULTS: We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (>0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of >80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers. INTERPRETATION: Our findings provide the first cross-study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.",

                    "text": "Using Actiwatch to monitor circadian rhythm disturbance in Huntington' disease: A cautionary note. Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is well recognised as producing progressive deterioration of motor function, including dyskinetic movements, as well as deterioration of cognition and ability to carry out activities of daily living. However, individuals with HD commonly suffer from a wide range of additional symptoms, including weight loss and sleep disturbance, possibly due to disruption of circadian rhythmicity. Disrupted circadian rhythms have been reported in mice models of HD and in humans with HD. One way of assessing an individual's circadian rhythmicity in a community setting is to monitor their sleep/wake cycles, and a convenient method for recording periods of wakefulness and sleep is to use accelerometers to discriminate between varied activity levels (including sleep) during daily life. Here we used Actiwatch( ) Activity monitors alongside ambulatory EEG and sleep diaries to record wake/sleep patterns in people with HD and normal volunteers. We report that periods of wakefulness during the night, as detected by activity monitors, agreed poorly with EEG recordings in HD subjects, and unsurprisingly sleep diary findings showed poor agreement with both EEG recordings and activity monitor derived sleep periods. One explanation for this is the occurrence of 'break through' involuntary movements during sleep in the HD patients, which are incorrectly assessed as wakeful periods by the activity monitor algorithms. Thus, care needs to be taken when using activity monitors to assess circadian activity in individuals with movement disorders.",

Synaptic dysfunction is a primary mechanism underlying Huntington disease (HD) progression. This study investigated changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density by means of 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging in the central nervous system of mice with HD. Methods: Dynamic 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging was performed at clinically relevant disease stages (at 3, 7, 10, and 16 mo) in the heterozygous knock-in Q175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates (16-18 mice per genotype and time point). Cerebral 11C-UCB-J analyses were performed to assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16 mo) disease stages. 11C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo. 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in mouse and human brain tissues. Results:11C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11C-UCB-J binding was detectable in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant reduction (P < 0.0001). 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice (P < 0.05). Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion:11C-UCB-J PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical application, 11C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating illness, associated with progressive motor, behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions. However, some studies emphasized that social cognition impairment could occur prior to the onset of these other symptoms. Here, we report the case of a 47 years old patient with early manifest HD, whose complaint was mainly related to the behavioral sphere. He exhibited a significant impairment of Theory of Mind abilities as well as behavioral, and discrete motor symptoms without noticeable cognitive decline. This case study suggests that social cognition impairments and behavioral changes could be in some cases a feature of the disease and may represent a major disability, in early stages of manifest HD.",

OBJECTIVES: People with Huntington's disease (HD) experience poor social quality of life, relationship breakdown, and social withdrawal, which are mediated to some extent by socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy and disinhibition. Social cognitive symptoms, such as impaired emotion recognition, also occur in HD, however, the extent of their association with these socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms is unknown. Our study examined the relationship between emotion recognition and symptom ratings of apathy and disinhibition in HD. METHODS: Thirty-two people with premanifest or symptomatic-HD completed Part 1 of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT), which is a facial emotion recognition task. In addition, we obtained severity ratings for apathy and disinhibition on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) from a close family member. Our analyses used motor symptom severity as a proxy for disease progression. RESULTS: Emotion recognition performance was significantly associated with family-ratings of apathy, above and beyond their shared association with disease severity. We found a similar pattern for disinhibition ratings, which fell short of statistical significance. As expected, worse emotion recognition performance was correlated with higher severity in FrSBe symptom ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emotion recognition abilities relate to key socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. Our results help to understand the functional significance of emotion recognition impairments in HD, and may have implications for the development of remediation programs aimed at improving patients' social quality of life.

Huntington disease (HD) is a late onset ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine ( CAG) triplet repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene which was discovered in 1993. The PHAROS study is a unique observational study of 1001 individuals at risk for HD who had not been previously tested for HD and who had no plans to do so. In this cohort, 104 (10%) individuals changed their minds and chose to be tested during the course of the study but outside of the study protocol. Baseline behavioral scores, especially apathy, were more strongly associated with later genetic testing than motor and chorea scores, particularly among subjects with expanded CAG repeat length. In the CAG expanded group, those choosing to be tested were older and had more chorea and higher scores on the behavioral section of the unified Huntington's disease rating scale at baseline than those not choosing to be tested. Following genetic testing, 56% of subjects with CAG < 37 had less depression when compared to prior to testing, but depression generally stayed the same or increased for 64% of subjects in the expanded group. This finding suggests that approaches to testing must continue to be cautious, with appropriate medical, psychological and social support.",

More recently, widespread prodromal white matter (WM) degradation has also been detected. However, longitudinal WM studies are limited and conflicting, and most analyses comparing WM and clinical functioning have also been cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: We simultaneously assessed changes in WM and cognitive and motor functioning at various prodromal HD stages. METHODS: Data from 1,336 (1,047 prodromal, 289 control) PREDICT-HD participants were analyzed (3,700 sessions). MRI images were used to create GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid probability maps. Using source-based morphometry, independent component analysis was applied to WM probability maps to extract covarying spatial patterns and their subject profiles. WM profiles were analyzed in two sets of linear mixed model (LMM) analyses: one to compare WM profiles across groups cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and one to concurrently compare WM profiles and clinical variables cross-sectionally and longitudinally within each group. RESULTS: Findings illustrate widespread prodromal changes in GM-adjacent-WM, with premotor, supplementary motor, middle frontal and striatal changes early in the prodrome that subsequently extend sub-gyrally with progression.

BACKGROUND: European studies identified the C9orf72 repeat expansion as the most frequent genetic alteration in patients with Huntington disease (HD)-like phenotypes but negative HD genetic testing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate C9orf72 repeat expansion frequency in individuals tested for HD in a North American tertiary referral laboratory. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three cases (115 positive and 258 negative for HD) were evaluated by genotyping PCR, with follow-up Southern blot and 5' repeat methylation status assessment by combined repeat-primed and methylation-specific PCR in a subset. RESULTS: Three cases (all HD-negative) tested positive: 2 had > 2,000 repeats and were methylated, 1 had 80-100 repeats and was unmethylated. Two cases (1 HD-positive and 1 HD-negative) had intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) and were unmethylated. The remaining 368 cases were negative (< 20 repeats). C9orf72 repeat expansion was absent in patients with HD and was identified in a small subset (1.2%) of patients with negative HD genetic testing. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C9orf72 repeat expansion does not coexist with HTT repeat expansion and that C9orf72 repeat expansion testing is unnecessary for patients with HD. In addition, C9orf72 evaluation may be considered for individuals negative for HD genetic testing. Similar to in previous studies, methylation of C9orf72 repeat expansion was limited to large expansions.",

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant rejection is considered as a vital factor of kidney transplant failure. Therefore, it's necessary to search for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study, we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network analysis.

Huntington disease (HD) is a late-onset genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide in the exon 1 of the gene encoding the polyglutamine (polyQ). It has been shown that protein degradation and lipid metabolism is altered in HD. In many neurodegenerative disorders, impaired lipid homeostasis is one of the early events in the disease onset. Yet, little is known about how mutant huntingtin may affect phospholipids membrane fluidity. Here, we investigated how membrane fluidity in the living cells (differentiated PC12 and HEK293 cell lines) are affected using a hyperspectral imaging of widely used probes, LAURDAN. Using phasor approach, we characterized the fluorescence of LAURDAN that is sensitive to the polarity of the immediate environment. LAURDAN is affected by the physical order of phospholipids (lipid order) and reports the membrane fluidity. We also validated our results using a different fluorescent membrane probe, Nile Red (NR). The plasma membrane in the cells expressing expanded polyQ shows a shift toward increased membrane fluidity revealed by both LAURDAN and NR spectral phasors. This finding brings a new perspective in the understanding of the early stages of HD that can be used as a target for drug screening.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a late-onset genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide in the exon 1 of the gene encoding the polyglutamine (polyQ). It has been shown that protein degradation and lipid metabolism is altered in HD. In many neurodegenerative disorders, impaired lipid homeostasis is one of the early events in the disease onset.

Here, we investigated how membrane fluidity in the living cells (differentiated PC12 and HEK293 cell lines) are affected using a hyperspectral imaging of widely used probes, LAURDAN. Using phasor approach, we characterized the fluorescence of LAURDAN that is sensitive to the polarity of the immediate environment. LAURDAN is affected by the physical order of phospholipids (lipid order) and reports the membrane fluidity. We also validated our results using a different fluorescent membrane probe, Nile Red (NR). The plasma membrane in the cells expressing expanded polyQ shows a shift toward increased membrane fluidity revealed by both LAURDAN and NR spectral phasors.

Recent studies have reported visual dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD). However, little is known about retinal structural changes in HD. METHODS: A total of 50 subjects, including 25 motor-manifest HD patients and 25 gender- and age-matched controls, were enrolled. Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Score-Motor part was assessed in HD patients. Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was used to evaluate the macular thickness and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). Superficial and deep capillary plexus densities were measured using OCT angiography (OCTA). To account for inter-eye correlation, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used. RESULTS: HD patients had a significant reduction in macular thickness in both inner and outer superior sectors and the inferior outer sector. Inferior pRNFLs were significantly decreased in thickness. There was no significant difference in retinal capillary plexus density between the two groups. Age and disease duration were negatively correlated with macular thickness in HD patients. However, the severity of motor involvement was not correlated with SD-OCT or OCTA parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We observed attenuated pRNFL and macular retinal thickness in patients with HD, independent of macular capillary plexus parameters. It can support the hypothesis that the retina may be a potential biomarker for monitoring the neurodegenerative process in HD.",

Quinolinic acid (QA)-induced neurotoxicity involves a cascade of events such as excitotoxicity, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, as well as selective GABAergic neuronal loss. Therefore, we investigated spermidine, an endogenous molecule with free radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonistic properties, for its beneficial potential if any, in QA-induced Huntington's like symptoms in rats. Rats were administered with QA (200 nmol/2 microl saline) bilaterally on 0 day. Spermidine (5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered for 21 days once a day.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) have impairments in performing dual-tasks, however, there is limited information about the effects of changing postural and cognitive demands as well as which measures are best suited as markers of underlying motor-cognitive interference. METHODS: Forty-three individuals with HD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed single tasks of walking (Timed Up & Go (TUG), 7 m walk), standing (feet together, feet apart and foam surface) and seated cognitive performance (Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting test) and dual cognitive-motor tasks while standing (+ Stroop) and walking (+ DKEFS, TUG cognitive). APDM Opal sensors recorded measures of postural sway and time to complete motor tasks. RESULTS: Individuals with HD had a greater increase in standing postural sway compared to HC from single to dual-tasks and with changes to support surface. Both groups demonstrated a decrease in gait performance during the TUG cognitive, however, this difference was greater in people with HD compared to HC. While those with HD showed a greater dual-task motor cost compared to HC, both groups behaved similarly as condition complexity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Standing postural sway is a more sensitive marker of instability than change in standard gait speed, particularly under dual-task conditions. The more complex TUG cognitive is a sensitive measure of walking dual-task performance. The results of this study provide insights about the nature of motor-cognitive impairments in HD and provide support for a distinction between static and dynamic postural control mechanisms during performance of dual-tasks.",

Mapping the spatiotemporal progression of neuroanatomical change in Huntington's Disease (HD) is fundamental to the development of bio-measures for prognostication. Statistical shape analysis to measure the striatum has been performed in HD, however there have been a limited number of longitudinal studies. To address these limitations, we utilised the Spherical Harmonic Point Distribution Method (SPHARM-PDM) to generate point distribution models of the striatum in individuals, and used linear mixed models to test for localised shape change over time in pre-manifest HD (pre-HD), symp-HD (symp-HD) and control individuals. Longitudinal MRI scans from the IMAGE-HD study were used (baseline, 18 and 30 months). We found significant differences in the shape of the striatum between groups. Significant group-by-time interaction was observed for the putamen bilaterally, but not for caudate. A differential rate of shape change between groups over time was observed, with more significant deflation in the symp-HD group in comparison with the pre-HD and control groups. CAG repeats were correlated with bilateral striatal shape in pre-HD and symp-HD. Robust statistical analysis of the correlates of striatal shape change in HD has confirmed the suitability of striatal morphology as a potential biomarker correlated with CAG-repeat length, and potentially, an endophenotype.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder encoding a mutant form of the huntingtin protein (HTT). HD is pathologically characterized by loss of neurons in the striatum and cortex, which leads to progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline and behavioral symptoms. Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and may be effective in alleviating and/or halting the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HD. Several pre-clinical studies have used stem cells in animal models of HD. Here, we performed a systematic review of preclinical studies to estimate the treatment efficacy of stem cells in animal models of HD. Based on our systematic review, treatment with stem cells significantly improves neurological and behavioral outcomes in animal models of HD. Although promising results were found, the design of animal studies, the types of transplanted cells and the route of administration are poorly standardized and this greatly complicates comparative analysis.",

Neurodegenerative disease encompasses a wide range of disorders afflicting the central and peripheral nervous systems and is a major unmet biomedical need of our time. There are very limited treatments, and no cures, for most of these diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Disease, and Motor Neuron Diseases. Mouse and other animal models provide hope by analysing them to understand pathogenic mechanisms, to identify drug targets, and to develop gene therapies and stem cell therapies. However, despite many decades of research, virtually no new treatments have reached the clinic. Increasingly, it is apparent that human heterogeneity within clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders, and between patients with the same genetic mutations, significantly impacts disease presentation and, potentially, therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, stratifying patients according to genetics, lifestyle, disease presentation, ethnicity, and other parameters may hold the key to bringing effective therapies from the bench to the clinic. Here, we discuss genetic and cellular humanised mouse models, and how they help in defining the genetic and environmental parameters associated with neurodegenerative disease, and so help in developing effective precision medicine strategies for future healthcare.",

Huntington disease (HD) is most widely known for its selective degeneration of striatal neurons but there is also growing evidence for white matter (WM) deterioration. The primary objective of this research was to conduct a large-scale analysis using multisite diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) tractography data to quantify diffusivity properties along major prefrontal cortex WM tracts in prodromal HD. Fifteen international sites participating in the PREDICT-HD study collected imaging and neuropsychological data on gene-positive HD participants without a clinical diagnosis (i.e., prodromal) and gene-negative control participants. The anatomical prefrontal WM tracts of the corpus callosum (PFCC), anterior thalamic radiations (ATRs), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFO), and uncinate fasciculi (UNC) were identified using streamline tractography of DWI. Within each of these tracts, tensor scalars for fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity coefficients were calculated. We divided prodromal HD subjects into three CAG-age product (CAP) groups having Low, Medium, or High probabilities of onset indexed by genetic exposure. We observed significant differences in WM properties for each of the four anatomical tracts for the High CAP group in comparison to controls. Additionally, the Medium CAP group presented differences in the ATR and IFO in comparison to controls. Furthermore, WM alterations in the PFCC, ATR, and IFO showed robust associations with neuropsychological measures of executive functioning. These results suggest long-range tracts essential for cross-region information transfer show early vulnerability in HD and may explain cognitive problems often present in the prodromal stage.

                    "text": "A Classification System to Guide Physical Therapy Management in Huntington Disease: A Case Series. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

The role of rehabilitation interventions is increasingly considered a key component to effective management of people with Huntington disease (HD). Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

Movement disorders can be hypokinetic (e.g., parkinsonism), hyperkinetic, or dystonic in nature and commonly arise from altered function in nuclei of the basal ganglia or their connections. As obvious structural changes are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism. Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli. In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions. Various approaches are reviewed here. ",

The ability to anticipate events and execute motor commands prior to a sensory event is an essential capability for human's everyday life. This implicitly learned anticipatory behavior depends on the past performance of repeated sensorimotor interactions timed with external cues. This kind of predictive behavior has been shown to be compromised in neurological disorders such as Huntington disease (HD), in which neural atrophy includes key cortical and basal ganglia regions. To investigate the neural basis of the anticipatory behavioral deficits in HD we used a predictive-saccade paradigm that requires predictive control to generate saccades in a metronomic temporal pattern. This is ideal because the integrity of the oculomotor network that includes the striatum and prefrontal, parietal, occipital and temporal cortices can be analyzed using structural MRI. Our results showed that the HD patients had severe predictive saccade deficits (i.e., an inability to reduce saccade reaction time in predictive condition), which are accentuated in patients with more severe motor deterioration. Structural imaging analyses revealed that these anticipatory deficits correlated with grey-matter atrophy in frontal, parietal-occipital and striatal regions. These findings indicate that the predictive saccade control deficits in HD are related to an extended cortico-striatal atrophy. This suggests that eye movement measurement could be a reliable marker of the progression of cognitive deficits in HD.",

                    "text": "Live-Cell Bioorthogonal Chemical Imaging: Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy of Vibrational Probes. Innovations in light microscopy have tremendously revolutionized the way researchers study biological systems with subcellular resolution. In particular, fluorescence microscopy with the expanding choices of fluorescent probes has provided a comprehensive toolkit to tag and visualize various molecules of interest with exquisite specificity and high sensitivity. Although fluorescence microscopy is currently the method of choice for cellular imaging, it faces fundamental limitations for studying the vast number of small biomolecules. This is because common fluorescent labels, which are relatively bulky, could introduce considerable perturbation to or even completely alter the native functions of vital small biomolecules. Hence, despite their immense functional importance, these small biomolecules remain largely undetectable by fluorescence microscopy. To address this challenge, a bioorthogonal chemical imaging platform has recently been introduced. By coupling stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, an emerging nonlinear Raman microscopy technique, with tiny and Raman-active vibrational probes (e.g., alkynes and stable isotopes), bioorthogonal chemical imaging exhibits superb sensitivity, specificity, and biocompatibility for imaging small biomolecules in live systems. In this Account, we review recent technical achievements for visualizing a broad spectrum of small biomolecules, including ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, amino acids, fatty acids, choline, glucose, cholesterol, and small-molecule drugs in live biological systems ranging from individual cells to animal tissues and model organisms. Importantly, this platform is compatible with live-cell biology, thus allowing real-time imaging of small-molecule dynamics. Moreover, we discuss further chemical and spectroscopic strategies for multicolor bioorthogonal chemical imaging, a valuable technique in the era of \"omics\". As a unique tool for biological discovery, this platform has been applied to studying various metabolic processes under both physiological and pathological states, including protein synthesis activity of neuronal systems, protein aggregations in Huntington disease models, glucose uptake in tumor xenografts, and drug penetration through skin tissues. We envision that the coupling of SRS microscopy with vibrational probes would do for small biomolecules what fluorescence microscopy of fluorophores has done for larger molecular species.",

Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient but excessive levels induce neurotoxic effects. Increasing evidence suggests a deficit of bioavailable Mn in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and cognitive disturbances. Previous studies have shown rescue of some molecular HD phenotypes by acute Mn exposure. This study simultaneously examined the potential for chronic Mn exposure to attenuate HD behavioral phenotypes, and for the HD genotype to offer protection against detrimental effects of chronic Mn exposure. In two independent studies a chronic Mn exposure paradigm was implemented in the YAC128 mouse model of HD and behavior was assessed at several timepoints. Study 1 exposed WT and YAC128 mice to twice weekly subcutaneous injections of 0, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 32 weeks of age. A promising protective effect against motor coordination decline in 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate-treated YAC128 mice was detected. Study 2 thus exposed WT and YAC128 mice to either 0 or 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 52 weeks of age (with a partial randomized treatment crossover at 31 weeks). The same protective effect was not observed under these conditions at higher statistical power. We report subtle toxicological changes in exploratory behavior and total activity induced by chronic Mn exposure in WT mice only, despite similar total increases in brain Mn in WT and YAC128 mice. Further, chronic Mn treatment resulted in a 10-12 % decrease in striatal NeuN positive cell density in WT mice but not YAC128 mice, despite vehicle cell counts already being reduced compared to WT mice as expected for the HD genotype. The subtle changes observed in specific outcome measures, but not others, following long-term low-level Mn exposure in WT mice delineate the neurobehavioral and neuropathological effects at the threshold of chronic Mn toxicity. We conclude that these chronic low-dose Mn exposures do not significantly rescue behavioral HD phenotypes, but YAC2128 mice are protected against the subtle Mn-induced behavioral changes and decreased striatal neuron density observed in Mn-exposed WT mice.",

Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient but excessive levels induce neurotoxic effects. Increasing evidence suggests a deficit of bioavailable Mn in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and cognitive disturbances. Previous studies have shown rescue of some molecular HD phenotypes by acute Mn exposure. This study simultaneously examined the potential for chronic Mn exposure to attenuate HD behavioral phenotypes, and for the HD genotype to offer protection against detrimental effects of chronic Mn exposure. In two independent studies a chronic Mn exposure paradigm was implemented in the YAC128 mouse model of HD and behavior was assessed at several timepoints. Study 1 exposed WT and YAC128 mice to twice weekly subcutaneous injections of 0, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 32 weeks of age. A promising protective effect against motor coordination decline in 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate-treated YAC128 mice was detected. Study 2 thus exposed WT and YAC128 mice to either 0 or 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 52 weeks of age (with a partial randomized treatment crossover at 31 weeks). The same protective effect was not observed under these conditions at higher statistical power. We report subtle toxicological changes in exploratory behavior and total activity induced by chronic Mn exposure in WT mice only, despite similar total increases in brain Mn in WT and YAC128 mice. Further, chronic Mn treatment resulted in a 10-12 % decrease in striatal NeuN positive cell density in WT mice but not YAC128 mice, despite vehicle cell counts already being reduced compared to WT mice as expected for the HD genotype. The subtle changes observed in specific outcome measures, but not others, following long-term low-level Mn exposure in WT mice delineate the neurobehavioral and neuropathological effects at the threshold of chronic Mn toxicity. We conclude that these chronic low-dose Mn exposures do not significantly rescue behavioral HD phenotypes, but YAC2128 mice are protected against the subtle Mn-induced behavioral changes and decreased striatal neuron density observed in Mn-exposed WT mice.",

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sleep pattern and the motor activity during sleep in a cohort of patients affected by Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: Thirty HD patients, 16 women and 14 men (mean age 57.3 +- 12.2 y); 30 matched healthy controls (mean age 56.5 +- 11.8 y). INTERVENTIONS: Subjective sleep evaluation: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); Berlin's Questionnaire, interview for restless legs syndrome (RLS), questionnaire for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Clinical evaluation: disease duration, clinical severity (unified Huntington disease motor rating scale [UHDMRS]), genetic tests. Laboratory-based full-night attended video-polysomnography (V-PSG). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The duration of the disease was 9.4 +- 4.4 y, UHMDRS score was 55.5 +- 23.4, CAG repeats were 44.3 +- 4.1. Body mass index was 21.9 +- 4.0 kg/m(2). No patients or caregivers reported poor sleep quality. Two patients reported symptoms of RLS. Eight patients had an ESS score >= 9. Eight patients had high risk of obstructive sleep apnea. At the RBD questionnaire, two patients had a pathological score. HD patients, compared to controls, showed shorter sleep, reduced sleep efficiency index, and increased arousals and awakenings. Four patients presented with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Periodic limb movements (PLMs) during wake and sleep were observed in all patients. No episode of RBD was observed in the V-PSG recordings, and no patients showed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia. The disease duration correlated with ESS score (P < 0.02). UHMDRS correlated positively with the ESS score (P < 0.005), and negatively with the percentage of REM sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Huntington disease showed a severe sleep disruption and a high prevalence of periodic limb movements, but no evidence of sleep disordered breathing or REM sleep behavior disorder.",

OBJECTIVE: With a shift towards noninvasive testing, we have explored and validated the use of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Fifteen couples have been included, assessing a total of n = 20 pregnancies. Fetal paternally inherited CAG repeat length was determined in total cell-free DNA from maternal plasma using a direct approach by PCR and subsequent fragment analysis. RESULTS: All fetal HD (n = 7) and intermediate (n = 3) CAG repeats could be detected in maternal plasma. Detection of repeats in the normal range (n = 10) was successful in n = 5 cases where the paternal repeat size could be distinguished from maternal repeat patterns after fragment analysis. In all other cases (n = 5), the paternal peaks coincided with the maternal peak pattern. All NIPD results were concordant with results from routine diagnostics on fetal genomic DNA from chorionic villi. CONCLUSION: In this validation study, we demonstrated that all fetuses at risk for HD could be identified noninvasively in maternal plasma. Additionally, we have confirmed results from previously described case reports that NIPD for HD can be performed using a direct approach by PCR. For future diagnostics, parental CAG profiles can be used to predict the success rate for NIPD prior to testing.",

BACKGROUND: At the end of life, anxious attitudes concerning the dying process are common in patients in Palliative Care. Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

The formation and topology of filamentous mHTT inclusions in the brain (hallmarks of HD implicated in neurotoxicity) remain elusive. Using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, here we show that mHTT exon 1 and polyQ-only aggregates in vitro are structurally heterogenous and filamentous, similar to prior observations with other methods. Yet, we find filaments in both types of aggregates under ~2 nm in width, thinner than previously reported, and regions forming large sheets. In addition, our data show a prevalent subpopulation of filaments exhibiting a lumpy slab morphology in both aggregates, supportive of the polyQ core model. This provides a basis for future cryoET studies of various aggregated mHTT and polyQ constructs to improve their structure-based modeling as well as their identification in cells without fusion tags.",

Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies in Huntington disease (HD) have suggested a role for the cerebellum. Our goal was to perform a detailed evaluation of cerebellar morphology. We performed the Unified HD rating scale (UHDRS) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) in 26 HD patients and 26 healthy controls. We created a two-sample test to analyze cerebellar gray matter (GM) differences between groups and another to correlate GM alterations with UHDRS and MOCA, corrected for age, expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats, and disease duration using the spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT)-SPM-toolbox which preserves anatomical detailing. We found increased GM density in the anterior cerebellum compared to controls. Higher GM density in the postero-superior lobe correlated with mood symptoms. Worse motor function and better cognitive function correlated with GM changes in the posterior cerebellum (false discovery rate (FDR) correction p < 0.05 and k > 100 voxels). In this detailed study of the in vivo cerebellar morphology in HD, we observed GM changes in regions involved in sensorimotor integration, motor planning, and emotional processing, supporting cerebellar involvement in the neuropathological process of HD.",

Synaptic structure and function are compromised prior to cell death and symptom onset in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In Huntington disease (HD), a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein results in a presymptomatic stage that typically spans multiple decades and is followed by striking degeneration of striatal tissue and the progression of debilitating motor symptoms. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that the HD presymptomatic window is associated with injurious effects to striatal synapses, many of which appear to be prerequisites to subsequent cell death. While the striatum is the most vulnerable region in the HD brain, it is widely recognized that HD is a brain-wide disease, affecting numerous extrastriatal regions that contribute to debilitating non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction. Currently, we have a poor understanding of the synaptic integrity, or lack thereof, in extrastriatal regions in the presymptomatic HD brain. If early therapeutic intervention seeks to maintain healthy synaptic function, it is important to understand early HD-associated synaptopathy at a brain-wide, rather than striatal-exclusive, level. Here, we focused on the hippocampus as this structure is generally thought to be affected only in manifest HD despite the subtle cognitive deficits known to emerge in prodromal HD. We used super-resolution microscopy and multi-electrode array electrophysiology as sensitive measures of excitatory synapse structure and function, respectively, in the hippocampus of presymptomatic heterozygous HD mice (Q175FDN model). We found clear evidence for enhanced AMPA receptor subunit clustering and hyperexcitability well before the onset of a detectable HD-like behavioral phenotype. In addition, activity-dependent re-organization of synaptic protein nanostructure, and functional measures of synaptic plasticity were impaired in presymptomatic HD mice. These data demonstrate that synaptic abnormalities in the presymptomatic HD brain are not exclusive to the striatum, and highlight the need to better understand the region-dependent complexities of early synaptopathy in the HD brain.",

OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

BACKGROUND: At the end of life, anxious attitudes concerning the dying process are common in patients in Palliative Care. Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a gain-of-function mutation in HTT. Suppression of mutant HTT has emerged as a leading therapeutic strategy for HD, with allele-selective approaches targeting HTT SNPs now in clinical trials. Haplotypes associated with the HD mutation (A1, A2, A3a) represent panels of allele-specific gene silencing targets for efficient treatment of individuals with HD of Northern European and indigenous South American ancestry. Here we extend comprehensive haplotype analysis of the HD mutation to key populations of Southern European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and admixed African ancestry. In each of these populations, the HD mutation occurs predominantly on the A2 HTT haplotype. Analysis of HD haplotypes across all affected population groups enables rational selection of candidate target SNPs for development of allele-selective gene silencing therapeutics worldwide. Targeting SNPs on the A1 and A2 haplotypes in parallel is essential to achieve treatment of the most HD-affected subjects in populations where HD is most prevalent. Current allele-specific approaches will leave a majority of individuals with HD untreated in populations where the HD mutation occurs most frequently on the A2 haplotype. We further demonstrate preclinical development of potent and selective ASOs targeting SNPs on the A2 HTT haplotype, representing an allele-specific treatment strategy for these individuals. On the basis of comprehensive haplotype analysis, we show the maximum proportion of HD-affected subjects that may be treated with three or four allele targets in different populations worldwide, informing current allele-specific HTT silencing strategies.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatment is available. A better understanding of the pathology, and identification of biomarkers will facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments. HD is potentially a good model of a neurodegenerative disease for development of biomarkers because it is an autosomal-dominant disease with complete penetrance, caused by a single gene mutation, in which the neurodegenerative process can be assessed many years before onset of signs and symptoms of manifest disease. Previous MRI studies have detected abnormalities in gray and white matter starting in premanifest stages. However, the understanding of how these abnormalities are related, both in time and space, is still incomplete. In this study, we combined deep gray matter shape diffeomorphometry and white matter DTI analysis in order to provide a better mapping of pathology in the deep gray matter and subcortical white matter in premanifest HD. We used 296 MRI scans from the PREDICT-HD database. Atrophy in the deep gray matter, thalamus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens was analyzed by surface based morphometry, and while white matter abnormalities were analyzed in (i) regions of interest surrounding these structures, using (ii) tractography-based analysis, and using (iii) whole brain atlas-based analysis. We detected atrophy in the deep gray matter, particularly in putamen, from early premanifest stages. The atrophy was greater both in extent and effect size in cases with longer exposure to the effects of the CAG expansion mutation (as assessed by greater CAP-scores), and preceded detectible abnormalities in the white matter. Near the predicted onset of manifest HD, the MD increase was widespread, with highest indices in the deep and posterior white matter. This type of in-vivo macroscopic mapping of HD brain abnormalities can potentially indicate when and where therapeutics could be targeted to delay the onset or slow the disease progression. ",

MRI scans, from the IMAGE-HD study, were obtained from 36 individuals with pre-symptomatic HD (pre-HD), 37 with early symptomatic HD (symp-HD), and 36 healthy matched controls. The neostriatum was manually segmented and a surface-based parametric mapping protocol derived two pointwise shape measures: thickness and surface dilation ratio. Significant shape differences were detected between all groups. Negative associations were detected between lower thickness and surface area shape measure and CAG repeats, disease burden score, and UHDRS total motor score. In symp-HD, UPSIT scores were correlated with higher thickness in left caudate tail and surface dilation ratio in left posterior putamen; Stroop scores were positively correlated with the thickness of left putamen head and body. Self-paced tapping (slow) was correlated with higher thickness and surface dilation ratio in the right caudate in symp-HD and with bilateral putamen in pre-HD. Self-paced tapping (fast) was correlated with higher surface dilation ratio in the right anterior putamen in symp-HD.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between striatal morphology in Huntington disease (HD) and measures of motor and cognitive dysfunction. MRI scans, from the IMAGE-HD study, were obtained from 36 individuals with pre-symptomatic HD (pre-HD), 37 with early symptomatic HD (symp-HD), and 36 healthy matched controls. The neostriatum was manually segmented and a surface-based parametric mapping protocol derived two pointwise shape measures: thickness and surface dilation ratio. Significant shape differences were detected between all groups. Negative associations were detected between lower thickness and surface area shape measure and CAG repeats, disease burden score, and UHDRS total motor score. In symp-HD, UPSIT scores were correlated with higher thickness in left caudate tail and surface dilation ratio in left posterior putamen; Stroop scores were positively correlated with the thickness of left putamen head and body. Self-paced tapping (slow) was correlated with higher thickness and surface dilation ratio in the right caudate in symp-HD and with bilateral putamen in pre-HD. Self-paced tapping (fast) was correlated with higher surface dilation ratio in the right anterior putamen in symp-HD.

BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement. RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.",

Synaptic dysfunction is a primary mechanism underlying Huntington disease (HD) progression. This study investigated changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density by means of 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging in the central nervous system of mice with HD. Methods: Dynamic 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging was performed at clinically relevant disease stages (at 3, 7, 10, and 16 mo) in the heterozygous knock-in Q175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates (16-18 mice per genotype and time point). Cerebral 11C-UCB-J analyses were performed to assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16 mo) disease stages. 11C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo. 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in mouse and human brain tissues. Results:11C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11C-UCB-J binding was detectable in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant reduction (P < 0.0001). 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice (P < 0.05). Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion:11C-UCB-J PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical application, 11C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.",

Importance: Tetrabenazine is efficacious for chorea control; however, tolerability concerns exist. Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea, was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea control. Interventions: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales. Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled. Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment. Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1 and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively maintained chorea control.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatment is available. A better understanding of the pathology, and identification of biomarkers will facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments. HD is potentially a good model of a neurodegenerative disease for development of biomarkers because it is an autosomal-dominant disease with complete penetrance, caused by a single gene mutation, in which the neurodegenerative process can be assessed many years before onset of signs and symptoms of manifest disease. Previous MRI studies have detected abnormalities in gray and white matter starting in premanifest stages. However, the understanding of how these abnormalities are related, both in time and space, is still incomplete. In this study, we combined deep gray matter shape diffeomorphometry and white matter DTI analysis in order to provide a better mapping of pathology in the deep gray matter and subcortical white matter in premanifest HD. We used 296 MRI scans from the PREDICT-HD database. Atrophy in the deep gray matter, thalamus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens was analyzed by surface based morphometry, and while white matter abnormalities were analyzed in (i) regions of interest surrounding these structures, using (ii) tractography-based analysis, and using (iii) whole brain atlas-based analysis. We detected atrophy in the deep gray matter, particularly in putamen, from early premanifest stages. The atrophy was greater both in extent and effect size in cases with longer exposure to the effects of the CAG expansion mutation (as assessed by greater CAP-scores), and preceded detectible abnormalities in the white matter. Near the predicted onset of manifest HD, the MD increase was widespread, with highest indices in the deep and posterior white matter. This type of in-vivo macroscopic mapping of HD brain abnormalities can potentially indicate when and where therapeutics could be targeted to delay the onset or slow the disease progression. ",

The multidisciplinary study of HD has been the focus of an international collaborating effort of basic and applied research for several decades. HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low.

Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement. RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.",

Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review. RESULTS: Dementia, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease are the neurological diseases that most frequently motivate requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Requests related to dementia constitute the largest group, are growing, and raise additional ethical and legal issues due to these patients' diminished decision-making capacity. In some countries, the ratios of euthanasia requests to all cases of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, or Huntington disease are higher than for any other disease.

However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of motor functions in these patients. METHODS: We searched 12 electronic databases to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening, only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score-4 in both fixed and quality effect models [MD = -2.720, 95% CI (-4.76, -.68), p = 0.009; MD = -2.225, 95% CI (-3.842, -0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score showed significant results [MD = -1.013, 95% CI (-1.793, -0.233), p = 0.011] in only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming test or symbol digit modality. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement of motor scores only after 12 months. These results should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies had assessed the efficacy of ethyl-EPA after 12 months with one of them having a 6-month open-label phase.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) on brain injury caused by 3NPA.

Staining for cytochrome c oxidase activity and in situ hybridization autoradiography of synaptotagmin-4 and -7 mRNAs were used to evaluate brain injury caused by 3NPA. There was a significant reduction of body weight in the 3NPA+LiCl group (79%) compared to the 3NPA group (90%, p = 0.031) and both control groups (100%, p = 0.000). Densitometric evaluation of cytochrome c oxidase staining and in situ hybridization autoradiograms revealed that the pre-treatment with LiCl caused an increase in striatal lesion for about 40% (p = 0.049). Moreover, the lesion was observed also in the hippocampus of three animals from the 3NPA+LiCl group and in two animals from the 3NPA group.

BACKGROUND: Imaging biomarkers sensitive to Huntington's disease (HD) during the premanifest phase preceding motor diagnosis may accelerate identification and evaluation of potential therapies. For this purpose, quantitative MRI sensitive to tissue microstructure and metabolism may hold great potential. We investigated the potential value of T1rho relaxation to detect pathological changes in premanifest HD (preHD) relative to other quantitative relaxation parameters. METHODS: Quantitative MR parametric mapping was used to assess differences between 50 preHD subjects and 26 age- and sex-matched controls. Subjects with preHD were classified into two progression groups based on their CAG-age product (CAP) score; a high and a low/moderate CAP group. Voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses were used to assess changes in the quantitative relaxation times. RESULTS: T1rho showed a significant increase in the relaxation times in the high-CAP group, as compared to controls, largely in the striatum. The T1rho changes in the preHD subjects showed a significant relationship with CAP score. No significant changes in T2 or T2* relaxation times were found in the striatum. T2* relaxation changes were found in the globus pallidus, but no significant changes with disease progression were found. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that quantitative T1rho mapping may provide a useful marker for assessing disease progression in HD. The absence of T2 changes suggests that the T1rho abnormalities are unlikely owing to altered water content or tissue structure. The established sensitivity of T1rho to pH and glucose suggests that these factors are altered in HD perhaps owing to abnormal mitochondrial function.",

OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD phenocopies.",

                    "text": "Recombinant Antibody Fragments for Neurodegenerative Diseases. BACKGROUND: Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length immunoglobulins and offer important advantages compared with conventional monoclonal antibodies: extreme specificity, higher affinity, superior stability and solubility, reduced immunogenicity as well as easy and inexpensive large-scale production. OBJECTIVE: In this article we will review and discuss recombinant antibodies that are being evaluated for neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical models and in clinical studies and will summarize new strategies that are being developed to optimize their stability, specificity and potency for advancing their use. METHODS: Articles describing recombinant antibody fragments used for neurological diseases were selected (PubMed) and evaluated for their significance. RESULTS: Different antibody formats such as single-chain fragment variable (scFv), single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs or sdAbs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), intrabodies and nanobodies, are currently being studied in pre-clinical models of cancer as well as infectious and autoimmune diseases and many of them are being tested as therapeutics in clinical trials. Immunotherapy approaches have shown therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of Alzheimer s disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington disease (HD), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that recombinant antibody fragments may neutralize toxic extra- and intracellular misfolded proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, DLB, FTD, HD or TSEs and may target toxic immune cells participating in the pathogenesis of MS. CONCLUSION: Recombinant antibody fragments represent a promising tool for the development of antibody-based immunotherapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.",

                    "text": "Huntington disease: new insights into molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities. Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) and involves a complex web of pathogenic mechanisms. Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

PURPOSE: We analyzed the patients served by the University of Washington Adult Genetic Medicine Clinic (UWAGMC) over a 42-year period to determine how clinical services have changed and to evaluate the contributing factors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective survey of patients seen by UWAGMC that included patients seen from 1975 to 2016. Variables considered included referral indication, disease status, and clinic visit date. Indications for referral were then binned into clinical categories for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Of 30,780 patient visits during the 39 years for which data were available, 57.3% occurred in the last decade. Referrals for breast/ovarian cancer or colon/endometrial cancer account for 74.8% of cancer referrals since 1998. Huntington disease patients made up 46% of neurological referral indications. Telephone screening implemented in 2013 has reduced the number of referrals for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSION: Referral indications increased with clinical testing availability and because of the academic programs of UWAGMC providers. With increased public awareness of heritable conditions, prescreening self-referrals were used to allocate limited resources. These trends demonstrate the need for more geneticists in adult medicine to expand centers of excellence for rare diseases and to serve the increasing numbers of adult patients with genetic conditions.",

INTRODUCTION: Huntington s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuropsychiatric, motor and cognitive manifestations. It is caused by expansion of the trinucleotide CAG on HTT. The molecular bases are not completely understood, DNA damage, such as double and single strand breaks and oxidative stress (OS) have been implicated. At telomeres, DNA breaks are less efficiently repaired. Double strand breaks evoke the break induced replication (BIR) mechanism. BIR, plus inefficient repair can produce telomere shortening and cellular senescence. Our aim was to investigate the correlation between leukocyte relative telomeric length (RTL) and HD. METHODS: 206 samples were analyzed, 71 patients with molecular diagnosis and symptomatology (HD), 29 individuals with positive molecular test but asymptomatic (PP) and 106 healthy individuals (NP). RESULTS: We found a significant difference in RTL between HD patients compared with both, PP and NP, independently of subjects' age. DISCUSSION: Here we present evidence supporting an association between telomere shortening and HD. Telomere shortening could be related to DNA damage caused by ROS and defective DNA repair mechanism. Both events have been probed to occur in the presence of a mutant Huntingtin. This study contributes with current evidence suggesting a potential role of telomere shortening as HD biomarker.",

BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication. We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease. RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1 out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100). They were less in favour of gamete donation (48.3+-39.8 out of 100) or pregnancy abstention (43.3+-40.3 out of 100). The greater the perceived severity of the disease, the more reproductive options were considered justified, except for gamete donation. Prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis was a motivation to inform relatives for only 55.3% of participants (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Self-estimated severity minimally impacts opinions towards reproductive options. Medically assisted reproduction procedures are rarely sought and do not motivate familial communication.",

Neurodegenerative diseases that affect serious gait abnormalities include Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington disease (HD). These diseases lead to gait rhythm distortion that can be determined by stride time interval of footfall contact times. In this paper, we present a new method for gait classification of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we utilize a symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm to convert left-foot stride-stride interval into a sequence of symbols using a symbolic aggregate approximation. We then find string prototypes of each class using the newly proposed string grammar unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy C-medians. Then in the testing process the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor is used. We implement the system on three 2-class problems, i.e., the classification of ALS against healthy patients, that of HD against healthy patients , and that of PD against healthy patients. The system is also implemented on one 4-class problem (the classification of ALS, HD, PD, and healthy patients altogether) called NDDs versus healthy. We found that our system yields a very good detection result. The average correct classification for ALS versus healthy is 96.88%, and that for HD versus healthy is 97.22%, whereas that for PD versus healthy is 96.43%. When the system is implemented on 4-class problem, the average accuracy is approximately 98.44%. It can provide prototypes of gait signals that are more understandable to human.",

                    "text": "Recent advances in the therapeutic development for Huntington disease. INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

Results from the Track data were externally validated with data from the COHORT. The required sample size was estimated for a 2-arm prediagnosis clinical trial. Data analysis took place from May 1, 2016, to June 10, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point is PFS. Huntington disease progression events are defined for the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score, total functional capacity, symbol digit modalities test, and Stroop word test. Results: Of Track's 167 prediagnosis mutation carriers, 93 (55.6%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 40.06 (8.92) years; of the 156 noncarriers, 87 (55.7%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 45.58 (10.30) years. Of the 366 COHORT participants, 229 (62.5%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 42.21 (12.48) years. The PFS curves of the Track mutation carriers showed good external validity with the COHORT mutation carriers after adjusting for initial progression. For required sample size, PFS with a motor diagnosis or total motor score progression required about 4 times fewer participants than a motor diagnosis alone. Including additional cognitive progression events further reduced the number. For example, a 3-year trial with 10% attrition and a treatment effect of 50% requires a total of 661 with motor diagnosis as the survival end point but only 177 with a total motor score PFS. Conclusions and Relevance: Reasonably sized prediagnosis Huntington disease trials can be planned with PFS, and there is evidence of generalizability of this approach.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder encoding a mutant form of the huntingtin protein (HTT). HD is pathologically characterized by loss of neurons in the striatum and cortex, which leads to progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline and behavioral symptoms. Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and may be effective in alleviating and/or halting the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HD. Several pre-clinical studies have used stem cells in animal models of HD. Here, we performed a systematic review of preclinical studies to estimate the treatment efficacy of stem cells in animal models of HD. Based on our systematic review, treatment with stem cells significantly improves neurological and behavioral outcomes in animal models of HD. Although promising results were found, the design of animal studies, the types of transplanted cells and the route of administration are poorly standardized and this greatly complicates comparative analysis.",

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) have impairments in performing dual-tasks, however, there is limited information about the effects of changing postural and cognitive demands as well as which measures are best suited as markers of underlying motor-cognitive interference. METHODS: Forty-three individuals with HD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed single tasks of walking (Timed Up & Go (TUG), 7 m walk), standing (feet together, feet apart and foam surface) and seated cognitive performance (Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting test) and dual cognitive-motor tasks while standing (+ Stroop) and walking (+ DKEFS, TUG cognitive). APDM Opal sensors recorded measures of postural sway and time to complete motor tasks. RESULTS: Individuals with HD had a greater increase in standing postural sway compared to HC from single to dual-tasks and with changes to support surface. Both groups demonstrated a decrease in gait performance during the TUG cognitive, however, this difference was greater in people with HD compared to HC. While those with HD showed a greater dual-task motor cost compared to HC, both groups behaved similarly as condition complexity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Standing postural sway is a more sensitive marker of instability than change in standard gait speed, particularly under dual-task conditions. The more complex TUG cognitive is a sensitive measure of walking dual-task performance. The results of this study provide insights about the nature of motor-cognitive impairments in HD and provide support for a distinction between static and dynamic postural control mechanisms during performance of dual-tasks.",

Importance: Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor and phonic tics, often accompanied by behavioral and psychiatric comorbidities. Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved in the US for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. Objective: To report results of the ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in Tourette Syndrome 2) study examining deutetrabenazine for treatment of Tourette syndrome. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted over 8 weeks with a 1-week follow-up (June 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019). Children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and active tics causing distress or impairment were enrolled in the study. Children were recruited from 52 sites in 10 countries. Data were analyzed from February 4 to April 22, 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/d), high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/d), or a matching placebo, which were titrated over 4 weeks to the target dose followed by a 4-week maintenance period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine. Key secondary end points included changes in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine, Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression score, Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact score, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and questionnaires. Results: The study included 158 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 11.7 [2.6] years). A total of 119 participants (75%) were boys; 7 (4%), Asian; 1 (1%), Black; 32 (20%), Hispanic; 4 (3%), Native American; 135 (85%), White; 2 (1%), multiracial; 9 (6%), other race; and 1 (0.6%), of unknown ethnic origin. Fifty-two participants were randomized to the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 54 to the low-dose deutetrabenazine group, and 52 to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics for participants were similar between groups. Of the total 158 participants, 64 (41%) were aged 6 to 11 years, and 94 (59%) were aged 12 to 16 years at baseline. Mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 (2.8) years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 (6.6) points. At week 8, the difference in YGTSS-TTS was not significant between the high-dose deutetrabenazine and placebo groups (least-squares mean difference, -0.8 points; 95% CI, -3.9 to 2.3 points; P = .60; Cohen d, -0.11). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 34 participants (65%) treated with high-dose deutetrabenazine, 24 (44%) treated with low-dose deutetrabenazine, and 25 (49%) treated with placebo and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this fixed-dose randomized clinical trial of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03571256.",

OBJECTIVE: To survey neurologists and obtain clinical perceptions of tetrabenazine for the treatment of chorea in patients with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

BACKGROUND: Clinician-rated measures of functioning are often used as primary endpoints in clinical trials and other behavioral research in Huntington disease. As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible, there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM: The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures, differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related assessments are not feasible.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatment is available. A better understanding of the pathology, and identification of biomarkers will facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments. HD is potentially a good model of a neurodegenerative disease for development of biomarkers because it is an autosomal-dominant disease with complete penetrance, caused by a single gene mutation, in which the neurodegenerative process can be assessed many years before onset of signs and symptoms of manifest disease. Previous MRI studies have detected abnormalities in gray and white matter starting in premanifest stages. However, the understanding of how these abnormalities are related, both in time and space, is still incomplete. In this study, we combined deep gray matter shape diffeomorphometry and white matter DTI analysis in order to provide a better mapping of pathology in the deep gray matter and subcortical white matter in premanifest HD. We used 296 MRI scans from the PREDICT-HD database. Atrophy in the deep gray matter, thalamus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens was analyzed by surface based morphometry, and while white matter abnormalities were analyzed in (i) regions of interest surrounding these structures, using (ii) tractography-based analysis, and using (iii) whole brain atlas-based analysis. We detected atrophy in the deep gray matter, particularly in putamen, from early premanifest stages. The atrophy was greater both in extent and effect size in cases with longer exposure to the effects of the CAG expansion mutation (as assessed by greater CAP-scores), and preceded detectible abnormalities in the white matter. Near the predicted onset of manifest HD, the MD increase was widespread, with highest indices in the deep and posterior white matter. This type of in-vivo macroscopic mapping of HD brain abnormalities can potentially indicate when and where therapeutics could be targeted to delay the onset or slow the disease progression. ",

BACKGROUND: For reasons of cost and ethical concerns, models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) are currently being developed in farm animals, as an alternative to non-human primates. Developing reliable methods of testing cognitive function is essential to determining the usefulness of such models. Nevertheless, cognitive testing of farm animal species presents a unique set of challenges. The primary aims of this study were to develop and validate a mobile operant system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing of sheep. NEW METHOD: We designed a semi-automated testing system with the capability of presenting stimuli (visual, auditory) and reward at six spatial locations. Fourteen normal sheep were used to validate the system using a two-choice visual discrimination task. Four stages of training devised to acclimatise animals to the system are also presented. RESULTS: All sheep progressed rapidly through the training stages, over eight sessions. All sheep learned the 2CVDT and performed at least one reversal stage. The mean number of trials the sheep took to reach criterion in the first acquisition learning was 13.9+-1.5 and for the reversal learning was 19.1+-1.8. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): This is the first mobile semi-automated operant system developed for testing cognitive function in sheep. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed and validated an automated operant behavioural testing system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing in sheep and other medium-sized quadrupeds, such as pigs and dogs. Sheep performance in the two-choice visual discrimination task was very similar to that reported for non-human primates and strongly supports the use of farm animals as pre-clinical models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.",

OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

Pediatric-onset Huntingtons disease (PoHD) presents differently from adult-onset disease. Children typically exhibit regression in school performance, psychiatric features such as inattention, and oral motor dysfunction. Unlike adult-onset HD, in which seizures occur at approximately the rate of the general public, at least half of children with HD develop epilepsy and seizures can be a presenting feature of PoHD. Here we present the case of a 10-year-old boy with a history of language delay, motor regression, oral motor dysfunction, and tremor who presented with a first lifetime seizure. Given a family history of Huntingtons disease in his father, PoHD was considered, and a pathogenic allele with 88 repeats was confirmed in the child. As symptoms progressed, history alone could not differentiate abnormal movements from seizures. Continuous video electroencephalography helped to demonstrate epileptic myoclonic jerks and guide treatment.",

AIMS: To analyze brain functional connectivity in the somatomotor and default-mode networks (DMNs) of patients with Huntington disease (HD), its relationship with gray matter (GM) volume loss, and functional changes after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: Ten patients and ten untreated controls underwent T1-weighted imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); four patients were also assessed after 3 months of pridopidine treatment (90 mg/d). The seed-based functional connectivity patterns from the posterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area (SMA), considered cortical hubs of the DMN and somatomotor networks, respectively, were computed. FMRIB Software Library voxel-based morphometry measured GM volume. RESULTS: Patients had GM volume decrease in all cortical and subcortical areas of the somatomotor network with preservation of the SMA, and increased somatomotor and DMN connectivity. In DMN structures, functional connectivity impairment preceded volume loss. Pridopidine reduced the intensity of these aberrant connections. CONCLUSION: The abnormal connectivity of the somatomotor and DMN observed in HD patients may represent an early dysfunction marker, as it preceded volume loss in DMN. Pridopidine reduced connectivity of these networks in all four treated patients, suggesting that connectivity is sensitive to treatment response.",

OBJECTIVE: After MRI studies suggested the efficacy of ethyl-EPA in reducing the progressive brain atrophy in Huntington disease (HD), trials were conducted to test its efficacy as a treatment for HD. Trials that continued for 6 months did not find any significant improvement, urging discontinuation of the drug. However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of motor functions in these patients. METHODS: We searched 12 electronic databases to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening, only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score-4 in both fixed and quality effect models [MD = -2.720, 95% CI (-4.76, -.68), p = 0.009; MD = -2.225, 95% CI (-3.842, -0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score showed significant results [MD = -1.013, 95% CI (-1.793, -0.233), p = 0.011] in only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming test or symbol digit modality. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement of motor scores only after 12 months. These results should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies had assessed the efficacy of ethyl-EPA after 12 months with one of them having a 6-month open-label phase.",

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the percent volume of dilated perivascular space (PVS) in the subcortical forebrain in patients with early Huntington disease (HD) and to explore the relationship between PVS and disease severity. METHODS: MRI scans were performed on 25 patients with HD and 23 healthy age-matched controls at Massachusetts General Hospital. The imaging data were analyzed with a novel algorithm to determine regional PVS volume. A fractional logistic regression analysis was used to quantify the association between regional percent PVS volume and (1) disease designation (HD or control) and (2) disease severity as assessed by normalized caudate volume. RESULTS: Patients with HD had the greatest percent volume of dilated PVS in the putamen (left putamen: odds ratio 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-2.62], HD 3.27% [95% CI 2.83-3.78] vs controls 1.62% [95% CI 1.32-1.97], p fdr < 0.001; right putamen: odds ratio 1.66 [95% CI 1.33-2.08], HD 3.43% [95% CI 2.94-4.01] vs controls 2.09% [95% CI 1.79-2.45], p fdr < 0.001) and several subcortical white matter regions compared to controls. Dilated PVS increased with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The objective quantification of dilated PVS suggests that PVS burden is high, is associated with disease severity, and may affect the distribution and success of treatments administered either intrathecally such as antisense oligonucleotides or by intraparenchymal administration such as cell and gene therapies. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that increased dilated PVS is associated with worse HD severity. The study is rated Class II because of the cross-sectional design.",

Laquinimod, an immunomodulatory agent under clinical development for Huntington disease (HD), has recently been shown to confer behavioural improvements that are coupled with prevention of atrophy of the white matter (WM)-rich corpus callosum (CC) in the YAC128 HD mice. However, the nature of the WM improvements is not known yet. Here we investigated the effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination deficits at the cellular, molecular and ultrastructural levels. We showed that laquinimod treatment improves motor learning and motor function deficits in YAC128 HD mice, and confirmed its antidepressant effect even at the lowest dose used. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time the beneficial effects of laquinimod on myelination in the posterior region of the CC where it reversed changes in myelin sheath thickness and rescued Mbp mRNA and protein deficits. Furthermore, the effect of laquinimod on myelin-related gene expression was not region-specific since the levels of the Mbp and Plp1 transcripts were also increased in the striatum. Also, we did not detect changes in immune cell densities or levels of inflammatory genes in 3-month-old YAC128 HD mice, and these were not altered with laquinimod treatment. Thus, the beneficial effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination abnormalities in YAC128 HD mice do not appear to be dependent on its immunomodulatory activity. Altogether, our findings describe the beneficial effects of laquinimod treatment on HD-related myelination abnormalities and highlight its therapeutic potential for the treatment of WM pathology in HD patients.",

Laquinimod, an immunomodulatory agent under clinical development for Huntington disease (HD), has recently been shown to confer behavioural improvements that are coupled with prevention of atrophy of the white matter (WM)-rich corpus callosum (CC) in the YAC128 HD mice. However, the nature of the WM improvements is not known yet. Here we investigated the effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination deficits at the cellular, molecular and ultrastructural levels. We showed that laquinimod treatment improves motor learning and motor function deficits in YAC128 HD mice, and confirmed its antidepressant effect even at the lowest dose used. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time the beneficial effects of laquinimod on myelination in the posterior region of the CC where it reversed changes in myelin sheath thickness and rescued Mbp mRNA and protein deficits. Furthermore, the effect of laquinimod on myelin-related gene expression was not region-specific since the levels of the Mbp and Plp1 transcripts were also increased in the striatum. Also, we did not detect changes in immune cell densities or levels of inflammatory genes in 3-month-old YAC128 HD mice, and these were not altered with laquinimod treatment. Thus, the beneficial effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination abnormalities in YAC128 HD mice do not appear to be dependent on its immunomodulatory activity. Altogether, our findings describe the beneficial effects of laquinimod treatment on HD-related myelination abnormalities and highlight its therapeutic potential for the treatment of WM pathology in HD patients.",

BACKGROUND: The underlying cause of major neurodegenerative disorders remains a healthcare mystery. The thoroughly investigated causes include oxidative stress, inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular neuronal protein aggregation. Withania somnifera has been used for more than 2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha, neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The current review substantially deciphered the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders. However, future studies are further required better to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their neuroprotective nature.",

Recent studies suggest that neurodegenerative diseases could affect brain structure and function in disease-specific network patterns; however, how spontaneous activity affects structural covariance network (SC) is not clear.

MRI was conducted to measure somatosensory activation, resting-state functional-connectivity (rsFC), SC, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and ALFF covariance (ALFFC) in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. We found somatosensory activation was unchanged but the subcortical ALFF was increased in HD mice, indicating subcortical but not cortical hyperactivity. The reduced sensorimotor rsFC but spared hippocampal and default mode networks in the HD mice was consistent with the more pronounced impairment in motor function compared with cognitive performance. The disease suppressed SC globally and reduced ALFFC in the basal ganglia network as well as its anti-correlation with the default mode network. By comparing these connectivity measures, we found that the originally coupled rsFC-SC relationship was impaired whereas SC-ALFFC correlation was increased by HD, suggesting disease facilitated covariation of brain volume and activity amplitude but not neural synchrony. The comparison with mono-synaptic axonal projection supports the hypothesis that rsFC, but not SC or ALFFC, is highly dependent on structural connectivity under healthy conditions. Treatment with memantine had a strong effect on normalizing the SC and reducing ALFF while slightly increasing other connectivity measures and restoring the rsFC-SC coupling, which is consistent with its effect on alleviating hyper-excitability and improving the coordinated neural growth. These results indicate that HD affects the cerebral structure-function relationship which could be partially reverted by NMDA antagonism.

BACKGROUND: Deutetrabenazine is approved in the USA, China, Australia, Israel, Brazil, and South Korea for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington disease. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study included patients who completed a double-blind study (Rollover) and patients who converted overnight from a stable tetrabenazine dose (Switch). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (adverse events per person-year) were calculated. Efficacy was analyzed using a stable post-titration timepoint (8 weeks). Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score and total maximal chorea score from baseline to week 8, as well as those from week 8 to week 145 (or the last visit on the study drug if that occurred earlier), were evaluated as both efficacy and safety endpoints during the study. RESULTS: Of 119 patients (Rollover, n = 82; Switch, n = 37), 100 (84%) completed >= 1 year of treatment. End-of-study exposure-adjusted incidence rates for adverse events in Rollover and Switch, respectively, were: any, 2.57 and 4.02; serious, 0.11 and 0.14; leading to dose suspension, 0.05 and 0.04. Common adverse events (>= 4% either cohort) included somnolence (Rollover, 20%; Switch, 30%), depression (32%; 22%), anxiety (27%; 35%), insomnia (23%; 16%), and akathisia (6%; 11%). Adverse events of interest included suicidality (9%; 5%) and parkinsonism (4%; 8%). Mean dose at week 8 was 38.1 mg (Rollover) and 36.5 mg (Switch). Mean dose across cohorts after titration was 37.6 mg; at the final visit, mean dose across cohorts was 45.7 mg. Patients showed minimal change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea scores with stable dosing from weeks 8-145 or at the end of treatment, but total motor score increased versus week 8 (mean change [standard deviation]: 8.2 [11.9]). There were no unexpected adverse events upon drug withdrawal, and mean (standard deviation) total maximal chorea scores increased 4.7 (4.6) units from week 8 to 1-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events observed with long-term deutetrabenazine exposure were consistent with previous studies. Reductions in chorea persisted over time. Upon treatment cessation, there was no unexpected worsening of chorea. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01897896.",

                    "text": "Tetrabenazine Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Chorea Associated with Huntington Disease: A Retrospective Chart Review. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate early disease mechanisms that potentially could be used as a target therapeutically.

In CSF of HTT gene expansion carriers, we found increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, and increased consumption of the lymphocyte growth factor IL-7 before motor onset of HD. In concordance, we observed an increased prevalence of IL-17-producing Th17.1 cells in the CSF of HTT gene expansion carriers, predominantly in pre-motor manifest individuals.

                    "text": "Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 Activation Improves Motor Performance and Reduces Pathology in Heterozygous zQ175 Huntington Disease Mice. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been widely reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and Huntington disease. An increasing number of studies have implicated altered glucose and energy metabolism in patients with AD. There is compelling evidence of abnormalities in some of the key mitochondrial enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes, which play a great significance role in the pathogenesis of AD. Changes in some of the enzyme activities of the mitochondria found in AD have been linked with the pathology of amyloid-beta (Abeta). This review highlights the role of mitochondrial function in the production and clearance of Abeta and how the pathology of Abeta leads to a decrease in energy metabolism by affecting mitochondrial function.",

OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by the mutant huntingtin gene (mHTT), which harbors expanded CAG repeats. We previously reported that the brain vessel density is higher in mice and patients with HD than in controls. The present study determines whether vascular function is altered in HD and characterizes the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The brain vessel density and vascular reactivity (VR) to carbogen challenge of HD mice were monitored by 3D DeltaR2 -mMRA and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)/flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. The amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and the pericyte coverage were determined by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in human and mouse brain sections, primary mouse astrocytes and pericytes, and human astrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. RESULTS: Expression of mHTT in astrocytes and neurons is sufficient to increase the brain vessel density in HD mice. BOLD and FAIR MRI revealed gradually impaired VR to carbogen in HD mice. Astrocytes from HD mice and patients contained more VEGF-A, which triggers proliferation of endothelial cells and may be responsible for the augmented neurovascular changes. Moreover, an astrocytic inflammatory response, which reduces the survival of pericytes through an IkappaB kinase-dependent pathway, mediates the low pericyte coverage of blood vessels in HD brains. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the inflammation-prone HD astrocytes provide less pericyte coverage by promoting angiogenesis and reducing the number of pericytes and that these changes can explain the inferior VR in HD mice. The resultant impaired VR might hinder cerebral hemodynamics and increase brain atrophy during HD progression.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

Quantitation of huntingtin protein in the brain is needed, both as a marker of Huntington disease (HD) progression and for use in clinical gene silencing trials. Measurement of huntingtin in cerebrospinal fluid could be a biomarker of brain huntingtin, but traditional protein quantitation methods have failed to detect huntingtin in cerebrospinal fluid. Using micro-bead based immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM), we have developed a highly sensitive mutant huntingtin detection assay. The sensitivity of huntingtin IP-FCM enables accurate detection of mutant huntingtin protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of HD patients and model mice, demonstrating that mutant huntingtin levels in cerebrospinal fluid reflect brain levels, increasing with disease stage and decreasing following brain huntingtin suppression. This technique has potential applications as a research tool and as a clinical biomarker. ",

We created a two-sample test to analyze cerebellar gray matter (GM) differences between groups and another to correlate GM alterations with UHDRS and MOCA, corrected for age, expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats, and disease duration using the spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT)-SPM-toolbox which preserves anatomical detailing. We found increased GM density in the anterior cerebellum compared to controls. Higher GM density in the postero-superior lobe correlated with mood symptoms. Worse motor function and better cognitive function correlated with GM changes in the posterior cerebellum (false discovery rate (FDR) correction p < 0.05 and k > 100 voxels). In this detailed study of the in vivo cerebellar morphology in HD, we observed GM changes in regions involved in sensorimotor integration, motor planning, and emotional processing, supporting cerebellar involvement in the neuropathological process of HD.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

BACKGROUND: The underlying cause of major neurodegenerative disorders remains a healthcare mystery. The thoroughly investigated causes include oxidative stress, inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular neuronal protein aggregation. Withania somnifera has been used for more than 2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha, neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The current review substantially deciphered the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders. However, future studies are further required better to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their neuroprotective nature.",

Withania somnifera has been used for more than 2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha, neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The current review substantially deciphered the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders. However, future studies are further required better to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their neuroprotective nature.",

OBJECTIVE: The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD. METHODS: We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT-HD, TRACK-HD, and IMAGE-HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease-affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers. RESULTS: We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (>0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of >80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers. INTERPRETATION: Our findings provide the first cross-study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials.

The aim of the present review article is to summarize the role of nanodiamonds in various neurological diseases. We have taken related literature of making this review article from ScienceDirect, springer, Research gate, PubMed, Sci-finder, etc. The current approaches for treating neurological conditions such as glioblastoma includes chemotherapy or combination anti-retro viral therapy for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or use of anti-Alzheimer drugs during cognitive impairment. These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization, multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted drug delivery with minimal side effects.",

                    "text": "Recent advances in the therapeutic development for Huntington disease. INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis with the mutation allow for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT transcript as a therapeutic strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise heterozygosity estimates are needed across diverse HD patient populations. Here we present the first comprehensive investigation of all common target alleles across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives in Canada, Sweden, France, and Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and A3a) define mutually exclusive sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy in the greatest number of patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80% are treatable using these three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion found exclusively on the A1 haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of mutant HTT in approximately 40% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the deletion reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78% in patient cells while sparing wild-type HTT expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG occurs, we demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific therapy for a monogenic disorder. ",

Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.",

BACKGROUND: The cohort-level risk of Huntington disease (HD) is related to the age and symptom level of the cohort, but this relationship has not been made precise. OBJECTIVE: To predict the evolving likelihood of carrying the Huntington disease (HD) gene for at-risk adults using age and sign level. METHODS: Using data from adults with early signs and symptoms of HD linked to information on genetic status, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that an undiagnosed individual of a certain age and sign level has an expanded CAG repeat. RESULTS: Both age and sign levels have substantial influence on the likelihood of HD onset, and the probability of eventual diagnosis changes as those at risk age and exhibit (or fail to exhibit) symptoms. For example, our data suggest that in a cohort of individuals age 26 with a Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score of 7-10 70% of them will carry the HD mutation. For individuals age 56, the same motor score suggests only a 40% chance of carrying the mutation. Early motor signs of HD, overall and the chorea subscore, were highly predictive of disease onset at any age. However, body mass index (BMI) and cognitive performance scores were not as highly predictive. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that if researchers or clinicians are looking for early clues of HD, it may be more foretelling to look at motor rather than cognitive signs. Application of similar approaches could be used with other adult-onset genetic conditions.",

In contrast to classic neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors, drugs that deplete presynaptic dopamine by blocking vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) seem to be safer and have little or no risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is one reason why there has been a recent emergence of novel VMAT2 inhibitors. Areas covered: Since the approval of tetrabenazine, the classic VMAT2 inhibitor, in the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD), other VMAT2 inhibitors (e.g. deutetrabenazine and valbenazine) have been studied in the treatment of HD-related chorea, tardive dyskinesia and tics associated with Tourette syndrome. This review, based largely on a detailed search of PubMed, will summarize the pharmacology and clinical experience with the various VMAT2 inhibitors. Expert commentary: Because of differences in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics these new VMAT2 inhibitors promise to be at least as effective as tetrabenazine but with a lower risk of adverse effects, such as sedation, insomnia, depression, parkinsonism, and akathisia.",

Cognitive and behavioral (psychiatric) changes in HD are summarized and implications for ongoing advancement in our knowledge of prodromal HD are suggested. The earliest detected cognitive changes are observed in the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Interference, Stroop Color and Word Test-interference condition, and Trail Making Test. Cognitive changes in the middle and near motor diagnostic stages of prodromal HD involve nearly every cognitive test administered and the greatest changes over time (i.e., slopes) are found in those prodromal HD participants who are nearest to motor diagnosis. Psychiatric changes demonstrate significant worsening over time and remain elevated compared with healthy controls throughout the prodromal disease course. Psychiatric and behavior changes in prodromal HD are much lower than that obtained using cognitive assessment, although the psychiatric and behavioral changes represent symptoms most debilitating to independent capacity and wellness.",

Patients with Huntington's disease suffer from disturbances in the perception of emotions; they do not correctly read the body, vocal and facial expressions of others. With regard to the expression of emotions, it has been shown that they are impaired in expressing emotions through face but up until now, little research has been conducted about their ability to express emotions through spoken language. To better understand emotion production in both voice and language in Huntington's Disease (HD), we tested 115 individuals: 68 patients (HD), 22 participants carrying the mutant HD gene without any motor symptoms (pre-manifest HD), and 25 controls in a single-centre prospective observational follow-up study. Participants were recorded in interviews in which they were asked to recall sad, angry, happy, and neutral stories. Emotion expression through voice and language was investigated by comparing the identifiability of emotions expressed by controls, preHD and HD patients in these interviews. To assess separately vocal and linguistic expression of emotions in a blind design, we used machine learning models instead of a human jury performing a forced-choice recognition test. Results from this study showed that patients with HD had difficulty expressing emotions through both voice and language compared to preHD participants and controls, who behaved similarly and above chance. In addition, we did not find any differences in expression of emotions between preHD and healthy controls. We further validated our newly proposed methodology with a human jury on the speech produced by the controls. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that emotional deficits in HD are caused by impaired sensori-motor representations of emotions, in line with embodied cognition theories. This study also shows how machine learning models can be leveraged to assess emotion expression in a blind and reproducible way.",

BACKGROUND: Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length immunoglobulins and offer important advantages compared with conventional monoclonal antibodies: extreme specificity, higher affinity, superior stability and solubility, reduced immunogenicity as well as easy and inexpensive large-scale production. OBJECTIVE: In this article we will review and discuss recombinant antibodies that are being evaluated for neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical models and in clinical studies and will summarize new strategies that are being developed to optimize their stability, specificity and potency for advancing their use. METHODS: Articles describing recombinant antibody fragments used for neurological diseases were selected (PubMed) and evaluated for their significance. RESULTS: Different antibody formats such as single-chain fragment variable (scFv), single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs or sdAbs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), intrabodies and nanobodies, are currently being studied in pre-clinical models of cancer as well as infectious and autoimmune diseases and many of them are being tested as therapeutics in clinical trials. Immunotherapy approaches have shown therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of Alzheimer s disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington disease (HD), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that recombinant antibody fragments may neutralize toxic extra- and intracellular misfolded proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, DLB, FTD, HD or TSEs and may target toxic immune cells participating in the pathogenesis of MS. CONCLUSION: Recombinant antibody fragments represent a promising tool for the development of antibody-based immunotherapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) is an expansion of traditional, static FNC that measures connectivity variation among brain networks throughout scan duration. We used a large resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) sample from the PREDICT-HD study (N = 183 Huntington disease gene mutation carriers [HDgmc] and N = 78 healthy control [HC] participants) to examine whole-brain dFNC and its associations with CAG repeat length as well as the product of scaled CAG length and age, a variable representing disease burden. We also tested for relationships between functional connectivity and motor and cognitive measurements. Group independent component analysis was applied to rs-fMRI data to obtain whole-brain resting state networks. FNC was defined as the correlation between RSN time-courses. Dynamic FNC behavior was captured using a sliding time window approach, and FNC results from each window were assigned to four clusters representing FNC states, using a k-means clustering algorithm. HDgmc individuals spent significantly more time in State-1 (the state with the weakest FNC pattern) compared to HC. However, overall HC individuals showed more FNC dynamism than HDgmc. Significant associations between FNC states and genetic and clinical variables were also identified. In FNC State-4 (the one that most resembled static FNC), HDgmc exhibited significantly decreased connectivity between the putamen and medial prefrontal cortex compared to HC, and this was significantly associated with cognitive performance. In FNC State-1, disease burden in HDgmc participants was significantly associated with connectivity between the postcentral gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as between the inferior occipital gyrus and posterior parietal cortex.",

Disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is a common feature for different neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Although the interplay between perturbed BBB homeostasis and the pathogenesis of brain disorders needs further investigation, the development and validation of a reliable procedure to accurately detect BBB alterations may be crucial and represent a useful tool for potentially predicting disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we present an easy and efficient procedure for evaluating BBB leakage in a neurodegenerative condition like that occurring in a preclinical mouse model of Huntington disease, in which defects in the permeability of BBB are clearly detectable precociously in the disease. Specifically, the high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled (FITC)-albumin, which is able to cross the BBB only when the latter is impaired, is acutely infused into a mouse jugular vein and its distribution in the vascular or parenchymal districts is then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of green fluorescent-albumin in the brain parenchyma functions as an index of aberrant BBB permeability and, when quantitated by using Image J processing software, is reported as Green Fluorescence Intensity.",

The basis for region-specific neuronal toxicity in Huntington disease is unknown. Here, we show that region-specific neuronal vulnerability is a substrate-driven response in astrocytes. Glucose is low in HdhQ(150/150) animals, and astrocytes in each brain region adapt by metabolically reprogramming their mitochondria to use endogenous, non-glycolytic metabolites as an alternative fuel. Each region is characterized by distinct metabolic pools, and astrocytes adapt accordingly. The vulnerable striatum is enriched in fatty acids, and mitochondria reprogram by oxidizing them as an energy source but at the cost of escalating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage. The cerebellum is replete with amino acids, which are precursors for glucose regeneration through the pentose phosphate shunt or gluconeogenesis pathways. ROS is not elevated, and this region sustains little damage. While mhtt expression imposes disease stress throughout the brain, sensitivity or resistance arises from an adaptive stress response, which is inherently region specific. Metabolic reprogramming may have relevance to other diseases.",

Huntington Disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease which leads to involuntary movements and impaired balance. These changes have been quantified using footstep pressure sensor mats such as Protokinetics' Zeno Walkway. Drawing from distances between recorded footsteps, patients' disease severity have been measured in terms of high level gait characteristics such as gait width and stride length. However, little attention has been paid to the pressure data collected during formation of individual footsteps. This work investigates the potential of classifying patient disease severity based on individual footstep pressure data using deep learning techniques. Using the Motor Subscale of the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) as the gold standard, our experiments showed that using VGG16 and similar modules can achieve classification accuracy of 89%. Image pre-processing are key steps for better model performance. This classification accuracy is compared to results based on 3D CNN (82%) and SVM (86.9%).",

BACKGROUND: Following predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD), knowledge of one's carrier status may have consequences on disease onset. Our study aimed to address two questions. First, does knowledge of being a carrier of the pathological HD mutation trigger onset of the disease? Second, does this knowledge influence self-awareness and allow carriers to identify signs and symptoms of disease onset? METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 75 HD mutation carriers were examined using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score. Onset estimation made with the disease burden score was compared with UHDRS findings. We collected qualitative data with questionnaires and semistructured interviews. RESULTS: 38 women and 37 men, aged 43.7 years+-10.5 (20-68), were interviewed after a mean delay between test and study interview of 10.5 years+-4.7 (from 4 to 21 years). Estimation of age at onset was 4.5+-8.5 years earlier than data-derived age at onset. Participants were categorised according to their motor score: scores <5 were premanifest (n=35), and scores >5 were manifest carriers (n=40). Self-observation was a major preoccupation for all, independent of their clinical status (82% vs 74%, p=0.57). Among manifest carriers, 56% thought they showed symptoms, but only 33% felt ill. Interestingly, this was also observed in those without motor signs (20% and 9%). Being a mutation carrier did not significantly facilitate recognition of motor signs. Interviews with premanifest carriers allowed the burden of self-observation to be illustrated despite lack of motor signs. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating age at onset based on disease burden score may not be accurate. The transition to disease was experienced as an ambiguous or liminal experience. The view of mutation carriers is not always concordant with medical onset estimation, highlighting the difficulties involved in the concept of onset and its use as an outcome in future disease-modifying trials.",

Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for this neurodegenerative disease.

Neurodegenerative diseases that affect serious gait abnormalities include Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington disease (HD). These diseases lead to gait rhythm distortion that can be determined by stride time interval of footfall contact times. In this paper, we present a new method for gait classification of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we utilize a symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm to convert left-foot stride-stride interval into a sequence of symbols using a symbolic aggregate approximation. We then find string prototypes of each class using the newly proposed string grammar unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy C-medians. Then in the testing process the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor is used. We implement the system on three 2-class problems, i.e., the classification of ALS against healthy patients, that of HD against healthy patients , and that of PD against healthy patients. The system is also implemented on one 4-class problem (the classification of ALS, HD, PD, and healthy patients altogether) called NDDs versus healthy. We found that our system yields a very good detection result. The average correct classification for ALS versus healthy is 96.88%, and that for HD versus healthy is 97.22%, whereas that for PD versus healthy is 96.43%. When the system is implemented on 4-class problem, the average accuracy is approximately 98.44%. It can provide prototypes of gait signals that are more understandable to human.",

BACKGROUND: Motor impairment appears as a characteristic symptom of several diseases and injuries. Therefore, tests for analyzing motor dysfunction are widely applied across preclinical models and disease stages. Among those, gait analysis tests are commonly used, but they generate a huge number of gait parameters. Thus, complications in data analysis and reporting raise, which often leads to premature parameter selection. NEW METHODS: In order to avoid arbitrary parameter selection, we present here a systematic initial data analysis by utilizing heat-maps for data reporting. We exemplified this approach within an intervention study, as well as applied it to two longitudinal studies in rodent models related to Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington disease (HD). RESULTS: The systematic initial data analysis (IDA) is feasible for exploring gait parameters, both in experimental and longitudinal studies. The resulting heat maps provided a visualization of gait parameters within a single chart, highlighting important clusters of differences. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Often, premature parameter selection is practiced, lacking comprehensiveness. Researchers often use multiple separated graphs on distinct gait parameters for reporting. Additionally, negative results are often not reported. CONCLUSIONS: Heat mapping utilized in initial data analysis is advantageous for reporting clustered gait parameter differences in one single chart and improves data mining.",

BACKGROUND: For reasons of cost and ethical concerns, models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) are currently being developed in farm animals, as an alternative to non-human primates. Developing reliable methods of testing cognitive function is essential to determining the usefulness of such models. Nevertheless, cognitive testing of farm animal species presents a unique set of challenges. The primary aims of this study were to develop and validate a mobile operant system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing of sheep. NEW METHOD: We designed a semi-automated testing system with the capability of presenting stimuli (visual, auditory) and reward at six spatial locations. Fourteen normal sheep were used to validate the system using a two-choice visual discrimination task. Four stages of training devised to acclimatise animals to the system are also presented. RESULTS: All sheep progressed rapidly through the training stages, over eight sessions. All sheep learned the 2CVDT and performed at least one reversal stage. The mean number of trials the sheep took to reach criterion in the first acquisition learning was 13.9+-1.5 and for the reversal learning was 19.1+-1.8. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): This is the first mobile semi-automated operant system developed for testing cognitive function in sheep. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed and validated an automated operant behavioural testing system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing in sheep and other medium-sized quadrupeds, such as pigs and dogs. Sheep performance in the two-choice visual discrimination task was very similar to that reported for non-human primates and strongly supports the use of farm animals as pre-clinical models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q, n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001). No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically. Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.",

Innovations in light microscopy have tremendously revolutionized the way researchers study biological systems with subcellular resolution. In particular, fluorescence microscopy with the expanding choices of fluorescent probes has provided a comprehensive toolkit to tag and visualize various molecules of interest with exquisite specificity and high sensitivity. Although fluorescence microscopy is currently the method of choice for cellular imaging, it faces fundamental limitations for studying the vast number of small biomolecules. This is because common fluorescent labels, which are relatively bulky, could introduce considerable perturbation to or even completely alter the native functions of vital small biomolecules. Hence, despite their immense functional importance, these small biomolecules remain largely undetectable by fluorescence microscopy. To address this challenge, a bioorthogonal chemical imaging platform has recently been introduced. By coupling stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, an emerging nonlinear Raman microscopy technique, with tiny and Raman-active vibrational probes (e.g., alkynes and stable isotopes), bioorthogonal chemical imaging exhibits superb sensitivity, specificity, and biocompatibility for imaging small biomolecules in live systems. In this Account, we review recent technical achievements for visualizing a broad spectrum of small biomolecules, including ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, amino acids, fatty acids, choline, glucose, cholesterol, and small-molecule drugs in live biological systems ranging from individual cells to animal tissues and model organisms. Importantly, this platform is compatible with live-cell biology, thus allowing real-time imaging of small-molecule dynamics. Moreover, we discuss further chemical and spectroscopic strategies for multicolor bioorthogonal chemical imaging, a valuable technique in the era of \"omics\". As a unique tool for biological discovery, this platform has been applied to studying various metabolic processes under both physiological and pathological states, including protein synthesis activity of neuronal systems, protein aggregations in Huntington disease models, glucose uptake in tumor xenografts, and drug penetration through skin tissues. We envision that the coupling of SRS microscopy with vibrational probes would do for small biomolecules what fluorescence microscopy of fluorophores has done for larger molecular species.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The typical motor symptoms have been associated with basal ganglia pathology. However, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms often precede the motor component and may be due to changes in the limbic system. Recent work has indicated pathology in the hypothalamus in HD but other parts of the limbic system have not been extensively studied. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in HD also include white matter pathology. Here we investigated if the main white matter tract of the limbic system, the fornix, is affected in HD. We demonstrate that the fornix is 34% smaller already in prodromal HD and 41% smaller in manifest HD compared to controls using volumetric analyses of MRI of the IMAGE-HD study. In post-mortem fornix tissue from HD cases, we confirm the smaller fornix volume in HD which is accompanied by signs of myelin breakdown and reduced levels of the transcription factor myelin regulating factor but detect no loss of oligodendrocytes. Further analyses using RNA-sequencing demonstrate downregulation of oligodendrocyte identity markers in the fornix of HD cases. Analysis of differentially expressed genes based on transcription-factor/target-gene interactions also revealed enrichment for binding sites of SUZ12 and EZH2, components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, as well as RE1 Regulation Transcription Factor. Taken together, our data show that there is early white matter pathology of the fornix in the limbic system in HD likely due to a combination of reduction in oligodendrocyte genes and myelin break down.",

Conventional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging depicts important anatomic information and helps to identify imaging patterns which may support diagnosis of a specific motor disorder. Advanced imaging techniques can provide further detail regarding volume, functional, or metabolic changes occurring in nervous system pathology. This chapter is an overview of the advances in neuroimaging with particular emphasis on both standard and less well-known advanced imaging techniques and findings, such as diffusion tensor imaging or volumetric studies, and their application to specific motor disorders. In addition, it provides reference to emerging imaging biomarkers in motor system disorders such as Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease, and briefly reviews the neuroimaging findings in different causes of myelopathy and peripheral nerve disorders.",

We performed the Unified HD rating scale (UHDRS) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) in 26 HD patients and 26 healthy controls. We created a two-sample test to analyze cerebellar gray matter (GM) differences between groups and another to correlate GM alterations with UHDRS and MOCA, corrected for age, expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats, and disease duration using the spatially unbiased atlas template (SUIT)-SPM-toolbox which preserves anatomical detailing. We found increased GM density in the anterior cerebellum compared to controls. Higher GM density in the postero-superior lobe correlated with mood symptoms. Worse motor function and better cognitive function correlated with GM changes in the posterior cerebellum (false discovery rate (FDR) correction p < 0.05 and k > 100 voxels). In this detailed study of the in vivo cerebellar morphology in HD, we observed GM changes in regions involved in sensorimotor integration, motor planning, and emotional processing, supporting cerebellar involvement in the neuropathological process of HD.",

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant rejection is considered as a vital factor of kidney transplant failure. Therefore, it's necessary to search for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study, we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We reported several potential genes may be associated with the kidney transplant rejection, which should provide novel biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance.",

The screening included analyses for C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD phenocopies.",

We detected atrophy in the deep gray matter, particularly in putamen, from early premanifest stages.

BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

Englisch: Being one of the most common genetic neurodegenerative disease, Huntington's disease has been a model disease - also for gene therapy. Among the various options, the development of antisense oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus. Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene therapy against Huntington's disease.",

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the most common subtype of SCA worldwide, is caused by mutation of CAG repeats expansion in ATXN3. Body mass index (BMI) is an important modulatory factor in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, its relevance in SCA3 is not well understood. In this study, BMI was investigated in 134 molecularly confirmed SCA3 patients and 136 healthy controls from China. The multivariable linear regression models were performed to establish the putative risk factors for BMI, and whether BMI could affect the severity of ataxia. We found that BMI was significantly lower in the case group than that in the control group. The age at onset (positive correlation) and severity of ataxia (negative correlation) were the risk factors affecting BMI. Conversely, BMI along with the disease duration, the age at onset, and the numbers of CAG repeats could also have influence on the severity of ataxia. In conclusion, SCA3 patients had lower BMI than matched controls and BMI is a predictor of disease progression in SCA3. Nutritional intervention to promote weight gain could be a promising strategy to impede SCA3 progression.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies. Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement. RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.",

INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a degeneration of the brain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004), the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p = 0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50 to 3.16; p = 0.007).

                    "text": "Clinical recommendations to guide physical therapy practice for Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies. Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided a promising tool for cell therapy. Umbilical cord (UC) is one of the best sources of MSCs since its collection is noninvasive, and effortless, and the cells from this source are more capable and prolific. It has been proven that the differentiation, migration and protective properties of UC-MSCs are superior compared with other kinds of stem cells. Moreover, incurable neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Huntington, encourage scientists to apply UC-MSCs transplantation in order to find a definite treatment. This review will focus on the preclinical and clinical use of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical cord in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low.

Presymptomatic genetic testing allows at-risk individuals to clarify their risk status. Understanding the characteristics and motivations of individuals seeking HD presymptomatic genetic testing better equips genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive and personalized care. The aims of this study were to (1) determine whether the average age when individuals seek presymptomatic HD genetic testing has decreased over time, (2) assess motivations for seeking testing, (3) explore whether there is a relationship between age and motivations, and (4) explore genetic counselors' perceptions of the shift in age. Data from the US HD testing centers (N = 4) were analyzed. A small but statistically significant decrease in age of individuals seeking presymptomatic testing was observed (p = 0.045). HD community members (N = 77) were surveyed regarding presymptomatic testing motivations. Younger individuals were more likely than older individuals to cite \"To learn whether or not you would develop HD\" and \"To make choices about further education or a career\" compared to older individuals (p < 0.05). Conversely, older individuals more frequently cited \"To give children a better idea of their risk\" (p < 0.002). Sixteen percent of genetic counselors surveyed (6/37) perceived a change in age of testing. All of these respondents had provided HD testing for ten or more years and anecdotally believed the age at testing has decreased over time. Study results help providers personalize counseling based on patient's age and serve as a starting point for more research into the relationship between age at testing and motivations for testing.",

The scope of our study is to investigate the expansion frequency in a Greek HD-L cohort and the meta-analysis of all published cases. This will be of use in genetic counseling of these cases. Methods: A cohort of 74 patients with HD-L and 67 healthy controls were screened for the C9orf72 expansion status. Case-controls comparison was assessed with the Pearson's chi-square statistic for a 2 x 2 table.A systematic database search was conducted and seven studies, including the current study, were considered eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis considering a total of 812 patients with HD phenocopies. Pooled mutation frequency was calculated using a Random Effects model or the Mantel-Haezsel fixed effects model, depending on the observed heterogeneity. Results: In our cohort, one patient was found to have a pathologic expansion of C9orf72, and none from the control group (chi-square: 0.91, p-value: 0.34).

The expanded CAG repeat number in HTT gene causes Huntington disease (HD), which is a severe, dominant neurodegenerative illness. The accurate determination of the expanded allele size is crucial to confirm the genetic status in symptomatic and presymptomatic at-risk subjects and avoid genetic polymorphism-related false-negative diagnoses. Precise CAG repeat number determination is critical to discriminate the cutoff between unexpanded and intermediate mutable alleles (IAs, 27-35 CAG) as well as between IAs and pathological, low-penetrance alleles (i.e., 36-39 CAG repeats), and it is also critical to detect large repeat expansions causing pediatric HD variants. We analyzed the HTT-CAG repeat number of 14 DNA reference materials and of a DNA collection of 43 additional samples carrying unexpanded, IAs, low and complete penetrance alleles, including large (>60 repeats) and very large (>100 repeats) expansions using a novel triplet-primed PCR-based assay, the AmplideX PCR/CE HTT Kit. The results demonstrate that the method accurately genotypes both normal and expanded HTT-CAG repeat numbers and reveals previously undisclosed and very large CAG expansions >200 repeats. We also show that this technique can improve genetic test reliability and accuracy by detecting CAG expansions in samples with sequence variations within or adjacent to the repeat tract that cause allele drop-outs or inaccuracies using other PCR methods.",

BACKGROUND: Clinical care teams providing presymptomatic genetic testing often employ advanced confidentiality practices for documentation and result storage. However, patient requests for increased confidentiality may be in conflict with the legal obligations of medical providers to document patient care activities in the electronic health record (EHR). Huntington disease presents a representative case study for investigating the ways centers currently balance the requirements of EHRs with the privacy demands of patients seeking presymptomatic genetic testing. METHODS: We surveyed 23 HD centers (53% response rate) regarding their use of the EHR for presymptomatic HD testing. RESULTS: Our survey revealed that clinical care teams and laboratories have each developed their own practices, which are cumbersome and often include EHR avoidance. We found that a majority of HD care teams record appointments in the EHR (91%), often using vague notes. Approximately half of the care teams (52%) keep presymptomatic results of out of the EHR. CONCLUSION: As genetic knowledge grows, linking more genes to late-onset conditions, institutions will benefit from having professional recommendations to guide development of policies for EHR documentation of presymptomatic genetic results. Policies must be sensitive to the ethical differences and patient demands for presymptomatic genetic testing compared to those undergoing confirmatory genetic testing.",

This qualitative study gathered opinions about genetic testing from people who received presymptomatic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) 20-30 years ago and have lived with the implications of that testing for decades. During the last section of a semi-structured interview, participants were asked open-ended questions about their opinions on the importance of autonomy in the decision to be tested for HD, whether a formal HD testing protocol is necessary, whether physician ordering for HD is acceptable without a formal protocol, whether online direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for HD is acceptable, and whether incidental/secondary findings should be returned in the context of whole exome/genome sequencing. Most-but not all-participants were in favor of an individual's right to decide whether and when to pursue HD testing, use of a formal HD testing protocol, and returning medically actionable secondary findings. However, the majority of participants were opposed not only to physician ordering and DTC HD testing in the absence of a formal protocol but also to returning a secondary finding of an expanded HD allele. This study presents the opinions of a unique and extremely well-informed cohort on issues that need to be taken into careful consideration by genetic counselors and other medical professionals who are developing genetic testing protocols, making decisions about the availability of genetic tests, and making decisions about whether and how to return incidental findings.",

OBJECTIVE: The huntingtin gene is critical for the formation and differentiation of the CNS, which raises questions about the neurodevelopmental effect of CAG expansion mutations within this gene (mHTT) that cause Huntington disease (HD). We sought to test the hypothesis that child and adolescent carriers of mHTT exhibit different brain growth compared to peers without the mutation by conducting structural MRI in youth who are at risk for HD. We also explored whether the length of CAG expansion affects brain development. METHODS: Children and adolescents (age 6-18) with a parent or grandparent diagnosed with HD underwent MRI and blinded genetic testing to confirm the presence or absence of mHTT. Seventy-five individuals were gene-expanded (GE) and 97 individuals were gene-nonexpanded (GNE). The GE group was estimated to be on average 35 years from clinical onset. Following an accelerated longitudinal design, age-related changes in brain regions were estimated. RESULTS: Age-related striatal volume changes differed significantly between the GE and GNE groups, with initial hypertrophy and more rapid volume decline in GE. This pattern was exaggerated with CAG expansion length for CAG > 50. A similar age-dependent group difference was observed for the globus pallidus, but not in other major regions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pathogenesis of HD begins with abnormal brain development. An understanding of potential neurodevelopmental features associated with mHTT may be needed for optimized implementation of preventative gene silencing therapies, such that normal aspects of neurodevelopment are preserved as neurodegeneration is forestalled.",

Huntington disease (HD) is most prevalent among populations of western European descent and isolated populations where founder effects may operate. The aim of this study was to examine the epidemiology of HD in Cyprus, an island in southern Europe with extensive western European colonization in the past. All registered HD patients in the Cyprus, since 1994, were included. Detailed pedigrees and clinical information were recorded and maps, showing the geographic distribution of HD, were constructed. Requests for genetic testing were also examined. The project identified 58 clinically manifested cases of HD belonging to 19 families. The 16 families of Cypriot origin were concentrated in a confined geographical cluster in southeast Cyprus. In 2015, prevalence of symptomatic HD was 4.64/100 000 population, while incidence was 0.12/100 000 person-years. Prevalence displayed a marked increase during the past 20 years. Disease characteristics of HD patients were similar to those reported in western European populations. Lastly, the uptake of predictive and/or prenatal testing was limited. HD disease characteristics, incidence and prevalence in Cyprus were comparable to western European populations. Together with the geographical clustering observed, these results support the possibility for a relatively recent founder effect of HD in Cyprus, potentially of western European origin.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a late onset ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine ( CAG) triplet repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene which was discovered in 1993. The PHAROS study is a unique observational study of 1001 individuals at risk for HD who had not been previously tested for HD and who had no plans to do so. In this cohort, 104 (10%) individuals changed their minds and chose to be tested during the course of the study but outside of the study protocol. Baseline behavioral scores, especially apathy, were more strongly associated with later genetic testing than motor and chorea scores, particularly among subjects with expanded CAG repeat length. In the CAG expanded group, those choosing to be tested were older and had more chorea and higher scores on the behavioral section of the unified Huntington's disease rating scale at baseline than those not choosing to be tested. Following genetic testing, 56% of subjects with CAG < 37 had less depression when compared to prior to testing, but depression generally stayed the same or increased for 64% of subjects in the expanded group. This finding suggests that approaches to testing must continue to be cautious, with appropriate medical, psychological and social support.",

OBJECTIVE: To define the role played by microglia in different stages of Huntington disease (HD), we used the TSPO radioligand [11C]-ER176 and PET to evaluate microglial activation in relation to neurodegeneration and in relation to the clinical features seen at premanifest and manifest stages of the disease. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study in which 18 subjects (6 controls, 6 premanifest, and 6 manifest HD gene carriers) underwent a [11C]-ER176 PET scan and an MRI for anatomic localization. Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) was performed, and group differences in [11C]-ER176 binding (used to evaluate the extent of microglial activation) were assessed by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Microglial activation was correlated with ROIs volumes, disease burden, and the scores obtained in the clinical scales. As an exploratory aim, we evaluated the dynamic functions of microglia in vitro, by using induced microglia-like (iMG) cells from peripheral blood monocytes. RESULTS: Individuals with manifest HD present higher [11C]-ER176 SUVR in both globi pallidi and putamina in comparison with controls. No differences were observed when we compared premanifest HD with controls or with manifest HD. We also found a significant correlation between increased microglial activation and cumulative disease burden, and with reduced volumes. iMG from controls, premanifest HD, and manifest HD patients showed similar phagocytic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data demonstrate that microglial activation is involved in HD pathophysiology and is associated with disease progression.",

                    "text": "Behavioral Symptoms in Premanifest Huntington Disease Correlate with Reduced Frontal CB1R Levels. Many Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers already have cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in the premanifest (premotor) phase of the disease (pre-HD), but the molecular underpinnings of these symptoms are not well understood. Previous work has shown reduced availability of the cerebral type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) in manifest HD. Here, we investigated whether CB1R binding is related to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in pre-HD mutation carriers. Methods: CB1R binding was measured with 18F-MK-9470 (N-[(2S,3S)-3-(3-cyanophenyl)-4-(4-ethoxyphenyl)butan-2-yl]-2-methyl-2-(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)oxypropanamide) PET in 15 pre-HD subjects (8 men, 7 women; age, 39.3 +- 9.9 y), 15 gene-negative controls from HD families (9 men, 6 women; age, 37.0 +- 10.6 y), and 12 community controls (6 men and 6 women; age, 39.9 +- 15.1 y). All subjects also underwent extensive assessment of motor and cognitive function, as well as a behavioral test battery including the Problem Behavior Assessment for HD (PBA-HD), and MRI. Parametric binding images of 18F-MK-9470 were corrected for partial-volume effect. Results: There was no difference in CB1R binding, gray matter volume, cognitive function, or psychiatric scores between gene-negative controls from HD families and community controls, which were therefore pooled to one control group. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects showed striatal atrophy, a decrease in CB1R binding in the prefrontal cortex, and higher PBA-HD scores on depression, apathy, and irritability (range, P = 0.01-0.005). The PBA-HD scores inversely correlated with CB1R binding in prefrontal regions and cingulate cortex in pre-HD (range: r = -0.64 to -0.72; P = 0.01-0.008). Conclusion: The association between behavioral symptoms and reduced prefrontal CB1R levels may provide new insight into the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pre-HD and suggest new therapeutic avenues.",

PURPOSE: Pridopidine is an investigational drug for Huntington disease (HD). Pridopidine was originally thought to act as a dopamine stabilizer. However, pridopidine shows highest affinity to the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) and enhances neuroprotection via the S1R in preclinical studies. Using [18F] fluspidine and [18F] fallypride PET, the purpose of this study was to assess in vivo target engagement/receptor occupancy of pridopidine to the S1R and dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) at clinical relevant doses in healthy volunteers (HVs) and as proof-of-concept in a small number of patients with HD. METHODS: Using [18F] fluspidine PET (300 MBq, 0-90 min), 11 male HVs (pridopidine 0.5 to 90 mg; six dose groups) and three male patients with HD (pridopidine 90 mg) were investigated twice, without and 2 h after single dose of pridopidine. Using [18F] fallypride PET (200 MBq, 0-210 min), four male HVs were studied without and 2 h following pridopidine administration (90 mg). Receptor occupancy was analyzed by the Lassen plot. RESULTS: S1R occupancy as function of pridopidine dose (or plasma concentration) in HVs could be described by a three-parameter Hill equation with a Hill coefficient larger than one. A high degree of S1R occupancy (87% to 91%) was found throughout the brain at pridopidine doses ranging from 22.5 to 90 mg. S1R occupancy was 43% at 1 mg pridopidine. In contrast, at 90 mg pridopidine, the D2/D3R occupancy was only minimal (~ 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our PET findings indicate that at clinically relevant single dose of 90 mg, pridopidine acts as a selective S1R ligand showing near to complete S1R occupancy with negligible occupancy of the D2/D3R. The dose S1R occupancy relationship suggests cooperative binding of pridopidine to the S1R. Our findings provide significant clarification about pridopidine's mechanism of action and support further use of the 45-mg twice-daily dose to achieve full and selective targeting of the S1R in future clinical trials of neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to follow tonic and phasic autonomic nervous activity in Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers and patients. METHODS: Evaluation of motor functions and total functional capacity was performed in 30 HD mutation carriers or patients at the beginning and in 22 subjects after 8-10 years. Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress. There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of an outbreak of clinical disease phase.",

The aim of the present review article is to summarize the role of nanodiamonds in various neurological diseases. We have taken related literature of making this review article from ScienceDirect, springer, Research gate, PubMed, Sci-finder, etc. The current approaches for treating neurological conditions such as glioblastoma includes chemotherapy or combination anti-retro viral therapy for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or use of anti-Alzheimer drugs during cognitive impairment. These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization, multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted drug delivery with minimal side effects.",

Connecting expert multidisciplinary teams with community-based care, developing treatment guidelines, and involving the HD family community in quality improvements can achieve an integrated system of health care delivery.

OBJECTIVE: Normalization to an appropriate reference region in F-FDG PET imaging may enhance diagnostic performance in Huntington disease (HD). We aimed to identify stable brain areas that could be used to model neurometabolic degeneration in HD correlating imaging (SUVrvalues at the basal ganglia [BBGG]) and clinical parameters (disease burden score [DBS]). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed brain F-FDG PET/CT in 38 manifest HD patients (meanage +- SD, 54 +- 14.3 years; CAGrepeats +- SD, 44.2 +- 3.1), 20 premanifest HD patients (meanage +- SD, 42.7 +- 11.7 years; CAGrepeats +- SD, 40 +- 3.8), and 18 healthy controls (NC; meanage +- SD, 45 +- 13.2 years). For quantitative analysis, we selected (a) defined reference regions from the Montreal Neurological Institute space atlas (pons, whole cerebellum, cerebral white matter, thalamus, and a pons-cerebellar vermis region of interest), and (b) reference clusters obtained by voxelwise statistical comparison across groups (P < 0.05 FWE; extent voxel threshold k = 200). Each candidate reference region and reference cluster was quantitatively assessed using imaging and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Comparing HD and NC groups, we obtained a reference cluster in the cerebellum, and in temporal and frontal lobes. Comparing manifest HD and premanifest HD patients, we observed reference clusters in the cerebellum, pons, thalamus, parietal lobe, and cuneus. The set of reference regions showed a significant correlation between SUVrvalues at the BBGG and DBS in all HD patients. In premanifest HD patients, the correlation between SUVrvalues at the BBGG and DBS was significant using the pons-cerebellar vermis region of interest, the thalamus as defined reference regions, and the pons and thalamus as reference clusters. In manifest HD patients, the correlation was significant using the temporal and white matter frontal lobe clusters. Variance between SUVrvalues in the set of reference regions and reference clusters was minimal within NC. CONCLUSIONS: The pons may be a stable and reliable region to calculate SUVrvalues to model the neurometabolic degeneration in quantitative F-FDG PET imaging in HD.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the approach to chorea in clinical practice, beginning with a discussion of the phenomenologic features of chorea and how to differentiate it from other movement disorders. The diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas, and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats are included. RECENT FINDINGS: C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including NKX2-1, ADCY5, GNAO1, and PDE10A. New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing. SUMMARY: Clinical features remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.",

Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.",

Movement disorders can be hypokinetic (e.g., parkinsonism), hyperkinetic, or dystonic in nature and commonly arise from altered function in nuclei of the basal ganglia or their connections. As obvious structural changes are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism. Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli. In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions. Various approaches are reviewed here. ",

Neurological disorders are one of the major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

INTRODUCTION: Modulation of gene expression using gene therapy as well as modulation of immune activation using immunotherapy has attracted considerable attention as rapidly emerging potential therapeutic intervention for the treatment of HD. Several preclinical and clinical trials for gene-based therapy and immunotherapy/antibody-based have been conducted. AREAS COVERED: This review focused on the potential use of gene therapy and immuno-based therapies to treat HD, including the current status, the rationale for these approaches as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting it. Growing knowledge of HD pathogenesis has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets, some of which are now in clinical trials. Focus has been allocated to RNA and DNA-based gene therapies for the reduction of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), using Immuno/antibody-based therapies. EXPERT OPINION: While safety and efficacy of gene therapy and immunotherapy has been well demonstrated for HD, therefore much focus has now been shifted to disease-modifying therapies. This review defines the current status and future directions of gene therapy and immunotherapies. The review summarizes by what means HD genetic root cause modification and functional restoration of mHtt protein could be achieved by using targeted multimodality gene therapy and immunotherapy to target intracellular and extracellular mHtt.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder encoding a mutant form of the huntingtin protein (HTT). HD is pathologically characterized by loss of neurons in the striatum and cortex, which leads to progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline and behavioral symptoms. Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and may be effective in alleviating and/or halting the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HD. Several pre-clinical studies have used stem cells in animal models of HD. Here, we performed a systematic review of preclinical studies to estimate the treatment efficacy of stem cells in animal models of HD. Based on our systematic review, treatment with stem cells significantly improves neurological and behavioral outcomes in animal models of HD. Although promising results were found, the design of animal studies, the types of transplanted cells and the route of administration are poorly standardized and this greatly complicates comparative analysis.",

PURPOSE: There is little long-term, population-based data on uptake of prenatal diagnosis for Huntington disease (HD), a late-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, and the effect of the availability of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) on families' decisions about conventional prenatal diagnosis is not known. We report trends in prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation diagnosis for HD in the United Kingdom since services commenced. METHODS: Long-term UK-wide prospective case record-based service evaluation in 23 UK Regional Genetic Centres 1988-2015, and four UK PGD centers 2002-2015. RESULTS: From 1988 to 2015, 479 prenatal diagnoses were performed in the UK for HD. An exclusion approach was used in 150 (31%). The annual rate of HD prenatal diagnosis has remained around 18 (3.5/million) over 27 years, despite a steady increase in the use of PGD for HD since 2002. CONCLUSION: Although increasing number of couples are choosing either direct or exclusion PGD to prevent HD in their offspring, both direct and exclusion prenatal diagnosis remain important options in a health system where both PGD and prenatal diagnosis are state funded. At-risk couples should be informed of all options available to them, preferably prepregnancy.",

Currently there is no secured ongoing funding in Australia for next generation sequencing (NGS) such as exome sequencing (ES) for adult neurological disorders. Studies have focused on paediatric populations in research or highly specialised settings, utilised standard NGS pipelines focusing only on small insertions, deletions and single nucleotide variants, and not explored impacts on management in detail. This prospective multi-site study performed ES and an extended bioinformatics repeat expansion analysis pipeline, on patients with broad phenotypes (ataxia, dementia, dystonia, spastic paraparesis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease and complex/not-otherwise-specified), with symptom onset between 2 and 60 years. Genomic data analysis was phenotype-driven, using virtual gene panels, reported according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. One-hundred-and-sixty patients (51% female) were included, median age 52 years (range 14-79) and median 9 years of symptoms. 34/160 (21%) patients received a genetic diagnosis. Highest diagnostic rates were in spastic paraparesis (10/25, 40%), complex/not-otherwise-specified (10/38, 26%) and ataxia (7/28, 25%) groups. Findings were considered 'possible/uncertain' in 21/160 patients. Repeat expansion detection identified an unexpected diagnosis of Huntington disease in an ataxic patient with negative ES. Impacts on management, such as more precise and tailored care, were seen in most diagnosed patients (23/34, 68%). ES and a novel bioinformatics analysis pipepline had a substantial diagnostic yield (21%) and management impacts for most diagnosed patients, in heterogeneous, complex, mainly adult-onset neurological disorders in real-world settings in Australia, providing evidence for NGS and complementary multiple, new technologies as valuable diagnostic tools.",

Cognitive and behavioral (psychiatric) changes in HD are summarized and implications for ongoing advancement in our knowledge of prodromal HD are suggested. The earliest detected cognitive changes are observed in the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Interference, Stroop Color and Word Test-interference condition, and Trail Making Test. Cognitive changes in the middle and near motor diagnostic stages of prodromal HD involve nearly every cognitive test administered and the greatest changes over time (i.e., slopes) are found in those prodromal HD participants who are nearest to motor diagnosis. Psychiatric changes demonstrate significant worsening over time and remain elevated compared with healthy controls throughout the prodromal disease course.

                    "text": "Movement disorders. Movement disorders can be hypokinetic (e.g., parkinsonism), hyperkinetic, or dystonic in nature and commonly arise from altered function in nuclei of the basal ganglia or their connections. As obvious structural changes are often limited, standard imaging plays less of a role than in other neurologic disorders. However, structural imaging is indicated where clinical presentation is atypical, particularly if the disorder is abrupt in onset or remains strictly unilateral. More recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may allow for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and atypical forms of parkinsonism. Functional imaging can assess regional cerebral blood flow (functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)), cerebral glucose metabolism (PET), neurochemical and neuroreceptor status (PET and SPECT), and pathologic processes such as inflammation or abnormal protein deposition (PET) (Table 49.1). Cerebral blood flow can be assessed at rest, during the performance of motor or cognitive tasks, or in response to a variety of stimuli. In appropriate situations, the correct imaging modality and/or combination of modalities can be used to detect early disease or even preclinical disease, and to monitor disease progression and the effects of disease-modifying interventions. Various approaches are reviewed here. ",

                    "text": "Live-Cell Bioorthogonal Chemical Imaging: Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy of Vibrational Probes. Innovations in light microscopy have tremendously revolutionized the way researchers study biological systems with subcellular resolution. In particular, fluorescence microscopy with the expanding choices of fluorescent probes has provided a comprehensive toolkit to tag and visualize various molecules of interest with exquisite specificity and high sensitivity. Although fluorescence microscopy is currently the method of choice for cellular imaging, it faces fundamental limitations for studying the vast number of small biomolecules. This is because common fluorescent labels, which are relatively bulky, could introduce considerable perturbation to or even completely alter the native functions of vital small biomolecules. Hence, despite their immense functional importance, these small biomolecules remain largely undetectable by fluorescence microscopy. To address this challenge, a bioorthogonal chemical imaging platform has recently been introduced. By coupling stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, an emerging nonlinear Raman microscopy technique, with tiny and Raman-active vibrational probes (e.g., alkynes and stable isotopes), bioorthogonal chemical imaging exhibits superb sensitivity, specificity, and biocompatibility for imaging small biomolecules in live systems. In this Account, we review recent technical achievements for visualizing a broad spectrum of small biomolecules, including ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, amino acids, fatty acids, choline, glucose, cholesterol, and small-molecule drugs in live biological systems ranging from individual cells to animal tissues and model organisms. Importantly, this platform is compatible with live-cell biology, thus allowing real-time imaging of small-molecule dynamics. Moreover, we discuss further chemical and spectroscopic strategies for multicolor bioorthogonal chemical imaging, a valuable technique in the era of \"omics\". As a unique tool for biological discovery, this platform has been applied to studying various metabolic processes under both physiological and pathological states, including protein synthesis activity of neuronal systems, protein aggregations in Huntington disease models, glucose uptake in tumor xenografts, and drug penetration through skin tissues. We envision that the coupling of SRS microscopy with vibrational probes would do for small biomolecules what fluorescence microscopy of fluorophores has done for larger molecular species.",
