                    "text": "Efficacy and Safety of Fixed-Dose Deutetrabenazine in Children and Adolescents for Tics Associated With Tourette Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor and phonic tics, often accompanied by behavioral and psychiatric comorbidities. Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved in the US for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. Objective: To report results of the ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in Tourette Syndrome 2) study examining deutetrabenazine for treatment of Tourette syndrome. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted over 8 weeks with a 1-week follow-up (June 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019). Children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and active tics causing distress or impairment were enrolled in the study. Children were recruited from 52 sites in 10 countries. Data were analyzed from February 4 to April 22, 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/d), high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/d), or a matching placebo, which were titrated over 4 weeks to the target dose followed by a 4-week maintenance period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine. Key secondary end points included changes in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine, Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression score, Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact score, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and questionnaires. Results: The study included 158 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 11.7 [2.6] years). A total of 119 participants (75%) were boys; 7 (4%), Asian; 1 (1%), Black; 32 (20%), Hispanic; 4 (3%), Native American; 135 (85%), White; 2 (1%), multiracial; 9 (6%), other race; and 1 (0.6%), of unknown ethnic origin. Fifty-two participants were randomized to the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 54 to the low-dose deutetrabenazine group, and 52 to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics for participants were similar between groups. Of the total 158 participants, 64 (41%) were aged 6 to 11 years, and 94 (59%) were aged 12 to 16 years at baseline. Mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 (2.8) years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 (6.6) points. At week 8, the difference in YGTSS-TTS was not significant between the high-dose deutetrabenazine and placebo groups (least-squares mean difference, -0.8 points; 95% CI, -3.9 to 2.3 points; P = .60; Cohen d, -0.11). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 34 participants (65%) treated with high-dose deutetrabenazine, 24 (44%) treated with low-dose deutetrabenazine, and 25 (49%) treated with placebo and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this fixed-dose randomized clinical trial of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03571256.",

Deutetrabenazine is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia in adults. Objective: To examine whether deutetrabenazine is effective and safe for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in children and adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2/3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-titration study included children and adolescents (aged 6-16 years) with Tourette syndrome with active tics causing distress or impairment (ie, Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score [YGTSS-TTS] >=20). The trial was conducted over 12 weeks, with 1 week of follow-up from February 2018 to November 2019 at 36 centers in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Russia, Serbia, and Spain. Data analysis was conducted from January 31 to April 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive deutetrabenazine or placebo, titrated during 7 weeks to an optimal level, followed by a 5-week maintenance period. The maximum total daily deutetrabenazine dose was 48 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 12 in YGTSS-TTS. Key secondary end points included changes in Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression, Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, questionnaires, and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 119 participants were randomized to deutetrabenazine (59 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.5] years; 53 [90%] boys; 49 [83%] White; 3 [5%] Black) and placebo (60 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.6] years; 51 [85%] boys; 53 [88%] White; 3 [5%] Black). At week 12, the difference in YGTSS-TTS score was not significant between deutetrabenazine and placebo (least squares mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -4.1 to 2.8; P = .69; Cohen d, -0.07). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 38 patients (66%) and 33 patients (56%) receiving deutetrabenazine and placebo, respectively, and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. These results may be informative for future studies of treatments for tics in Tourette syndrome. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03452943.",

Objective estimates of prevalence using instrumental diagnostics and data on neural correlates of dysphagia in HD are scarce or lacking entirely. Similarly, its correlation with other clinical markers is still not fully known. We aimed at defining clinical risk factors and neural correlates for compromised swallowing safety in HD more precisely. METHODS: Thirty-four HD subjects (16 female, Shoulson & Fahn Stage I-IV, two premanifest) underwent a full clinical-neurological examination including the cranial nerves, the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was performed by a trained speech and language therapist. Twenty-six subjects additionally underwent a high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (T1, 3-T Siemens Prisma). Moreover, we correlated clinical and atrophy (MRI) measures with swallowing safety levels as judged by the validated Penetration-Aspiration Scale. RESULTS: FEES showed penetration or aspiration in 70.6%. Using partial correlation, no significant correlations were found between swallowing safety and any of the clinical markers after correcting for disease duration and CAG repeat length. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated atrophy associated with compromised swallowing safety in a network of parietothalamocerebellar areas related to sensorimotor communication, notably excluding striatum. CONCLUSIONS: Our results characterise dysphagia in HD as a disorder of communication between sensory and motor networks involved in swallowing.

This study investigated changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density by means of 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging in the central nervous system of mice with HD. Methods: Dynamic 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging was performed at clinically relevant disease stages (at 3, 7, 10, and 16 mo) in the heterozygous knock-in Q175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates (16-18 mice per genotype and time point). Cerebral 11C-UCB-J analyses were performed to assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16 mo) disease stages. 11C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo. 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in mouse and human brain tissues. Results:11C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11C-UCB-J binding was detectable in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant reduction (P < 0.0001). 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice (P < 0.05). Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion:11C-UCB-J PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical application, 11C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.",

Cerebral 11C-UCB-J analyses were performed to assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16 mo) disease stages. 11C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo. 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in mouse and human brain tissues. Results:11C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11C-UCB-J binding was detectable in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant reduction (P < 0.0001). 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice (P < 0.05). Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion:11C-UCB-J PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical application, 11C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.",

                    "text": "Disparities in Palliative Care Utilization Among Hospitalized People With Huntington Disease: A National Cross-Sectional Study.BACKGROUND: People with Huntington's disease (HD) often become institutionalized and more frequently die away from the home setting. The reasons behind differences in end-of-life care are poorly understood. Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for this neurodegenerative disease. It is unknown what factors are associated with in-patient specialty PC consultation in this population and how PC might be related to discharge disposition. OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge disposition. DESIGN: We analyzed factors associated with PC consultation for people with HD using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. An anonymized, cross-sectional, and stratified sample of 20% of United States hospitalizations from 2007 through 2014 were included using ICD-9 codes. RESULTS: 8521 patients with HD were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 321 (3.8%) received specialty PC. Payer type, (specifically private insurer or other insurer as compared to Medicare), income, (specifically the top quartile as compared to the bottom quartile), mortality risk, D.N.R., aspiration pneumonia, and depression were significantly associated with PC in a multivariate model. Among those who received PC, the odds ratio (OR) of discharge to a facility was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.32-0.58), whereas the OR of discharge to home with services was 2.25 (95% CI 1.57-3.23), even after adjusting for possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HD, economic factors, depression, and serious illness-specific factors were associated with PC, and PC was associated with discharge disposition.

The reasons behind differences in end-of-life care are poorly understood. Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for this neurodegenerative disease. It is unknown what factors are associated with in-patient specialty PC consultation in this population and how PC might be related to discharge disposition. OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge disposition. DESIGN: We analyzed factors associated with PC consultation for people with HD using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. An anonymized, cross-sectional, and stratified sample of 20% of United States hospitalizations from 2007 through 2014 were included using ICD-9 codes. RESULTS: 8521 patients with HD were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 321 (3.8%) received specialty PC. Payer type, (specifically private insurer or other insurer as compared to Medicare), income, (specifically the top quartile as compared to the bottom quartile), mortality risk, D.N.R., aspiration pneumonia, and depression were significantly associated with PC in a multivariate model. Among those who received PC, the odds ratio (OR) of discharge to a facility was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.32-0.58), whereas the OR of discharge to home with services was 2.25 (95% CI 1.57-3.23), even after adjusting for possible confounders.

However, few studies have clearly discussed the neuromodulatory effects of naringenin against different neurodegenerative disorders. AIM: We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of naringenin against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in rats. METHODS: Albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered group, received saline. Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received naringenin (50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP administration. On the 5th day, neurobehavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes and the striatum tissue was used for analysis of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and serotonin (5-HT) levels. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. RESULTS: Our results showed that naringenin co-treatment provides neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced neurological disorders. Naringenin also increased the MAO activity and 5-HT levels in the striatum. Moreover, co-treatment with naringenin reduced the expression of GFAP protein in the striatal part and significantly attenuated the neuronal cell death. The findings of the present study suggest that naringenin provides neuroprotection and mitigates neurobehavioral alterations in experimental rats.

However, the effects from the brain regions to motor impairment may vary for different groups of patients. Hence, our interest is not only to identify the brain regions but also to understand how their effects on motor impairment differ by patient groups. This can be cast as a model selection problem for a varying-coefficient regression. However, this is challenging when there is a pre-specified group structure among variables. We propose a novel variable selection method for a varying-coefficient regression with such structured variables and provide a publicly available R package svreg for implementation of our method. Our method is empirically shown to select relevant variables consistently. Also, our method screens irrelevant variables better than existing methods. Hence, our method leads to a model with higher sensitivity, lower false discovery rate and higher prediction accuracy than the existing methods. Finally, we found that the effects from the brain regions to motor impairment differ by disease severity of the patients. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to identify such interaction effects between the disease severity and brain regions, which indicates the need for customized intervention by disease severity.",

The accurate determination of the expanded allele size is crucial to confirm the genetic status in symptomatic and presymptomatic at-risk subjects and avoid genetic polymorphism-related false-negative diagnoses. Precise CAG repeat number determination is critical to discriminate the cutoff between unexpanded and intermediate mutable alleles (IAs, 27-35 CAG) as well as between IAs and pathological, low-penetrance alleles (i.e., 36-39 CAG repeats), and it is also critical to detect large repeat expansions causing pediatric HD variants. We analyzed the HTT-CAG repeat number of 14 DNA reference materials and of a DNA collection of 43 additional samples carrying unexpanded, IAs, low and complete penetrance alleles, including large (>60 repeats) and very large (>100 repeats) expansions using a novel triplet-primed PCR-based assay, the AmplideX PCR/CE HTT Kit. The results demonstrate that the method accurately genotypes both normal and expanded HTT-CAG repeat numbers and reveals previously undisclosed and very large CAG expansions >200 repeats. We also show that this technique can improve genetic test reliability and accuracy by detecting CAG expansions in samples with sequence variations within or adjacent to the repeat tract that cause allele drop-outs or inaccuracies using other PCR methods.",

METHODS: We processed T1-weighted MRI from IMAGE-HD study using FreeSurfer 7.0 and compared the volumes of the hippocampal subfields among 36 early motor symptomatic (symp-HD), 40 pre-symptomatic (pre-HD), and 36 healthy control individuals across three timepoints over 36 months. RESULTS: Mixed-model analyses revealed significantly lower subfield volumes in symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and control groups, in the subicular regions of the perforant-pathway: presubiculum, subiculum, dentate gyrus, tail, and right molecular layer. These adjoining subfields aggregated into a single principal component, which demonstrated an accelerated rate of atrophy in the symp-HD. Volumes between pre-HD and controls did not show any significant difference. In the combined HD groups, CAG repeat length and disease burden score were associated with presubiculum, molecular layer, tail, and perforant-pathway subfield volumes. Hippocampal left tail and perforant-pathway subfields were associated with motor onset in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal subfields atrophy in early symptomatic HD affects key regions of the perforant-pathway, which may implicate the distinctive memory impairment at this stage of illness.

Several preclinical and clinical trials for gene-based therapy and immunotherapy/antibody-based have been conducted. AREAS COVERED: This review focused on the potential use of gene therapy and immuno-based therapies to treat HD, including the current status, the rationale for these approaches as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting it. Growing knowledge of HD pathogenesis has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets, some of which are now in clinical trials. Focus has been allocated to RNA and DNA-based gene therapies for the reduction of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), using Immuno/antibody-based therapies. EXPERT OPINION: While safety and efficacy of gene therapy and immunotherapy has been well demonstrated for HD, therefore much focus has now been shifted to disease-modifying therapies. This review defines the current status and future directions of gene therapy and immunotherapies. The review summarizes by what means HD genetic root cause modification and functional restoration of mHtt protein could be achieved by using targeted multimodality gene therapy and immunotherapy to target intracellular and extracellular mHtt.",

A glutamine stretch (PolyQ) at the N-terminal of the Huntingtin protein is generated by the abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in exon 1 of the HTT gene. While the resulting polyQ aggregates are the predominate feature of HD, the intercellular spread of the expanded protein and the effect upon this transfer inside healthy cells have not yet fully understood. Here, we have employed the phasor Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) method to measure NADH fluorescence lifetime change after the internalization of the PolyQ protein. Based on our analysis, we have found a significant decrease in the fraction of bound NADH in both cytoplasmic and nucleus regions when cells are co-cultured or when healthy cells uptake the supernatant containing polyQ proteins and aggregates. Overall, our FLIM study combined with confocal fluorescence imaging visualizes the absorption of the mutant Htt protein aggregates which results in a distinct NADH fluorescence lifetime between control cells and acceptor cells. These studies show, for the first time, the influence of how neighboring cells expressing the expanded Htt protein can regulate energy metabolism in healthy cells.",

Recent studies have reported visual dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD). However, little is known about retinal structural changes in HD. METHODS: A total of 50 subjects, including 25 motor-manifest HD patients and 25 gender- and age-matched controls, were enrolled. Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Score-Motor part was assessed in HD patients. Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was used to evaluate the macular thickness and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). Superficial and deep capillary plexus densities were measured using OCT angiography (OCTA). To account for inter-eye correlation, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used. RESULTS: HD patients had a significant reduction in macular thickness in both inner and outer superior sectors and the inferior outer sector. Inferior pRNFLs were significantly decreased in thickness. There was no significant difference in retinal capillary plexus density between the two groups. Age and disease duration were negatively correlated with macular thickness in HD patients. However, the severity of motor involvement was not correlated with SD-OCT or OCTA parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We observed attenuated pRNFL and macular retinal thickness in patients with HD, independent of macular capillary plexus parameters. It can support the hypothesis that the retina may be a potential biomarker for monitoring the neurodegenerative process in HD.",

Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved in the US for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. Objective: To report results of the ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in Tourette Syndrome 2) study examining deutetrabenazine for treatment of Tourette syndrome. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted over 8 weeks with a 1-week follow-up (June 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019). Children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and active tics causing distress or impairment were enrolled in the study. Children were recruited from 52 sites in 10 countries. Data were analyzed from February 4 to April 22, 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/d), high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/d), or a matching placebo, which were titrated over 4 weeks to the target dose followed by a 4-week maintenance period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine. Key secondary end points included changes in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine, Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression score, Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact score, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and questionnaires. Results: The study included 158 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 11.7 [2.6] years). A total of 119 participants (75%) were boys; 7 (4%), Asian; 1 (1%), Black; 32 (20%), Hispanic; 4 (3%), Native American; 135 (85%), White; 2 (1%), multiracial; 9 (6%), other race; and 1 (0.6%), of unknown ethnic origin. Fifty-two participants were randomized to the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 54 to the low-dose deutetrabenazine group, and 52 to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics for participants were similar between groups. Of the total 158 participants, 64 (41%) were aged 6 to 11 years, and 94 (59%) were aged 12 to 16 years at baseline. Mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 (2.8) years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 (6.6) points. At week 8, the difference in YGTSS-TTS was not significant between the high-dose deutetrabenazine and placebo groups (least-squares mean difference, -0.8 points; 95% CI, -3.9 to 2.3 points; P = .60; Cohen d, -0.11). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 34 participants (65%) treated with high-dose deutetrabenazine, 24 (44%) treated with low-dose deutetrabenazine, and 25 (49%) treated with placebo and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this fixed-dose randomized clinical trial of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03571256.",

A total of 119 participants (75%) were boys; 7 (4%), Asian; 1 (1%), Black; 32 (20%), Hispanic; 4 (3%), Native American; 135 (85%), White; 2 (1%), multiracial; 9 (6%), other race; and 1 (0.6%), of unknown ethnic origin. Fifty-two participants were randomized to the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 54 to the low-dose deutetrabenazine group, and 52 to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics for participants were similar between groups. Of the total 158 participants, 64 (41%) were aged 6 to 11 years, and 94 (59%) were aged 12 to 16 years at baseline. Mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 (2.8) years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 (6.6) points. At week 8, the difference in YGTSS-TTS was not significant between the high-dose deutetrabenazine and placebo groups (least-squares mean difference, -0.8 points; 95% CI, -3.9 to 2.3 points; P = .60; Cohen d, -0.11). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 34 participants (65%) treated with high-dose deutetrabenazine, 24 (44%) treated with low-dose deutetrabenazine, and 25 (49%) treated with placebo and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this fixed-dose randomized clinical trial of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03571256.",

                    "text": "AggreCount: an unbiased image analysis tool for identifying and quantifying cellular aggregates in a spatially defined manner.Protein quality control is maintained by a number of integrated cellular pathways that monitor the folding and functionality of the cellular proteome. Defects in these pathways lead to the accumulation of misfolded or faulty proteins that may become insoluble and aggregate over time. Protein aggregates significantly contribute to the development of a number of human diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, imaging-based, cellular studies have defined key biomolecular components that recognize and clear aggregates; however, no unifying method is available to quantify cellular aggregates, limiting our ability to reproducibly and accurately quantify these structures. Here we describe an ImageJ macro called AggreCount to identify and measure protein aggregates in cells. AggreCount is designed to be intuitive, easy to use, and customizable for different types of aggregates observed in cells. Minimal experience in coding is required to utilize the script. Based on a user-defined image, AggreCount will report a number of metrics: (i) total number of cellular aggregates, (ii) percentage of cells with aggregates, (iii) aggregates per cell, (iv) area of aggregates, and (v) localization of aggregates (cytosol, perinuclear, or nuclear). A data table of aggregate information on a per cell basis, as well as a summary table, is provided for further data analysis. We demonstrate the versatility of AggreCount by analyzing a number of different cellular aggregates including aggresomes, stress granules, and inclusion bodies caused by huntingtin polyglutamine expansion.",

The aim of this study was to measure NfL longitudinally in autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and establish correlation with clinical and imaging parameters. We enrolled 62 pathological expansions carriers (17 SCA1, 13 SCA2, 19 SCA3, and 13 SCA7) and 19 age-matched controls in a prospective biomarker study between 2011 and 2015 and followed for 24 months at the Paris Brain Institute. We performed neurological examination, brain 3 T MRI and plasma NfL measurements using an ultrasensitive single-molecule array at baseline and at the two-year follow-up visit. We evaluated NfL correlations with ages, CAG repeat sizes, clinical scores and volumetric brain MRIs. NfL levels were significantly higher in SCAs than controls at both time points (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted NfL levels were significantly correlated at baseline with clinical scores (p < 0.01). We identified optimal NfL cut-off concentrations to differentiate controls from carriers for each genotype (SCA1 16.87 pg/mL, SCA2, 19.1 pg/mL, SCA3 16.04 pg/mL, SCA7 16.67 pg/mL). For all SCAs, NfL concentration was stable over two years (p = 0.95) despite a clinical progression (p < 0.0001). Clinical progression between baseline and follow-up was associated with higher NfL concentrations at baseline (p = 0.04). Of note, all premanifest carriers with NfL levels close to cut off concentrations had signs of the disease at follow-up. For all SCAs, the higher the observed NfL, the lower the pons volume at baseline (p < 0.01) and follow-up (p = 0.02). Higher NfL levels at baseline in all SCAs predicted a decrease in cerebellar volume (p = 0.03). This result remained significant for SCA2 only among all genotypes (p = 0.02). Overall, plasma NfL levels at baseline in SCA expansion carriers predict cerebellar volume change and clinical score progression.

                    "text": "Reducing huntingtin by immunotherapy delays disease progression in a mouse model of Huntington disease.In Huntington disease (HD), the mutant huntingtin (mtHTT) protein is the principal cause of pathological changes that initiate primarily along the cortico-striatal axis. mtHTT is ubiquitously expressed and there is, accordingly, growing recognition that HD is a systemic disorder with functional interplay between the brain and the periphery. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, C6-17, targeting an exposed region of HTT near the aa586 Caspase 6 cleavage site. As recently published, mAB C6-17 can block cell-to-cell propagation of mtHTT in vitro. In order to reduce the burden of the mutant protein in vivo, we queried whether extracellular mtHTT could be therapeutically targeted in YAC128 HD mice. In a series of proof of concept experiments, we found that systemic mAB C6-17 treatment resulted in the distribution of the mAB C6-17 to peripheral and CNS tissues and led to the reduction of HTT protein levels.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a theoretical cohort of 3,851 couples, where one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. SETTING: N/A. PATIENTS/ANIMALS: None. INTERVENTION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing for couples attempting conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both parents in addition to secondary outcomes of procedure-related loss, spontaneous abortion, termination of pregnancy, and early/normal/late-onset Huntington disease. A willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is lower in cost and higher in effectiveness compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis among couples with one heterozygous Huntington disease individual, making it the dominant strategy. In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing was associated with 77 more QALYs and a cost savings of $46,394,268. All measured outcomes were lower in the IVF preimplantation genetic testing strategy, including 39 fewer procedure-related losses, 39 fewer spontaneous abortions, and 462 fewer terminations of pregnancy. Most notably, in our theoretical cohort of couples, IVF preimplantation genetic testing resulted in 1,079 fewer Huntington disease-affected offspring. Our results were robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is a cost-effective conception strategy compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis when one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. Not only can morbidity and mortality incurred by Huntington disease be mitigated for the offspring with the use of IVF preimplantation genetic testing, but this study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of using IVF preimplantation genetic testing for those with Huntington disease.",

                    "text": "In vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenetic diseases versus unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis for Huntington disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis.OBJECTIVE: To investigate if in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease is cost effective for heterozygous individuals with Huntington disease vs. unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a theoretical cohort of 3,851 couples, where one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. SETTING: N/A. PATIENTS/ANIMALS: None. INTERVENTION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing for couples attempting conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both parents in addition to secondary outcomes of procedure-related loss, spontaneous abortion, termination of pregnancy, and early/normal/late-onset Huntington disease. A willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is lower in cost and higher in effectiveness compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis among couples with one heterozygous Huntington disease individual, making it the dominant strategy. In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing was associated with 77 more QALYs and a cost savings of $46,394,268. All measured outcomes were lower in the IVF preimplantation genetic testing strategy, including 39 fewer procedure-related losses, 39 fewer spontaneous abortions, and 462 fewer terminations of pregnancy. Most notably, in our theoretical cohort of couples, IVF preimplantation genetic testing resulted in 1,079 fewer Huntington disease-affected offspring. Our results were robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is a cost-effective conception strategy compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis when one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. Not only can morbidity and mortality incurred by Huntington disease be mitigated for the offspring with the use of IVF preimplantation genetic testing, but this study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of using IVF preimplantation genetic testing for those with Huntington disease.",

Children typically exhibit regression in school performance, psychiatric features such as inattention, and oral motor dysfunction. Unlike adult-onset HD, in which seizures occur at approximately the rate of the general public, at least half of children with HD develop epilepsy and seizures can be a presenting feature of PoHD. Here we present the case of a 10-year-old boy with a history of language delay, motor regression, oral motor dysfunction, and tremor who presented with a first lifetime seizure. Given a family history of Huntingtons disease in his father, PoHD was considered, and a pathogenic allele with 88 repeats was confirmed in the child. As symptoms progressed, history alone could not differentiate abnormal movements from seizures. Continuous video electroencephalography helped to demonstrate epileptic myoclonic jerks and guide treatment.",

We performed a PET imaging study to assess synaptic damage and its clinical correlates in early HD in vivo. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, premanifest and early manifest (Shoulson-Fahn stage 1 and 2) HD mutation carriers and age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent clinical assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations and time-of-flight PET with 11C-UCB-J, a radioligand targeting the ubiquitous presynaptic terminal marker synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). We also performed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET in all participants because regional cerebral glucose consumption is thought to largely reflect synaptic activity. Volumes of interest were delineated on the basis of individual 3-dimensional T1 MRI. Standardized uptake value ratio-1 images were calculated for 11C-UCB-J with the centrum semiovale as reference region. 18F-FDG-PET activity was normalized to the pons. All PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. Volume of interest- and voxel-based analyses were performed. Correlations between clinical scores and 11C-UCB-J PET data were calculated. RESULTS: Eighteen HD mutation carriers (age 51.4 +- 11.6 years; 6 female; 7 premanifest, 11 early manifest) and 15 healthy controls (age 52.3 +- 3.5 years; 4 female) were included. In the HD group, significant loss of SV2A binding was found in putamen, caudate, pallidum, cerebellum, parietal, and temporal and frontal cortex, whereas reduced 18F-FDG uptake was restricted to caudate and putamen. In the premanifest subgroup, 11C-UCB-J and 18F-FDG-PET showed significant reductions in putamen and caudate only. In the total HD group, SV2A loss in the putamen correlated with motor impairment. DISCUSSION: Our data reveal loss of presynaptic terminal integrity in early HD, which begins in the striatum in the premanifest phase, spreads extensively to extrastriatal regions in the early manifest phase, and correlates with motor impairment. 11C-UCB-J PET is more sensitive than 18F-FDG-PET for detection of extrastriatal changes in early HD.

Hospice is the standard in end-of-life care for people with Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects people in middle adulthood. Yet, we have little knowledge regarding the place of death for people with HD. Therefore, the current state of knowledge limits HD clinicians' ability to conduct high-quality goals of care conversations. Objectives: We sought to determine the factors associated with the place of death in people with HD. Design: We obtained cross-sectional data from Enroll-HD and included participants with a positive HD mutation of 36 or more CAG repeats. Results: Out of 16,120 participants in the Enroll-HD study, 536 were reported as deceased. The mean age at death was 60. The leading place of death was home (29%), followed by the hospital (23%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of dying at a skilled nursing facility was significantly lower for those partnered (aOR: 0.48, confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.26-0.86). The aOR for dying on hospice compared to home was increased in a person with some college and above (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.21-4.75). Conclusions: Our data further suggest that models that predict the place of death for serious illnesses do not appear to generalize to HD. The distribution in the places of death within HD was not uniform. Our findings may assist HD clinicians in communication during goals of care conversations.",

Statistical shape analysis to measure the striatum has been performed in HD, however there have been a limited number of longitudinal studies. To address these limitations, we utilised the Spherical Harmonic Point Distribution Method (SPHARM-PDM) to generate point distribution models of the striatum in individuals, and used linear mixed models to test for localised shape change over time in pre-manifest HD (pre-HD), symp-HD (symp-HD) and control individuals. Longitudinal MRI scans from the IMAGE-HD study were used (baseline, 18 and 30 months). We found significant differences in the shape of the striatum between groups. Significant group-by-time interaction was observed for the putamen bilaterally, but not for caudate. A differential rate of shape change between groups over time was observed, with more significant deflation in the symp-HD group in comparison with the pre-HD and control groups. CAG repeats were correlated with bilateral striatal shape in pre-HD and symp-HD. Robust statistical analysis of the correlates of striatal shape change in HD has confirmed the suitability of striatal morphology as a potential biomarker correlated with CAG-repeat length, and potentially, an endophenotype.",

To address these limitations, we utilised the Spherical Harmonic Point Distribution Method (SPHARM-PDM) to generate point distribution models of the striatum in individuals, and used linear mixed models to test for localised shape change over time in pre-manifest HD (pre-HD), symp-HD (symp-HD) and control individuals. Longitudinal MRI scans from the IMAGE-HD study were used (baseline, 18 and 30 months). We found significant differences in the shape of the striatum between groups. Significant group-by-time interaction was observed for the putamen bilaterally, but not for caudate. A differential rate of shape change between groups over time was observed, with more significant deflation in the symp-HD group in comparison with the pre-HD and control groups. CAG repeats were correlated with bilateral striatal shape in pre-HD and symp-HD. Robust statistical analysis of the correlates of striatal shape change in HD has confirmed the suitability of striatal morphology as a potential biomarker correlated with CAG-repeat length, and potentially, an endophenotype.",

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the study is to characterize research development on emotion recognition, identifying the intellectual structure that supports this area of knowledge, and the main lines of research attracting investigators' interest. METHODS: We identified publications on emotion recognition and dementia included in the Web of Science Core Collection, analyzing the scientific output and main disciplines involved in generating knowledge in the area. A co-citation analysis and an analysis of the bibliographic coupling between the retrieved documents elucidated the thematic orientations of the research and the reference works that constitute the foundation for development in the field. RESULTS: A total of 345 documents, with 24,282 bibliographic references between them, were included. This is an emerging research area, attracting the interest of investigators in Neurosciences, Psychology, Clinical Neurology, and Psychiatry, among other disciplines. Four prominent topic areas were identified, linked to frontotemporal dementia, autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's and Huntington disease. Many recent papers focus on the detection of mild cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Impaired emotion recognition may be a key sign facilitating the diagnosis and early treatment of different neurodegenerative diseases as well as for triggering the necessary provision of social and family support, explaining the growing research interest in this area.",

Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q, n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001). No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically. Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model.

The underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not known. Neuropathological analyses of postmortem human HD hypothalamic tissue have demonstrated loss of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin. The dynamic interplay between these neuropeptides is crucial for modulating emotional and social behavior but its role in HD is unclear. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of expressing the mutant huntingtin gene on the development of behavioral changes using the transgenic BACHD mouse model at different ages. We show for the first time that BACHD mice exhibit deficits in social behavior with parallel aberrations in the balance of the oxytocin-vasopressin system. Importantly, our data also show that restoration of the interplay within the system with an acute dose of intranasal oxytocin immediately prior to behavioral testing can rescue the depressive-like phenotype but not anxiety-like behavior in this transgenic model. These findings demonstrate that imbalances in the oxytocin-vasopressin interplay contribute to the neuropsychiatric component of HD and suggest that interventions aimed at restoring the blunted levels of oxytocin may confer therapeutic benefits for this disease.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the existing scientific literature on wearable and mobile technologies that are being used or tested for assessing motor functions in mobility-impaired and healthy adults and to evaluate the degree to which these devices provide clinically valid measures of motor function in these populations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL (January 1, 2015, to June 24, 2020), the United States and European Union clinical trial registries, and the United States Food and Drug Administration website using predefined study selection criteria. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 91 publications representing 87 unique studies were included. The most represented clinical conditions were Parkinson disease (n=51 studies), followed by stroke (n=5), Huntington disease (n=5), and multiple sclerosis (n=2). A total of 42 motion-detecting devices were identified, and the majority (n=27, 64%) were created for the purpose of health care-related data collection, although approximately 25% were personal electronic devices (eg, smartphones and watches) and 11% were entertainment consoles (eg, Microsoft Kinect or Xbox and Nintendo Wii). The primary motion outcomes were related to gait (n=30), gross motor movements (n=25), and fine motor movements (n=23). As a group, sensor-derived motion data showed a mean sensitivity of 0.83 (SD 7.27), a mean specificity of 0.84 (SD 15.40), a mean accuracy of 0.90 (SD 5.87) in discriminating between diseased individuals and healthy controls, and a mean Pearson r validity coefficient of 0.52 (SD 0.22) relative to clinical measures. We did not find significant differences in the degree of validity between in-laboratory and at-home sensor-based assessments nor between device class (ie, health care-related device, personal electronic devices, and entertainment consoles). CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-derived motion data can be leveraged to classify and quantify disease status for a variety of neurological conditions. However, most of the recent research on digital clinical measures is derived from proof-of-concept studies with considerable variation in methodological approaches, and much of the reviewed literature has focused on clinical validation, with less than one-quarter of the studies performing analytical validation.

It is unclear if ANS dysfunction is present years prior to the onset of motor symptoms of HD. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we compared crude markers of ANS function between children with the gene-expansion that causes HD (GE group) who were decades from their predicted motor onset and gene-non-expanded children (GNE group). METHODS: We included participants from the Kids-HD study who were <18 years old. Linear mixed effects regression models were constructed that controlled for sex, age, and BMI, and included a random effect per participant and per family. We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84) and GNE (n = 238) groups. We then grouped participants from the GE group based on their predicted years to onset (YTO) and compared their vital signs to the GNE group. RESULTS: The GE group had higher rHR (  = 3.83, p = 0.0064), SBP (  = 2.38, p = 0.032), and CBT (  = 0.16, t = 2.92, p = 0.007).

                    "text": "Autonomic dysregulation as an early pathologic feature of Huntington Disease.OBJECTIVE: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction has been described in adults with motor-manifest Huntington's Disease (HD) or those who are near their predicted motor onset. It is unclear if ANS dysfunction is present years prior to the onset of motor symptoms of HD. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we compared crude markers of ANS function between children with the gene-expansion that causes HD (GE group) who were decades from their predicted motor onset and gene-non-expanded children (GNE group). METHODS: We included participants from the Kids-HD study who were <18 years old. Linear mixed effects regression models were constructed that controlled for sex, age, and BMI, and included a random effect per participant and per family. We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84) and GNE (n = 238) groups. We then grouped participants from the GE group based on their predicted years to onset (YTO) and compared their vital signs to the GNE group. RESULTS: The GE group had higher rHR (  = 3.83, p = 0.0064), SBP (  = 2.38, p = 0.032), and CBT (  = 0.16, t = 2.92, p = 0.007). The mean rHR and CBT became significantly elevated compared to the GNE group in participants who had 15-25 YTO and those who had <15 YTO. The mean SBP of participants who had 25-35 YTO was significantly elevated compared to the GNE group. CONCLUSION: ANS dysfunction in HD seems to occur approximately 20 years prior to the predicted onset of motor symptoms of HD.",

Increasing evidence suggests a deficit of bioavailable Mn in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and cognitive disturbances. Previous studies have shown rescue of some molecular HD phenotypes by acute Mn exposure. This study simultaneously examined the potential for chronic Mn exposure to attenuate HD behavioral phenotypes, and for the HD genotype to offer protection against detrimental effects of chronic Mn exposure. In two independent studies a chronic Mn exposure paradigm was implemented in the YAC128 mouse model of HD and behavior was assessed at several timepoints. Study 1 exposed WT and YAC128 mice to twice weekly subcutaneous injections of 0, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 32 weeks of age. A promising protective effect against motor coordination decline in 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate-treated YAC128 mice was detected. Study 2 thus exposed WT and YAC128 mice to either 0 or 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 52 weeks of age (with a partial randomized treatment crossover at 31 weeks). The same protective effect was not observed under these conditions at higher statistical power. We report subtle toxicological changes in exploratory behavior and total activity induced by chronic Mn exposure in WT mice only, despite similar total increases in brain Mn in WT and YAC128 mice. Further, chronic Mn treatment resulted in a 10-12 % decrease in striatal NeuN positive cell density in WT mice but not YAC128 mice, despite vehicle cell counts already being reduced compared to WT mice as expected for the HD genotype. The subtle changes observed in specific outcome measures, but not others, following long-term low-level Mn exposure in WT mice delineate the neurobehavioral and neuropathological effects at the threshold of chronic Mn toxicity. We conclude that these chronic low-dose Mn exposures do not significantly rescue behavioral HD phenotypes, but YAC2128 mice are protected against the subtle Mn-induced behavioral changes and decreased striatal neuron density observed in Mn-exposed WT mice.",

The pooled analysis did not detect significant changes in cognition, gait characteristics, or functional balance scales. The current study shows the positive effect of HBE in HD, especially on motor function and QoL. No significant adverse events were reported. The current results support the clinical effect of HBE intervention on motor function and QoL in HD patients.

The current study shows the positive effect of HBE in HD, especially on motor function and QoL. No significant adverse events were reported. The current results support the clinical effect of HBE intervention on motor function and QoL in HD patients. However, these results should be taken with caution due to the limited available evidence. Well-designed clinical studies that consider the disease severity and stages are required in the future.",

                    "text": "Super-resolution imaging reveals extrastriatal synaptic dysfunction in presymptomatic Huntington disease mice.Synaptic structure and function are compromised prior to cell death and symptom onset in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In Huntington disease (HD), a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein results in a presymptomatic stage that typically spans multiple decades and is followed by striking degeneration of striatal tissue and the progression of debilitating motor symptoms. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that the HD presymptomatic window is associated with injurious effects to striatal synapses, many of which appear to be prerequisites to subsequent cell death. While the striatum is the most vulnerable region in the HD brain, it is widely recognized that HD is a brain-wide disease, affecting numerous extrastriatal regions that contribute to debilitating non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction. Currently, we have a poor understanding of the synaptic integrity, or lack thereof, in extrastriatal regions in the presymptomatic HD brain. If early therapeutic intervention seeks to maintain healthy synaptic function, it is important to understand early HD-associated synaptopathy at a brain-wide, rather than striatal-exclusive, level. Here, we focused on the hippocampus as this structure is generally thought to be affected only in manifest HD despite the subtle cognitive deficits known to emerge in prodromal HD. We used super-resolution microscopy and multi-electrode array electrophysiology as sensitive measures of excitatory synapse structure and function, respectively, in the hippocampus of presymptomatic heterozygous HD mice (Q175FDN model). We found clear evidence for enhanced AMPA receptor subunit clustering and hyperexcitability well before the onset of a detectable HD-like behavioral phenotype. In addition, activity-dependent re-organization of synaptic protein nanostructure, and functional measures of synaptic plasticity were impaired in presymptomatic HD mice. These data demonstrate that synaptic abnormalities in the presymptomatic HD brain are not exclusive to the striatum, and highlight the need to better understand the region-dependent complexities of early synaptopathy in the HD brain.",

                    "text": "Gene Therapy, A Novel Therapeutic Tool for Neurological Disorders: Current Progress, Challenges and Future Prospective.Neurological disorders are one of the major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

We assessed WM changes in premanifest HD by exploiting ultra-strong-gradient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This allowed to separately quantify magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and hindered and restricted diffusion-weighted signal fractions, and assess how they drove WM microstructure differences between patients and controls. We used tractometry to investigate region-specific alterations across callosal segments with well-characterized early- and late-myelinating axon populations, while brain-wise differences were explored with tract-based cluster analysis (TBCA). Behavioral measures were included to explore disease-associated brain-function relationships. We detected lower MTR in patients' callosal rostrum (tractometry: p = .03; TBCA: p = .03), but higher MTR in their splenium (tractometry: p = .02). Importantly, patients' mutation-size and MTR were positively correlated (all p-values < .01), indicating that MTR alterations may directly result from the mutation. Further, MTR was higher in younger, but lower in older patients relative to controls (p = .003), suggesting that MTR increases are detrimental later in the disease. Finally, patients showed higher restricted diffusion signal fraction (FR) from the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED) in the cortico-spinal tract (p = .03), which correlated positively with MTR in the posterior callosum (p = .033), potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms. In summary, this first comprehensive, ultra-strong gradient MRI study in HD provides novel evidence of mutation-driven MTR alterations at the premanifest disease stage which may reflect neurodevelopmental changes in iron, myelin, or a combination of these.",

                    "text": "Comparative transcriptome analysis identified crucial genes and pathways affecting sperm motility in the reproductive tract of drakes with different libido.Libido can affect the semen quality of male, and the sperm motility in semen quality parameters is a reliable index to evaluate the fertility of male. In drakes, the sperm motility is gradually acquired in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. However, the relationship between libido and sperm motility in drakes has not been reported and the mechanisms of testis, epididymis, and spermaduct regulating the sperm motility of drakes are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the semen quality of drakes with libido level 4 (LL4) and libido level 5 (LL5), and tried to identify the mechanisms regulating the sperm motility in drakes by performing RNA-seq in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. Phenotypically, the sperm motility of drakes (P < 0.01), weight of testis (P < 0.05), and organ index of epididymis (P < 0.05) in the LL5 group were significantly better than those in LL4 group. Moreover, compared with the LL4 group, the ductal square of seminiferous tubule (ST) in testis was significantly bigger in the LL5 group (P < 0.05), and the seminiferous epithelial thickness (P < 0.01) of ST in testis and lumenal diameter (P < 0.05) of ductuli conjugentes/dutus epididymidis in epididymis were significantly longer in the LL5 group. In transcriptional regulation, in addition to KEGG pathways related to metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, lots of KEGG pathways associated with immunity, proliferation, and signaling were also significantly enriched in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct, respectively. Furthermore, through the integrated analysis of coexpression network and protein-protein interaction network, 3 genes (including COL11A1, COL14A1, and C3AR1) involved in protein digestion and absorption pathway and Staphylococcus aureus infection pathway were identified in testis, 2 genes (including BUB1B and ESPL1) involved in cell cycle pathway were identified in epididymis, and 13 genes (including DNAH1, DNAH3, DNAH7, DNAH10, DNAH12, DNAI1, DNAI2, DNALI1, NTF3, ITGA1, TLR2, RELN, and PAK1) involved in Huntington disease pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were identified in spermaduct. These genes could play crucial roles in the sperm motility of drakes with different libido, and all data the present study obtained will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating sperm motility of drakes.",

                    "text": "Comparative transcriptome analysis identified crucial genes and pathways affecting sperm motility in the reproductive tract of drakes with different libido.Libido can affect the semen quality of male, and the sperm motility in semen quality parameters is a reliable index to evaluate the fertility of male. In drakes, the sperm motility is gradually acquired in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. However, the relationship between libido and sperm motility in drakes has not been reported and the mechanisms of testis, epididymis, and spermaduct regulating the sperm motility of drakes are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the semen quality of drakes with libido level 4 (LL4) and libido level 5 (LL5), and tried to identify the mechanisms regulating the sperm motility in drakes by performing RNA-seq in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. Phenotypically, the sperm motility of drakes (P < 0.01), weight of testis (P < 0.05), and organ index of epididymis (P < 0.05) in the LL5 group were significantly better than those in LL4 group. Moreover, compared with the LL4 group, the ductal square of seminiferous tubule (ST) in testis was significantly bigger in the LL5 group (P < 0.05), and the seminiferous epithelial thickness (P < 0.01) of ST in testis and lumenal diameter (P < 0.05) of ductuli conjugentes/dutus epididymidis in epididymis were significantly longer in the LL5 group. In transcriptional regulation, in addition to KEGG pathways related to metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, lots of KEGG pathways associated with immunity, proliferation, and signaling were also significantly enriched in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct, respectively. Furthermore, through the integrated analysis of coexpression network and protein-protein interaction network, 3 genes (including COL11A1, COL14A1, and C3AR1) involved in protein digestion and absorption pathway and Staphylococcus aureus infection pathway were identified in testis, 2 genes (including BUB1B and ESPL1) involved in cell cycle pathway were identified in epididymis, and 13 genes (including DNAH1, DNAH3, DNAH7, DNAH10, DNAH12, DNAI1, DNAI2, DNALI1, NTF3, ITGA1, TLR2, RELN, and PAK1) involved in Huntington disease pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were identified in spermaduct. These genes could play crucial roles in the sperm motility of drakes with different libido, and all data the present study obtained will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating sperm motility of drakes.",

An increasing number of studies have implicated altered glucose and energy metabolism in patients with AD. There is compelling evidence of abnormalities in some of the key mitochondrial enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes, which play a great significance role in the pathogenesis of AD. Changes in some of the enzyme activities of the mitochondria found in AD have been linked with the pathology of amyloid-beta (Abeta). This review highlights the role of mitochondrial function in the production and clearance of Abeta and how the pathology of Abeta leads to a decrease in energy metabolism by affecting mitochondrial function.",

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study in which 18 subjects (6 controls, 6 premanifest, and 6 manifest HD gene carriers) underwent a [11C]-ER176 PET scan and an MRI for anatomic localization. Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) was performed, and group differences in [11C]-ER176 binding (used to evaluate the extent of microglial activation) were assessed by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Microglial activation was correlated with ROIs volumes, disease burden, and the scores obtained in the clinical scales. As an exploratory aim, we evaluated the dynamic functions of microglia in vitro, by using induced microglia-like (iMG) cells from peripheral blood monocytes. RESULTS: Individuals with manifest HD present higher [11C]-ER176 SUVR in both globi pallidi and putamina in comparison with controls. No differences were observed when we compared premanifest HD with controls or with manifest HD. We also found a significant correlation between increased microglial activation and cumulative disease burden, and with reduced volumes. iMG from controls, premanifest HD, and manifest HD patients showed similar phagocytic capacity.

In spite of considerable efforts, there is currently no treatment to stop or delay the disease. Although HTT is expressed ubiquitously, most of our knowledge has been obtained on neurons. More recently, the impact of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) on other cell types, including glial cells, has received growing interest. It is currently unclear whether new pathological pathways could be identified in these cells compared to neurons. To address this question, we performed an in vivo screen for modifiers of mutant huntingtin (HTT-548-128Q) induced pathology in Drosophila adult glial cells and identified several putative therapeutic targets. Among them, we discovered that partial nej/dCBP depletion in these cells was protective, as revealed by strongly increased lifespan and restored locomotor activity. Thus, dCBP promotes the HD pathology in glial cells, in contrast to previous opposite findings in neurons. Further investigations implicated the transcriptional activator Foxo as a critical downstream player in this glial protective pathway. Our data suggest that combinatorial approaches combined to specific tissue targeting may be required to uncover efficient therapies in HD.",

Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

                    "text": "Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 Activation Improves Motor Performance and Reduces Pathology in Heterozygous zQ175 Huntington Disease Mice.Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington disease. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study included patients who completed a double-blind study (Rollover) and patients who converted overnight from a stable tetrabenazine dose (Switch). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (adverse events per person-year) were calculated. Efficacy was analyzed using a stable post-titration timepoint (8 weeks). Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score and total maximal chorea score from baseline to week 8, as well as those from week 8 to week 145 (or the last visit on the study drug if that occurred earlier), were evaluated as both efficacy and safety endpoints during the study. RESULTS: Of 119 patients (Rollover, n = 82; Switch, n = 37), 100 (84%) completed >= 1 year of treatment. End-of-study exposure-adjusted incidence rates for adverse events in Rollover and Switch, respectively, were: any, 2.57 and 4.02; serious, 0.11 and 0.14; leading to dose suspension, 0.05 and 0.04. Common adverse events (>= 4% either cohort) included somnolence (Rollover, 20%; Switch, 30%), depression (32%; 22%), anxiety (27%; 35%), insomnia (23%; 16%), and akathisia (6%; 11%). Adverse events of interest included suicidality (9%; 5%) and parkinsonism (4%; 8%). Mean dose at week 8 was 38.1 mg (Rollover) and 36.5 mg (Switch). Mean dose across cohorts after titration was 37.6 mg; at the final visit, mean dose across cohorts was 45.7 mg. Patients showed minimal change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea scores with stable dosing from weeks 8-145 or at the end of treatment, but total motor score increased versus week 8 (mean change [standard deviation]: 8.2 [11.9]). There were no unexpected adverse events upon drug withdrawal, and mean (standard deviation) total maximal chorea scores increased 4.7 (4.6) units from week 8 to 1-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events observed with long-term deutetrabenazine exposure were consistent with previous studies. Reductions in chorea persisted over time. Upon treatment cessation, there was no unexpected worsening of chorea. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01897896.",

Adverse events of interest included suicidality (9%; 5%) and parkinsonism (4%; 8%). Mean dose at week 8 was 38.1 mg (Rollover) and 36.5 mg (Switch). Mean dose across cohorts after titration was 37.6 mg; at the final visit, mean dose across cohorts was 45.7 mg. Patients showed minimal change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea scores with stable dosing from weeks 8-145 or at the end of treatment, but total motor score increased versus week 8 (mean change [standard deviation]: 8.2 [11.9]). There were no unexpected adverse events upon drug withdrawal, and mean (standard deviation) total maximal chorea scores increased 4.7 (4.6) units from week 8 to 1-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events observed with long-term deutetrabenazine exposure were consistent with previous studies. Reductions in chorea persisted over time. Upon treatment cessation, there was no unexpected worsening of chorea. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01897896.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington disease. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study included patients who completed a double-blind study (Rollover) and patients who converted overnight from a stable tetrabenazine dose (Switch). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (adverse events per person-year) were calculated. Efficacy was analyzed using a stable post-titration timepoint (8 weeks). Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score and total maximal chorea score from baseline to week 8, as well as those from week 8 to week 145 (or the last visit on the study drug if that occurred earlier), were evaluated as both efficacy and safety endpoints during the study. RESULTS: Of 119 patients (Rollover, n = 82; Switch, n = 37), 100 (84%) completed >= 1 year of treatment.

Deutetrabenazine is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia in adults. Objective: To examine whether deutetrabenazine is effective and safe for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in children and adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2/3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-titration study included children and adolescents (aged 6-16 years) with Tourette syndrome with active tics causing distress or impairment (ie, Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score [YGTSS-TTS] >=20). The trial was conducted over 12 weeks, with 1 week of follow-up from February 2018 to November 2019 at 36 centers in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Russia, Serbia, and Spain. Data analysis was conducted from January 31 to April 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive deutetrabenazine or placebo, titrated during 7 weeks to an optimal level, followed by a 5-week maintenance period. The maximum total daily deutetrabenazine dose was 48 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 12 in YGTSS-TTS. Key secondary end points included changes in Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression, Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, questionnaires, and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 119 participants were randomized to deutetrabenazine (59 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.5] years; 53 [90%] boys; 49 [83%] White; 3 [5%] Black) and placebo (60 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.6] years; 51 [85%] boys; 53 [88%] White; 3 [5%] Black). At week 12, the difference in YGTSS-TTS score was not significant between deutetrabenazine and placebo (least squares mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -4.1 to 2.8; P = .69; Cohen d, -0.07). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 38 patients (66%) and 33 patients (56%) receiving deutetrabenazine and placebo, respectively, and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified.

The trial was conducted over 12 weeks, with 1 week of follow-up from February 2018 to November 2019 at 36 centers in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Russia, Serbia, and Spain. Data analysis was conducted from January 31 to April 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive deutetrabenazine or placebo, titrated during 7 weeks to an optimal level, followed by a 5-week maintenance period. The maximum total daily deutetrabenazine dose was 48 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 12 in YGTSS-TTS. Key secondary end points included changes in Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression, Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, questionnaires, and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 119 participants were randomized to deutetrabenazine (59 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.5] years; 53 [90%] boys; 49 [83%] White; 3 [5%] Black) and placebo (60 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.6] years; 51 [85%] boys; 53 [88%] White; 3 [5%] Black). At week 12, the difference in YGTSS-TTS score was not significant between deutetrabenazine and placebo (least squares mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -4.1 to 2.8; P = .69; Cohen d, -0.07). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 38 patients (66%) and 33 patients (56%) receiving deutetrabenazine and placebo, respectively, and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. These results may be informative for future studies of treatments for tics in Tourette syndrome. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03452943.",

METHODS: Evaluation of motor functions and total functional capacity was performed in 30 HD mutation carriers or patients at the beginning and in 22 subjects after 8-10 years. Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress.

                    "text": "Heart Rate Variability in Huntington Disease: A Long-Term Longitudinal Study.INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to follow tonic and phasic autonomic nervous activity in Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers and patients. METHODS: Evaluation of motor functions and total functional capacity was performed in 30 HD mutation carriers or patients at the beginning and in 22 subjects after 8-10 years. Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress. There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of an outbreak of clinical disease phase.",

Aggregates are mainly formed by aberrant disease-specific proteins and are accompanied by accumulation of other aggregate-interacting proteins. Although aggregate-interacting proteins have been considered to modulate the formation of aggregates and to be involved in molecular mechanisms of disease progression, the components of aggregate-interacting proteins remain unknown. In this study, we showed that small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alfa (SGTA) is an aggregate-interacting protein in neurodegenerative diseases. Immunohistochemistry showed that SGTA interacted with intracellular aggregates in Huntington disease (HD) cell models and neurons of HD model mice. We also revealed that SGTA colocalized with intracellular aggregates in postmortem brains of patients with polyQ diseases including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. In addition, SGTA colocalized with glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the brains of MSA patients, whereas no accumulation of SGTA was observed in neurons of PD and ALS patients. In vitro study showed that SGTA bound to polyQ aggregates through its C-terminal domain and SGTA overexpression reduced intracellular aggregates. These results suggest that SGTA may play a role in the formation of aggregates and may act as potential modifier of molecular pathological mechanisms of polyQ diseases and MSA.",

METHODS: Forty-three individuals with HD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed single tasks of walking (Timed Up & Go (TUG), 7 m walk), standing (feet together, feet apart and foam surface) and seated cognitive performance (Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting test) and dual cognitive-motor tasks while standing (+ Stroop) and walking (+ DKEFS, TUG cognitive).

The typical motor symptoms have been associated with basal ganglia pathology. However, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms often precede the motor component and may be due to changes in the limbic system. Recent work has indicated pathology in the hypothalamus in HD but other parts of the limbic system have not been extensively studied. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in HD also include white matter pathology. Here we investigated if the main white matter tract of the limbic system, the fornix, is affected in HD. We demonstrate that the fornix is 34% smaller already in prodromal HD and 41% smaller in manifest HD compared to controls using volumetric analyses of MRI of the IMAGE-HD study. In post-mortem fornix tissue from HD cases, we confirm the smaller fornix volume in HD which is accompanied by signs of myelin breakdown and reduced levels of the transcription factor myelin regulating factor but detect no loss of oligodendrocytes. Further analyses using RNA-sequencing demonstrate downregulation of oligodendrocyte identity markers in the fornix of HD cases. Analysis of differentially expressed genes based on transcription-factor/target-gene interactions also revealed enrichment for binding sites of SUZ12 and EZH2, components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, as well as RE1 Regulation Transcription Factor. Taken together, our data show that there is early white matter pathology of the fornix in the limbic system in HD likely due to a combination of reduction in oligodendrocyte genes and myelin break down.",

The typical motor symptoms have been associated with basal ganglia pathology. However, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms often precede the motor component and may be due to changes in the limbic system. Recent work has indicated pathology in the hypothalamus in HD but other parts of the limbic system have not been extensively studied. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in HD also include white matter pathology. Here we investigated if the main white matter tract of the limbic system, the fornix, is affected in HD. We demonstrate that the fornix is 34% smaller already in prodromal HD and 41% smaller in manifest HD compared to controls using volumetric analyses of MRI of the IMAGE-HD study. In post-mortem fornix tissue from HD cases, we confirm the smaller fornix volume in HD which is accompanied by signs of myelin breakdown and reduced levels of the transcription factor myelin regulating factor but detect no loss of oligodendrocytes. Further analyses using RNA-sequencing demonstrate downregulation of oligodendrocyte identity markers in the fornix of HD cases. Analysis of differentially expressed genes based on transcription-factor/target-gene interactions also revealed enrichment for binding sites of SUZ12 and EZH2, components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, as well as RE1 Regulation Transcription Factor. Taken together, our data show that there is early white matter pathology of the fornix in the limbic system in HD likely due to a combination of reduction in oligodendrocyte genes and myelin break down.",

METHODS: MRI scans were performed on 25 patients with HD and 23 healthy age-matched controls at Massachusetts General Hospital. The imaging data were analyzed with a novel algorithm to determine regional PVS volume. A fractional logistic regression analysis was used to quantify the association between regional percent PVS volume and (1) disease designation (HD or control) and (2) disease severity as assessed by normalized caudate volume. RESULTS: Patients with HD had the greatest percent volume of dilated PVS in the putamen (left putamen: odds ratio 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-2.62], HD 3.27% [95% CI 2.83-3.78] vs controls 1.62% [95% CI 1.32-1.97], p fdr < 0.001; right putamen: odds ratio 1.66 [95% CI 1.33-2.08], HD 3.43% [95% CI 2.94-4.01] vs controls 2.09% [95% CI 1.79-2.45], p fdr < 0.001) and several subcortical white matter regions compared to controls. Dilated PVS increased with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The objective quantification of dilated PVS suggests that PVS burden is high, is associated with disease severity, and may affect the distribution and success of treatments administered either intrathecally such as antisense oligonucleotides or by intraparenchymal administration such as cell and gene therapies. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that increased dilated PVS is associated with worse HD severity. The study is rated Class II because of the cross-sectional design.",

A fractional logistic regression analysis was used to quantify the association between regional percent PVS volume and (1) disease designation (HD or control) and (2) disease severity as assessed by normalized caudate volume. RESULTS: Patients with HD had the greatest percent volume of dilated PVS in the putamen (left putamen: odds ratio 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-2.62], HD 3.27% [95% CI 2.83-3.78] vs controls 1.62% [95% CI 1.32-1.97], p fdr < 0.001; right putamen: odds ratio 1.66 [95% CI 1.33-2.08], HD 3.43% [95% CI 2.94-4.01] vs controls 2.09% [95% CI 1.79-2.45], p fdr < 0.001) and several subcortical white matter regions compared to controls. Dilated PVS increased with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The objective quantification of dilated PVS suggests that PVS burden is high, is associated with disease severity, and may affect the distribution and success of treatments administered either intrathecally such as antisense oligonucleotides or by intraparenchymal administration such as cell and gene therapies. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that increased dilated PVS is associated with worse HD severity. The study is rated Class II because of the cross-sectional design.",

We hypothesised that in 2019, parents would inform their at-risk children about their genetic risk more and at a younger age than in 2000, given the availability of prenatal diagnosis, French legislation changes since 2011, and recent therapeutic advances. We made a questionnaire available about the transmission of genetic information within families with Huntington disease in 2000 and 2019. We obtained 443 questionnaires (295 in 2019 and 148 in 2000).

However, they would inform at an earlier age (<=18 years, 67% vs 59%, p = 0.16). Information on transmission risk had been given primarily by parents (45% vs 30%, p = 0.06).

We hypothesised that in 2019, parents would inform their at-risk children about their genetic risk more and at a younger age than in 2000, given the availability of prenatal diagnosis, French legislation changes since 2011, and recent therapeutic advances. We made a questionnaire available about the transmission of genetic information within families with Huntington disease in 2000 and 2019. We obtained 443 questionnaires (295 in 2019 and 148 in 2000). Participants were mainly at-risk for Huntington disease (n = 113), affected (n = 85), and spouses (n = 154).

METHODS: We utilized resting-state, functional MRI data from participants in the Kids-HD study between 6 and 18 years old. Participants were divided into GE (CAG 36-59) and GNE (CAG <36) groups. Seed-to-seed correlations were calculated among 4 regions that provide input signals to the anterior cerebellum: (1) dorsocaudal putamen, (2) globus pallidus externa, (3) subthalamic nucleus, and (4) pontine nuclei; and 2 regions that represented output from the cerebellum: the dentate nucleus to the (1) ventrolateral thalamus and (2) dorsocaudal putamen. Linear mixed effects regression models evaluated differences in developmental trajectories of these connections over time between groups. RESULTS: Four of the six striatal-cerebellum correlations showed significantly different trajectories between groups. All showed a pattern where in the early age ranges (6-12 years) there was hyperconnectivity in the GE compared to the GNE, with those trajectories showing linear decline in the latter half of the age range. CONCLUSION: These results parallel previous findings showing striatal hypertrophy in children with GE as early as age 6. These findings support the notion of developmentally higher connectivity between the striatum and cerebellum early in the life of the child with HD GE, possibly setting the stage for cerebellar compensatory mechanisms.",

The method was validated by correlation and Bland-Altman analysis on a ferritin-containing phantom. Mineral-iron maps were obtained from postmortem tissue of patients with neurological diseases characterized by brain iron accumulation, that is, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and aceruloplasminemia, and validated with histology.

                    "text": "NAV3 Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker Affecting the Immune Status of the Tumor Microenvironment in Colorectal Cancer.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development of CRC. With the deep understanding of TME function, growing studies have demonstrated that alteration in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and gene expressions are associated with clinical outcomes of various tumors. In this study, we aimed to recognize critical prognostic genes involved in immune states in TME of CRC. Hence, the proportion of TICs and the number of immune and stromal components in CRC samples from TCGA datasets were calculated by the use of CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE calculation methods. Different assays were applied to collect differential expression genes (DEGs) shared by the ImmuneScore and StromalScore. DEGs were further analyzed by the use of univariate Cox regression. Our attention focused on neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) which was highly expressed in CRC specimens and associated with an advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis of CRC patients. KEGG assays revealed that NAV3 may be involved in Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, FoxO signaling pathway, and human papillomavirus infection. Correlation assays showed that macrophage M0 and B cells memory, NK cells activated, dendritic cells resting, T cells CD4 memory activated, and T cells CD8 were correlated with NAV3 expression, indicating that NAV3 may represent the immune status of TME. Finally, RT-PCR confirmed that NAV3 expression was distinctly increased in CRC cells, and its knockdown suppressed the proliferation of CRC cells. Overall, NAV3 could be used as a novel predictor for TME of CRC and might be a novel prognostic biomarker. In the future, drugs targeting NAV3 might be developed as a potential immunotherapy for CRC patients.",

It has been proven that the differentiation, migration and protective properties of UC-MSCs are superior compared with other kinds of stem cells. Moreover, incurable neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Huntington, encourage scientists to apply UC-MSCs transplantation in order to find a definite treatment.

Moreover, the mean diffusivity of the intra-axonal metabolite N-acetylaspartate, co-measured with N-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA), was significantly reduced in the corpus callosum of patients compared to controls. FBA and DW-MRS of tNAA provided more specific information about the biological mechanisms underlying HD and showed promise for early investigation of white matter degeneration in HD.",

                    "text": "Multiparametric characterization of white matter alterations in early stage Huntington disease.Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic, fully penetrant neurodegenerative disorder. Widespread white matter damage affects the brain of patients with HD at very early stages of the disease. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) is a novel method to investigate the contribution of individual crossing fibers to the white matter damage and to detect possible alterations in both fiber density and fiber-bundle morphology. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS), on the other hand, quantifies the motion of brain metabolites in vivo, thus enabling the investigation of microstructural alteration of specific cell populations. The aim of this study was to identify novel specific microstructural imaging markers of white matter degeneration in HD, by combining FBA and DW-MRS. Twenty patients at an early stage of HD and 20 healthy controls were recruited in a monocentric study. Using diffusion imaging we observed alterations to the brain microstructure and their morphology in patients with HD. Furthermore, FBA revealed specific fiber populations that were affected by the disease. Moreover, the mean diffusivity of the intra-axonal metabolite N-acetylaspartate, co-measured with N-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA), was significantly reduced in the corpus callosum of patients compared to controls.

The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",
