METHODS: Spanish participants of the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN) Registry study diagnosed with HD or premanifest HD gene carriers were included from June 2012 to August 2013. Self-reported dietary intake was collected by 3-day dietary record, MeDi adherence was assessed by 0-9 range (proposed by Trichopoulou et al.) and, other contributing factors related to nutrition were collected by telephone. Demographics and clinical variables were obtained from the EHDN Registry study database. Association of HD with MeDi adherence and nutritional characteristics were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48 years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range). HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however, quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P = 0.013). Moderate adherence to MeDi, was associated with older participants (OR = 1.19, P = 0.031), lower comorbidity (OR = 0.18, P = 0.018), lower UHDRS motor (OR = 0.90, P = 0.041), and lower risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.02, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In HD the moderate MeDi adherence is associated with better quality of life, lower comorbidity, lower motor impairment and lower risk for abdominal obesity compared to those participants with low MeDi adherence.",

The worn-out products of cell metabolism should be safely eliminated via the proteasome, autophago-lysosome and exocytosis. Insufficient activity of these degradation mechanisms within neurons leads to the accumulation of toxic protein oligomers, which represent a starting material for development of neurodegenerative proteinopathy. The spectrum of CNS linked proteinopathies is particularly broad and includes Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia, Pick disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many others. Although the primary events in etiopathogenesis of sporadic forms of these diseases are still unknown, it is clear that aging, in connection with decreased activity of ubiquitin proteasome system, is the most significant risk factor. In this review we discuss the pathogenic role and intracellular fate of the candidate molecules associated with onset and progression of AD and PD, the protein tau and alpha-synuclein in context with the function of ubiquitin proteasome system. We also discuss the possibility whether or not the strategies focused to re-establishment of neuroproteostasis via accelerated clearance of damaged proteins in proteasome could be a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of major neurodegenerative diseases.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive heredoneurodegenerative disease manifested by chorea and other hyperkinetic (dystonia, myoclonus, tics) and hypokinetic (parkinsonism) movement disorders. In addition, a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, along with cognitive decline, contribute significantly to the patient's disability. Because there are no effective neuroprotective therapies that delay the progression of the disease, symptomatic treatment remains the cornerstone of medical management. Several classes of medications have been used to ameliorate the various symptoms of HD, including typical and atypical neuroleptics, dopamine depleters, antidepressants, antiglutamatergic drugs, GABA agonists, antiepileptic medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and botulinum toxin. Recently, surgical approaches including pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation, and fetal cell transplants have been used for the symptomatic treatment of HD. The selected therapy must be customized to the needs of each patient, minimizing the potential adverse effects. The primary aim of this article is to review the role of the different therapies, both available and investigational, for the treatment of the motor, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of HD, and to examine their impact on the patient's functionality and quality of life.",

Self-reported dietary intake was collected by 3-day dietary record, MeDi adherence was assessed by 0-9 range (proposed by Trichopoulou et al.) and, other contributing factors related to nutrition were collected by telephone.

Association of HD with MeDi adherence and nutritional characteristics were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48 years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range). HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however, quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P = 0.013). Moderate adherence to MeDi, was associated with older participants (OR = 1.19, P = 0.031), lower comorbidity (OR = 0.18, P = 0.018), lower UHDRS motor (OR = 0.90, P = 0.041), and lower risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.02, P = 0.011).

METHODS: The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. Thirty-three adults with HD, cognitive complaints, and no depression (Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] rating scale <= 12) were administered citalopram 20 mg or placebo (7 visits, 20 weeks), with practice and placebo run-ins. The primary outcome was change in executive functioning. RESULTS: The intent to treat analysis was controlled for practice effects, comparing visits 1 and 2 to visits 5 and 6 for citalopram versus placebo. There were no significant benefits on the executive function composite (treatment-placebo mean difference -0.167; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.361 to 0.028; P = .092). Citalopram participants showed improved clinician-rated depression symptoms on the HAM-D (t = -2.02; P = 0.05). There were no group differences on motor ratings, self-reported executive functions, psychiatric symptoms, or functional status. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that short-term treatment with citalopram improved executive functions in HD. Despite excluding patients with active depression, participants on citalopram showed improved mood, raising the possibility of efficacy for subsyndromal depression in HD.",

                    "abstract": "One of the chief contemporary goals of neurologists and neuroscientists is to find a way to overcome the debilitating effects of brain diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Since very few molecules have been found to be efficient in curing the patients and even halting the progression of the symptoms, cell therapy is now seen as an attractive alternative. Two therapeutic strategies are currently under investigation: i) the \"substitution\" strategy, based on grafts of cells capable of differentiating in the appropriate cells and restoring lost functions and ii) the \"neuroprotective\" or \"conservative\" strategy aiming to increase the resistance of spared cells to the toxicity of their environment and to reinforce the body's own mechanisms of healing. Twenty years ago, foetal neuroblasts were the first cells to be transplanted in the brains of patients with Parkinson's or Huntington disease. A phase II clinical trial is presently conducted in France for the latter disorder. However, the numerous ethical and technical issues raised by the use of embryonic and foetal cells have directed the focus of clinicians and researchers towards substitute cell types. In this review, we summarise the main findings of the most recent basic studies and clinical trials based on: i) the grafting of surrogate adult cells such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and olfactory ensheathing cells; ii) the potential therapeutic applications of neuropoiesis - the persistent neurogenesis in the brain - as a source for tissue engraftment and as self-repair by a person's own indigenous population of pluripotent cells and iii) immune-based therapy (autologous activated macrophages and T cell vaccination) as well as administration of immunomodulatory molecules. Unexpectedly, it has been found that undifferentiated adult stem cells can display immune-like functions when they home in on an inflamed brain area while immune cells and immunosuppressors can improve functional and morphological recovery when administered within the appropriate time-window. On the one hand, outcomes from substitution therapy trials are encouraging. They pave the way for an enlarged use of various adult cell types for various neurological disorders. On the other hand, clinical benefits of the neuroprotective therapy, still under close scrutiny, look rather promising. It is likely that, in a close future, the two strategies will be combined in order to efficiently repair the pathological, the damaged or the senescent brain.",

Neuronal dysfunction and degeneration contribute to progressive physiological, motor, cognitive, and emotional disturbances characteristic of HD. A major impetus for research into the treatment of HD has centered on cell therapy strategies to protect vulnerable neuronal cell populations or to replace dysfunctional or dying cells. The work underlying 3 approaches to HD cell therapy includes the potential for self-repair through the manipulation of endogenous stem cells and/or neurogenesis, the use of fetal or stem cell transplantation as a cell replacement strategy, and the administration of neurotrophic factors to protect susceptible neuronal populations. These approaches have shown some promising results in animal models of HD. Although striatal transplantation of fetal-derived cells has undergone clinical assessment since the 1990s, many cell therapy strategies have yet to be applied in the clinic environment. A more thorough understanding of the pathophysiologies underlying HD as well as the response of both endogenous and exogenous cells to the degenerating brain will inform their merit as potential therapeutic agents and enhance the framework by which the success of such strategies are determined.",

Pridopidine was administered either prior to the appearance of disease phenotypes or in advanced stages of disease in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. In the early treatment cohort, animals received 0, 10, or 30 mg/kg pridopidine for a period of 10.5 months. In the late treatment cohort, animals were treated for 8 weeks with 0 mg/kg or an escalating dose of pridopidine (10 to 30 mg/kg over 3 weeks). Early treatment improved motor coordination and reduced anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes in YAC128 mice, but it did not rescue striatal and corpus callosum atrophy. Late treatment, conversely, only improved depressive-like symptoms. RNA-seq analysis revealed that early pridopidine treatment reversed striatal transcriptional deficits, upregulating disease-specific genes that are known to be downregulated during HD, a finding that is experimentally confirmed herein. This suggests that pridopidine exerts beneficial effects at the transcriptional level. Taken together, our findings support continued clinical development of pridopidine for HD, particularly in the early stages of disease, and provide valuable insight into the potential therapeutic mode of action of pridopidine.",

It is not known whether testosterone therapy (TT) in men with borderline hypogonadism and neurodegenerative diseases will be of substantial benefit. Previously, we reported that testosterone deficiency is more common in patients with PD compared with age-matched control subjects, and we also reported in 2 small open-label studies that some nonmotor symptoms responded favorably to TT. OBJECTIVE: To define the effects of TT on nonmotor and motor symptoms in men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. DESIGN: Double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center trial. PATIENTS: Two experimental groups: patients with PD who were receiving either TT or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either the study drug by intramuscular injection (200 mg/mL of testosterone enanthate every 2 weeks for 8 weeks) or placebo (isotonic sodium chloride solution injections). In patients in each group, the testosterone serum concentration was obtained at each study visit. During 2 study visits, testosterone levels were blindly evaluated and the intramuscular testosterone dose was increased by 200 mg/mL if the free testosterone value failed to double from the baseline value. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Questionnaire, and secondary outcome measures included measures of mood, cognition, fatigue, motor function, and frequency of adverse events. At the end of the double-blind phase, all patients were offered open-label TT and were followed up after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Fifteen patients in the placebo group (mean age, 69.9 years), receiving a mean total levodopa equivalent dose of 924 mg/d, had a baseline free testosterone level of 47.91 pg/mL, compared with 15 patients in the TT group (mean age, 66.7 years), receiving an average total levodopa equivalent dose of 734 mg/d, who had a baseline free testosterone level of 63.49 pg/mL. Testosterone was generally well tolerated. More subjects in the TT group experienced lower extremity edema (40% vs 20%). In 2 patients, 1 in each group, prostate-specific antigen levels were elevated from baseline. The improvement in the TT group compared with the placebo group (1.7 vs 1.1) on the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Scale was not statistically significant. In addition, there were no significant differences in motor and nonmotor features of PD between the 2 groups, although a few subscales showed improvements (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, P<.04; and Backward Visual Span subtrial, P<.03). However, long-term open-label TT resulted in delayed but sustained improvement in subjects in the TT group who continued to receive treatment (n = 6) compared with subjects in the placebo group who elected not to receive TT (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone therapy was generally well tolerated in elderly men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. While there was no significant difference in the motor and nonmotor scales between the TT and placebo groups at the end of 8 weeks compared with baseline, this may be due to several study limitations, including small sample size, a strong placebo effect with intramuscular therapy, and short follow-up that did not allow measurement of delayed effects of TT in some subjects. Until more definitive studies are reported, practitioners should be particularly cautious in treatment of low testosterone concentrations in men with PD and borderline testosterone deficiency, and careful consideration should be given to the risks vs the benefits of TT.",

Neuronal dysfunction and degeneration contribute to progressive physiological, motor, cognitive, and emotional disturbances characteristic of HD. A major impetus for research into the treatment of HD has centered on cell therapy strategies to protect vulnerable neuronal cell populations or to replace dysfunctional or dying cells. The work underlying 3 approaches to HD cell therapy includes the potential for self-repair through the manipulation of endogenous stem cells and/or neurogenesis, the use of fetal or stem cell transplantation as a cell replacement strategy, and the administration of neurotrophic factors to protect susceptible neuronal populations. These approaches have shown some promising results in animal models of HD. Although striatal transplantation of fetal-derived cells has undergone clinical assessment since the 1990s, many cell therapy strategies have yet to be applied in the clinic environment. A more thorough understanding of the pathophysiologies underlying HD as well as the response of both endogenous and exogenous cells to the degenerating brain will inform their merit as potential therapeutic agents and enhance the framework by which the success of such strategies are determined.",

The study aimed to assess the self-awareness of memory impairment in HD in comparison to advanced Parkinson disease (PD), mild PD and cervical dystonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-awareness was tested in 23 patients with HD by comparing patient and caregiver ratings in reference to clinical control groups (25 patients with advanced PD, 21 with mild PD and 20 with cervical dystonia). Self-awareness was tested using the Self Rating Scale of Memory Functions, which was administered to both the patients and the caregivers. Neuropsychological assessment addressed general cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination), verbal learning (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 15-word list) and mood (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). RESULTS: Patients with HD significantly underestimated their memory dysfunction. Underestimation of memory deficit correlated with disease duration and disease severity in HD. CONCLUSIONS: Huntington disease patients underestimate memory dysfunction. These results add to the previous reports on poor insight in HD in other domains and suggest that anosognosia in HD, albeit usually rather mild, may be a generalized phenomenon.",

Pridopidine was administered either prior to the appearance of disease phenotypes or in advanced stages of disease in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. In the early treatment cohort, animals received 0, 10, or 30 mg/kg pridopidine for a period of 10.5 months. In the late treatment cohort, animals were treated for 8 weeks with 0 mg/kg or an escalating dose of pridopidine (10 to 30 mg/kg over 3 weeks). Early treatment improved motor coordination and reduced anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes in YAC128 mice, but it did not rescue striatal and corpus callosum atrophy. Late treatment, conversely, only improved depressive-like symptoms. RNA-seq analysis revealed that early pridopidine treatment reversed striatal transcriptional deficits, upregulating disease-specific genes that are known to be downregulated during HD, a finding that is experimentally confirmed herein. This suggests that pridopidine exerts beneficial effects at the transcriptional level. Taken together, our findings support continued clinical development of pridopidine for HD, particularly in the early stages of disease, and provide valuable insight into the potential therapeutic mode of action of pridopidine.",

Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea, was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea control. Interventions: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales. Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled. Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment. Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1 and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively maintained chorea control.",

Lowering the mutant gene expression is predicted to slow the disease progression and produce clinical benefit. Administration of small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence specific genes. However, long term delivery of siRNA to silence the mutant genes, a requirement for treatment of these chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases, remains a critical unsolved issue. Here we designed and tested a chemically stabilized siRNA against human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We show that the modified siRNA has enhanced stability and retains siRNA activity. Administration of this siRNA at the disease onset by long term infusion into the CNS resulted in widespread distribution of this siRNA, knocked down the mutant SOD1 expression, slowed the disease progression, and extended the survival.

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of latrepirdine on cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Sixty-four research centers in Australia, Europe, and North America. PATIENTS Four hundred three patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and baseline cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10-26). INTERVENTION Latrepirdine (20 mg) vs matching placebo administered orally 3 times daily for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary outcome measures were cognition as measured by the change in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to week 26 and global function at week 26 as measured by the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview, which ranges from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included behavior, daily function, motor function, and safety. RESULTS The mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination score among participants randomized to latrepirdine (1.5-point improvement) did not differ significantly from that among participants randomized to placebo (1.3-point improvement) (P=.39). Similarly, the distribution of the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview did not differ significantly among those randomized to latrepirdine compared with placebo (P=.84). No significant treatment effects were detected on the secondary efficacy outcome measures. The incidence of adverse events was similar between those randomized to latrepirdine (68.5%) and placebo (68.0%). CONCLUSION In patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and cognitive impairment, treatment with latrepirdine for 6 months was safe and well tolerated but did not improve cognition or global function relative to placebo.

Neuronal dysfunction and degeneration contribute to progressive physiological, motor, cognitive, and emotional disturbances characteristic of HD. A major impetus for research into the treatment of HD has centered on cell therapy strategies to protect vulnerable neuronal cell populations or to replace dysfunctional or dying cells. The work underlying 3 approaches to HD cell therapy includes the potential for self-repair through the manipulation of endogenous stem cells and/or neurogenesis, the use of fetal or stem cell transplantation as a cell replacement strategy, and the administration of neurotrophic factors to protect susceptible neuronal populations. These approaches have shown some promising results in animal models of HD. Although striatal transplantation of fetal-derived cells has undergone clinical assessment since the 1990s, many cell therapy strategies have yet to be applied in the clinic environment. A more thorough understanding of the pathophysiologies underlying HD as well as the response of both endogenous and exogenous cells to the degenerating brain will inform their merit as potential therapeutic agents and enhance the framework by which the success of such strategies are determined.",

Lowering the mutant gene expression is predicted to slow the disease progression and produce clinical benefit. Administration of small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence specific genes. However, long term delivery of siRNA to silence the mutant genes, a requirement for treatment of these chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases, remains a critical unsolved issue. Here we designed and tested a chemically stabilized siRNA against human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We show that the modified siRNA has enhanced stability and retains siRNA activity. Administration of this siRNA at the disease onset by long term infusion into the CNS resulted in widespread distribution of this siRNA, knocked down the mutant SOD1 expression, slowed the disease progression, and extended the survival. These results bring RNA interference therapy one step closer to its clinical application for treatment of chronic, devastating, and fatal CNS disorders.",

In animal models, effects of LEV are observed in basal ganglia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of LEV in reducing involuntary movements in subjects affected by Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: This was a single-center, short-term, open-label, controlled study. Patients had LEV as add-on therapy for 6 months. In the first visit patients were rated according to the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale. Every 2 months they were submitted to all these tests. LEV was added at the dose of 500 mg twice daily for the first 2 months and then the dosage was increased until 1000 mg twice daily for the next 4 more months. The authors enrolled 22 patients: 15 were assigned to the LEV group and 7 were enrolled as control subjects. RESULTS: No serious adverse events were experienced by the treated patients. After 6 months of treatment patients on LEV showed a significant reduction of involuntary movements, with a slight improvement of functional capacity compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Results of this short-term, prospective, controlled study indicates that in HD patients, LEV is effective in reducing involuntary movements, thus improving the quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD), caused by polyglutamate expansions in the huntingtin protein, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting in cognitive and motor impairments and death. Neuronal dysfunction and degeneration contribute to progressive physiological, motor, cognitive, and emotional disturbances characteristic of HD. A major impetus for research into the treatment of HD has centered on cell therapy strategies to protect vulnerable neuronal cell populations or to replace dysfunctional or dying cells. The work underlying 3 approaches to HD cell therapy includes the potential for self-repair through the manipulation of endogenous stem cells and/or neurogenesis, the use of fetal or stem cell transplantation as a cell replacement strategy, and the administration of neurotrophic factors to protect susceptible neuronal populations. These approaches have shown some promising results in animal models of HD. Although striatal transplantation of fetal-derived cells has undergone clinical assessment since the 1990s, many cell therapy strategies have yet to be applied in the clinic environment. A more thorough understanding of the pathophysiologies underlying HD as well as the response of both endogenous and exogenous cells to the degenerating brain will inform their merit as potential therapeutic agents and enhance the framework by which the success of such strategies are determined.",

There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they would give directive counseling.

When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.",

METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD.

METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004), the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p = 0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50 to 3.16; p = 0.007). No benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of programs PA were observed for walking endurance lower limb functionality strenght and cognition function in low and moderate stage of HD. However, no benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. All authors included aerobic exercises in their programs but is unclear if vigorous and intensive PA is optimal for individuals with HD.",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

Reducing the expression of mHTT is therefore an attractive therapy for HD. However, wild-type HTT protein is essential for development and has critical roles in maintaining neuronal health. Therapies for HD that reduce wild-type HTT may therefore generate unintended negative consequences. We have identified single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) targets in the human HD population for the disease-specific targeting of the HTT gene. Using primary cells from patients with HD and the transgenic YAC18 and BACHD mouse lines, we developed antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) molecules that potently and selectively silence mHTT at both exonic and intronic SNP sites. Modification of these ASOs with S-constrained-ethyl (cET) motifs significantly improves potency while maintaining allele selectively in vitro. The developed ASO is potent and selective for mHTT in vivo after delivery to the mouse brain. We demonstrate that potent and selective allele-specific knockdown of the mHTT protein can be achieved at therapeutically relevant SNP sites using ASOs in vitro and in vivo.",

Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis with the mutation allow for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT transcript as a therapeutic strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise heterozygosity estimates are needed across diverse HD patient populations. Here we present the first comprehensive investigation of all common target alleles across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives in Canada, Sweden, France, and Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and A3a) define mutually exclusive sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy in the greatest number of patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80% are treatable using these three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion found exclusively on the A1 haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of mutant HTT in approximately 40% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the deletion reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78% in patient cells while sparing wild-type HTT expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG occurs, we demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific therapy for a monogenic disorder. ",

In specific diseases, selective silencing of only one copy of a gene may be advantageous over non-selective silencing of both copies. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Silencing both expanded and normal copies of HTT may be therapeutically beneficial, but preservation of normal HTT expression is preferred. Allele-specific methods can selectively silence the mutant HTT transcript by targeting either the expanded CAG repeat or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with the expansion. Both approaches require personalized treatment strategies based on patient genotypes. We compare the prospect of safe treatment of HD by CAG- and SNP-specific silencing approaches and review HD population genetics used to guide target identification in the patient population. Clinical implementation of allele-specific HTT silencing faces challenges common to personalized genetic medicine, requiring novel solutions from clinical scientists and regulatory authorities.",

BACKGROUND: The duration of the illness may be up to 30 years and there are far reaching implications for the affected person, family members and carers. Services for families need to provide expert psychological and practical support, whilst remaining planned and flexible. The aim of this research was to identify needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their carers and ascertain the extent to which they were supported by a specialised community service. METHODS: Five focus groups and three individual interviews were used to gather data from affected individuals, family, carers and staff of the unit (n = 33). A semi-structured discussion guide was used in every case. Data were analysed using an inductive coding technique. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged; (i) Transitions and the journey, (ii) Challenges in finding and providing support and (iii) The role of the unit in providing supportive care. While the service was seen as supportive, the need for flexibility was emphasised to facilitate the transition from unaffected to affected status. Affected individuals felt it was important to be known as the person they had been, despite the changes due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of service in a dedicated unit is an appropriate way to support affected patients and their carers. Enhancing understanding of the disease and allowing the individual to make choices can assist coping with this challenging disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is helpful to allow patients control over timing and frequency of contact with professionals. Improving understanding of the condition in the public and health professionals may enable patients to access a greater range of social activities.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this research was to identify the needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their family members/carers and to ascertain the extent to which they were supported by the type of specialised service provided in this unit. BACKGROUND: The duration of the illness may be up to 30 years and there are far reaching implications for the affected person, family members and carers. Services for families need to provide expert psychological and practical support, whilst remaining planned and flexible. The aim of this research was to identify needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their carers and ascertain the extent to which they were supported by a specialised community service. METHODS: Five focus groups and three individual interviews were used to gather data from affected individuals, family, carers and staff of the unit (n = 33). A semi-structured discussion guide was used in every case. Data were analysed using an inductive coding technique. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged; (i) Transitions and the journey, (ii) Challenges in finding and providing support and (iii) The role of the unit in providing supportive care. While the service was seen as supportive, the need for flexibility was emphasised to facilitate the transition from unaffected to affected status. Affected individuals felt it was important to be known as the person they had been, despite the changes due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of service in a dedicated unit is an appropriate way to support affected patients and their carers. Enhancing understanding of the disease and allowing the individual to make choices can assist coping with this challenging disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is helpful to allow patients control over timing and frequency of contact with professionals. Improving understanding of the condition in the public and health professionals may enable patients to access a greater range of social activities.",

Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.",

Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

There are very limited treatments, and no cures, for most of these diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Disease, and Motor Neuron Diseases. Mouse and other animal models provide hope by analysing them to understand pathogenic mechanisms, to identify drug targets, and to develop gene therapies and stem cell therapies. However, despite many decades of research, virtually no new treatments have reached the clinic. Increasingly, it is apparent that human heterogeneity within clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders, and between patients with the same genetic mutations, significantly impacts disease presentation and, potentially, therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, stratifying patients according to genetics, lifestyle, disease presentation, ethnicity, and other parameters may hold the key to bringing effective therapies from the bench to the clinic. Here, we discuss genetic and cellular humanised mouse models, and how they help in defining the genetic and environmental parameters associated with neurodegenerative disease, and so help in developing effective precision medicine strategies for future healthcare.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Choreic movements of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) may result from an abnormal control of sensory inputs. In order to further examine the pathophysiology of facial choreic movements (FCM), we carried out a neurophysiological study, including prepulse inhibition of the blink reflex (BR), in HD patients with and without FCM. METHODS: The study was conducted in 20 genetically proven HD patients with Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores of FCM ranging between 0 and 3, and in 12 age-matched healthy volunteers who served as control subjects. We counted the number of spontaneous blinks, recorded the electromyographic activity underlying FCM, and analyzed latency, amplitude, and duration of the BR responses to electrical and auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition was studied by comparing the responses to test trials with those to control trials. In control trials BRs were obtained to either a single supraorbital nerve electrical stimulus (EBR) or to a 90dB auditory stimulus (ABR). In test trials, the same stimuli were preceded by the prepulse, which was either a weak acoustic tone or a weak electrical stimulus to the third finger, delivered 30-150 ms before. RESULTS: Spontaneous blinking rate was abnormally low in 3 patients, and abnormally high in 9 patients. Mean duration of the BR was longer in patients than in control subjects. In prepulse trials, the percentage inhibition of the BR was abnormally reduced in 15 patients to at least one sensory modality, and significantly correlated with the score of FCM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the severity of FCM in patients with HD might be an expression of a disturbance in motor control partly related to an abnormal processing of sensory inputs. Such abnormality involves circuits used in prepulse inhibition of the BR.",

In the last 17 years, many of the underlying mechanisms of anti-psoriatic action, such as a Th1/Th2 shift, a suppression of important leukocyte adhesion molecules, the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways in T-cells and recently anti-angiogenic action, have been discovered. Based on the knowledge of these immunomodulatory characteristics, fumaric acid esters have been shown to be effective or potentially effective in a multitude of dermatological as well as non-dermatological diseases. The range of new therapeutic targets reaches from multiple sclerosis to illnesses such as necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare and sarcoidosis. Experimental approaches offer promising, although preliminary, results on the treatment of cancer, malaria, chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and Huntington disease, to name but a few. This valued and well-known drug mainly prescribed by dermatologists is now experiencing a renaissance far beyond dermatologic applications.",

The identification and validation of novel therapeutic targets that contribute to these degenerative cellular processes may lead to new interventions that slow or even halt the course of this insidious disease. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) is a transmembrane signaling molecule that modulates a variety of processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including glial cell activation, neuronal growth cone collapse and apoptosis of neural precursors, as well as inhibition of oligodendrocyte migration, differentiation and process formation. Therefore, inhibition of SEMA4D signaling could reduce CNS inflammation, increase neuronal outgrowth and enhance oligodendrocyte maturation, which may be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases, including HD. To that end, we evaluated the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody, which prevents the interaction between SEMA4D and its receptors, in the YAC128 transgenic HD mouse model. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorated neuropathological signatures, including striatal atrophy, cortical atrophy, and corpus callosum atrophy and prevented testicular degeneration in YAC128 mice. In parallel, a subset of behavioral symptoms was improved in anti-SEMA4D treated YAC128 mice, including reduced anxiety-like behavior and rescue of cognitive deficits.

In addition to characteristic motor deficits and atrophy of the caudate nucleus, signature hallmarks of HD include behavioral abnormalities, immune activation, and cortical and white matter loss. The identification and validation of novel therapeutic targets that contribute to these degenerative cellular processes may lead to new interventions that slow or even halt the course of this insidious disease. Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) is a transmembrane signaling molecule that modulates a variety of processes central to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration including glial cell activation, neuronal growth cone collapse and apoptosis of neural precursors, as well as inhibition of oligodendrocyte migration, differentiation and process formation. Therefore, inhibition of SEMA4D signaling could reduce CNS inflammation, increase neuronal outgrowth and enhance oligodendrocyte maturation, which may be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases, including HD. To that end, we evaluated the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of an anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody, which prevents the interaction between SEMA4D and its receptors, in the YAC128 transgenic HD mouse model. Anti-SEMA4D treatment ameliorated neuropathological signatures, including striatal atrophy, cortical atrophy, and corpus callosum atrophy and prevented testicular degeneration in YAC128 mice. In parallel, a subset of behavioral symptoms was improved in anti-SEMA4D treated YAC128 mice, including reduced anxiety-like behavior and rescue of cognitive deficits. There was, however, no discernible effect on motor deficits. The preservation of brain gray and white matter and improvement in behavioral measures in YAC128 mice treated with anti-SEMA4D suggest that this approach could represent a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HD. Importantly, this work provides in vivo demonstration that inhibition of pathways initiated by SEMA4D constitutes a novel approach to moderation of neurodegeneration. ",

When expressed intracellularly in mammalian cells these intracellular antibodies, or intrabodies, have the potential to alter the folding, interactions, modifications, or subcellular localization of their targets. These reagents have previously been developed as therapeutics against cancer and HIV. Since misfolded and accumulated intracellular proteins characterize several major neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease (HD) and Parkinson disease, these disorders are prime candidates for intrabody therapy. In this article we review the extension of intrabody technology to the nervous system. Studies of HD have been used to develop the approach and anti-synuclein strategies are in the early stages of development. Such neurodegenerative diseases are therefore poised for engineered antibody approaches, which can provide a pipeline of novel therapeutics and new drug discovery tools.",

There have been case studies reporting improvement in choreiform movements with administration of low-frequency rTMS lasting for a brief period. We report a case series where application of 7 consecutive sessions of bilateral low-frequency rTMS over the scalp area corresponding to supplementary motor area in patients with severe Huntington chorea did not reduce the intensity of choreiform movements even transiently. Hence, the proposed role of rTMS in reducing intensity of choreiform movements by altering neuronal plasticity may not hold true in severe cases.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded number of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene. A hallmark of HD is unintended weight loss, the cause of which is unknown. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of weight loss in HD, we studied its relation to other disease characteristics including motor, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances and CAG repeat number. METHODS: In 517 patients with early stage HD, we applied mixed-effects model analyses to correlate weight changes over 3 years to CAG repeat number and various components of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). We also assessed the relation between CAG repeat number and body weight and caloric intake in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. RESULTS: In patients with HD, mean body mass index decreased with -0.15 units per year (p < 0.001). However, no single UHDRS component, including motor, cognitive, and behavioral scores, was independently associated with the rate of weight loss. Patients with HD with a higher CAG repeat number had a faster rate of weight loss. Similarly, R6/2 mice with a larger CAG repeat length had a lower body weight, whereas caloric intake increased with larger CAG repeat length. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss in Huntington disease (HD) is directly linked to CAG repeat length and is likely to result from a hypermetabolic state. Other signs and symptoms of HD are unlikely to contribute to weight loss in early disease stages. Elucidation of the responsible mechanisms could lead to effective energy-based therapeutics.",

In the current review, we discuss the process of extending basic stem cell research into translational therapies for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. We begin with a discussion of the burden of these diseases on society, emphasizing the need for increased attention toward advancing stem cell therapies. We then explain the various types of stem cells utilized in neurodegenerative disease research, and outline important issues to consider in the transition of stem cell therapy from bench to bedside. Finally, we detail the current progress regarding the applications of stem cell therapies to specific neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. With a greater understanding of the capacity of stem cell technologies, there is growing public hope that stem cell therapies will continue to progress into realistic and efficacious treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",

These data are part of a survey of 682 geneticists in 19 nations. Of 490 U.S. geneticists asked to participate, 295 (60%) returned anonymous detailed questionnaires. There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they would give directive counseling. Women were more likely than men to say that they would perform prenatal diagnosis for maternal anxiety or for sex selection.",

The subjects of the study were 91 at risk persons and 68 matched controls. Both groups were divided by sex and age (45 yr less than or equal to vs greater than or equal to 46 yr). Demographic data included age, occupation, marital status, religion, education, ethnic background, and family size. We recorded 1) attitudes toward reproduction, 2) nature of contact with affected family member(s), 3) effects of HD on family planning, 4) attitudes toward AID, and 5) concern about donor selection criteria. Results suggest that 1) men and women differ in several ways with regard to their views about AID, and 2) that more vigorous educational programs might increase utilization of AID for the prevention of not only HD, but other human genetic diseases as well.",

Here, we show that ASC transplantation rescues the striatal pathology of Huntington disease (HD) models. METHODS: ASCs were isolated from human subcutaneous adipose tissue. In a quinolinic acid (QA)-induced rat model of striatal degeneration, human ASCs (1 million cells) were transplanted into the ipsilateral striatal border immediately after the QA injection. In 60-day-old R6/2 mice transgenic for HD, ASCs (0.5 million cells) were transplanted into each bilateral striata. In in vitro experiments, we treated mutant huntingtin gene-transfected cerebral neurons with ASC-conditioned media. RESULTS: In the QA model, human ASCs reduced apomorphine-induced rotation behavior, lesion volume, and striatal apoptosis. In R6/2 transgenic mice, transplantation of ASCs improved Rota-Rod performance and limb clasping, increased survival, attenuated the loss of striatal neurons, and reduced the huntingtin aggregates. ASC-transplanted R6/2 mice expressed elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and reactive oxygen defense enzymes and showed activation of the Akt/cAMP-response element-binding proteins. ASC-conditioned media decreased the level of N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin and associated apoptosis, and increased PGC-1alpha expression. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, ASC transplantation slowed striatal degeneration and behavioral deterioration of HD models, possibly via secreted factors.",

Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

METHODS: We examined factor structure (confirmatory factor analysis), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), floor and ceiling effects, convergent validity (Pearson correlations), and known-groups validity (multivariate analysis). RESULTS: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis replicated the six-factor latent model that reflects the six separate scales within the WHODAS 2.0 (understanding and communicating; getting around; self-care; getting along with others; life activities; participation). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.94, suggesting good internal consistency reliability. The WHODAS demonstrated a ceiling effect for 19.5 % of participants; there were no floor effects. There was evidence for convergent validity; the WHODAS demonstrated moderate significant correlations with other general measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL; i.e., RAND-12, EQ5D). Multivariate analyses indicated that late-stage HD participants indicated poorer HRQOL than both early-stage HD and prodromal HD participants for all HRQOL measures.

A transgenic rat model for HD carrying only 51 CAG repeats recapitulates the late-onset HD phenotype. Here, we assessed prefrontostriatal function in this model through both behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Behavioral examination consisted in a temporal bisection task within a supra-second range (2 vs.8 s), which is thought to involve prefrontostriatal networks. In two independent experiments, the behavioral analysis revealed poorer temporal sensitivity as early as 4 months of age, well before detection of overt motor deficits. At a later symptomatic age, animals were impaired in their temporal discriminative behavior. In vivo recording of field potentials in the dorsomedial striatum evoked by stimulation of the prelimbic cortex were studied in 4- to 5-month-old rats. Input/output curves, paired-pulse function, and plasticity induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were assessed. Results showed an altered plasticity, with higher paired-pulse facilitation, enhanced short-term depression, as well as stronger long-term potentiation after TBS in homozygous transgenic rats. Results from the heterozygous animals mostly fell between wild-type and homozygous transgenic rats. Our results suggest that normal plasticity in prefrontostriatal circuits may be necessary for reliable and precise timing behavior. Furthermore, the present study provides the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of a presymptomatic alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in an animal model for Huntington disease and suggests that supra-second timing may be the earliest cognitive dysfunction in HD.",

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of nutritional factors with HD severity. METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional, national multicenter study. Participants were selected from a Spanish cohort of patients who participate in the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN). The frequency of food consumption, caloric and nutrients intake in patients with HD were assessed using validated questionnaires for the Spanish population, and calculated using Alimentaci on and Salud, version 2.0, and the Spanish Dietary Recommended Intakes were used as the gold standard. Disease severity was assessed using the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) and Total Functional Capacity (TFC). Logistic regression models were performed using the TFC as the dependent variable, and the macro-micronutrients as the independent variables, adjusted for age, gender, education, physical activity, and intake of supplements. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty four patients with HD were included (59% women), mean age of 47.41+-14.26 years, median TFC 9 (3-13), median UHDRS motor score of 33.5 (3.75-56), 75.8% with normal-high caloric intake, 55.4% normal BMI, and 54.4% with medium-high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Compared to patients with mild-moderate HD, patients with severe HD had higher caloric intake (p = 0.02), and similar BMI (p = 0.33). Advanced HD was associated with higher intake of water-soluble vitamins (OR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.12-3.85, p = 0.02), and minerals (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.09- 3.19, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An adequate dietary intake prevents against weight loss in patients with advanced HD, but it is not associated with better functional state.",

                    "abstract": "Although neuroprotective strategies and pharmaceutical agents have been initiated in the treatment of numerous disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including trauma, epilepsy, stroke, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,and AIDS dementia, none have yet been applied to the treatment of glaucoma. A prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded number of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene. A hallmark of HD is unintended weight loss, the cause of which is unknown. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of weight loss in HD, we studied its relation to other disease characteristics including motor, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances and CAG repeat number. METHODS: In 517 patients with early stage HD, we applied mixed-effects model analyses to correlate weight changes over 3 years to CAG repeat number and various components of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). We also assessed the relation between CAG repeat number and body weight and caloric intake in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. RESULTS: In patients with HD, mean body mass index decreased with -0.15 units per year (p < 0.001). However, no single UHDRS component, including motor, cognitive, and behavioral scores, was independently associated with the rate of weight loss. Patients with HD with a higher CAG repeat number had a faster rate of weight loss. Similarly, R6/2 mice with a larger CAG repeat length had a lower body weight, whereas caloric intake increased with larger CAG repeat length. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss in Huntington disease (HD) is directly linked to CAG repeat length and is likely to result from a hypermetabolic state. Other signs and symptoms of HD are unlikely to contribute to weight loss in early disease stages. Elucidation of the responsible mechanisms could lead to effective energy-based therapeutics.",

However, the views of people with life-limiting conditions, for whom this issue is likely to have a different resonance, are less well represented. AIM: The purpose of this study was to explore the views of people who live with the inevitability of developing Huntington's disease, a genetically transmitted disease which significantly limits life, on assisted dying. DESIGN: Using thematic analysis methodology, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Seven participants (five women and two men) who were gene positive for Huntington's disease took part in the study. RESULTS: Four themes were extracted: (1) autonomy and kindness in assisted dying: the importance of moral principles; (2) Huntington's disease threatens life and emphasises issues relating to death; (3) dilemmas in decision-making on assisted dying: \"There are no winners\" and (4) the absence of explicit discussion on dying and Huntington's disease: \"Elephants in the room\". CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that talking to patients about assisted death may not cause harm and may even be invited by many patients with Huntington's disease. The perspectives of those who live with Huntington's disease, especially given its extended effects within families, add significant clinical and theoretical insights.",

The study aimed to assess the self-awareness of memory impairment in HD in comparison to advanced Parkinson disease (PD), mild PD and cervical dystonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-awareness was tested in 23 patients with HD by comparing patient and caregiver ratings in reference to clinical control groups (25 patients with advanced PD, 21 with mild PD and 20 with cervical dystonia). Self-awareness was tested using the Self Rating Scale of Memory Functions, which was administered to both the patients and the caregivers. Neuropsychological assessment addressed general cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination), verbal learning (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 15-word list) and mood (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). RESULTS: Patients with HD significantly underestimated their memory dysfunction. Underestimation of memory deficit correlated with disease duration and disease severity in HD. CONCLUSIONS: Huntington disease patients underestimate memory dysfunction. These results add to the previous reports on poor insight in HD in other domains and suggest that anosognosia in HD, albeit usually rather mild, may be a generalized phenomenon.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: This paper is a report of a study of the perceptions of family caregivers regarding the availability and adequacy of health and social care services for their family member with Huntington disease, and to compare findings from these reports in United Kingdom and United States of America samples. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is an inherited neurodegenerative condition. Family members often take responsibility for care of relatives with long-term conditions. Studies have demonstrated there are both positive and negative outcomes for carers. METHODS: During 2006 and 2007, respondents from the United Kingdom (n = 108) and the United States (n = 119) who were caring for a relative affected with Huntington disease completed the Community Health Care Services Scale to identify areas of concern and the extent to which specific issues bothered carers. Data were analysed using statistical tests including chi-square, t-tests and factor analysis. Results were compared between carers in the two cohorts. RESULTS: Three main factors were derived: 'community resources', 'individualized care' and 'knowledge of Huntington disease'. Carers had concerns about the knowledge of healthcare professionals providing care and thought that there were insufficient services to support them and the affected person. There were different challenges for carers when the affected person had a long-term neurodegenerative condition because these carers were also likely to have responsibilities for earning and caring for children. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive facilities and resources are needed to support families affected by long-term complex conditions. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the health needs of carers as well as those of the affected person.",

In particular, the grafted cells can sustain functional recovery in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative conditions including genetic and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood and aging, ischemic stroke, and brain and spinal cord trauma. In a restricted subset of such conditions, cell transplantation has progressed to application in humans in early-stage clinical trials. At the present stage of play, there is clear evidence of clinical efficacy of fetal cell transplants in Parkinson disease (notwithstanding a range of technical difficulties still to be fully resolved), and preliminary claims of promising outcomes in several other severe neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington disease and stroke. Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

                    "abstract": "Cognitive decline precedes motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD). A transgenic rat model for HD carrying only 51 CAG repeats recapitulates the late-onset HD phenotype. Here, we assessed prefrontostriatal function in this model through both behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Behavioral examination consisted in a temporal bisection task within a supra-second range (2 vs.8 s), which is thought to involve prefrontostriatal networks. In two independent experiments, the behavioral analysis revealed poorer temporal sensitivity as early as 4 months of age, well before detection of overt motor deficits. At a later symptomatic age, animals were impaired in their temporal discriminative behavior. In vivo recording of field potentials in the dorsomedial striatum evoked by stimulation of the prelimbic cortex were studied in 4- to 5-month-old rats. Input/output curves, paired-pulse function, and plasticity induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were assessed. Results showed an altered plasticity, with higher paired-pulse facilitation, enhanced short-term depression, as well as stronger long-term potentiation after TBS in homozygous transgenic rats. Results from the heterozygous animals mostly fell between wild-type and homozygous transgenic rats. Our results suggest that normal plasticity in prefrontostriatal circuits may be necessary for reliable and precise timing behavior. Furthermore, the present study provides the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of a presymptomatic alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in an animal model for Huntington disease and suggests that supra-second timing may be the earliest cognitive dysfunction in HD.",

The symptomatic stage of the disease is defined by the onset of motor symptoms. However, psychiatric disturbances, including depression, are common features of HD and can occur a decade before the manifestation of motor symptoms. We used the YAC128 transgenic mice (which develop motor deficits at a later stage, allowing more time to study depressive behaviors without the confounding effects of motor impairment) to test the effects of intranasal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment for 15 days in the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors. Using multiple well-validated behavioral tests, we found that BDNF treatment alleviated anhedonic and depressive-like behaviors in the YAC128 HD mice. Furthermore, we also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effects of BDNF were associated with an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, BDNF treatment only increased cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of wild-type (WT) mice, without altering these parameters in their YAC128 counterparts. Moreover, BDNF treatment did not cause an increase in the number of dendritic branches in the hippocampal DG when compared with animals treated with vehicle. In conclusion, our results suggest that non-invasive administration of BDNF via the intranasal route may have important therapeutic potential for treating mood disturbances in early-symptomatic HD patients.",

Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..). A large number of clinical areas stand as candidates for clinical applications: leukaemia and cancers, cardiac insufficiency and vascular diseases, cartilage and bone repair, ligaments and tendons, liver diseases, ophthalmology, diabetes, neurological diseases (Parkinson, Huntington disease, ..), .. Various aspects of this new regenerative therapeutic medicine are developed in this work.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Laquinimod is an orally dosed immuno-modulator currently under development for Huntington's disease (HD). Preclinical findings suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated. METHODS: In this randomized, phase-1 single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of 21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose. RESULTS: The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24 and Cmax of EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSION: The combination of COC and laquinimod treatment was found to be safe, tolerable, and devoid of any noticeable pharmacokinetic interaction.",

We have taken related literature of making this review article from ScienceDirect, springer, Research gate, PubMed, Sci-finder, etc. The current approaches for treating neurological conditions such as glioblastoma includes chemotherapy or combination anti-retro viral therapy for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or use of anti-Alzheimer drugs during cognitive impairment. These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization, multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted drug delivery with minimal side effects.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Adherence to Mediterranean-type diet (MeDi) may delay onset of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Whether adherence to MeDi affects time to phenoconversion in Huntington disease (HD), a highly penetrant, single-gene disorder, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine if MeDi modifies the time to clinical onset of HD (phenoconversion) in premanifest carriers participating in Prospective Huntington at Risk Observational Study (PHAROS), and to examine the effects of body mass index and caloric intake on time to phenoconversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of 41 Huntington study group sites in the United States and Canada involving 1001 participants enrolled in PHAROS between July 1999 and January 2004 who were followed up every 9 months until 2010. A total of 211 participants aged 26 to 57 years had an expanded CAG repeat length (>= 37). EXPOSURE: A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered 33 months after baseline. We calculated daily gram intake for dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, and alcohol and constructed MeDi scores (0-9); higher scores indicate higher adherence. Demographics, medical history, body mass index, and Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score were collected. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine the association of MeDi and phenoconversion. RESULTS Age, sex, caloric intake, education status, and UHDRS motor scores did not differ among MeDi tertiles (0-3, 4-5, and 6-9). The highest body mass index was associated with the lowest adherence to MeDi. Thirty-one participants phenoconverted. In a model adjusted for age, CAG repeat length, and caloric intake, MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion (P for trend = 0.14 for tertile of MeDi, and P = .22 for continuous MeDi). When individual components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.0-5.57; P = .05) and higher caloric intake (P = .04) were associated with risk of phenoconversion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion; however, higher consumption of dairy products had a 2-fold increased risk and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression in manifest HD). Studies of diet and energy expenditure in premanifest HD may provide data for interventions to modify specific components of diet that may delay the onset of HD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the importance of the Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) and dietary intake as environmental neuroprotective factors in Huntington's disease (HD); so, we evaluated and analyzed the prevalence and factors associated with MeDi adherence, and dietary intake in HD. METHODS: Spanish participants of the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN) Registry study diagnosed with HD or premanifest HD gene carriers were included from June 2012 to August 2013. Self-reported dietary intake was collected by 3-day dietary record, MeDi adherence was assessed by 0-9 range (proposed by Trichopoulou et al.) and, other contributing factors related to nutrition were collected by telephone. Demographics and clinical variables were obtained from the EHDN Registry study database. Association of HD with MeDi adherence and nutritional characteristics were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48 years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range). HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however, quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P = 0.013). Moderate adherence to MeDi, was associated with older participants (OR = 1.19, P = 0.031), lower comorbidity (OR = 0.18, P = 0.018), lower UHDRS motor (OR = 0.90, P = 0.041), and lower risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.02, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In HD the moderate MeDi adherence is associated with better quality of life, lower comorbidity, lower motor impairment and lower risk for abdominal obesity compared to those participants with low MeDi adherence.",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

They also have the potential to accelerate drug discovery in 3 ways. The first involves the delineation of chemical components for efficient reprogramming of patient's blood cells or cells from biopsies, obviating the need for cellular delivery of reprogramming exogenous transgenes, thereby converting hope into reality for patients suffering from degenerative diseases. Patients worldwide stand to benefit from the clinical applicability of iPS cell-based cell replacement therapy for a number of degenerative diseases. The second is the potential for discovering novel drugs in a high throughput manner using patient-specific iPS cell-derived somatic cells possessing the etiology of the specific disease. The third is their suitability for toxicological testing of drugs and environmental factors. This review focuses on these potential applications of iPS cells with special emphasis on recent updates of iPS cell research contributing to the accelerated drug discovery.",

Authentic STR progenitors can be collected from the fetal putative striatum, or whole ganglionic eminence (WGE), but these tissues remain impractical for widespread clinical application, and alternative donor sources are required. Here we begin exploring the possibility that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from WGE may retain an epigenetic memory of their tissue of origin, which could enhance their ability to differentiate into STR cells. RESULTS: We generate four iPSC lines from human WGE (hWGE) and establish that they have a capacity similar to human embryonic stem cells with regard to their ability to differentiate toward an STR phenotype, as measured by expression and demethylation of key STR genes, while maintaining an overall different methylome. Finally, we demonstrate that these STR-differentiated hWGE iPSCs share characteristics with hWGE (i.e., authentic STR tissues) both in vitro and following transplantation into an HD model. Overall, iPSCs derived from human WGE show promise as a donor source for CRT for HD.",

                    "abstract": "Transplants of cells and tissues to the central nervous system of adult mammals can, under appropriate conditions, survive, integrate, and function. In particular, the grafted cells can sustain functional recovery in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative conditions including genetic and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood and aging, ischemic stroke, and brain and spinal cord trauma. In a restricted subset of such conditions, cell transplantation has progressed to application in humans in early-stage clinical trials. At the present stage of play, there is clear evidence of clinical efficacy of fetal cell transplants in Parkinson disease (notwithstanding a range of technical difficulties still to be fully resolved), and preliminary claims of promising outcomes in several other severe neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington disease and stroke. Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

This was followed by increased production of neurotoxic metabolite hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) in the striatum of symptomatic mice. We therefore hypothesized that the chronic Ido1 induction in the striatum of YAC128 mice leads to increased neurotoxicity in this mouse model; based on this hypothesis, we predicted that the absence of Ido1 expression would result in decreased sensitivity to neurotoxicity in mice. The work described in this brief communication will include the characterization of Ido(-/-) striatum in terms of enzymatic expression and activity in the first step of the pathway. Additionally, we assessed the sensitivity of the striatum to excitotoxic insult in the absence of Ido1 expression in the striatum of constitutive Ido1 null mice (Ido(-/-)) and demonstrated that Ido(-/-) mice are less sensitive to QA-induced striatal neurotoxicity. Finally, through measurement of kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites in Ido(-/-) mice, we showed decreased levels of 3-HK in the striatum of these mice. This study suggests that the inhibition of the first step in the KP may be neuroprotective and should be considered as a potential therapeutic target in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

In the present study, we used small-animal PET to characterize the expression of molecular targets in the recently reported HD animal model, the zQ175 mouse model. Methods: Male heterozygous zQ175 (Htttm1Mfc/190JChdi, CHDI-81003003) and wild-type (WT, C57BL/6J) animals were imaged with the dopamine D2 receptor radioligand 11C-raclopride, the PDE10A radioligand 18F-MNI-659, the dopamine D1 receptor radioligand 11C-NNC 112, and the 5-HT2A radioligand 11C-MDL 100907 at 6 and 9 mo of age. The outcome measure was the binding potential (BPND), using the cerebellum as the reference region. Selected regions of interest were the striatum for all radioligands and additionally the striatum, rostral cortex, caudal cortex, and hippocampus for 11C-NNC 112 and 11C-MDL 100907. Results: At 6 mo of age, the BPND in the striatum was lower in zQ175 than WT animals by 40% for 11C-raclopride, by 52% for 18F-MNI-659, by 28% for 11C-NNC, and by 11% for 11C-MDL 100907. In the rostral cortex, D1 receptor binding was 22% lower in zQ175 than WT animals. We found an overall reduction in D1 and 5-HT2A binding in the hippocampus of zQ175 compared with WT animals. The BPND of 11C-MDL 100907 in the caudal cortex was also lower in zQ175 WT animals. At 9 mo, there was a slight further reduction of D1, D2, and 5-HT2ABPND in the striatum, whereas PDE10A reached a plateau. Cortical markers were also slightly further decreased at 9 mo in zQ175 animals. Conclusion: Our study indicates a marked reduction of ligand binding to D1 and D2 and 5-HT2A receptors as well as loss of PDE10A enzyme in the striatum of zQ175 mice as compared with WT animals, in agreement with data obtained in clinical PET studies of patients with HD.

In the present study, we used small-animal PET to characterize the expression of molecular targets in the recently reported HD animal model, the zQ175 mouse model. Methods: Male heterozygous zQ175 (Htttm1Mfc/190JChdi, CHDI-81003003) and wild-type (WT, C57BL/6J) animals were imaged with the dopamine D2 receptor radioligand 11C-raclopride, the PDE10A radioligand 18F-MNI-659, the dopamine D1 receptor radioligand 11C-NNC 112, and the 5-HT2A radioligand 11C-MDL 100907 at 6 and 9 mo of age. The outcome measure was the binding potential (BPND), using the cerebellum as the reference region. Selected regions of interest were the striatum for all radioligands and additionally the striatum, rostral cortex, caudal cortex, and hippocampus for 11C-NNC 112 and 11C-MDL 100907. Results: At 6 mo of age, the BPND in the striatum was lower in zQ175 than WT animals by 40% for 11C-raclopride, by 52% for 18F-MNI-659, by 28% for 11C-NNC, and by 11% for 11C-MDL 100907. In the rostral cortex, D1 receptor binding was 22% lower in zQ175 than WT animals. We found an overall reduction in D1 and 5-HT2A binding in the hippocampus of zQ175 compared with WT animals. The BPND of 11C-MDL 100907 in the caudal cortex was also lower in zQ175 WT animals. At 9 mo, there was a slight further reduction of D1, D2, and 5-HT2ABPND in the striatum, whereas PDE10A reached a plateau. Cortical markers were also slightly further decreased at 9 mo in zQ175 animals. Conclusion: Our study indicates a marked reduction of ligand binding to D1 and D2 and 5-HT2A receptors as well as loss of PDE10A enzyme in the striatum of zQ175 mice as compared with WT animals, in agreement with data obtained in clinical PET studies of patients with HD. The zQ175 mouse model recapitulates the expression pattern seen in humans with HD and may have value in further elucidating pathophysiologic events and therapeutic strategies.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate CAG repeat length (36-39) of the Huntingtin gene, HTT. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation 0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).",

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of latrepirdine on cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Sixty-four research centers in Australia, Europe, and North America. PATIENTS Four hundred three patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and baseline cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10-26). INTERVENTION Latrepirdine (20 mg) vs matching placebo administered orally 3 times daily for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary outcome measures were cognition as measured by the change in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to week 26 and global function at week 26 as measured by the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview, which ranges from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included behavior, daily function, motor function, and safety. RESULTS The mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination score among participants randomized to latrepirdine (1.5-point improvement) did not differ significantly from that among participants randomized to placebo (1.3-point improvement) (P=.39). Similarly, the distribution of the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview did not differ significantly among those randomized to latrepirdine compared with placebo (P=.84). No significant treatment effects were detected on the secondary efficacy outcome measures. The incidence of adverse events was similar between those randomized to latrepirdine (68.5%) and placebo (68.0%). CONCLUSION In patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and cognitive impairment, treatment with latrepirdine for 6 months was safe and well tolerated but did not improve cognition or global function relative to placebo.

We have taken related literature of making this review article from ScienceDirect, springer, Research gate, PubMed, Sci-finder, etc. The current approaches for treating neurological conditions such as glioblastoma includes chemotherapy or combination anti-retro viral therapy for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or use of anti-Alzheimer drugs during cognitive impairment. These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization, multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted drug delivery with minimal side effects.",

                    "abstract": "Although neuroprotective strategies and pharmaceutical agents have been initiated in the treatment of numerous disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including trauma, epilepsy, stroke, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,and AIDS dementia, none have yet been applied to the treatment of glaucoma. A prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is an inherited neurodegenerative condition. Family members often take responsibility for care of relatives with long-term conditions. Studies have demonstrated there are both positive and negative outcomes for carers. METHODS: During 2006 and 2007, respondents from the United Kingdom (n = 108) and the United States (n = 119) who were caring for a relative affected with Huntington disease completed the Community Health Care Services Scale to identify areas of concern and the extent to which specific issues bothered carers. Data were analysed using statistical tests including chi-square, t-tests and factor analysis. Results were compared between carers in the two cohorts. RESULTS: Three main factors were derived: 'community resources', 'individualized care' and 'knowledge of Huntington disease'. Carers had concerns about the knowledge of healthcare professionals providing care and thought that there were insufficient services to support them and the affected person. There were different challenges for carers when the affected person had a long-term neurodegenerative condition because these carers were also likely to have responsibilities for earning and caring for children. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive facilities and resources are needed to support families affected by long-term complex conditions. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the health needs of carers as well as those of the affected person.",

                    "abstract": "Some improvements are presented for the affected-pedigree-member method of linkage analysis, which is a generalization of the sib-pair method. The test statistic is extended to include contrasts between affected and unaffected pedigree members, so that it now utilizes marker information from all typed pedigree members rather than just the typed affected members. Computer simulation using a sample pedigree of 14 individuals shows that this modification can substantially increase statistical power where there is a direct association between marker variation and disease and where disease risk is elevated in carriers of the disease allele. Data on Huntington disease in 16 British families, which were analyzed previously using only the affected individuals, are reanalyzed with the unaffected individuals included. Strong rejection of the null hypothesis of no association between Huntington disease and the HindIII polymorphism is confirmed, but the particular families in which the association is significant differs from that obtained through an analysis based only on affected individuals and reflects more closely the results obtained from a lod-score analysis. The test statistic is also modified here to incorporate contrasts between individuals of zero kinship, if needed. This enables contrasts between individuals from different pedigrees, as well as contrasts involving individuals sampled from the general population, to be incorporated into the test of association. For population data, the methodology reduces to a type of contingency-table analysis, in which the rows of the table correspond to different marker-locus genotypes and in which the two columns categorize subjects into an \"affected\" group versus an \"unaffected,\" or control, group. This aspect of the methodology is illustrated using two population data sets, the first relating APO-E genotype to the frequency of individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and the second relating APO-B genotype to the frequency of coronary artery disease. The present methodology confirms the lack of association between marker and disease in the former data set and confirms the presence of association in the latter. Finally, the methodology is formulated here in terms of ordinary, multiperson kinship coefficients rather than in terms of the generalized kinship coefficients originally proposed. This greatly reduces the number of coefficients to be calculated, thereby enhancing the computational efficiency of the computer program.",

Abnormal responses to anesthesia have been reported in case reports and raised concerns regarding the safety of anesthesia in this patient population. METHODS: We performed a computerized search of the Mayo Clinic medical records database searching for patients with HD who underwent general anesthesia. Medical records were reviewed for anesthetic technique, medications used, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: We identified 11 patients with genetically confirmed HD who underwent 17 general anesthetics. Psychiatric medication use was common, with 6 patients using antipsychotics, 7 patients using antidepressants, and 3 patients using benzodiazepines. Succinylcholine was used in 7 anesthetics, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs in 11 anesthetics, all without adverse effects. Patients had normal responses to induction and maintenance of anesthesia without adverse effects. Serious postoperative complications did not occur. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous case reports, we found that patients with HD have normal responses to general anesthesia. However, the anesthesiologist should be aware of interactions between anesthetics and psychiatric medications frequently used by these patients. Measures should also be taken to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration because bulbar dysfunction may be a manifestation of this disease.",

Whether adherence to MeDi affects time to phenoconversion in Huntington disease (HD), a highly penetrant, single-gene disorder, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine if MeDi modifies the time to clinical onset of HD (phenoconversion) in premanifest carriers participating in Prospective Huntington at Risk Observational Study (PHAROS), and to examine the effects of body mass index and caloric intake on time to phenoconversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of 41 Huntington study group sites in the United States and Canada involving 1001 participants enrolled in PHAROS between July 1999 and January 2004 who were followed up every 9 months until 2010. A total of 211 participants aged 26 to 57 years had an expanded CAG repeat length (>= 37). EXPOSURE: A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered 33 months after baseline. We calculated daily gram intake for dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, and alcohol and constructed MeDi scores (0-9); higher scores indicate higher adherence. Demographics, medical history, body mass index, and Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score were collected. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine the association of MeDi and phenoconversion. RESULTS Age, sex, caloric intake, education status, and UHDRS motor scores did not differ among MeDi tertiles (0-3, 4-5, and 6-9). The highest body mass index was associated with the lowest adherence to MeDi. Thirty-one participants phenoconverted. In a model adjusted for age, CAG repeat length, and caloric intake, MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion (P for trend = 0.14 for tertile of MeDi, and P = .22 for continuous MeDi). When individual components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.0-5.57; P = .05) and higher caloric intake (P = .04) were associated with risk of phenoconversion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion; however, higher consumption of dairy products had a 2-fold increased risk and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression in manifest HD). Studies of diet and energy expenditure in premanifest HD may provide data for interventions to modify specific components of diet that may delay the onset of HD.",

These data are part of a survey of 682 geneticists in 19 nations. Of 490 U.S. geneticists asked to participate, 295 (60%) returned anonymous detailed questionnaires. There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they would give directive counseling. Women were more likely than men to say that they would perform prenatal diagnosis for maternal anxiety or for sex selection.",

METHODS: We examined factor structure (confirmatory factor analysis), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), floor and ceiling effects, convergent validity (Pearson correlations), and known-groups validity (multivariate analysis). RESULTS: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis replicated the six-factor latent model that reflects the six separate scales within the WHODAS 2.0 (understanding and communicating; getting around; self-care; getting along with others; life activities; participation). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.94, suggesting good internal consistency reliability. The WHODAS demonstrated a ceiling effect for 19.5 % of participants; there were no floor effects. There was evidence for convergent validity; the WHODAS demonstrated moderate significant correlations with other general measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL; i.e., RAND-12, EQ5D). Multivariate analyses indicated that late-stage HD participants indicated poorer HRQOL than both early-stage HD and prodromal HD participants for all HRQOL measures. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide support for both the reliability and validity of the WHODAS 2.0 in individuals with HD.",

While the analysis points to the many similarities between taking care of HD patients and those suffering from other neurodegenerative disorders, it also emphasizes the factors associated with HD that are not present in other diseases: early onset, severity of symptoms, prolonged trajectory, its genetic, i.e. hereditary character and social ignorance of HD. It concludes that while in medical setting the HD patient is the one who draws professional attention, it is often the unaffected family caregiver who needs the most attention, support and help. ",

                    "abstract": "Caring for a person with chronic disease often rests on the patient's family. Nevertheless, most studies on the needs, quality of life and caregiver burden focus on different types of dementia, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke, cancer or mental illnesses. Less attention has been paid to informal caregivers of patients with Huntington's disease (HD). Meanwhile, psychosocial implications of HD are much more serious and wide-ranging. Thus, this paper aims to review the literature on the costs of caring for a person with HD (pHD). The review identifies the aspects of caregiving that are the most burdensome to family caregivers: negative experience with health and social care services, dissatisfaction with caregiving role, concern over children, loss of meaningful relationship with pHD, family breakdown and loss of social contacts and decrease in health. It also describes strategies of coping with HD.

                    "abstract": "OBJECT: Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and morbidity in young adults, no effective pharmaceutical treatment is available. By inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively, lithium and valproate (VPA) have beneficial effects in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in an excitotoxic neuronal model and in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, and stroke, combined treatment with lithium and VPA produces more robust neuroprotective effects than treatment with either agent alone. Building on previous work that establishes that therapeutic doses of either lithium or VPA have beneficial effects in mouse models of TBI, this study evaluated the effects of combined treatment with subeffective doses of lithium and VPA in a mouse model of TBI. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent TBI and were subsequently treated with lithium, VPA, or a combination of lithium and VPA 15 minutes post-TBI and once daily thereafter for up to 3 weeks; all doses were subeffective (1 mEq/kg of lithium and 200 mg/kg of VPA). Assessed parameters included lesion volume via H & E staining; blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity via immunoglobulin G extravasation; neurodegeneration via Fluoro-Jade B staining; motor coordination via a beam-walk test; and protein levels of acetylhistone H3, phospho-GSK-3beta, and beta-catenin via Western blotting. RESULTS: Posttrauma treatment with combined subeffective doses of lithium and VPA significantly reduced lesion volume, attenuated BBB disruption, and mitigated hippocampal neurodegeneration 3 days after TBI. As expected, subeffective doses of lithium or VPA alone did not have these beneficial effects. Combined treatment also improved motor coordination starting from Day 7 and persisting at least 21 days after TBI. Acetylation of histone H3, an index of HDAC inhibition, was robustly increased by the combined treatment 3 days after TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Cotreatment with subeffective doses of lithium and VPA significantly attenuated TBI-induced brain lesion, BBB disruption, and neurodegeneration, and robustly improved long-term functional recovery. These findings suggest that potentiating histone acetylation by HDAC inhibition is probably part of the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects associated with this combined treatment for TBI. Because both lithium and VPA have a long history of safe clinical use, the results suggest that using a combination of these 2 agents at subtherapeutic doses to treat patients with TBI may also reduce side effects and enhance tolerability.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Adherence to Mediterranean-type diet (MeDi) may delay onset of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Whether adherence to MeDi affects time to phenoconversion in Huntington disease (HD), a highly penetrant, single-gene disorder, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine if MeDi modifies the time to clinical onset of HD (phenoconversion) in premanifest carriers participating in Prospective Huntington at Risk Observational Study (PHAROS), and to examine the effects of body mass index and caloric intake on time to phenoconversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of 41 Huntington study group sites in the United States and Canada involving 1001 participants enrolled in PHAROS between July 1999 and January 2004 who were followed up every 9 months until 2010. A total of 211 participants aged 26 to 57 years had an expanded CAG repeat length (>= 37). EXPOSURE: A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered 33 months after baseline. We calculated daily gram intake for dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, and alcohol and constructed MeDi scores (0-9); higher scores indicate higher adherence. Demographics, medical history, body mass index, and Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score were collected. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine the association of MeDi and phenoconversion. RESULTS Age, sex, caloric intake, education status, and UHDRS motor scores did not differ among MeDi tertiles (0-3, 4-5, and 6-9). The highest body mass index was associated with the lowest adherence to MeDi. Thirty-one participants phenoconverted. In a model adjusted for age, CAG repeat length, and caloric intake, MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion (P for trend = 0.14 for tertile of MeDi, and P = .22 for continuous MeDi). When individual components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.0-5.57; P = .05) and higher caloric intake (P = .04) were associated with risk of phenoconversion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion; however, higher consumption of dairy products had a 2-fold increased risk and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression in manifest HD). Studies of diet and energy expenditure in premanifest HD may provide data for interventions to modify specific components of diet that may delay the onset of HD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).",

Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.",

He had depression, poor cognitive function, choreiform movements, difficulty pronouncing words, and difficulty walking. His symptoms had worsened markedly over several months. Chorea lead to genetic testing that confirmed a diagnosis of Huntington Disease (HD). A CT scan of the head showed wider ventricles than is typical of HD. The head CT and gait change suggested normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Lumbar puncture (LP) led to improved neuropsychologic test scores and walking thereby supporting the diagnosis of NPH. Surprisingly, the LP also led to an 80% improvement of chorea. There are two other reports of an association between HD and NPH. NPH should be considered in HD patients with atypical symptoms, such as the inability to walk or rapid progression, as its treatment may lead to improved cognition, gait, and chorea.",

Chorea, ballism and dystonia are prototypical examples of hyperkinetic movement disorders. In our previous study, normal rats without nigro-striatal lesion were rendered hypokinetic with hyperpolarizing currents injected into the STN. Therefore, modulation of the firing pattern by injection of a hyperpolarizing current into the STN could be an effective treatment for hyperkinetic movement disorders. We investigated the effect of injecting a hyperpolarizing current into the STNs of two different types of hyperkinetic animal models and a patient with an otherwise uncontrollable hyperkinetic disorder. The two animal models included levodopa-induced hyperkinetic movement in parkinsonian rats (L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia model) and hyperkinesia induced by an intrastriatal injection of 3-nitropropionic acid (Huntington disease model), covering neurodegeneration-related as well as neurotoxin-induced derangement in the cortico-subcortical re-entrant loops. Delivering hyperpolarizing currents into the STN readily alleviated the hyperkinetic behaviors in the two animal models and in the clinical case, with an evident increase in subthalamic burst discharges in electrophysiological recordings. Application of a hyperpolarizing current into the STN via a Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode could be an effective general therapy for a wide spectrum of hyperkinetic movement disorders.",

                    "abstract": "Neurological disorders are one of the major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

NSCs are defined as CNS progenitor cells that have the capacity for self-renewal and multipotent potential to become neurons or glial cells. Recent studies have shown that NSCs isolated from mammalian CNS including human can be propagated in vitro and then implanted into the brain of animal models of human neurological disorders. Recently, we have generated clonally derived immortalized human NSC cell lines via a retroviral vector encoded with v-myc oncogene. One of the human NSC lines, HB1.F3, was utilized in stem-cell based therapy in animal models of human neurological disorders. When F3 human NSCs were implanted into the brain of murine models of lysosomal storage diseases, stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease or stroke, implanted F3 NSCs were found to migrate to the lesion sites, differentiate into neurons and glial cells, and restore functional deficits found in these neurological disorders. In animal models of brain tumors, F3 NSCs could deliver a bioactive therapeutically relevant molecules to effect a significant anti-tumor response intracranial tumor mass. Since these genetically engineered human NSCs are immortalized and continuously multiplying, there would be limitless supply of human neurons for treatment for patients suffering from neurological disorders including stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The promising field of stem cell research as it applies to regenerative medicine is still in infancy, but its potential appears limitless, and we are blessed to be involved in this exciting realm of research.",

                    "abstract": "A neurogenetic disorder is defined as a clinical disease caused by a defect in one or more genes which affect the differentiation and function of the neuroectoderm and its derivatives. Genetic findings in various neurogenetic disorders are discussed. Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant disorders caused by the expansion of trinucleotides (CAG) within disease genes. The CAG expansions appear to result in a gain of gene function. Prenatal, presymptomatic, and differential diagnostic tests are based on the detection of the repeat expansions. Point mutations within disease genes result in many additional neurogenetic disorders. An autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various types of craniosynostotic syndromes are described. The mutations in the disease genes also appear to result in a gain of gene function. Molecular diagnosis in these disorders is based on the direct examination of the mutated gene by methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing. In many neurogenetic disorders the disease gene has not yet been identified. Here molecular diagnosis relies on indirect approaches based on methods such as the analysis of linkage and of allelic association. Hereditary forms of dystonia are presented as examples. Common sporadic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases frequently have multifactorial causes. Investigations into the molecular basis and the development of diagnostic tests in these two important diseases are discussed. At present no curative therapies exist in neurogenetic disorders. Gene therapeutic approaches, however, provide promise for a cure in at least some of these diseases. Basic principles of gene therapy are explained and attempts at gene therapy in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are described. Finally, some of the many obstacles are summarized that must be overcome before gene therapy becomes feasible in most monogenic neurological diseases.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For reasons of cost and ethical concerns, models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) are currently being developed in farm animals, as an alternative to non-human primates. Developing reliable methods of testing cognitive function is essential to determining the usefulness of such models. Nevertheless, cognitive testing of farm animal species presents a unique set of challenges. The primary aims of this study were to develop and validate a mobile operant system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing of sheep. NEW METHOD: We designed a semi-automated testing system with the capability of presenting stimuli (visual, auditory) and reward at six spatial locations. Fourteen normal sheep were used to validate the system using a two-choice visual discrimination task. Four stages of training devised to acclimatise animals to the system are also presented. RESULTS: All sheep progressed rapidly through the training stages, over eight sessions. All sheep learned the 2CVDT and performed at least one reversal stage. The mean number of trials the sheep took to reach criterion in the first acquisition learning was 13.9+-1.5 and for the reversal learning was 19.1+-1.8. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): This is the first mobile semi-automated operant system developed for testing cognitive function in sheep. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed and validated an automated operant behavioural testing system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing in sheep and other medium-sized quadrupeds, such as pigs and dogs. Sheep performance in the two-choice visual discrimination task was very similar to that reported for non-human primates and strongly supports the use of farm animals as pre-clinical models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).",

The purposes of these analyses were to (1) determine the prevalence of EOL plans, including advance directives (ADs) among persons across 3 stages of Huntington disease (HD) and (2) examine factors associated with having ADs in this sample. METHODS: Data are from 503 participants in the HD Quality of Life study. Participants completed an online health-related quality-of-life survey that included questions regarding EOL planning and self-reported HD symptoms. Frequencies were calculated for EOL planning by the HD stage. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to identify variables associated with having ADs. RESULTS: A total of 38.2% of participants stated they had ADs and fewer than half had other EOL plans. Being older, increased HD stage, more years of education, lower anxiety, more swallowing symptoms, and higher meaning and purpose were associated with having ADs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ADs in our sample is comparable to the general US population, but surprisingly low, considering the severity and long disease course of HD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health-care providers should develop specific interventions early in the disease process to increase ADs in this population.",

When expressed intracellularly in mammalian cells these intracellular antibodies, or intrabodies, have the potential to alter the folding, interactions, modifications, or subcellular localization of their targets. These reagents have previously been developed as therapeutics against cancer and HIV. Since misfolded and accumulated intracellular proteins characterize several major neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease (HD) and Parkinson disease, these disorders are prime candidates for intrabody therapy. In this article we review the extension of intrabody technology to the nervous system. Studies of HD have been used to develop the approach and anti-synuclein strategies are in the early stages of development. Such neurodegenerative diseases are therefore poised for engineered antibody approaches, which can provide a pipeline of novel therapeutics and new drug discovery tools.",

Reducing the expression of mHTT is therefore an attractive therapy for HD. However, wild-type HTT protein is essential for development and has critical roles in maintaining neuronal health. Therapies for HD that reduce wild-type HTT may therefore generate unintended negative consequences. We have identified single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) targets in the human HD population for the disease-specific targeting of the HTT gene. Using primary cells from patients with HD and the transgenic YAC18 and BACHD mouse lines, we developed antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) molecules that potently and selectively silence mHTT at both exonic and intronic SNP sites. Modification of these ASOs with S-constrained-ethyl (cET) motifs significantly improves potency while maintaining allele selectively in vitro. The developed ASO is potent and selective for mHTT in vivo after delivery to the mouse brain. We demonstrate that potent and selective allele-specific knockdown of the mHTT protein can be achieved at therapeutically relevant SNP sites using ASOs in vitro and in vivo.",

These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Huntington disease (HD) is an incurable terminal disease. Thus, end of life (EOL) concerns are common in these individuals. A quantitative measure of EOL concerns in HD would enable a better understanding of how these concerns impact health-related quality of life. Therefore, we developed new measures of EOL for use in HD. METHODS: An EOL item pool of 45 items was field tested in 507 individuals with prodromal or manifest HD. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA, respectively) were conducted to establish unidimensional item pools. Item response theory (IRT) and differential item functioning analyses were applied to the identified unidimensional item pools to select the final items. RESULTS: EFA and CFA supported two separate unidimensional sets of items: Concern with Death and Dying (16 items), and Meaning and Purpose (14 items). IRT and DIF supported the retention of 12 Concern with Death and Dying items and 4 Meaning and Purpose items. IRT data supported the development of both a computer adaptive test (CAT) and a 6-item, static short form for Concern with Death and Dying. CONCLUSION: The HDQLIFE Concern with Death and Dying CAT and corresponding 6-item short form, and the 4-item calibrated HDQLIFE Meaning and Purpose scale demonstrate excellent psychometric properties. These new measures have the potential to provide clinically meaningful information about end-of-life preferences and concerns to clinicians and researchers working with individuals with HD. In addition, these measures may also be relevant and useful for other terminal conditions.",

The heat shock protein 90 and 70 (Hsp90/Hsp70) chaperone machinery is a key component of cellular protein quality control, playing a role in the regulation of folding, aggregation, and degradation of polyQ proteins. The ability of Hsp70 to facilitate disaggregation and degradation of misfolded proteins makes it an attractive therapeutic target in polyQ diseases. Genetic studies have demonstrated that manipulation of Hsp70 and related co-chaperones can enhance the disaggregation and/or degradation of misfolded proteins in models of polyQ disease. Therefore, the development of small molecules that enhance Hsp70 activity is of great interest. However, it is still unclear if currently available Hsp70 modulators can selectively enhance disaggregation or degradation of misfolded proteins without perturbing other Hsp70 functions essential for cellular homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), developed to assess Huntington patients' clinical capacities, does not differentiate adequately in later stages of the disease. A scale easy to administer by nursing personnel for progression of the disease in later stages was needed. METHOD: Two pilot questionnaires preceded the final version of the BOSH. Observers administered the final version twice independently on 91 patients in 4 nursing homes. RESULTS: The BOSH contains 32 items in 3 subscales: 1) activities of daily living (ADL), 2) social-cognitive functioning, and 3) mental rigidity and aggression. Internal and interrater reliabilities were between 0.83 and 0.95. Rigidity and aggression become more frequent as the disease progresses; later on, this behavior diminishes. Social-cognitive capabilities deteriorate more rapidly in later stages. CONCLUSIONS: This study sought to develop a scale for assessing behaviors and individual differences in later stages of HD. The findings support the use of the BOSH in identifying these behaviors and differences.",

RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48 years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range). HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however, quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P = 0.013).

These anomalies include bioenergetic defect, respiratory chain-induced oxidative stress, defects of mitochondrial dynamics, increase sensitivity to apoptosis, and accumulation of damaged mitochondria with instable mitochondrial DNA. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited mitochondrial disorders but most have no effective therapies. The development of new metabolic treatments will be useful not only for rare mitochondrial disorders but also for the wide spectrum of common age-related neurodegenerative diseases shown to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. A better understanding of the mitochondrial regulating pathways raised several promising perspectives of neuroprotection. This review focuses on the pharmacological approaches to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis, the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy, scavenging free radicals and also dietary measures such as ketogenic diet.",

Environmental enrichment has been used to slow processes leading to ageing and neurodegenerative diseases including HD. Phenolic phytochemicals including anthocyanins have also been shown to improve brain function in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of anthocyanin dietary supplementation and environmental enrichment on behavioural phenotypes and brain cholesterol metabolic alterations in the R6/1 mouse model of HD. METHODS: R6/1 HD mice and their wild-type littermate controls were randomised into the different experimental conditions, involving either environmentally enriched versus standard housing conditions, or anthocyanin versus control diet. Motor dysfunction was assessed from 6 to 26 weeks using the RotaRod and the hind-paw clasping tests. Gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify a broad range of sterols in the striatum and cortex of R6/1 HD mice. RESULTS: Anthocyanin dietary supplementation delayed the onset of motor dysfunction in female HD mice. Environmental enrichment improved motor function and the hind paw clasping phenotype in male HD mice only. These mice also had lower levels of cholesterol oxidation products in the cortex compared to standard-housed mice. CONCLUSION: Both anthocyanin supplementation and environmental enrichment are able to improve the motor dysfunction phenotype of R6/1 mice, however the effectiveness of these interventions was different between the two sexes. The interventions examined did not alter brain cholesterol metabolic deficits that have been reported previously in this mouse model of HD.",

Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

NSCs are defined as CNS progenitor cells that have the capacity for self-renewal and multipotent potential to become neurons or glial cells. Recent studies have shown that NSCs isolated from mammalian CNS including human can be propagated in vitro and then implanted into the brain of animal models of human neurological disorders. Recently, we have generated clonally derived immortalized human NSC cell lines via a retroviral vector encoded with v-myc oncogene. One of the human NSC lines, HB1.F3, was utilized in stem-cell based therapy in animal models of human neurological disorders. When F3 human NSCs were implanted into the brain of murine models of lysosomal storage diseases, stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease or stroke, implanted F3 NSCs were found to migrate to the lesion sites, differentiate into neurons and glial cells, and restore functional deficits found in these neurological disorders. In animal models of brain tumors, F3 NSCs could deliver a bioactive therapeutically relevant molecules to effect a significant anti-tumor response intracranial tumor mass. Since these genetically engineered human NSCs are immortalized and continuously multiplying, there would be limitless supply of human neurons for treatment for patients suffering from neurological disorders including stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The promising field of stem cell research as it applies to regenerative medicine is still in infancy, but its potential appears limitless, and we are blessed to be involved in this exciting realm of research.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review. RESULTS: Dementia, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease are the neurological diseases that most frequently motivate requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Requests related to dementia constitute the largest group, are growing, and raise additional ethical and legal issues due to these patients' diminished decision-making capacity. In some countries, the ratios of euthanasia requests to all cases of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, or Huntington disease are higher than for any other disease.

These data are part of a survey of 682 geneticists in 19 nations. Of 490 U.S. geneticists asked to participate, 295 (60%) returned anonymous detailed questionnaires. There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they would give directive counseling. Women were more likely than men to say that they would perform prenatal diagnosis for maternal anxiety or for sex selection.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

In animal models, effects of LEV are observed in basal ganglia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of LEV in reducing involuntary movements in subjects affected by Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: This was a single-center, short-term, open-label, controlled study. Patients had LEV as add-on therapy for 6 months. In the first visit patients were rated according to the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale. Every 2 months they were submitted to all these tests. LEV was added at the dose of 500 mg twice daily for the first 2 months and then the dosage was increased until 1000 mg twice daily for the next 4 more months. The authors enrolled 22 patients: 15 were assigned to the LEV group and 7 were enrolled as control subjects. RESULTS: No serious adverse events were experienced by the treated patients. After 6 months of treatment patients on LEV showed a significant reduction of involuntary movements, with a slight improvement of functional capacity compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Results of this short-term, prospective, controlled study indicates that in HD patients, LEV is effective in reducing involuntary movements, thus improving the quality of life.",

Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea, was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea control. Interventions: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales. Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled. Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment. Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1 and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively maintained chorea control.",

The presence of this mutant protein is correlated with the characteristic loss of striatal neurons and the clinical manifestation of HD. Currently there is no effective treatment for the associated cell death. The aim of this study was to evaluate an innovative strategy combining RNA interference (RNAi) and gene transfer via the nonviral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system to down-regulate Htt expression. siRNA expression vectors were designed to target exons 1, 4, 6, and 62 of the human htt gene. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to quantify Htt mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in human cell lines. The results indicated that selected siRNA constructs significantly decreased Htt mRNA and protein levels relative to controls. In addition, SB transposition of the siRNA constructs into the genome reduced long-term protein expression of Htt by approximately 90%. The combination of siRNA, the SB transposon, and an accurate transgenic mouse model may permit evaluation of this approach in preventing the pathogenesis associated with expression of mutant Htt.",

The first involves the delineation of chemical components for efficient reprogramming of patient's blood cells or cells from biopsies, obviating the need for cellular delivery of reprogramming exogenous transgenes, thereby converting hope into reality for patients suffering from degenerative diseases. Patients worldwide stand to benefit from the clinical applicability of iPS cell-based cell replacement therapy for a number of degenerative diseases. The second is the potential for discovering novel drugs in a high throughput manner using patient-specific iPS cell-derived somatic cells possessing the etiology of the specific disease.

Preclinical findings suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated. METHODS: In this randomized, phase-1 single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of 21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose. RESULTS: The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24 and Cmax of EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event. CONCLUSION: The combination of COC and laquinimod treatment was found to be safe, tolerable, and devoid of any noticeable pharmacokinetic interaction.",

Enhancing autophagy to remove impaired mitochondria and toxic protein aggregation is an essential component of PD treatment. In particular, activation of autophagy confers neuroprotection in cellular and preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment in mice with established PD and evaluated the relationship between EA, autophagy, and different neurons in the mouse brain. We report that EA improves PD motor symptoms in mice and enhances (1) autophagy initiation (increased Beclin 1), (2) autophagosome biogenesis (increased Atg5, Atg7, Atg9A, Atg12, Atg16L, Atg3, and LC3-II), (3) autophagy flux/substrate degradation (decreased p62), and (4) mitophagy (increased PINK1 and DJ-1) in neurons of the substantia nigra, striatum, hippocampus, and cortex (affected brain areas of PD, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer's disease). EA enhances autophagy initiation, autophagosome biogenesis, mitophagy, and autophagy flux/substrate degradation in certain brain areas. Our findings are the first to show that EA regulates neuronal autophagy and suggest that this convenient, inexpensive treatment has exciting therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders.",

Catatonia is an underdiagnosed psychomotor syndrome often associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, but it has rarely been documented in patients with HD. Catatonia usually responds to standard treatment with benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy; however, this patient's catatonic syndrome did not improve until we augmented the standard treatment with amantadine and levodopa. The underlying pathophysiology and a neurochemical hypothesis of HD and catatonia can explain their comorbidity and the refractoriness of catatonia to treatment. Both conditions are linked to dysregulation of neurotransmitters in the striatocortical and corticocortical pathways. This understanding may serve as a guide for the use of nonstandard treatments.

                    "abstract": "Cognitive decline precedes motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD). A transgenic rat model for HD carrying only 51 CAG repeats recapitulates the late-onset HD phenotype. Here, we assessed prefrontostriatal function in this model through both behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Behavioral examination consisted in a temporal bisection task within a supra-second range (2 vs.8 s), which is thought to involve prefrontostriatal networks. In two independent experiments, the behavioral analysis revealed poorer temporal sensitivity as early as 4 months of age, well before detection of overt motor deficits. At a later symptomatic age, animals were impaired in their temporal discriminative behavior. In vivo recording of field potentials in the dorsomedial striatum evoked by stimulation of the prelimbic cortex were studied in 4- to 5-month-old rats. Input/output curves, paired-pulse function, and plasticity induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were assessed. Results showed an altered plasticity, with higher paired-pulse facilitation, enhanced short-term depression, as well as stronger long-term potentiation after TBS in homozygous transgenic rats. Results from the heterozygous animals mostly fell between wild-type and homozygous transgenic rats. Our results suggest that normal plasticity in prefrontostriatal circuits may be necessary for reliable and precise timing behavior. Furthermore, the present study provides the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of a presymptomatic alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in an animal model for Huntington disease and suggests that supra-second timing may be the earliest cognitive dysfunction in HD.",

                    "abstract": "Transgenic R6/2 mice, which express exon 1 of the human mutant Huntington disease gene, develop behavioral and neuropathological changes that bear some resemblance to the human disease. Several studies have shown that elevated glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels can exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of Huntington disease that are based on intrastriatal injections of excitotoxins. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether intrastriatal delivery of the GDNF gene by lentivirus (LV-GDNF) could provide structural and functional protection in R6/2 transgenic mice. Four- to 5-week-old mice were left untreated or alternatively received intrastriatal injections of either LV-GDNF or the same viral vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) (LV-GFP) as a control. During the 4-week follow-up period, there was the expected deterioration in performance of the R6/2 mice in paw clasping, rotarod, and open field tests, and the LV-GDNF treated mice showed no improvement over controls. ELISA showed that the LV-GDNF-injected animals had a significant increase in GDNF level in the striatum, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GDNF was also overexpressed in brain regions receiving striatal projections. However, GDNF overexpression had no effect on the neuropathological changes examined. Thus, there were no significant differences in the number of EM-48-positive intraneuronal huntingtin inclusions, number of BrdU-positive cells and size of striatal neuronal cross-sectional area. These results suggest that intrastriatal lentiviral vector transfer of GDNF, performed at 5 weeks of age, does not ameliorate neurological and behavioral impairments in the R6/2 transgenic mice model of HD. Further studies are, however, needed to investigate if GDNF given at earlier time points is beneficial.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded number of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene. A hallmark of HD is unintended weight loss, the cause of which is unknown. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of weight loss in HD, we studied its relation to other disease characteristics including motor, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances and CAG repeat number. METHODS: In 517 patients with early stage HD, we applied mixed-effects model analyses to correlate weight changes over 3 years to CAG repeat number and various components of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). We also assessed the relation between CAG repeat number and body weight and caloric intake in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. RESULTS: In patients with HD, mean body mass index decreased with -0.15 units per year (p < 0.001). However, no single UHDRS component, including motor, cognitive, and behavioral scores, was independently associated with the rate of weight loss. Patients with HD with a higher CAG repeat number had a faster rate of weight loss. Similarly, R6/2 mice with a larger CAG repeat length had a lower body weight, whereas caloric intake increased with larger CAG repeat length. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss in Huntington disease (HD) is directly linked to CAG repeat length and is likely to result from a hypermetabolic state. Other signs and symptoms of HD are unlikely to contribute to weight loss in early disease stages. Elucidation of the responsible mechanisms could lead to effective energy-based therapeutics.",

Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluate the extent to which environmental enrichment can modify synaptic plasticity in the host-graft neuronal circuitry to try to find a physiological substrate for the observed improvements. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice, housed in enriched or standard environments, received unilateral quinolinic acid lesions of the striatum, followed by embryonic striatal grafts. Then, 3 months posttransplantation, synaptic physiology and plasticity were evaluated by extracellular recording from in vitro striatal slices. RESULTS: Environmental enrichment had no effect on the chance of long-term depression (LTD) induction or expression of LTD from either normal or grafted striatum. In contrast, enrichment increased the chance of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and level of expression associated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor within both the intact and grafted striatum compared with levels in the striatum of animals housed in standard environments. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental enrichment induces changes in host-graft corticostriatal LTP, thus providing a potential physiological substrate for the enrichment-induced improvement in motor and cognitive performance. The effect may be mediated by modulation of the trophic environment in which the grafted cells develop and integrate.",

There is still no causative treatment for HD but environmental factors such as passive lifestyle may modulate disease onset and progression. In humans, multidisciplinary rehabilitation has a positive impact on cognitive functions. However, a specific role for exercise as a component of an environmental enrichment effect has been difficult to demonstrate. We aimed at investigating whether endurance training (ET) stabilizes the progression of motor and cognitive dysfunction and ameliorates cardiovascular function in HD patients. Twelve male HD patients (mean +- SD, 54.8 +- 7.1 years) and twelve male controls (49.1 +- 6.8 years) completed 26 weeks of endurance training. Before and after the training intervention, clinical assessments, exercise physiological tests, and a body composition measurement were conducted and a muscle biopsy was taken from M. vastus lateralis. To examine the natural course of the disease, HD patients were additionally assessed 6 months prior to ET. During the ET period, there was a motor deficit stabilization as indicated by the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor section score in HD patients (baseline: 18.6 +- 9.2, pre-training: 26.0 +- 13.7, post-training: 26.8 +- 16.4). Peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) significantly increased in HD patients ( [Formula: see text] = +0.33 +- 0.28 l) and controls ( [Formula: see text] = +0.29 +- 0.41 l). No adverse effects of the training intervention were reported. Our results confirm that HD patients are amenable to a specific exercise-induced therapeutic strategy indicated by an increased cardiovascular function and a stabilization of motor function.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individualized exercise instruction on a regular basis may be desirable for people with Huntington disease (HD). Sustained interventions, however, may not be the most feasible for lifelong disease management. It is critical, therefore, for physical therapists to find ways to facilitate engagement in independent exercise programs. The capabilities of DVD technology can make the DVD a useful format to facilitate engagement for people with HD who have motivational and cognitive problems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore how people with HD used a home-based exercise DVD and how it was perceived by the participants and their caregivers. DESIGN: An exploratory, mixed-method design was used in this study. METHODS: Fifteen participants with HD were provided with an exercise DVD, developed by the authors, to support their engagement in a home-based exercise program. Exercise diaries were used to record adherence rates. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore what factors affected the usability of the DVD. Conversations were audio recorded and fully transcribed. Content analysis approach was used to analyze the interviews. RESULTS: Most of the participants (11/15, 73.3%) adhered well to the use of the DVD. Participants felt that the exercises were suitable. Commitment of the caregiver as a key to the success of the program was the main theme that emerged from the data. Participants identified barriers and facilitators that affected adherence to using the exercise DVD and described management strategies that helped promote adherence to the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: The DVD was perceived to be suitable and supportive. The DVD could be appropriate for use in supporting people with HD to engage in exercise at home, either outside of therapy sessions or upon completion of a therapy program.",

When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.",

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment in mice with established PD and evaluated the relationship between EA, autophagy, and different neurons in the mouse brain. We report that EA improves PD motor symptoms in mice and enhances (1) autophagy initiation (increased Beclin 1), (2) autophagosome biogenesis (increased Atg5, Atg7, Atg9A, Atg12, Atg16L, Atg3, and LC3-II), (3) autophagy flux/substrate degradation (decreased p62), and (4) mitophagy (increased PINK1 and DJ-1) in neurons of the substantia nigra, striatum, hippocampus, and cortex (affected brain areas of PD, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer's disease). EA enhances autophagy initiation, autophagosome biogenesis, mitophagy, and autophagy flux/substrate degradation in certain brain areas. Our findings are the first to show that EA regulates neuronal autophagy and suggest that this convenient, inexpensive treatment has exciting therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders.",

BACKGROUND: The duration of the illness may be up to 30 years and there are far reaching implications for the affected person, family members and carers. Services for families need to provide expert psychological and practical support, whilst remaining planned and flexible. The aim of this research was to identify needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their carers and ascertain the extent to which they were supported by a specialised community service. METHODS: Five focus groups and three individual interviews were used to gather data from affected individuals, family, carers and staff of the unit (n = 33). A semi-structured discussion guide was used in every case. Data were analysed using an inductive coding technique. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged; (i) Transitions and the journey, (ii) Challenges in finding and providing support and (iii) The role of the unit in providing supportive care. While the service was seen as supportive, the need for flexibility was emphasised to facilitate the transition from unaffected to affected status. Affected individuals felt it was important to be known as the person they had been, despite the changes due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of service in a dedicated unit is an appropriate way to support affected patients and their carers. Enhancing understanding of the disease and allowing the individual to make choices can assist coping with this challenging disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is helpful to allow patients control over timing and frequency of contact with professionals. Improving understanding of the condition in the public and health professionals may enable patients to access a greater range of social activities.",

For patients with HD, feeding is one of the problems they have to face. People with HD often have lower than average body weight and struggle with malnutrition. As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.

In particular, the grafted cells can sustain functional recovery in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative conditions including genetic and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood and aging, ischemic stroke, and brain and spinal cord trauma. In a restricted subset of such conditions, cell transplantation has progressed to application in humans in early-stage clinical trials. At the present stage of play, there is clear evidence of clinical efficacy of fetal cell transplants in Parkinson disease (notwithstanding a range of technical difficulties still to be fully resolved), and preliminary claims of promising outcomes in several other severe neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington disease and stroke. Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

Environmental enrichment has been used to slow processes leading to ageing and neurodegenerative diseases including HD. Phenolic phytochemicals including anthocyanins have also been shown to improve brain function in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of anthocyanin dietary supplementation and environmental enrichment on behavioural phenotypes and brain cholesterol metabolic alterations in the R6/1 mouse model of HD. METHODS: R6/1 HD mice and their wild-type littermate controls were randomised into the different experimental conditions, involving either environmentally enriched versus standard housing conditions, or anthocyanin versus control diet. Motor dysfunction was assessed from 6 to 26 weeks using the RotaRod and the hind-paw clasping tests. Gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify a broad range of sterols in the striatum and cortex of R6/1 HD mice. RESULTS: Anthocyanin dietary supplementation delayed the onset of motor dysfunction in female HD mice. Environmental enrichment improved motor function and the hind paw clasping phenotype in male HD mice only. These mice also had lower levels of cholesterol oxidation products in the cortex compared to standard-housed mice. CONCLUSION: Both anthocyanin supplementation and environmental enrichment are able to improve the motor dysfunction phenotype of R6/1 mice, however the effectiveness of these interventions was different between the two sexes. The interventions examined did not alter brain cholesterol metabolic deficits that have been reported previously in this mouse model of HD.",

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of anthocyanin dietary supplementation and environmental enrichment on behavioural phenotypes and brain cholesterol metabolic alterations in the R6/1 mouse model of HD. METHODS: R6/1 HD mice and their wild-type littermate controls were randomised into the different experimental conditions, involving either environmentally enriched versus standard housing conditions, or anthocyanin versus control diet. Motor dysfunction was assessed from 6 to 26 weeks using the RotaRod and the hind-paw clasping tests. Gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify a broad range of sterols in the striatum and cortex of R6/1 HD mice. RESULTS: Anthocyanin dietary supplementation delayed the onset of motor dysfunction in female HD mice. Environmental enrichment improved motor function and the hind paw clasping phenotype in male HD mice only. These mice also had lower levels of cholesterol oxidation products in the cortex compared to standard-housed mice. CONCLUSION: Both anthocyanin supplementation and environmental enrichment are able to improve the motor dysfunction phenotype of R6/1 mice, however the effectiveness of these interventions was different between the two sexes. The interventions examined did not alter brain cholesterol metabolic deficits that have been reported previously in this mouse model of HD.",

Genetic causes are being discovered for an increasing number of chronic illnesses and diseases, such as Huntington disease. Because of the scientific and pharmacological advances, leading nursing organizations, such as the American Nurses Association, have established competencies in genetic knowledge for nurses. Such competencies help ensure quality care. Recent advances in the pharmacogenomics of therapy for human immunodeficiency virus disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and malignant hyperthermia have indicated a genetic linkage; therefore treatments are targeted toward the genetic aspect of the abnormality. Critical care nurses need knowledge of these genetic conditions and of medications affected by genetic factors.",

Cell replacement using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron. We have also shown that transplants elicited a significant improvement in sensory-motor tasks up to 2 months post-transplant further supporting the therapeutic potential of this approach.",

METHODS: We examined factor structure (confirmatory factor analysis), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), floor and ceiling effects, convergent validity (Pearson correlations), and known-groups validity (multivariate analysis). RESULTS: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis replicated the six-factor latent model that reflects the six separate scales within the WHODAS 2.0 (understanding and communicating; getting around; self-care; getting along with others; life activities; participation). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.94, suggesting good internal consistency reliability. The WHODAS demonstrated a ceiling effect for 19.5 % of participants; there were no floor effects. There was evidence for convergent validity; the WHODAS demonstrated moderate significant correlations with other general measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL; i.e., RAND-12, EQ5D). Multivariate analyses indicated that late-stage HD participants indicated poorer HRQOL than both early-stage HD and prodromal HD participants for all HRQOL measures. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide support for both the reliability and validity of the WHODAS 2.0 in individuals with HD.",

These subprocesses are (pre)-motor inhibition and inhibition monitoring, which are probably reflected by the Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3, respectively. Here we ask, if these subprocesses may depend on distinct basal ganglia subsystems. We examined response inhibition processes in an extended sample of young and elderly subjects, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington' disease (HD). This combination of groups also allow us to study whether, and to what degree, pathological basal ganglia changes and healthy aging have similar and/or different effects on these processes. We show that subprocesses of response inhibition are differentially modulated by distinct basal ganglia circuits. Processes related to (pre)-motor inhibition appear to be modulated by the nigrostriatal system, and are sensitive to aging and age-related basal ganglia diseases (i.e. PD). Parkinson's disease induces additive effects of aging and pathology. In contrast, inhibition monitoring is most likely modulated by the mesocortico-limbic dopamine system. These processes are equally affected in healthy aging and both basal ganglia diseases (i.e. PD, HD).",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement. RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.",

We will describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and discuss pre-clinical data concerning the impact of the experimental manipulation of BDNF levels on HD progression. These studies have revealed that a major loss of BDNF protein in the brain of HD patients may contribute to the clinical manifestations of the disease. The experimental strategies under investigation to increase brain BDNF levels in animal models of HD will also be described, with a view to ultimately improving the clinical treatment of this condition.

Most do not wish to pass on the gene for Huntington disease to their children, but may not be prepared themselves to undergo presymptomatic testing and learn their genetic status. For these reasons, many at-risk individuals with a family history of HD would choose a method of genetic diagnosis that would assure them that they can have children unaffected with HD without revealing their own genetic status (non-disclosing). We have shown that, with a carefully designed and executed programme of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic testing, one can successfully assist at-risk couples to have their own biological children who are free from Huntington disease, without forcing parents to confront knowledge of their own genetic status. METHODS: Couples where one partner was at 50% risk for Huntington disease underwent in vitro fertilization with preimplantation embryo biopsy and molecular analysis for Huntington disease where appropriate. RESULTS: After extensive counselling and informed consent, 10 couples underwent 13 in vitro fertilization and two frozen embryo transfer cycles in a programme for non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease. In 11 cycles, embryos determined to be free of Huntington disease were transferred, resulting in five clinical pregnancies. One set of twins and three singleton pregnancies have delivered. One pregnancy resulted in a first-trimester loss. CONCLUSIONS: The option of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis should be reviewed, along with other relevant medical options, when counselling at-risk Huntington disease families.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

For patients with HD, feeding is one of the problems they have to face. People with HD often have lower than average body weight and struggle with malnutrition. As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.

Although the interplay between perturbed BBB homeostasis and the pathogenesis of brain disorders needs further investigation, the development and validation of a reliable procedure to accurately detect BBB alterations may be crucial and represent a useful tool for potentially predicting disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we present an easy and efficient procedure for evaluating BBB leakage in a neurodegenerative condition like that occurring in a preclinical mouse model of Huntington disease, in which defects in the permeability of BBB are clearly detectable precociously in the disease. Specifically, the high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled (FITC)-albumin, which is able to cross the BBB only when the latter is impaired, is acutely infused into a mouse jugular vein and its distribution in the vascular or parenchymal districts is then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of green fluorescent-albumin in the brain parenchyma functions as an index of aberrant BBB permeability and, when quantitated by using Image J processing software, is reported as Green Fluorescence Intensity.",

This may in part be due to the lack of suitable outcome measures. Therefore, we investigated the applicability of novel quantitative and objective assessments of motor dysfunction in the evaluation of physical therapy interventions aimed at improving gait and posture. METHODS: Twelve patients with Huntington disease received a predefined twice-weekly intervention focusing on posture and gait over 6 weeks. The GAITRite mat and a force plate were used for objective and quantitative assessments. The Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score, the timed Up &Go test, and the Berg Balance Scale were used as clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen in GAITRite measures after therapy. Improvements were also seen in the Up & Go test and Berg Balance Scale, whereas force plate measures and Total Motor Scores did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that physical therapy has a positive effect on gait in Huntington's disease. The study shows that objective and quantitative measures of gait and posture may serve as endpoints in trials assessing the efficacy of physical therapy. They should be explored further in larger trials applying a randomized controlled setting.",

The mutation c.1551_1552ins20 was analyzed by fragment size and c.859G>C was minisequenced. Furthermore, STR markers linked to the POR gene were included to support the diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase (POR) deficiency. RESULTS: Nine embryos were diagnosed in total: three as POR deficiency affected, two as HD affected, one as POR deficiency and HD affected, and two as carriers of the paternal POR deficiency mutation and healthy for HD.

As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible, there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM: The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures, differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related assessments are not feasible.",

In addition, a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, along with cognitive decline, contribute significantly to the patient's disability. Because there are no effective neuroprotective therapies that delay the progression of the disease, symptomatic treatment remains the cornerstone of medical management. Several classes of medications have been used to ameliorate the various symptoms of HD, including typical and atypical neuroleptics, dopamine depleters, antidepressants, antiglutamatergic drugs, GABA agonists, antiepileptic medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and botulinum toxin. Recently, surgical approaches including pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation, and fetal cell transplants have been used for the symptomatic treatment of HD. The selected therapy must be customized to the needs of each patient, minimizing the potential adverse effects. The primary aim of this article is to review the role of the different therapies, both available and investigational, for the treatment of the motor, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of HD, and to examine their impact on the patient's functionality and quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physical therapy is recommended for the treatment of Huntington's disease, but reliable studies investigating its efficacy are almost non-existent. This may in part be due to the lack of suitable outcome measures. Therefore, we investigated the applicability of novel quantitative and objective assessments of motor dysfunction in the evaluation of physical therapy interventions aimed at improving gait and posture. METHODS: Twelve patients with Huntington disease received a predefined twice-weekly intervention focusing on posture and gait over 6 weeks. The GAITRite mat and a force plate were used for objective and quantitative assessments. The Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score, the timed Up &Go test, and the Berg Balance Scale were used as clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen in GAITRite measures after therapy. Improvements were also seen in the Up & Go test and Berg Balance Scale, whereas force plate measures and Total Motor Scores did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that physical therapy has a positive effect on gait in Huntington's disease. The study shows that objective and quantitative measures of gait and posture may serve as endpoints in trials assessing the efficacy of physical therapy. They should be explored further in larger trials applying a randomized controlled setting.",

Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder with a primary etiology of striatal pathology. The Huntingtin gene (HTT) has a unique feature of a DNA trinucleotide (triplet) repeat, with repeat length ranging from 10 to 35 in the normal population. Repeat lengths between 36 and 39 cause HD at reduced penetrance (some will get the disease, others won't) and when expanded to 40 or more repeats (mHTT), causes HD at full penetrance (every person with this length or beyond will definitely develop the disease). The symptoms of HD may be motor, cognitive, and psychiatric, and are consistent with the pathophysiology of frontostriatal circuitry malfunction. Expressed ubiquitously and throughout the entire life cycle (development through adulthood), mHTT causes initial dysfunction and eventual death of a specific cell population within the striatum. Although all areas of the brain are eventually affected, the primary pathology of the disease is regionally specific. As a single-gene disorder, HD has the distinction of having the potential of treatment that is aimed directly at the known pathogenic mechanism by gene silencing, providing hope for neuroprotection and ultimately, prevention.

In specific diseases, selective silencing of only one copy of a gene may be advantageous over non-selective silencing of both copies. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Silencing both expanded and normal copies of HTT may be therapeutically beneficial, but preservation of normal HTT expression is preferred. Allele-specific methods can selectively silence the mutant HTT transcript by targeting either the expanded CAG repeat or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with the expansion. Both approaches require personalized treatment strategies based on patient genotypes. We compare the prospect of safe treatment of HD by CAG- and SNP-specific silencing approaches and review HD population genetics used to guide target identification in the patient population. Clinical implementation of allele-specific HTT silencing faces challenges common to personalized genetic medicine, requiring novel solutions from clinical scientists and regulatory authorities.",

All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery.

Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..). A large number of clinical areas stand as candidates for clinical applications: leukaemia and cancers, cardiac insufficiency and vascular diseases, cartilage and bone repair, ligaments and tendons, liver diseases, ophthalmology, diabetes, neurological diseases (Parkinson, Huntington disease, ..), .. Various aspects of this new regenerative therapeutic medicine are developed in this work.",

All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

The presence of this mutant protein is correlated with the characteristic loss of striatal neurons and the clinical manifestation of HD. Currently there is no effective treatment for the associated cell death. The aim of this study was to evaluate an innovative strategy combining RNA interference (RNAi) and gene transfer via the nonviral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system to down-regulate Htt expression. siRNA expression vectors were designed to target exons 1, 4, 6, and 62 of the human htt gene. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to quantify Htt mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in human cell lines. The results indicated that selected siRNA constructs significantly decreased Htt mRNA and protein levels relative to controls. In addition, SB transposition of the siRNA constructs into the genome reduced long-term protein expression of Htt by approximately 90%. The combination of siRNA, the SB transposon, and an accurate transgenic mouse model may permit evaluation of this approach in preventing the pathogenesis associated with expression of mutant Htt.",

In this study we used alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency with the piZZ mutant phenotype as a model system to evaluate the efficiency of gene-delivery approaches that both silence the piZZ transcript (e.g., shRNA) and restore circulating wild-type AAT expression from resistant codon-optimized AAT (AAT-opt) transgene cassette using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivery. After systemic injection of a self-complimentary AAV serotype 8 (scAAV8) vector encoding shRNA in piZZ transgenic mice, both mutant AAT mRNA in the liver and defected serum protein level were inhibited by 95%, whereas liver pathology, as monitored by dPAS and fibrosis staining, reversed. To restore blood AAT levels in AAV8/shRNA-treated mice, several strategies to restore functional AAT levels were tested, including using AAV AAT-opt transgene cassettes targeted to muscle and liver, or combination vectors carrying piZZ shRNA and AAT-opt transgenes separately, or a single bicistronic AAV vector. With these molecular approaches, we observed over 90% knockdown of mutant AAT with a 13- to 30-fold increase of circulating wild-type AAT protein from the shRNA-resistant AAT-opt cassette. The molecular approaches applied in this study can simultaneously prevent liver pathology and restore blood AAT concentration in AAT deficiencies. Based on these observations, similar gene-therapy strategies could be considered for any diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins.",

We reported that C - C chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), C - C chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) and C - C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) contained in the secretome of activated microglia inhibit neuronal autophagy via a non-cell autonomous mechanism. These chemokines bind and activate neuronal C - C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), which, in turn, promotes phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT) - mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway activation, which inhibits autophagy, thus causing the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins in the cytoplasm of neurons. The levels of CCR5 and its chemokine ligands are increased in the brains of pre-manifesting Huntington disease (HD) and tauopathy mouse models. CCR5 accumulation might be due to a self-amplifying mechanism, since CCR5 is a substrate of autophagy and CCL5-CCR5-mediated autophagy inhibition impairs CCR5 degradation. Furthermore, pharmacological, or genetic inhibition of CCR5 rescues mTORC1-autophagy dysfunction and improves neurodegeneration in HD and tauopathy mouse models, suggesting that CCR5 hyperactivation is a pathogenic signal driving the progression of these diseases.",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

Previous research has shown suppression of just the mutant allele is achievable using siRNA targeted to regions of HD mRNA containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To determine whether more than a minority of patients may be eligible for an allele-specific therapy, we genotyped DNA from 327 unrelated European Caucasian HD patients at 26 SNP sites in the HD gene. Over 86% of the patients were found to be heterozygous for at least one SNP among those tested. Because the sites are genetically linked, one cannot use the heterozygosity rates of the individual SNPs to predict how many sites (and corresponding allele-specific siRNA) would be needed to provide at least one treatment possibility for this percentage of patients. By computing all combinations, we found that a repertoire of allele-specific siRNA corresponding to seven sites can provide at least one allele-specific siRNA treatment option for 85.6% of our sample. Moreover, we provide evidence that allele-specific siRNA targeting these sites are readily identifiable using a high throughput screening method, and that allele-specific siRNA identified using this method indeed show selective suppression of endogenous mutant htt protein in fibroblast cells from HD patients. Therefore, allele-specific siRNA are not so rare as to be impractical to find and use therapeutically.",

METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

For patients with HD, feeding is one of the problems they have to face. People with HD often have lower than average body weight and struggle with malnutrition. As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of latrepirdine on cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Sixty-four research centers in Australia, Europe, and North America. PATIENTS Four hundred three patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and baseline cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10-26). INTERVENTION Latrepirdine (20 mg) vs matching placebo administered orally 3 times daily for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary outcome measures were cognition as measured by the change in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to week 26 and global function at week 26 as measured by the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview, which ranges from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included behavior, daily function, motor function, and safety. RESULTS The mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination score among participants randomized to latrepirdine (1.5-point improvement) did not differ significantly from that among participants randomized to placebo (1.3-point improvement) (P=.39). Similarly, the distribution of the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview did not differ significantly among those randomized to latrepirdine compared with placebo (P=.84). No significant treatment effects were detected on the secondary efficacy outcome measures. The incidence of adverse events was similar between those randomized to latrepirdine (68.5%) and placebo (68.0%). CONCLUSION In patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and cognitive impairment, treatment with latrepirdine for 6 months was safe and well tolerated but did not improve cognition or global function relative to placebo.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Task-specific training may be a suitable intervention to address mobility limitations in people with Huntington disease (HD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of goal-directed, task-specific mobility training for individuals with mid-stage HD. DESIGN: This study was a randomized, blinded, feasibility trial; participants were randomly assigned to control (usual care) and intervention groups. SETTING: This multisite study was conducted in 6 sites in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Thirty individuals with mid-stage HD (13 men, 17 women; mean age=57.0 years, SD=10.1) were enrolled and randomly assigned to study groups. INTERVENTION: Task-specific training was conducted by physical therapists in participants' homes, focusing on walking, sit-to-stand transfers, and standing, twice a week for 8 weeks. Goal attainment scaling was used to individualize the intervention and monitor achievement of personal goals. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence and adverse events were recorded. Adjusted between-group comparisons on standardized outcome measures were conducted at 8 and 16 weeks to determine effect sizes. RESULTS: Loss to follow-up was minimal (n=2); adherence in the intervention group was excellent (96.9%). Ninety-two percent of goals were achieved at the end of the intervention; 46% of the participants achieved much better than expected outcomes. Effect sizes on all measures were small. LIMITATIONS: Measurements of walking endurance were lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of and excellent adherence to a home-based, task-specific training program, in which most participants exceeded goal expectations, are encouraging given the range of motivational, behavioral, and mobility issues in people with HD. The design of the intervention in terms of frequency (dose), intensity (aerobic versus anaerobic), and specificity (focused training on individual tasks) may not have been sufficient to elicit any systematic effects. Thus, a larger-scale trial of this specific intervention does not seem warranted.",

For patients with HD, feeding is one of the problems they have to face. People with HD often have lower than average body weight and struggle with malnutrition. As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.

Cell replacement using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron. We have also shown that transplants elicited a significant improvement in sensory-motor tasks up to 2 months post-transplant further supporting the therapeutic potential of this approach.",

                    "abstract": "One of the chief contemporary goals of neurologists and neuroscientists is to find a way to overcome the debilitating effects of brain diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Since very few molecules have been found to be efficient in curing the patients and even halting the progression of the symptoms, cell therapy is now seen as an attractive alternative. Two therapeutic strategies are currently under investigation: i) the \"substitution\" strategy, based on grafts of cells capable of differentiating in the appropriate cells and restoring lost functions and ii) the \"neuroprotective\" or \"conservative\" strategy aiming to increase the resistance of spared cells to the toxicity of their environment and to reinforce the body's own mechanisms of healing. Twenty years ago, foetal neuroblasts were the first cells to be transplanted in the brains of patients with Parkinson's or Huntington disease. A phase II clinical trial is presently conducted in France for the latter disorder. However, the numerous ethical and technical issues raised by the use of embryonic and foetal cells have directed the focus of clinicians and researchers towards substitute cell types. In this review, we summarise the main findings of the most recent basic studies and clinical trials based on: i) the grafting of surrogate adult cells such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and olfactory ensheathing cells; ii) the potential therapeutic applications of neuropoiesis - the persistent neurogenesis in the brain - as a source for tissue engraftment and as self-repair by a person's own indigenous population of pluripotent cells and iii) immune-based therapy (autologous activated macrophages and T cell vaccination) as well as administration of immunomodulatory molecules. Unexpectedly, it has been found that undifferentiated adult stem cells can display immune-like functions when they home in on an inflamed brain area while immune cells and immunosuppressors can improve functional and morphological recovery when administered within the appropriate time-window. On the one hand, outcomes from substitution therapy trials are encouraging. They pave the way for an enlarged use of various adult cell types for various neurological disorders. On the other hand, clinical benefits of the neuroprotective therapy, still under close scrutiny, look rather promising. It is likely that, in a close future, the two strategies will be combined in order to efficiently repair the pathological, the damaged or the senescent brain.",

Because INH inhibits the enzyme gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-T), and increases GABA content in the brains of experimental animals, it might correct the brain GABA deficiency characteristic of Huntington disease. Of six patients treated long enough to be clinically evaluated, one showed marked and two others showed signifciant improvement. High-dose INH therapy carries serious toxic risks, which are influenced by patients' acetylator phenotypes. Nevertheless, results are sufficiently promising to warrant further controlled trials of INH or other GABA-T inhibitors in Huntington disease.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials of fetal neural tissue transplantation for Huntington disease (HD) have been conducted with variable clinical results. However, no long-term analysis of graft survival and integration has been published. Here, we report the pathologic findings in two patients with HD who died 74 and 79 months after transplantation. METHODS: Methods used were pathologic examination, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Neostriatum from both patients showed typical neuropathologic changes of advanced HD. Surviving grafts were identified in both patients (6/6 sites and 7/8 sites, respectively) as well-demarcated nests within host neostriatum with associated needle tracts. Grafted neurons adopted either dominant calbindin/parvalbumin or calretinin immunoreactivity (IR). Few neurofilament, MAP-2, DARPP-32, tyrosine hydroxylase, or calbindin IR processes traversed the host parenchyma-graft interface despite minimal junctional gliosis. Immunohistochemistry for CD68 showed microgliosis that was more pronounced in host striatum than graft. Scattered CD45 and CD3 IR cells were present within grafts and host parenchyma. No ubiquitin IR neuronal intranuclear inclusions were identified in graft neurons, although these were prevalent in host cells. CONCLUSIONS: These two autopsies confirm previous findings of neuronal differentiation and survival of transplanted fetal tissue from the ganglionic eminence and also demonstrate viability of neurons from fetal transplants in human neostriatum for more than 6 years. Despite prolonged survival, these grafts had poor integration with host striatum that is likely responsible for lack of clear clinical improvement in these patients.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Most people prefer to die at home. Hospice is the standard in end-of-life care for people with Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects people in middle adulthood. Yet, we have little knowledge regarding the place of death for people with HD. Therefore, the current state of knowledge limits HD clinicians' ability to conduct high-quality goals of care conversations. Objectives: We sought to determine the factors associated with the place of death in people with HD. Design: We obtained cross-sectional data from Enroll-HD and included participants with a positive HD mutation of 36 or more CAG repeats. Results: Out of 16,120 participants in the Enroll-HD study, 536 were reported as deceased. The mean age at death was 60. The leading place of death was home (29%), followed by the hospital (23%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of dying at a skilled nursing facility was significantly lower for those partnered (aOR: 0.48, confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.26-0.86). The aOR for dying on hospice compared to home was increased in a person with some college and above (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.21-4.75). Conclusions: Our data further suggest that models that predict the place of death for serious illnesses do not appear to generalize to HD. The distribution in the places of death within HD was not uniform. Our findings may assist HD clinicians in communication during goals of care conversations.",

OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge disposition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The RA-loaded SLNs was prepared by the hot homogenization technique, in which glycerol monostearate (GMS) as lipid, tween 80 and soya lecithin were used as surfactant along with hydrogenated soya phosphatidyl choline (HSPC) as a stabilizer, and were characterized for particle size, zeta potential (ZP), in vitro study. Nasal delivery of the developed formulation followed by the study of behavioral (locomotor, narrow beam, body weight) and biochemical parameters (glutathione, lipid peroxidation, catalase and nitrite) in wistar rat was carried out. RESULTS: Optimized RA-loaded SLNs using tween 80 (SLNPRT) have the mean size of (149.2 +- 3.2 nm), ZP (-38.27 mV) entrapment efficiency (61.9 +- 2.2%). 3-NP-treated rat significantly increased behavioral alterations, oxidative damage as compared with the control group. SLNPRT treatment significantly improved behavioral abnormalities and attenuated the oxidative stress in 3NP-treated rats. However, the nasal delivery of SLNPRT produced significant therapeutic action as compared to intravenous application. In the organ distribution study, brain drug concentration was found to be 5.69 microg, in pharmacokinetic study Cmax, tmax, t1/2, AUC values were found to be 0.284 microg/ml, 1.5 h, 3.17 h, and 1.505 microg/ml/h, respectively. CONCLUSION: The encouraging results confirmed the developed optimized RA-loaded SLNs formulation following the non-invasive nose-to-brain drug delivery that is a promising therapeutic approach for the effective management in Huntington disease.",

OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluate the extent to which environmental enrichment can modify synaptic plasticity in the host-graft neuronal circuitry to try to find a physiological substrate for the observed improvements. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice, housed in enriched or standard environments, received unilateral quinolinic acid lesions of the striatum, followed by embryonic striatal grafts. Then, 3 months posttransplantation, synaptic physiology and plasticity were evaluated by extracellular recording from in vitro striatal slices. RESULTS: Environmental enrichment had no effect on the chance of long-term depression (LTD) induction or expression of LTD from either normal or grafted striatum. In contrast, enrichment increased the chance of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and level of expression associated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor within both the intact and grafted striatum compared with levels in the striatum of animals housed in standard environments. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental enrichment induces changes in host-graft corticostriatal LTP, thus providing a potential physiological substrate for the enrichment-induced improvement in motor and cognitive performance. The effect may be mediated by modulation of the trophic environment in which the grafted cells develop and integrate.",

Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

At present, the HD field is experiencing exciting times with the assessment for the first time in human subjects of interventions aimed at core disease mechanisms. Out of a portfolio of interventions that claim a potential disease-modifying effect in HD, the target huntingtin has more robust validation. In this review, we discuss the spectrum of huntingtin-lowering therapies that are currently being considered. We provide a critical appraisal of the validation of huntingtin as a drug target, describing the advantages, challenges, and limitations of the proposed therapeutic interventions. The development of these new therapies relies strongly on the knowledge of HD pathogenesis and the ability to translate this knowledge into validated pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Altogether, the goal is to support a rational drug development that is ethical and cost-effective. Among the pharmacodynamic biomarkers under development, the quantification of mutant huntingtin in the cerebral spinal fluid and PET imaging targeting huntingtin or phosphodiesterase 10A deserve special attention. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics are eagerly awaited as the first interventions that may be able to change the course of HD in a meaningful way.",

Reducing the expression of mHTT is therefore an attractive therapy for HD. However, wild-type HTT protein is essential for development and has critical roles in maintaining neuronal health. Therapies for HD that reduce wild-type HTT may therefore generate unintended negative consequences. We have identified single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) targets in the human HD population for the disease-specific targeting of the HTT gene. Using primary cells from patients with HD and the transgenic YAC18 and BACHD mouse lines, we developed antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) molecules that potently and selectively silence mHTT at both exonic and intronic SNP sites. Modification of these ASOs with S-constrained-ethyl (cET) motifs significantly improves potency while maintaining allele selectively in vitro. The developed ASO is potent and selective for mHTT in vivo after delivery to the mouse brain. We demonstrate that potent and selective allele-specific knockdown of the mHTT protein can be achieved at therapeutically relevant SNP sites using ASOs in vitro and in vivo.",

Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

There are very limited treatments, and no cures, for most of these diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Disease, and Motor Neuron Diseases. Mouse and other animal models provide hope by analysing them to understand pathogenic mechanisms, to identify drug targets, and to develop gene therapies and stem cell therapies. However, despite many decades of research, virtually no new treatments have reached the clinic. Increasingly, it is apparent that human heterogeneity within clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders, and between patients with the same genetic mutations, significantly impacts disease presentation and, potentially, therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, stratifying patients according to genetics, lifestyle, disease presentation, ethnicity, and other parameters may hold the key to bringing effective therapies from the bench to the clinic. Here, we discuss genetic and cellular humanised mouse models, and how they help in defining the genetic and environmental parameters associated with neurodegenerative disease, and so help in developing effective precision medicine strategies for future healthcare.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease, commonly diagnosed in young to middle adulthood, is an inherited single gene disorder involving loss of cognitive, motor and neuropsychiatric function. Many family members become caregivers as well as continuing as parents and wage earners. The emotional aspects of caregiving contribute to mental health risks for family members. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 42 adult carers of people with Huntington disease in four United States and two Canadian Huntington disease centers between 2001 and 2005. Data were analyzed through descriptive coding and thematic analysis. FINDINGS: All participants reported multiple aspects of emotional distress. Being a carer was described as experiencing disintegration of one's life. Carers attempted to cope by seeking comfort from selected family members, anticipating the time when the care recipient had died and/or using prescription medications. Spousal carers were distressed by the loss of their relationship with their spouse and dealt with this by no longer regarding the person as an intimate partner. Carers were concerned about the disease risk for children in their families and hoped for a cure. CONCLUSION: Emotional distress can compromise the well-being of family carers, who attempt to maintain multiple roles. Nurses should monitor carer mental health, identify sources of emotional distress and support effective strategies used by carers to mediate distress.",

                    "abstract": "One of the chief contemporary goals of neurologists and neuroscientists is to find a way to overcome the debilitating effects of brain diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Since very few molecules have been found to be efficient in curing the patients and even halting the progression of the symptoms, cell therapy is now seen as an attractive alternative. Two therapeutic strategies are currently under investigation: i) the \"substitution\" strategy, based on grafts of cells capable of differentiating in the appropriate cells and restoring lost functions and ii) the \"neuroprotective\" or \"conservative\" strategy aiming to increase the resistance of spared cells to the toxicity of their environment and to reinforce the body's own mechanisms of healing. Twenty years ago, foetal neuroblasts were the first cells to be transplanted in the brains of patients with Parkinson's or Huntington disease. A phase II clinical trial is presently conducted in France for the latter disorder. However, the numerous ethical and technical issues raised by the use of embryonic and foetal cells have directed the focus of clinicians and researchers towards substitute cell types. In this review, we summarise the main findings of the most recent basic studies and clinical trials based on: i) the grafting of surrogate adult cells such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and olfactory ensheathing cells; ii) the potential therapeutic applications of neuropoiesis - the persistent neurogenesis in the brain - as a source for tissue engraftment and as self-repair by a person's own indigenous population of pluripotent cells and iii) immune-based therapy (autologous activated macrophages and T cell vaccination) as well as administration of immunomodulatory molecules. Unexpectedly, it has been found that undifferentiated adult stem cells can display immune-like functions when they home in on an inflamed brain area while immune cells and immunosuppressors can improve functional and morphological recovery when administered within the appropriate time-window. On the one hand, outcomes from substitution therapy trials are encouraging. They pave the way for an enlarged use of various adult cell types for various neurological disorders. On the other hand, clinical benefits of the neuroprotective therapy, still under close scrutiny, look rather promising. It is likely that, in a close future, the two strategies will be combined in order to efficiently repair the pathological, the damaged or the senescent brain.",

Several preclinical and clinical trials for gene-based therapy and immunotherapy/antibody-based have been conducted. AREAS COVERED: This review focused on the potential use of gene therapy and immuno-based therapies to treat HD, including the current status, the rationale for these approaches as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting it. Growing knowledge of HD pathogenesis has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets, some of which are now in clinical trials. Focus has been allocated to RNA and DNA-based gene therapies for the reduction of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), using Immuno/antibody-based therapies. EXPERT OPINION: While safety and efficacy of gene therapy and immunotherapy has been well demonstrated for HD, therefore much focus has now been shifted to disease-modifying therapies. This review defines the current status and future directions of gene therapy and immunotherapies. The review summarizes by what means HD genetic root cause modification and functional restoration of mHtt protein could be achieved by using targeted multimodality gene therapy and immunotherapy to target intracellular and extracellular mHtt.",

                    "abstract": "Transgenic R6/2 mice, which express exon 1 of the human mutant Huntington disease gene, develop behavioral and neuropathological changes that bear some resemblance to the human disease. Several studies have shown that elevated glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels can exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of Huntington disease that are based on intrastriatal injections of excitotoxins. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether intrastriatal delivery of the GDNF gene by lentivirus (LV-GDNF) could provide structural and functional protection in R6/2 transgenic mice. Four- to 5-week-old mice were left untreated or alternatively received intrastriatal injections of either LV-GDNF or the same viral vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) (LV-GFP) as a control. During the 4-week follow-up period, there was the expected deterioration in performance of the R6/2 mice in paw clasping, rotarod, and open field tests, and the LV-GDNF treated mice showed no improvement over controls. ELISA showed that the LV-GDNF-injected animals had a significant increase in GDNF level in the striatum, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GDNF was also overexpressed in brain regions receiving striatal projections. However, GDNF overexpression had no effect on the neuropathological changes examined. Thus, there were no significant differences in the number of EM-48-positive intraneuronal huntingtin inclusions, number of BrdU-positive cells and size of striatal neuronal cross-sectional area. These results suggest that intrastriatal lentiviral vector transfer of GDNF, performed at 5 weeks of age, does not ameliorate neurological and behavioral impairments in the R6/2 transgenic mice model of HD. Further studies are, however, needed to investigate if GDNF given at earlier time points is beneficial.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials of fetal neural tissue transplantation for Huntington disease (HD) have been conducted with variable clinical results. However, no long-term analysis of graft survival and integration has been published. Here, we report the pathologic findings in two patients with HD who died 74 and 79 months after transplantation. METHODS: Methods used were pathologic examination, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Neostriatum from both patients showed typical neuropathologic changes of advanced HD. Surviving grafts were identified in both patients (6/6 sites and 7/8 sites, respectively) as well-demarcated nests within host neostriatum with associated needle tracts. Grafted neurons adopted either dominant calbindin/parvalbumin or calretinin immunoreactivity (IR). Few neurofilament, MAP-2, DARPP-32, tyrosine hydroxylase, or calbindin IR processes traversed the host parenchyma-graft interface despite minimal junctional gliosis. Immunohistochemistry for CD68 showed microgliosis that was more pronounced in host striatum than graft. Scattered CD45 and CD3 IR cells were present within grafts and host parenchyma. No ubiquitin IR neuronal intranuclear inclusions were identified in graft neurons, although these were prevalent in host cells. CONCLUSIONS: These two autopsies confirm previous findings of neuronal differentiation and survival of transplanted fetal tissue from the ganglionic eminence and also demonstrate viability of neurons from fetal transplants in human neostriatum for more than 6 years. Despite prolonged survival, these grafts had poor integration with host striatum that is likely responsible for lack of clear clinical improvement in these patients.",

It has been demonstrated that recombinant antibody fragments may neutralize toxic extra- and intracellular misfolded proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, DLB, FTD, HD or TSEs and may target toxic immune cells participating in the pathogenesis of MS. CONCLUSION: Recombinant antibody fragments represent a promising tool for the development of antibody-based immunotherapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.",

We hypothesized that hMSCs would be beneficial in a mouse model of Huntington disease (HD) due to these neurogenic effects. RESULTS: We implanted hMSCs into the striatum of transgenic mice (N171-82Q) that are a model for HD. The implanted hMSCs rapidly disappeared over 3 to 15 days. However, they increased proliferation and neural differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells for up to 30 days. They also increased neurotrophic signaling and decreased atrophy of the striatum in 3-month old HD mice implanted with hMSCs one month earlier. CONCLUSIONS: The results therefore suggested that neural implantation of hMSCs may be of benefit in HD but a number of parameters of dose, treatment schedule, and route of administration need to be optimized.",

The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.",

Based on several pharmacological activities of curcumin, it has been introduced as an ideal candidate for different neurological disorders. Despite the pleiotropic activities of curcumin, poor solubility, rapid clearance and low stability have limited its clinical application. In recent years, nano-based drug delivery system has effectively improved the aqueous solubility and bioavailability of curcumin. In this review article, the effects of curcumin nanoparticles and their possible mechanism/s of action has been elucidated in various central nervous system (CNS)-related diseases including Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

                    "abstract": "Although neuroprotective strategies and pharmaceutical agents have been initiated in the treatment of numerous disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including trauma, epilepsy, stroke, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,and AIDS dementia, none have yet been applied to the treatment of glaucoma. A prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.",

Emerging investigations have provided new understanding of how autophagy of mitochondria (also known as mitophagy) is associated with cellular oxidative stress and its impact on neurodegeneration. This impaired autophagic function may be considered as a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease. It can be suggested that autophagy dysfunction along with oxidative stress is considered main events in neurodegenerative disorders. New therapeutic approaches have now begun to target mitochondria as a potential drug target. This review discusses evidence supporting the notion that oxidative stress and autophagy are intimately associated with neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. This review also explores new approaches that can prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, improve neurodegenerative etiology, and also offer possible cures to the aforementioned neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: The duration of the illness may be up to 30 years and there are far reaching implications for the affected person, family members and carers. Services for families need to provide expert psychological and practical support, whilst remaining planned and flexible. The aim of this research was to identify needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their carers and ascertain the extent to which they were supported by a specialised community service. METHODS: Five focus groups and three individual interviews were used to gather data from affected individuals, family, carers and staff of the unit (n = 33). A semi-structured discussion guide was used in every case. Data were analysed using an inductive coding technique. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged; (i) Transitions and the journey, (ii) Challenges in finding and providing support and (iii) The role of the unit in providing supportive care. While the service was seen as supportive, the need for flexibility was emphasised to facilitate the transition from unaffected to affected status. Affected individuals felt it was important to be known as the person they had been, despite the changes due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of service in a dedicated unit is an appropriate way to support affected patients and their carers. Enhancing understanding of the disease and allowing the individual to make choices can assist coping with this challenging disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is helpful to allow patients control over timing and frequency of contact with professionals. Improving understanding of the condition in the public and health professionals may enable patients to access a greater range of social activities.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate if in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease is cost effective for heterozygous individuals with Huntington disease vs. unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a theoretical cohort of 3,851 couples, where one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. SETTING: N/A. PATIENTS/ANIMALS: None. INTERVENTION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing for couples attempting conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both parents in addition to secondary outcomes of procedure-related loss, spontaneous abortion, termination of pregnancy, and early/normal/late-onset Huntington disease. A willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is lower in cost and higher in effectiveness compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis among couples with one heterozygous Huntington disease individual, making it the dominant strategy. In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing was associated with 77 more QALYs and a cost savings of $46,394,268. All measured outcomes were lower in the IVF preimplantation genetic testing strategy, including 39 fewer procedure-related losses, 39 fewer spontaneous abortions, and 462 fewer terminations of pregnancy. Most notably, in our theoretical cohort of couples, IVF preimplantation genetic testing resulted in 1,079 fewer Huntington disease-affected offspring. Our results were robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is a cost-effective conception strategy compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis when one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. Not only can morbidity and mortality incurred by Huntington disease be mitigated for the offspring with the use of IVF preimplantation genetic testing, but this study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of using IVF preimplantation genetic testing for those with Huntington disease.",

It employs the use of polymerase chain reaction to amplify single cells from early embryos obtained with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques. PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring. Recent advances in sequencing may allow for higher success rates as the chromosomally abnormal embryos will be identified more easily and the embryos with the highest chance of survival will be transferred.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Individuals at risk for Huntington disease face difficult decisions regarding their reproductive options. Most do not wish to pass on the gene for Huntington disease to their children, but may not be prepared themselves to undergo presymptomatic testing and learn their genetic status. For these reasons, many at-risk individuals with a family history of HD would choose a method of genetic diagnosis that would assure them that they can have children unaffected with HD without revealing their own genetic status (non-disclosing). We have shown that, with a carefully designed and executed programme of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic testing, one can successfully assist at-risk couples to have their own biological children who are free from Huntington disease, without forcing parents to confront knowledge of their own genetic status. METHODS: Couples where one partner was at 50% risk for Huntington disease underwent in vitro fertilization with preimplantation embryo biopsy and molecular analysis for Huntington disease where appropriate. RESULTS: After extensive counselling and informed consent, 10 couples underwent 13 in vitro fertilization and two frozen embryo transfer cycles in a programme for non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease. In 11 cycles, embryos determined to be free of Huntington disease were transferred, resulting in five clinical pregnancies. One set of twins and three singleton pregnancies have delivered. One pregnancy resulted in a first-trimester loss. CONCLUSIONS: The option of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis should be reviewed, along with other relevant medical options, when counselling at-risk Huntington disease families.",

We previously demonstrated that transient exposure of subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived adult NPCs to lithium chloride during in vitro proliferation alters differential fate in vitro and increases the proportion of cells expressing neuronal markers while reducing glial progeny. To extend these findings, we examined whether in vitro priming of adult SVZ-derived NPCs with lithium chloride before transplantation into the quinolinic acid (QA) lesion rat model of Huntington disease altered in vivo neuronal differentiation and sensorimotor function compared with nonprimed NPC transplants. METHODS: NPCs were isolated from the SVZ of the adult rat brain and cultured for 2 weeks. Four days before transplantation into the QA-lesioned rat striatum, the cells were labeled with BrdU and primed with lithium chloride. The rats underwent regular evaluation of forelimb use and sensorimotor neglect to establish functional effects of NPC transplantation. Twelve weeks after transplantation, the brains were analyzed with immunohistochemistry to compare the differential fate of primed and nonprimed NPCs. RESULTS: We observed that in vitro priming of adult NPCs with lithium chloride reduced gliogenesis and enhanced the occurrence of DARPP-32-positive neurons when compared with nonprimed cells 12 weeks after transplantation into the QA-lesioned striatum. Lithium chloride priming also augmented the formation of efferent projections from newly formed neurons in the damaged host striatum to the globus pallidus. This was associated with acceleration of sensorimotor function recovery in rats receiving transplants of lithium chloride-primed adult NPCs compared with nonprimed transplants. CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings indicate that in vitro priming of adult NPCs with lithium chloride may augment transplant efficiency and accelerate sensorimotor function outcome in vivo.",

                    "abstract": "Cognitive decline precedes motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD). A transgenic rat model for HD carrying only 51 CAG repeats recapitulates the late-onset HD phenotype. Here, we assessed prefrontostriatal function in this model through both behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Behavioral examination consisted in a temporal bisection task within a supra-second range (2 vs.8 s), which is thought to involve prefrontostriatal networks. In two independent experiments, the behavioral analysis revealed poorer temporal sensitivity as early as 4 months of age, well before detection of overt motor deficits. At a later symptomatic age, animals were impaired in their temporal discriminative behavior. In vivo recording of field potentials in the dorsomedial striatum evoked by stimulation of the prelimbic cortex were studied in 4- to 5-month-old rats. Input/output curves, paired-pulse function, and plasticity induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were assessed. Results showed an altered plasticity, with higher paired-pulse facilitation, enhanced short-term depression, as well as stronger long-term potentiation after TBS in homozygous transgenic rats. Results from the heterozygous animals mostly fell between wild-type and homozygous transgenic rats. Our results suggest that normal plasticity in prefrontostriatal circuits may be necessary for reliable and precise timing behavior. Furthermore, the present study provides the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of a presymptomatic alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in an animal model for Huntington disease and suggests that supra-second timing may be the earliest cognitive dysfunction in HD.",

These data are part of a survey of 682 geneticists in 19 nations. Of 490 U.S. geneticists asked to participate, 295 (60%) returned anonymous detailed questionnaires. There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they would give directive counseling. Women were more likely than men to say that they would perform prenatal diagnosis for maternal anxiety or for sex selection.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Testosterone deficiency has been reported in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease, and Huntington disease. It is not known whether testosterone therapy (TT) in men with borderline hypogonadism and neurodegenerative diseases will be of substantial benefit. Previously, we reported that testosterone deficiency is more common in patients with PD compared with age-matched control subjects, and we also reported in 2 small open-label studies that some nonmotor symptoms responded favorably to TT. OBJECTIVE: To define the effects of TT on nonmotor and motor symptoms in men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. DESIGN: Double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center trial. PATIENTS: Two experimental groups: patients with PD who were receiving either TT or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either the study drug by intramuscular injection (200 mg/mL of testosterone enanthate every 2 weeks for 8 weeks) or placebo (isotonic sodium chloride solution injections). In patients in each group, the testosterone serum concentration was obtained at each study visit. During 2 study visits, testosterone levels were blindly evaluated and the intramuscular testosterone dose was increased by 200 mg/mL if the free testosterone value failed to double from the baseline value. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Questionnaire, and secondary outcome measures included measures of mood, cognition, fatigue, motor function, and frequency of adverse events. At the end of the double-blind phase, all patients were offered open-label TT and were followed up after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Fifteen patients in the placebo group (mean age, 69.9 years), receiving a mean total levodopa equivalent dose of 924 mg/d, had a baseline free testosterone level of 47.91 pg/mL, compared with 15 patients in the TT group (mean age, 66.7 years), receiving an average total levodopa equivalent dose of 734 mg/d, who had a baseline free testosterone level of 63.49 pg/mL. Testosterone was generally well tolerated. More subjects in the TT group experienced lower extremity edema (40% vs 20%). In 2 patients, 1 in each group, prostate-specific antigen levels were elevated from baseline. The improvement in the TT group compared with the placebo group (1.7 vs 1.1) on the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Scale was not statistically significant. In addition, there were no significant differences in motor and nonmotor features of PD between the 2 groups, although a few subscales showed improvements (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, P<.04; and Backward Visual Span subtrial, P<.03). However, long-term open-label TT resulted in delayed but sustained improvement in subjects in the TT group who continued to receive treatment (n = 6) compared with subjects in the placebo group who elected not to receive TT (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone therapy was generally well tolerated in elderly men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. While there was no significant difference in the motor and nonmotor scales between the TT and placebo groups at the end of 8 weeks compared with baseline, this may be due to several study limitations, including small sample size, a strong placebo effect with intramuscular therapy, and short follow-up that did not allow measurement of delayed effects of TT in some subjects. Until more definitive studies are reported, practitioners should be particularly cautious in treatment of low testosterone concentrations in men with PD and borderline testosterone deficiency, and careful consideration should be given to the risks vs the benefits of TT.",

We hypothesized that hMSCs would be beneficial in a mouse model of Huntington disease (HD) due to these neurogenic effects. RESULTS: We implanted hMSCs into the striatum of transgenic mice (N171-82Q) that are a model for HD. The implanted hMSCs rapidly disappeared over 3 to 15 days. However, they increased proliferation and neural differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells for up to 30 days. They also increased neurotrophic signaling and decreased atrophy of the striatum in 3-month old HD mice implanted with hMSCs one month earlier. CONCLUSIONS: The results therefore suggested that neural implantation of hMSCs may be of benefit in HD but a number of parameters of dose, treatment schedule, and route of administration need to be optimized.",

Unifying mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of polyQ-dependent neurodegenerative diseases including SBMA, Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxias. It has been suggested that mutant protein containing polyQ inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity, resulting in transcriptional dysfunction and subsequent neuronal dysfunction. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors alleviate neurological phenotypes in fly and mouse models of polyQ disease, although the therapeutic effect is limited by the toxicity of these compounds. We studied the therapeutic effects of sodium butyrate (SB), an HDAC inhibitor, in a transgenic mouse model of SBMA. Oral administration of SB ameliorated neurological phenotypes as well as increased acetylation of nuclear histone in neural tissues. These therapeutic effects, however, were seen only within a narrow range of SB dosage. Our results indicate that SB is a possible therapeutic agent for SBMA and other polyQ diseases, although an appropriate dose should be determined for clinical application.",

Here, we show that ASC transplantation rescues the striatal pathology of Huntington disease (HD) models. METHODS: ASCs were isolated from human subcutaneous adipose tissue. In a quinolinic acid (QA)-induced rat model of striatal degeneration, human ASCs (1 million cells) were transplanted into the ipsilateral striatal border immediately after the QA injection. In 60-day-old R6/2 mice transgenic for HD, ASCs (0.5 million cells) were transplanted into each bilateral striata. In in vitro experiments, we treated mutant huntingtin gene-transfected cerebral neurons with ASC-conditioned media. RESULTS: In the QA model, human ASCs reduced apomorphine-induced rotation behavior, lesion volume, and striatal apoptosis. In R6/2 transgenic mice, transplantation of ASCs improved Rota-Rod performance and limb clasping, increased survival, attenuated the loss of striatal neurons, and reduced the huntingtin aggregates. ASC-transplanted R6/2 mice expressed elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and reactive oxygen defense enzymes and showed activation of the Akt/cAMP-response element-binding proteins. ASC-conditioned media decreased the level of N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin and associated apoptosis, and increased PGC-1alpha expression. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, ASC transplantation slowed striatal degeneration and behavioral deterioration of HD models, possibly via secreted factors.",

However, only in Huntington disease (HD) gain- and loss-of-function experiments have mechanistically linked these abnormalities with the genetic defect.In this chapter we will describe how huntingtin protein, whose mutation causes HD, is involved in the physiological control of BDNF synthesis and transport in neurons and how both processes are simultaneously disrupted in HD. We will describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and discuss pre-clinical data concerning the impact of the experimental manipulation of BDNF levels on HD progression. These studies have revealed that a major loss of BDNF protein in the brain of HD patients may contribute to the clinical manifestations of the disease. The experimental strategies under investigation to increase brain BDNF levels in animal models of HD will also be described, with a view to ultimately improving the clinical treatment of this condition.

OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluate the extent to which environmental enrichment can modify synaptic plasticity in the host-graft neuronal circuitry to try to find a physiological substrate for the observed improvements. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice, housed in enriched or standard environments, received unilateral quinolinic acid lesions of the striatum, followed by embryonic striatal grafts. Then, 3 months posttransplantation, synaptic physiology and plasticity were evaluated by extracellular recording from in vitro striatal slices. RESULTS: Environmental enrichment had no effect on the chance of long-term depression (LTD) induction or expression of LTD from either normal or grafted striatum. In contrast, enrichment increased the chance of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and level of expression associated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor within both the intact and grafted striatum compared with levels in the striatum of animals housed in standard environments. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental enrichment induces changes in host-graft corticostriatal LTP, thus providing a potential physiological substrate for the enrichment-induced improvement in motor and cognitive performance. The effect may be mediated by modulation of the trophic environment in which the grafted cells develop and integrate.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinician-rated measures of functioning are often used as primary endpoints in clinical trials and other behavioral research in Huntington disease. As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible, there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM: The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures, differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related assessments are not feasible.",

Previous research has shown suppression of just the mutant allele is achievable using siRNA targeted to regions of HD mRNA containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To determine whether more than a minority of patients may be eligible for an allele-specific therapy, we genotyped DNA from 327 unrelated European Caucasian HD patients at 26 SNP sites in the HD gene. Over 86% of the patients were found to be heterozygous for at least one SNP among those tested. Because the sites are genetically linked, one cannot use the heterozygosity rates of the individual SNPs to predict how many sites (and corresponding allele-specific siRNA) would be needed to provide at least one treatment possibility for this percentage of patients. By computing all combinations, we found that a repertoire of allele-specific siRNA corresponding to seven sites can provide at least one allele-specific siRNA treatment option for 85.6% of our sample. Moreover, we provide evidence that allele-specific siRNA targeting these sites are readily identifiable using a high throughput screening method, and that allele-specific siRNA identified using this method indeed show selective suppression of endogenous mutant htt protein in fibroblast cells from HD patients. Therefore, allele-specific siRNA are not so rare as to be impractical to find and use therapeutically.",

Sustained interventions, however, may not be the most feasible for lifelong disease management. It is critical, therefore, for physical therapists to find ways to facilitate engagement in independent exercise programs. The capabilities of DVD technology can make the DVD a useful format to facilitate engagement for people with HD who have motivational and cognitive problems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore how people with HD used a home-based exercise DVD and how it was perceived by the participants and their caregivers. DESIGN: An exploratory, mixed-method design was used in this study. METHODS: Fifteen participants with HD were provided with an exercise DVD, developed by the authors, to support their engagement in a home-based exercise program. Exercise diaries were used to record adherence rates. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore what factors affected the usability of the DVD. Conversations were audio recorded and fully transcribed. Content analysis approach was used to analyze the interviews. RESULTS: Most of the participants (11/15, 73.3%) adhered well to the use of the DVD. Participants felt that the exercises were suitable. Commitment of the caregiver as a key to the success of the program was the main theme that emerged from the data. Participants identified barriers and facilitators that affected adherence to using the exercise DVD and described management strategies that helped promote adherence to the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: The DVD was perceived to be suitable and supportive. The DVD could be appropriate for use in supporting people with HD to engage in exercise at home, either outside of therapy sessions or upon completion of a therapy program.",

Based on the knowledge of these immunomodulatory characteristics, fumaric acid esters have been shown to be effective or potentially effective in a multitude of dermatological as well as non-dermatological diseases. The range of new therapeutic targets reaches from multiple sclerosis to illnesses such as necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare and sarcoidosis.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that mHtt is capable of spreading within cerebral tissue by examining genetically unrelated fetal neural allografts within the brains of patients with advancing HD. METHODS: The presence of mHtt aggregates within the grafted tissue was confirmed using 3 different types of microscopy (bright-field, fluorescence, and electron), 2 additional techniques consisting of Western immunoblotting and infrared spectroscopy, and 4 distinct antibodies targeting different epitopes of mHtt aggregates. RESULTS: We describe the presence of mHtt aggregates within intracerebral allografts of striatal tissue in 3 HD patients who received their transplants approximately 1 decade earlier and then died secondary to the progression of their disease. The mHtt(+) aggregates were observed in the extracellular matrix of the transplanted tissue, whereas in the host brain they were seen in neurons, neuropil, extracellular matrix, and blood vessels. INTERPRETATION: This is the first demonstration of the presence of mHtt in genetically normal and unrelated allografted neural tissue transplanted into the brain of affected HD patients. These observations raise questions on protein spread in monogenic neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system characterized by the formation of mutant protein oligomers/aggregates.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECT: Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and morbidity in young adults, no effective pharmaceutical treatment is available. By inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively, lithium and valproate (VPA) have beneficial effects in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in an excitotoxic neuronal model and in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, and stroke, combined treatment with lithium and VPA produces more robust neuroprotective effects than treatment with either agent alone. Building on previous work that establishes that therapeutic doses of either lithium or VPA have beneficial effects in mouse models of TBI, this study evaluated the effects of combined treatment with subeffective doses of lithium and VPA in a mouse model of TBI. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent TBI and were subsequently treated with lithium, VPA, or a combination of lithium and VPA 15 minutes post-TBI and once daily thereafter for up to 3 weeks; all doses were subeffective (1 mEq/kg of lithium and 200 mg/kg of VPA). Assessed parameters included lesion volume via H & E staining; blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity via immunoglobulin G extravasation; neurodegeneration via Fluoro-Jade B staining; motor coordination via a beam-walk test; and protein levels of acetylhistone H3, phospho-GSK-3beta, and beta-catenin via Western blotting. RESULTS: Posttrauma treatment with combined subeffective doses of lithium and VPA significantly reduced lesion volume, attenuated BBB disruption, and mitigated hippocampal neurodegeneration 3 days after TBI. As expected, subeffective doses of lithium or VPA alone did not have these beneficial effects. Combined treatment also improved motor coordination starting from Day 7 and persisting at least 21 days after TBI. Acetylation of histone H3, an index of HDAC inhibition, was robustly increased by the combined treatment 3 days after TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Cotreatment with subeffective doses of lithium and VPA significantly attenuated TBI-induced brain lesion, BBB disruption, and neurodegeneration, and robustly improved long-term functional recovery. These findings suggest that potentiating histone acetylation by HDAC inhibition is probably part of the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects associated with this combined treatment for TBI. Because both lithium and VPA have a long history of safe clinical use, the results suggest that using a combination of these 2 agents at subtherapeutic doses to treat patients with TBI may also reduce side effects and enhance tolerability.",

This was followed by increased production of neurotoxic metabolite hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) in the striatum of symptomatic mice. We therefore hypothesized that the chronic Ido1 induction in the striatum of YAC128 mice leads to increased neurotoxicity in this mouse model; based on this hypothesis, we predicted that the absence of Ido1 expression would result in decreased sensitivity to neurotoxicity in mice. The work described in this brief communication will include the characterization of Ido(-/-) striatum in terms of enzymatic expression and activity in the first step of the pathway. Additionally, we assessed the sensitivity of the striatum to excitotoxic insult in the absence of Ido1 expression in the striatum of constitutive Ido1 null mice (Ido(-/-)) and demonstrated that Ido(-/-) mice are less sensitive to QA-induced striatal neurotoxicity. Finally, through measurement of kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites in Ido(-/-) mice, we showed decreased levels of 3-HK in the striatum of these mice. This study suggests that the inhibition of the first step in the KP may be neuroprotective and should be considered as a potential therapeutic target in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

METHODS: We examined factor structure (confirmatory factor analysis), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), floor and ceiling effects, convergent validity (Pearson correlations), and known-groups validity (multivariate analysis). RESULTS: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis replicated the six-factor latent model that reflects the six separate scales within the WHODAS 2.0 (understanding and communicating; getting around; self-care; getting along with others; life activities; participation). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.94, suggesting good internal consistency reliability. The WHODAS demonstrated a ceiling effect for 19.5 % of participants; there were no floor effects. There was evidence for convergent validity; the WHODAS demonstrated moderate significant correlations with other general measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL; i.e., RAND-12, EQ5D). Multivariate analyses indicated that late-stage HD participants indicated poorer HRQOL than both early-stage HD and prodromal HD participants for all HRQOL measures. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide support for both the reliability and validity of the WHODAS 2.0 in individuals with HD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the development and delivery of a 14-week complex physical activity intervention for people with Huntington disease, where detailed information about the intervention was fully embedded in the trial design process. METHODS: Intervention Development: The intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. The findings from the focus groups informed the development of a logic model for the physical activity intervention that was broadly consistent with the framework of self-determination theory. Intervention Delivery: Key components underpinning the delivery of the intervention were implemented including a defined coach training program and intervention fidelity assessment methods. Training of coaches (physical therapists, occupational therapists, research nurses, and exercise trainers) was delivered via group and 1:1 training sessions using a detailed coach's manual, and with ongoing support via video calls, and e-mail communication as needed. Detailed documentation was provided to determine costs of intervention development and coach training. RESULTS: Intervention delivery coaches at 8 sites across the United Kingdom participated in the face-to-face training. Self-report checklists completed by each of the coaches indicated that all components of the intervention were delivered in accordance with the protocol. Mean (standard deviation) intervention fidelity scores (n = 15), as measured using a purpose-developed rating scale, was 11 (2.4) (out of 16 possible points). Coaches' perceptions of intervention fidelity were similarly high. The total cost of developing the intervention and providing training was $30,773 ($47,042 USD). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: An important consideration in promoting translation of clinical research into practice is the ability to convey the detailed components of how the intervention was delivered to facilitate replication if the results are favorable. This report presents an illustrative example of a physical activity intervention, including the development and the training required to deliver it. This approach has the potential to facilitate reproducibility, evidence synthesis, and implementation in clinical practice.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A122).",

Cell replacement using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron. We have also shown that transplants elicited a significant improvement in sensory-motor tasks up to 2 months post-transplant further supporting the therapeutic potential of this approach.",

Although fetal neural transplantation has been tried in both preclinical and clinical investigations, the efficacy is not satisfactory. With the recent explosive progress of stem cell biology, application of stem cell-based therapy in HD is an exciting prospect. Three kinds of stem cells, embryonic stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells, have previously been utilized in cell therapy in animal models of neurological disorders. However, neural stem cells were preferably used by investigators in experimental HD studies, since they have a clear capacity to become neurons or glial cells after intracerebral or intravenous transplantation, and they induce functional recovery. In this review, we summarize the current state of cell therapy utilizing stem cells in experimental HD animal models, and discuss the future considerations for developing new therapeutic strategies using neural stem cells.",

Previously, we showed strong huntingtin reduction and prevention of neuronal dysfunction in HD rodents using an engineered microRNA targeting human huntingtin, delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 5 vector with a transgene encoding an engineered miRNA against HTT mRNA (AAV5-miHTT). One of the challenges of rodents as a model of neurodegenerative diseases is their relatively small brain, making successful translation to the HD patient difficult. This is particularly relevant for gene therapy approaches, where distribution achieved upon local administration into the parenchyma is likely dependent on brain size and structure. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the translation of huntingtin-lowering gene therapy to a large-animal brain. We investigated the feasibility, efficacy, and tolerability of one-time intracranial administration of AAV5-miHTT in the transgenic HD (tgHD) minipig model. We detected widespread dose-dependent distribution of AAV5-miHTT throughout the tgHD minipig brain that correlated with the engineered microRNA expression. Both human mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in all brain regions transduced by AAV5-miHTT. The combination of widespread vector distribution and extensive huntingtin lowering observed with AAV5-miHTT supports the translation of a huntingtin-lowering gene therapy for HD from preclinical studies into the clinic.",

Although the precise role of mhtt aggregates in the pathogenesis is unclear, attempts to reduce accumulated mhtt protein have ameliorated the phenotype in multiple cellular and in vivo HD models. Here, we provide critical results on intracranial delivery of a single-chain Fv intrabody, C4, which targets the first 17 amino acids of the htt protein, a region of httExon1 that is increasingly being recognized as pivotal. To assess long-term efficacy and safety issues, we used adenoassociated viral vectors (AAV2/1) to deliver intrabody genes to the striatum of inbred B6.HDR6/1 mice. Treatment initiation at various stages of the disease showed that early treatment preserved the largest number of cells without nuclear aggregates and that the accumulation of aggregated material could be delayed by several months. Even when intrabody treatment was not initiated until the clinical disease stage, significant, albeit smaller, effects were seen. These data indicate that neuronal intrabodies against critical N-terminal epitopes can be safely and effectively delivered using AAV2/1 to delay the aggregation phenotype during a sustained period in this HD model, even when delivery is initiated after disease onset.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Testosterone deficiency has been reported in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease, and Huntington disease. It is not known whether testosterone therapy (TT) in men with borderline hypogonadism and neurodegenerative diseases will be of substantial benefit. Previously, we reported that testosterone deficiency is more common in patients with PD compared with age-matched control subjects, and we also reported in 2 small open-label studies that some nonmotor symptoms responded favorably to TT. OBJECTIVE: To define the effects of TT on nonmotor and motor symptoms in men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. DESIGN: Double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center trial. PATIENTS: Two experimental groups: patients with PD who were receiving either TT or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either the study drug by intramuscular injection (200 mg/mL of testosterone enanthate every 2 weeks for 8 weeks) or placebo (isotonic sodium chloride solution injections). In patients in each group, the testosterone serum concentration was obtained at each study visit. During 2 study visits, testosterone levels were blindly evaluated and the intramuscular testosterone dose was increased by 200 mg/mL if the free testosterone value failed to double from the baseline value. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Questionnaire, and secondary outcome measures included measures of mood, cognition, fatigue, motor function, and frequency of adverse events. At the end of the double-blind phase, all patients were offered open-label TT and were followed up after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Fifteen patients in the placebo group (mean age, 69.9 years), receiving a mean total levodopa equivalent dose of 924 mg/d, had a baseline free testosterone level of 47.91 pg/mL, compared with 15 patients in the TT group (mean age, 66.7 years), receiving an average total levodopa equivalent dose of 734 mg/d, who had a baseline free testosterone level of 63.49 pg/mL. Testosterone was generally well tolerated. More subjects in the TT group experienced lower extremity edema (40% vs 20%). In 2 patients, 1 in each group, prostate-specific antigen levels were elevated from baseline. The improvement in the TT group compared with the placebo group (1.7 vs 1.1) on the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Scale was not statistically significant. In addition, there were no significant differences in motor and nonmotor features of PD between the 2 groups, although a few subscales showed improvements (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, P<.04; and Backward Visual Span subtrial, P<.03). However, long-term open-label TT resulted in delayed but sustained improvement in subjects in the TT group who continued to receive treatment (n = 6) compared with subjects in the placebo group who elected not to receive TT (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone therapy was generally well tolerated in elderly men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. While there was no significant difference in the motor and nonmotor scales between the TT and placebo groups at the end of 8 weeks compared with baseline, this may be due to several study limitations, including small sample size, a strong placebo effect with intramuscular therapy, and short follow-up that did not allow measurement of delayed effects of TT in some subjects. Until more definitive studies are reported, practitioners should be particularly cautious in treatment of low testosterone concentrations in men with PD and borderline testosterone deficiency, and careful consideration should be given to the risks vs the benefits of TT.",

The symptomatic stage of the disease is defined by the onset of motor symptoms. However, psychiatric disturbances, including depression, are common features of HD and can occur a decade before the manifestation of motor symptoms. We used the YAC128 transgenic mice (which develop motor deficits at a later stage, allowing more time to study depressive behaviors without the confounding effects of motor impairment) to test the effects of intranasal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment for 15 days in the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors. Using multiple well-validated behavioral tests, we found that BDNF treatment alleviated anhedonic and depressive-like behaviors in the YAC128 HD mice. Furthermore, we also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effects of BDNF were associated with an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, BDNF treatment only increased cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of wild-type (WT) mice, without altering these parameters in their YAC128 counterparts. Moreover, BDNF treatment did not cause an increase in the number of dendritic branches in the hippocampal DG when compared with animals treated with vehicle. In conclusion, our results suggest that non-invasive administration of BDNF via the intranasal route may have important therapeutic potential for treating mood disturbances in early-symptomatic HD patients.",

However, the invasive nature of surgical procedure and its potential to trigger the host immune response may limit its clinical use. Hence, we sought to evaluate the non-invasive intranasal administration (INA) of MSC delivery as an effective alternative route in HD. GFP-expressing MSCs derived from bone marrow were intranasally administered to 4-week-old R6/2 HD transgenic mice. MSCs were detected in the olfactory bulb, midbrain and striatum five days post-delivery. Compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated littermates, MSC-treated R6/2 mice showed an increased survival rate and attenuated circadian activity disruption assessed by locomotor activity. MSCs increased the protein expression of DARPP-32 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and downregulated gene expression of inflammatory modulators in the brain 7.5 weeks after INA. While vehicle treated R6/2 mice displayed decreased Iba1 expression and altered microglial morphology in comparison to the wild type littermates, MSCs restored both, Iba1 level and the thickness of microglial processes in the striatum of R6/2 mice. Our results demonstrate significantly ameliorated phenotypes of R6/2 mice after MSCs administration via INA, suggesting this method as an effective delivering route of cells to the brain for HD therapy.",

Using a new phenotypic model of HD recently designed in primates, we demonstrate here complete and persistent recovery in a frontal-type cognitive task two to five months after intrastriatal allografting. The striatal allografts also reduce the occurrence of dystonia, a major abnormal movement associated with HD. These results show the capacity of fetal neurons to provide a renewed substrate for both cognitive and motor systems in the lesioned adult brain. They also support the use of neural transplantation as a potential therapy for HD.",

                    "abstract": "Transgenic R6/2 mice, which express exon 1 of the human mutant Huntington disease gene, develop behavioral and neuropathological changes that bear some resemblance to the human disease. Several studies have shown that elevated glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels can exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of Huntington disease that are based on intrastriatal injections of excitotoxins. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether intrastriatal delivery of the GDNF gene by lentivirus (LV-GDNF) could provide structural and functional protection in R6/2 transgenic mice. Four- to 5-week-old mice were left untreated or alternatively received intrastriatal injections of either LV-GDNF or the same viral vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) (LV-GFP) as a control. During the 4-week follow-up period, there was the expected deterioration in performance of the R6/2 mice in paw clasping, rotarod, and open field tests, and the LV-GDNF treated mice showed no improvement over controls. ELISA showed that the LV-GDNF-injected animals had a significant increase in GDNF level in the striatum, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GDNF was also overexpressed in brain regions receiving striatal projections. However, GDNF overexpression had no effect on the neuropathological changes examined. Thus, there were no significant differences in the number of EM-48-positive intraneuronal huntingtin inclusions, number of BrdU-positive cells and size of striatal neuronal cross-sectional area. These results suggest that intrastriatal lentiviral vector transfer of GDNF, performed at 5 weeks of age, does not ameliorate neurological and behavioral impairments in the R6/2 transgenic mice model of HD. Further studies are, however, needed to investigate if GDNF given at earlier time points is beneficial.",

Neurotrophic factors have demonstrated neuroprotective actions on striatal neurons, suggesting that increased neurotrophic factor expression may prevent or reduce neuronal loss in the HD brain. We investigated whether enhanced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), achieved by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery, could protect striatal neurons in the quinolinic acid (QA) rodent model of HD. Adult Wistar rats received unilateral intrastriatal injections of AAV-BDNF, AAV-GDNF, AAV-GFP, or PBS. Three weeks later, the rats were lesioned with QA, a toxin that induces striatal neuron death by an excitotoxic process. Both AAV-BDNF and AAV-GDNF significantly reduced the loss of both NeuN- and calbindin-immunopositive striatal neurons 2 weeks after lesion compared to controls. AAV-BDNF also provided significant neurotrophic support to NOS-immunopositive striatal interneurons, while AAV-GDNF-treated rats demonstrated significant protection of parvalbumin-immunopositive striatal interneurons compared to controls. These results indicate that AAV-mediated gene transfer of BDNF or GDNF into the striatum provides neuronal protection in a rodent model of HD.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The RA-loaded SLNs was prepared by the hot homogenization technique, in which glycerol monostearate (GMS) as lipid, tween 80 and soya lecithin were used as surfactant along with hydrogenated soya phosphatidyl choline (HSPC) as a stabilizer, and were characterized for particle size, zeta potential (ZP), in vitro study. Nasal delivery of the developed formulation followed by the study of behavioral (locomotor, narrow beam, body weight) and biochemical parameters (glutathione, lipid peroxidation, catalase and nitrite) in wistar rat was carried out. RESULTS: Optimized RA-loaded SLNs using tween 80 (SLNPRT) have the mean size of (149.2 +- 3.2 nm), ZP (-38.27 mV) entrapment efficiency (61.9 +- 2.2%). 3-NP-treated rat significantly increased behavioral alterations, oxidative damage as compared with the control group. SLNPRT treatment significantly improved behavioral abnormalities and attenuated the oxidative stress in 3NP-treated rats. However, the nasal delivery of SLNPRT produced significant therapeutic action as compared to intravenous application. In the organ distribution study, brain drug concentration was found to be 5.69 microg, in pharmacokinetic study Cmax, tmax, t1/2, AUC values were found to be 0.284 microg/ml, 1.5 h, 3.17 h, and 1.505 microg/ml/h, respectively. CONCLUSION: The encouraging results confirmed the developed optimized RA-loaded SLNs formulation following the non-invasive nose-to-brain drug delivery that is a promising therapeutic approach for the effective management in Huntington disease.",

Although the interplay between perturbed BBB homeostasis and the pathogenesis of brain disorders needs further investigation, the development and validation of a reliable procedure to accurately detect BBB alterations may be crucial and represent a useful tool for potentially predicting disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we present an easy and efficient procedure for evaluating BBB leakage in a neurodegenerative condition like that occurring in a preclinical mouse model of Huntington disease, in which defects in the permeability of BBB are clearly detectable precociously in the disease. Specifically, the high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled (FITC)-albumin, which is able to cross the BBB only when the latter is impaired, is acutely infused into a mouse jugular vein and its distribution in the vascular or parenchymal districts is then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of green fluorescent-albumin in the brain parenchyma functions as an index of aberrant BBB permeability and, when quantitated by using Image J processing software, is reported as Green Fluorescence Intensity.",

HD is characterized by the loss of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs). To date, there is no treatment for HD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a substantial therapeutic opportunity for the HD treatment. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic potential of human immature dental pulp stem cells (hIDPSC), a special type of MSC originated from the neural crest, for HD treatment. Two different doses of hIDPSC were intravenously administrated in a subacute 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP)-induced rat model. We demonstrated hIDPSC homing in the striatum, cortex and subventricular zone using specific markers for human cells. Thirty days after hIDPSC administration, the cells found in the brain are still express hallmarks of undifferentiated MSC. Immunohistochemistry quantities analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of BDNF, DARPP32 and D2R positive stained cells in the striatum and cortex in the groups that received hIDPSC. The differences were more expressive in animals that received only one administration of hIDPSC. Altogether, these data suggest that the intravenous administration of hIDPSCs can restore the BDNF, DARPP32 and D2R expression, promoting neuroprotection and neurogenesis.",

Although fetal neural transplantation has been tried in both preclinical and clinical investigations, the efficacy is not satisfactory. With the recent explosive progress of stem cell biology, application of stem cell-based therapy in HD is an exciting prospect. Three kinds of stem cells, embryonic stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells, have previously been utilized in cell therapy in animal models of neurological disorders. However, neural stem cells were preferably used by investigators in experimental HD studies, since they have a clear capacity to become neurons or glial cells after intracerebral or intravenous transplantation, and they induce functional recovery. In this review, we summarize the current state of cell therapy utilizing stem cells in experimental HD animal models, and discuss the future considerations for developing new therapeutic strategies using neural stem cells.",

Iron is thought to participate or initiate oxidative stress via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radical. Iron chelators are neuroprotective and prevent 6-hydroxydoapmine and MPTP dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rats and mice. However, their action on monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B have not been determined previously since MAO-B inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease. The chelators 8-hydroxyquinoline, O-phenanthroline, 2,2'-dipyridyl, U74500A and U74600F showed a preference for inhibition of rat brain mitochondrial MAO-A over MAO-B. Their IC(50) ranged from 10(-3) M to 10(-6) M, with 21-amino steroids (U74500A and U74006F) showing a greater selectivity and potency for MAO-A. Desferrioxamine (desferal), a prototype potent iron chelator, exhibited relatively poor MAO inhibitory. The inhibitions of MAO-A and B by 21-amino steroids (Lazaroids) were time dependent and irreversible. Those initiated by 8-hydroxyquinoline, 2,2'-dipyridyl and O-phenanthroline were fully reversible by enzyme dilution experiments. Both Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) reverse the MAO-A and B inhibition induced by the latter chelators, but not those initiated by 21-amino steroids. The data infer that either the inhibition of MAO by 21-amino steroids is either the resultant of their conversion to an irreversible covalently bound ligand or that the iron chelation moiety and MAO inhibitory activity in these compounds are not mutually shared. The results suggest that bifunctional brain penetrable drugs with iron chelating property and MAO inhibitory activity in could be the most feasible approach for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. Such drug would prevent participation of elevated iron in oxidative stress and formation of reactive hydroxyl radical, via its interaction with H(2)O2 (Fenton chemistry), generated as a consequence MAO and other oxidative enzyme reactions to generative cytotoxic reactive hydroxyl radical. We have now developed several of these compounds with neuroprotective, MAO inhibitory and iron chelating properties from our prototype iron chelators, VK-28 possessing propargylamine moiety of our anti-parkinson drug, rasagiline.",

                    "abstract": "Iron has been shown to accumulates at site where neurons degenerate in neurodegenerative diseases of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Friedreich ataxia. Iron is thought to participate or initiate oxidative stress via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radical. Iron chelators are neuroprotective and prevent 6-hydroxydoapmine and MPTP dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rats and mice. However, their action on monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B have not been determined previously since MAO-B inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease. The chelators 8-hydroxyquinoline, O-phenanthroline, 2,2'-dipyridyl, U74500A and U74600F showed a preference for inhibition of rat brain mitochondrial MAO-A over MAO-B. Their IC(50) ranged from 10(-3) M to 10(-6) M, with 21-amino steroids (U74500A and U74006F) showing a greater selectivity and potency for MAO-A. Desferrioxamine (desferal), a prototype potent iron chelator, exhibited relatively poor MAO inhibitory. The inhibitions of MAO-A and B by 21-amino steroids (Lazaroids) were time dependent and irreversible. Those initiated by 8-hydroxyquinoline, 2,2'-dipyridyl and O-phenanthroline were fully reversible by enzyme dilution experiments. Both Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) reverse the MAO-A and B inhibition induced by the latter chelators, but not those initiated by 21-amino steroids. The data infer that either the inhibition of MAO by 21-amino steroids is either the resultant of their conversion to an irreversible covalently bound ligand or that the iron chelation moiety and MAO inhibitory activity in these compounds are not mutually shared. The results suggest that bifunctional brain penetrable drugs with iron chelating property and MAO inhibitory activity in could be the most feasible approach for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. Such drug would prevent participation of elevated iron in oxidative stress and formation of reactive hydroxyl radical, via its interaction with H(2)O2 (Fenton chemistry), generated as a consequence MAO and other oxidative enzyme reactions to generative cytotoxic reactive hydroxyl radical. We have now developed several of these compounds with neuroprotective, MAO inhibitory and iron chelating properties from our prototype iron chelators, VK-28 possessing propargylamine moiety of our anti-parkinson drug, rasagiline.",

Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

                    "abstract": "Most human tissues do not regenerate spontaneously; this is why cell therapies and tissue engineering are promising alternatives. The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..). A large number of clinical areas stand as candidates for clinical applications: leukaemia and cancers, cardiac insufficiency and vascular diseases, cartilage and bone repair, ligaments and tendons, liver diseases, ophthalmology, diabetes, neurological diseases (Parkinson, Huntington disease, ..), ..

Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.

RESULTS: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis replicated the six-factor latent model that reflects the six separate scales within the WHODAS 2.0 (understanding and communicating; getting around; self-care; getting along with others; life activities; participation). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.94, suggesting good internal consistency reliability. The WHODAS demonstrated a ceiling effect for 19.5 % of participants; there were no floor effects. There was evidence for convergent validity; the WHODAS demonstrated moderate significant correlations with other general measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL; i.e., RAND-12, EQ5D). Multivariate analyses indicated that late-stage HD participants indicated poorer HRQOL than both early-stage HD and prodromal HD participants for all HRQOL measures.

Preclinical findings suggest potential teratogenicity of laquinimod, thus the reproductive ability of females with HD treated with laquinimod needs to be closely managed. Because combined oral contraceptives (COC) are often used in this context, the pharmacokinetics of COC containing ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with laquinimod (0.6 mg/day) was evaluated. METHODS: In this randomized, phase-1 single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in 48 healthy premenopausal women, COC were administered in a 28-day regimen of 21 days followed by 7 pill-free days for 4 cycles and laquinimod or placebo was administered for 28 days in cycle 1 and cycle 3 starting 7 days prior to COC administration. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling of laquinimod, EE and LNG were collected on day 21 and day 22 of Cycles 1 and 3 pre-dose and multiple times post-dose. RESULTS: The ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-24 and Cmax of EE and LNG with and without laquinimod were all within the bioequivalence range (80 to 125%). Laquinimod pharmacokinetics was consistent with those observed in previous studies. The adverse event profile was in line with the current knowledge on the safety profile of both drugs, with headache as the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event.

                    "abstract": "Transgenic R6/2 mice, which express exon 1 of the human mutant Huntington disease gene, develop behavioral and neuropathological changes that bear some resemblance to the human disease. Several studies have shown that elevated glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels can exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of Huntington disease that are based on intrastriatal injections of excitotoxins. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether intrastriatal delivery of the GDNF gene by lentivirus (LV-GDNF) could provide structural and functional protection in R6/2 transgenic mice. Four- to 5-week-old mice were left untreated or alternatively received intrastriatal injections of either LV-GDNF or the same viral vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) (LV-GFP) as a control. During the 4-week follow-up period, there was the expected deterioration in performance of the R6/2 mice in paw clasping, rotarod, and open field tests, and the LV-GDNF treated mice showed no improvement over controls. ELISA showed that the LV-GDNF-injected animals had a significant increase in GDNF level in the striatum, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GDNF was also overexpressed in brain regions receiving striatal projections. However, GDNF overexpression had no effect on the neuropathological changes examined. Thus, there were no significant differences in the number of EM-48-positive intraneuronal huntingtin inclusions, number of BrdU-positive cells and size of striatal neuronal cross-sectional area. These results suggest that intrastriatal lentiviral vector transfer of GDNF, performed at 5 weeks of age, does not ameliorate neurological and behavioral impairments in the R6/2 transgenic mice model of HD. Further studies are, however, needed to investigate if GDNF given at earlier time points is beneficial.",

Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

In this study we used alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency with the piZZ mutant phenotype as a model system to evaluate the efficiency of gene-delivery approaches that both silence the piZZ transcript (e.g., shRNA) and restore circulating wild-type AAT expression from resistant codon-optimized AAT (AAT-opt) transgene cassette using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivery. After systemic injection of a self-complimentary AAV serotype 8 (scAAV8) vector encoding shRNA in piZZ transgenic mice, both mutant AAT mRNA in the liver and defected serum protein level were inhibited by 95%, whereas liver pathology, as monitored by dPAS and fibrosis staining, reversed. To restore blood AAT levels in AAV8/shRNA-treated mice, several strategies to restore functional AAT levels were tested, including using AAV AAT-opt transgene cassettes targeted to muscle and liver, or combination vectors carrying piZZ shRNA and AAT-opt transgenes separately, or a single bicistronic AAV vector. With these molecular approaches, we observed over 90% knockdown of mutant AAT with a 13- to 30-fold increase of circulating wild-type AAT protein from the shRNA-resistant AAT-opt cassette. The molecular approaches applied in this study can simultaneously prevent liver pathology and restore blood AAT concentration in AAT deficiencies. Based on these observations, similar gene-therapy strategies could be considered for any diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins.",

METHODS: Spanish participants of the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN) Registry study diagnosed with HD or premanifest HD gene carriers were included from June 2012 to August 2013. Self-reported dietary intake was collected by 3-day dietary record, MeDi adherence was assessed by 0-9 range (proposed by Trichopoulou et al.) and, other contributing factors related to nutrition were collected by telephone. Demographics and clinical variables were obtained from the EHDN Registry study database. Association of HD with MeDi adherence and nutritional characteristics were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48 years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range). HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however, quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P = 0.013). Moderate adherence to MeDi, was associated with older participants (OR = 1.19, P = 0.031), lower comorbidity (OR = 0.18, P = 0.018), lower UHDRS motor (OR = 0.90, P = 0.041), and lower risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.02, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In HD the moderate MeDi adherence is associated with better quality of life, lower comorbidity, lower motor impairment and lower risk for abdominal obesity compared to those participants with low MeDi adherence.",

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of nutritional factors with HD severity. METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional, national multicenter study. Participants were selected from a Spanish cohort of patients who participate in the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN). The frequency of food consumption, caloric and nutrients intake in patients with HD were assessed using validated questionnaires for the Spanish population, and calculated using Alimentaci on and Salud, version 2.0, and the Spanish Dietary Recommended Intakes were used as the gold standard. Disease severity was assessed using the Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) and Total Functional Capacity (TFC). Logistic regression models were performed using the TFC as the dependent variable, and the macro-micronutrients as the independent variables, adjusted for age, gender, education, physical activity, and intake of supplements. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty four patients with HD were included (59% women), mean age of 47.41+-14.26 years, median TFC 9 (3-13), median UHDRS motor score of 33.5 (3.75-56), 75.8% with normal-high caloric intake, 55.4% normal BMI, and 54.4% with medium-high adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Compared to patients with mild-moderate HD, patients with severe HD had higher caloric intake (p = 0.02), and similar BMI (p = 0.33). Advanced HD was associated with higher intake of water-soluble vitamins (OR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.12-3.85, p = 0.02), and minerals (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.09- 3.19, p = 0.02).

Lowering the mutant gene expression is predicted to slow the disease progression and produce clinical benefit. Administration of small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence specific genes. However, long term delivery of siRNA to silence the mutant genes, a requirement for treatment of these chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases, remains a critical unsolved issue. Here we designed and tested a chemically stabilized siRNA against human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We show that the modified siRNA has enhanced stability and retains siRNA activity. Administration of this siRNA at the disease onset by long term infusion into the CNS resulted in widespread distribution of this siRNA, knocked down the mutant SOD1 expression, slowed the disease progression, and extended the survival. These results bring RNA interference therapy one step closer to its clinical application for treatment of chronic, devastating, and fatal CNS disorders.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate CAG repeat length (36-39) of the Huntingtin gene, HTT. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation 0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To delineate the progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: A survey of individuals with symptomatic HD completed by a first-degree relative. SETTING: The National Huntington Disease Research Roster for Patients and Families, Indianapolis, Ind. PARTICIPANTS: The survey included 1238 individuals with a minimum of a 6-year history of symptomatic HD. MEASURES: Participating families completed a series of surveys, including the Affected Individual Questionnaire, which consists of 19 physical, emotional, and cognitive signs commonly thought to occur during disease progression. The respondent indicates if each of the symptoms occurred and, if so, at what time during the course of the disease: (1) within 1 year, (2) within 2 to 5 years, (3) within 6 to 10 years, (4) after more than 10 years, (5) has not occurred, or (6) \"don't know.\" RESULTS: The symptoms are categorized into 6 onset periods. Involuntary movements are grouped alone as the earliest reported symptom. The second group is composed entirely of mental and emotional symptoms, including sadness, depression, and difficult to get along with. The third group includes clumsiness, sexual problems, lack of motivation, and suspiciousness/paranoia. As the disease progresses, a variety of motor, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive symptoms are experienced, including unsteadiness, trouble holding onto things, trouble walking, changes in sleeping patterns, delusions and hallucinations, intellectual decline, and memory loss. With the approach of late-stage HD, affected individuals begin to experience speech difficulty and weight loss. In the late stage, patients lose bowel and bladder control. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the symptoms of HD are fairly well characterized, their progression, especially in the early and middle stages, remains uncertain. Clarification of the disease progression is vital to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HD and to the evaluation of therapeutic agents that are designed to slow the progression of disease. The results of this study assist in clarifying HD progression from early involuntary movements and emotional changes to more overt motor symptoms and difficulty with activities of daily living.",

He had depression, poor cognitive function, choreiform movements, difficulty pronouncing words, and difficulty walking. His symptoms had worsened markedly over several months. Chorea lead to genetic testing that confirmed a diagnosis of Huntington Disease (HD). A CT scan of the head showed wider ventricles than is typical of HD. The head CT and gait change suggested normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Lumbar puncture (LP) led to improved neuropsychologic test scores and walking thereby supporting the diagnosis of NPH. Surprisingly, the LP also led to an 80% improvement of chorea. There are two other reports of an association between HD and NPH. NPH should be considered in HD patients with atypical symptoms, such as the inability to walk or rapid progression, as its treatment may lead to improved cognition, gait, and chorea.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Deutetrabenazine is a novel molecule containing deuterium, which attenuates CYP2D6 metabolism and increases active metabolite half-lives and may therefore lead to stable systemic exposure while preserving key pharmacological activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine treatment to control chorea associated with Huntington disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest Huntington disease and a baseline total maximal chorea score of 8 or higher (range, 0-28; lower score indicates less chorea) were enrolled from August 2013 to August 2014 and randomized to receive deutetrabenazine (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45) in a double-blind fashion at 34 Huntington Study Group sites. INTERVENTIONS: Deutetrabenazine or placebo was titrated to optimal dose level over 8 weeks and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was the total maximal chorea score change from baseline (the average of values from the screening and day-0 visits) to maintenance therapy (the average of values from the week 9 and 12 visits) obtained by in-person visits. This study was designed to detect a 2.7-unit treatment difference in scores. The secondary end points, assessed hierarchically, were the proportion of patients who achieved treatment success on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the change in 36-Item Short Form- physical functioning subscale score (SF-36), and the change in the Berg Balance Test. RESULTS: Ninety patients with Huntington disease (mean age, 53.7 years; 40 women [44.4%]) were enrolled. In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean total maximal chorea scores improved from 12.1 (95% CI, 11.2-12.9) to 7.7 (95% CI, 6.5-8.9), whereas in the placebo group, scores improved from 13.2 (95% CI, 12.2-14.3) to 11.3 (95% CI, 10.0-12.5); the mean between-group difference was -2.5 units (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.3) (P < .001). Treatment success, as measured by the PGIC, occurred in 23 patients (51%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 9 (20%) in the placebo group (P = .002). As measured by the CGIC, treatment success occurred in 19 patients (42%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 6 (13%) in the placebo group (P = .002). In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean SF-36 physical functioning subscale scores decreased from 47.5 (95% CI, 44.3-50.8) to 47.4 (44.3-50.5), whereas in the placebo group, scores decreased from 43.2 (95% CI, 40.2-46.3) to 39.9 (95% CI, 36.2-43.6), for a treatment benefit of 4.3 (95% CI, 0.4 to 8.3) (P = .03). There was no difference between groups (mean difference of 1.0 unit; 95% CI, -0.3 to 2.3; P = .14), for improvement in the Berg Balance Test, which improved by 2.2 units (95% CI, 1.3-3.1) in the deutetrabenazine group and by 1.3 units (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) in the placebo group. Adverse event rates were similar for deutetrabenazine and placebo, including depression, anxiety, and akathisia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in improved motor signs at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of the effect size and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01795859.",

To date, very few quantitative or qualitative studies have been conducted to guide physical therapists working with people with HD. The objective of this study was to characterize current physical therapist practice for people with HD, thus informing the development of standardized clinical care and future research studies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consultation with physical therapists working with people with HD was undertaken in the form of mailed questionnaires (n=49) and semistructured interviews (n=8). The development of the interview schedule was aided by consideration of the data obtained from the questionnaires. Themes identified from the interviews were considered in light of published literature and questionnaire responses. RESULTS: The main issues that emerged from the interviews were classified into 3 subthemes: (1) there is insufficient use of routine physical therapy-related outcome measures at different stages of HD, (2) there is underutilization of physical therapy services in managing HD (particularly in the early stages), and (3) the management of falls and mobility deficit progression is a key treatment aim for people with HD. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A conceptual framework for physical therapy intervention in HD was developed on the basis of the themes that emerged from the data in this study. Such a framework has utility for complex, progressive conditions such as HD and may facilitate clinical decision making and standardization of practice and affect the development of future physical therapy trials.",

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha mediates a broad, evolutionarily conserved, endogenous adaptive program to hypoxia, and manipulation of components of the HIF pathway is neuroprotective in a number of human neurological diseases and experimental models. In this review, we discuss molecular components of one aspect of hypoxic adaptation in detail and provide perspective on which targets within this pathway seem to be ripest for preventing and repairing neurodegeneration. Further, we highlight the role of HIF prolyl hydroxylases as emerging targets for the salutary effects of metal chelators on ferroptosis in vitro as well in animal models of neurological diseases. ",

The heat shock protein 90 and 70 (Hsp90/Hsp70) chaperone machinery is a key component of cellular protein quality control, playing a role in the regulation of folding, aggregation, and degradation of polyQ proteins. The ability of Hsp70 to facilitate disaggregation and degradation of misfolded proteins makes it an attractive therapeutic target in polyQ diseases. Genetic studies have demonstrated that manipulation of Hsp70 and related co-chaperones can enhance the disaggregation and/or degradation of misfolded proteins in models of polyQ disease. Therefore, the development of small molecules that enhance Hsp70 activity is of great interest. However, it is still unclear if currently available Hsp70 modulators can selectively enhance disaggregation or degradation of misfolded proteins without perturbing other Hsp70 functions essential for cellular homeostasis. This review discusses the multifaceted role of Hsp70 in protein quality control and the opportunities and challenges Hsp70 poses as a potential therapeutic target in polyQ disease.",

                    "abstract": "Iron has been shown to accumulates at site where neurons degenerate in neurodegenerative diseases of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Friedreich ataxia. Iron is thought to participate or initiate oxidative stress via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radical. Iron chelators are neuroprotective and prevent 6-hydroxydoapmine and MPTP dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rats and mice. However, their action on monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B have not been determined previously since MAO-B inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease. The chelators 8-hydroxyquinoline, O-phenanthroline, 2,2'-dipyridyl, U74500A and U74600F showed a preference for inhibition of rat brain mitochondrial MAO-A over MAO-B. Their IC(50) ranged from 10(-3) M to 10(-6) M, with 21-amino steroids (U74500A and U74006F) showing a greater selectivity and potency for MAO-A. Desferrioxamine (desferal), a prototype potent iron chelator, exhibited relatively poor MAO inhibitory. The inhibitions of MAO-A and B by 21-amino steroids (Lazaroids) were time dependent and irreversible. Those initiated by 8-hydroxyquinoline, 2,2'-dipyridyl and O-phenanthroline were fully reversible by enzyme dilution experiments. Both Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) reverse the MAO-A and B inhibition induced by the latter chelators, but not those initiated by 21-amino steroids. The data infer that either the inhibition of MAO by 21-amino steroids is either the resultant of their conversion to an irreversible covalently bound ligand or that the iron chelation moiety and MAO inhibitory activity in these compounds are not mutually shared. The results suggest that bifunctional brain penetrable drugs with iron chelating property and MAO inhibitory activity in could be the most feasible approach for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. Such drug would prevent participation of elevated iron in oxidative stress and formation of reactive hydroxyl radical, via its interaction with H(2)O2 (Fenton chemistry), generated as a consequence MAO and other oxidative enzyme reactions to generative cytotoxic reactive hydroxyl radical. We have now developed several of these compounds with neuroprotective, MAO inhibitory and iron chelating properties from our prototype iron chelators, VK-28 possessing propargylamine moiety of our anti-parkinson drug, rasagiline.",

This was followed by increased production of neurotoxic metabolite hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) in the striatum of symptomatic mice. We therefore hypothesized that the chronic Ido1 induction in the striatum of YAC128 mice leads to increased neurotoxicity in this mouse model; based on this hypothesis, we predicted that the absence of Ido1 expression would result in decreased sensitivity to neurotoxicity in mice. The work described in this brief communication will include the characterization of Ido(-/-) striatum in terms of enzymatic expression and activity in the first step of the pathway. Additionally, we assessed the sensitivity of the striatum to excitotoxic insult in the absence of Ido1 expression in the striatum of constitutive Ido1 null mice (Ido(-/-)) and demonstrated that Ido(-/-) mice are less sensitive to QA-induced striatal neurotoxicity. Finally, through measurement of kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites in Ido(-/-) mice, we showed decreased levels of 3-HK in the striatum of these mice. This study suggests that the inhibition of the first step in the KP may be neuroprotective and should be considered as a potential therapeutic target in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

Abnormal responses to anesthesia have been reported in case reports and raised concerns regarding the safety of anesthesia in this patient population. METHODS: We performed a computerized search of the Mayo Clinic medical records database searching for patients with HD who underwent general anesthesia. Medical records were reviewed for anesthetic technique, medications used, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: We identified 11 patients with genetically confirmed HD who underwent 17 general anesthetics. Psychiatric medication use was common, with 6 patients using antipsychotics, 7 patients using antidepressants, and 3 patients using benzodiazepines. Succinylcholine was used in 7 anesthetics, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs in 11 anesthetics, all without adverse effects. Patients had normal responses to induction and maintenance of anesthesia without adverse effects. Serious postoperative complications did not occur. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous case reports, we found that patients with HD have normal responses to general anesthesia. However, the anesthesiologist should be aware of interactions between anesthetics and psychiatric medications frequently used by these patients. Measures should also be taken to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration because bulbar dysfunction may be a manifestation of this disease.",

METHODS: Spanish participants of the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN) Registry study diagnosed with HD or premanifest HD gene carriers were included from June 2012 to August 2013. Self-reported dietary intake was collected by 3-day dietary record, MeDi adherence was assessed by 0-9 range (proposed by Trichopoulou et al.) and, other contributing factors related to nutrition were collected by telephone. Demographics and clinical variables were obtained from the EHDN Registry study database. Association of HD with MeDi adherence and nutritional characteristics were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48 years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range). HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however, quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P = 0.013). Moderate adherence to MeDi, was associated with older participants (OR = 1.19, P = 0.031), lower comorbidity (OR = 0.18, P = 0.018), lower UHDRS motor (OR = 0.90, P = 0.041), and lower risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.02, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In HD the moderate MeDi adherence is associated with better quality of life, lower comorbidity, lower motor impairment and lower risk for abdominal obesity compared to those participants with low MeDi adherence.",

Among the various options, the development of antisense oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus. Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene therapy against Huntington's disease.",

                    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease affect any part of the brain. The complete mechanism of ND is unknown, but there are some molecular mechanism and chemical process. Natural compounds have better compatibility with the human body along with lesser side effects. Moreover, several studies showed that various natural compounds have significant neuroprotective, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for treating the different type of ND. In ND, natural compounds act by various mechanisms such as preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating destructed biomolecules before their accumulation affects cell metabolism, and improving the disease conditions. But due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) layer and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds, their delivery into the brain is limited. To minimize this problem and enhance drug delivery into the brain with an effective therapeutic dose, there is a need to develop a practical novel approach. The various studies showed that nanoformulations and microneedles (MN) containing natural compounds such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, chrysin, piperine, ferulic acid, huperzine A, berberine, baicalein, hesperetin, and retinoic acid effectively improved many ND. In this review, the effect of such natural drug-loaded nanoformulation and MN patches on ND management is discussed, along with their merits and demerits. This review aims to introduce different novel approaches for enhancing natural drug delivery into the brain to manage various neurodegenerative diseases.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that mHtt is capable of spreading within cerebral tissue by examining genetically unrelated fetal neural allografts within the brains of patients with advancing HD. METHODS: The presence of mHtt aggregates within the grafted tissue was confirmed using 3 different types of microscopy (bright-field, fluorescence, and electron), 2 additional techniques consisting of Western immunoblotting and infrared spectroscopy, and 4 distinct antibodies targeting different epitopes of mHtt aggregates. RESULTS: We describe the presence of mHtt aggregates within intracerebral allografts of striatal tissue in 3 HD patients who received their transplants approximately 1 decade earlier and then died secondary to the progression of their disease. The mHtt(+) aggregates were observed in the extracellular matrix of the transplanted tissue, whereas in the host brain they were seen in neurons, neuropil, extracellular matrix, and blood vessels. INTERPRETATION: This is the first demonstration of the presence of mHtt in genetically normal and unrelated allografted neural tissue transplanted into the brain of affected HD patients. These observations raise questions on protein spread in monogenic neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system characterized by the formation of mutant protein oligomers/aggregates.",

The study aimed to assess the self-awareness of memory impairment in HD in comparison to advanced Parkinson disease (PD), mild PD and cervical dystonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-awareness was tested in 23 patients with HD by comparing patient and caregiver ratings in reference to clinical control groups (25 patients with advanced PD, 21 with mild PD and 20 with cervical dystonia). Self-awareness was tested using the Self Rating Scale of Memory Functions, which was administered to both the patients and the caregivers. Neuropsychological assessment addressed general cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination), verbal learning (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 15-word list) and mood (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). RESULTS: Patients with HD significantly underestimated their memory dysfunction. Underestimation of memory deficit correlated with disease duration and disease severity in HD. CONCLUSIONS: Huntington disease patients underestimate memory dysfunction. These results add to the previous reports on poor insight in HD in other domains and suggest that anosognosia in HD, albeit usually rather mild, may be a generalized phenomenon.",

METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation 0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors.",

METHODS: Huntington Disease (HD) had to be diagnosed using short tandem repeat (STR) markers linked to the HTT gene. The mutation c.1551_1552ins20 was analyzed by fragment size and c.859G>C was minisequenced. Furthermore, STR markers linked to the POR gene were included to support the diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase (POR) deficiency. RESULTS: Nine embryos were diagnosed in total: three as POR deficiency affected, two as HD affected, one as POR deficiency and HD affected, and two as carriers of the paternal POR deficiency mutation and healthy for HD. These two last embryos were transferred but no pregnancy was achieved.

To date, very few quantitative or qualitative studies have been conducted to guide physical therapists working with people with HD. The objective of this study was to characterize current physical therapist practice for people with HD, thus informing the development of standardized clinical care and future research studies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consultation with physical therapists working with people with HD was undertaken in the form of mailed questionnaires (n=49) and semistructured interviews (n=8). The development of the interview schedule was aided by consideration of the data obtained from the questionnaires. Themes identified from the interviews were considered in light of published literature and questionnaire responses. RESULTS: The main issues that emerged from the interviews were classified into 3 subthemes: (1) there is insufficient use of routine physical therapy-related outcome measures at different stages of HD, (2) there is underutilization of physical therapy services in managing HD (particularly in the early stages), and (3) the management of falls and mobility deficit progression is a key treatment aim for people with HD. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A conceptual framework for physical therapy intervention in HD was developed on the basis of the themes that emerged from the data in this study. Such a framework has utility for complex, progressive conditions such as HD and may facilitate clinical decision making and standardization of practice and affect the development of future physical therapy trials.",

In addition, distinct populations of nominally glial progenitor cells, which also have the capacity to generate several cell types, are dispersed throughout the subcortical white matter and cortex. A number of approaches have evolved for using neural progenitor cells in cell therapy. Four strategies are especially attractive for clinical translation: first, transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells as a means of treating the disorders of myelin; second, transplantation of phenotypically restricted neuronal progenitor cells to treat diseases of discrete loss of a single neuronal phenotype, such as Parkinson disease; third, implantation of mixed progenitor pools to treat diseases characterized by the loss of several discrete phenotypes, such as spinal cord injury; and fourth, mobilization of endogenous neural progenitor cells to restore neurons lost as a result of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Huntington disease. Together, these may present the most compelling strategies and near-term disease targets for cell-based neurological therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

Reducing the expression of mHTT is therefore an attractive therapy for HD. However, wild-type HTT protein is essential for development and has critical roles in maintaining neuronal health. Therapies for HD that reduce wild-type HTT may therefore generate unintended negative consequences. We have identified single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) targets in the human HD population for the disease-specific targeting of the HTT gene. Using primary cells from patients with HD and the transgenic YAC18 and BACHD mouse lines, we developed antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) molecules that potently and selectively silence mHTT at both exonic and intronic SNP sites. Modification of these ASOs with S-constrained-ethyl (cET) motifs significantly improves potency while maintaining allele selectively in vitro. The developed ASO is potent and selective for mHTT in vivo after delivery to the mouse brain. We demonstrate that potent and selective allele-specific knockdown of the mHTT protein can be achieved at therapeutically relevant SNP sites using ASOs in vitro and in vivo.",

Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.",

Among the various options, the development of antisense oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus. Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene therapy against Huntington's disease.",

                    "abstract": "A neurogenetic disorder is defined as a clinical disease caused by a defect in one or more genes which affect the differentiation and function of the neuroectoderm and its derivatives. Genetic findings in various neurogenetic disorders are discussed. Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant disorders caused by the expansion of trinucleotides (CAG) within disease genes. The CAG expansions appear to result in a gain of gene function. Prenatal, presymptomatic, and differential diagnostic tests are based on the detection of the repeat expansions. Point mutations within disease genes result in many additional neurogenetic disorders. An autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various types of craniosynostotic syndromes are described. The mutations in the disease genes also appear to result in a gain of gene function. Molecular diagnosis in these disorders is based on the direct examination of the mutated gene by methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing. In many neurogenetic disorders the disease gene has not yet been identified. Here molecular diagnosis relies on indirect approaches based on methods such as the analysis of linkage and of allelic association. Hereditary forms of dystonia are presented as examples. Common sporadic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases frequently have multifactorial causes. Investigations into the molecular basis and the development of diagnostic tests in these two important diseases are discussed. At present no curative therapies exist in neurogenetic disorders. Gene therapeutic approaches, however, provide promise for a cure in at least some of these diseases. Basic principles of gene therapy are explained and attempts at gene therapy in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are described. Finally, some of the many obstacles are summarized that must be overcome before gene therapy becomes feasible in most monogenic neurological diseases.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease, commonly diagnosed in young to middle adulthood, is an inherited single gene disorder involving loss of cognitive, motor and neuropsychiatric function. Many family members become caregivers as well as continuing as parents and wage earners. The emotional aspects of caregiving contribute to mental health risks for family members. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 42 adult carers of people with Huntington disease in four United States and two Canadian Huntington disease centers between 2001 and 2005. Data were analyzed through descriptive coding and thematic analysis. FINDINGS: All participants reported multiple aspects of emotional distress. Being a carer was described as experiencing disintegration of one's life. Carers attempted to cope by seeking comfort from selected family members, anticipating the time when the care recipient had died and/or using prescription medications. Spousal carers were distressed by the loss of their relationship with their spouse and dealt with this by no longer regarding the person as an intimate partner. Carers were concerned about the disease risk for children in their families and hoped for a cure. CONCLUSION: Emotional distress can compromise the well-being of family carers, who attempt to maintain multiple roles. Nurses should monitor carer mental health, identify sources of emotional distress and support effective strategies used by carers to mediate distress.",

The study aimed to assess the self-awareness of memory impairment in HD in comparison to advanced Parkinson disease (PD), mild PD and cervical dystonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-awareness was tested in 23 patients with HD by comparing patient and caregiver ratings in reference to clinical control groups (25 patients with advanced PD, 21 with mild PD and 20 with cervical dystonia). Self-awareness was tested using the Self Rating Scale of Memory Functions, which was administered to both the patients and the caregivers. Neuropsychological assessment addressed general cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination), verbal learning (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 15-word list) and mood (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). RESULTS: Patients with HD significantly underestimated their memory dysfunction. Underestimation of memory deficit correlated with disease duration and disease severity in HD. CONCLUSIONS: Huntington disease patients underestimate memory dysfunction. These results add to the previous reports on poor insight in HD in other domains and suggest that anosognosia in HD, albeit usually rather mild, may be a generalized phenomenon.",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

Riluzole interferes with glutamatergic neurotransmission, thereby reducing excitotoxicity, enhancing neurite formation in damaged motoneurons and increasing serum concentrations of BDNF, a brain cortex neurotrophin protecting striatal neurons from degeneration. METHODS: We investigated metabolic and volumetric differences in distinct brain areas between 11 riluzole-treated and 12 placebo-treated patients by MRI and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET scanning, according to fully automated protocols. We also investigated the influence of riluzole on peripheral growth factor blood levels. RESULTS: Placebo-treated patients showed significantly greater proportional volume loss of grey matter and decrease in metabolic FDG uptake than patients treated with riluzole in all cortical areas (p<0.05). The decreased rate of metabolic FDG uptake correlated with worsening clinical scores in placebo-treated patients, compared to those who were treated with riluzole. The progressive decrease in metabolic FDG uptake observed in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex correlated linearly with the severity of motor scores calculated by Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-I) in placebo-treated patients. Similarly, the rate of metabolic changes in the frontal and temporal areas of the brain cortex correlated linearly with worsening behavioural scores calculated by UHDRS-III in the placebo-treated patients. Finally, BDNF and transforming growth factor beta-1 serum levels were significantly higher in patients treated with riluzole.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate CAG repeat length (36-39) of the Huntingtin gene, HTT. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation 0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors.",

Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.",

                    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease affect any part of the brain. The complete mechanism of ND is unknown, but there are some molecular mechanism and chemical process. Natural compounds have better compatibility with the human body along with lesser side effects. Moreover, several studies showed that various natural compounds have significant neuroprotective, potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for treating the different type of ND. In ND, natural compounds act by various mechanisms such as preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating destructed biomolecules before their accumulation affects cell metabolism, and improving the disease conditions. But due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) layer and unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of natural compounds, their delivery into the brain is limited. To minimize this problem and enhance drug delivery into the brain with an effective therapeutic dose, there is a need to develop a practical novel approach. The various studies showed that nanoformulations and microneedles (MN) containing natural compounds such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, chrysin, piperine, ferulic acid, huperzine A, berberine, baicalein, hesperetin, and retinoic acid effectively improved many ND. In this review, the effect of such natural drug-loaded nanoformulation and MN patches on ND management is discussed, along with their merits and demerits. This review aims to introduce different novel approaches for enhancing natural drug delivery into the brain to manage various neurodegenerative diseases.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The RA-loaded SLNs was prepared by the hot homogenization technique, in which glycerol monostearate (GMS) as lipid, tween 80 and soya lecithin were used as surfactant along with hydrogenated soya phosphatidyl choline (HSPC) as a stabilizer, and were characterized for particle size, zeta potential (ZP), in vitro study. Nasal delivery of the developed formulation followed by the study of behavioral (locomotor, narrow beam, body weight) and biochemical parameters (glutathione, lipid peroxidation, catalase and nitrite) in wistar rat was carried out. RESULTS: Optimized RA-loaded SLNs using tween 80 (SLNPRT) have the mean size of (149.2 +- 3.2 nm), ZP (-38.27 mV) entrapment efficiency (61.9 +- 2.2%). 3-NP-treated rat significantly increased behavioral alterations, oxidative damage as compared with the control group. SLNPRT treatment significantly improved behavioral abnormalities and attenuated the oxidative stress in 3NP-treated rats. However, the nasal delivery of SLNPRT produced significant therapeutic action as compared to intravenous application. In the organ distribution study, brain drug concentration was found to be 5.69 microg, in pharmacokinetic study Cmax, tmax, t1/2, AUC values were found to be 0.284 microg/ml, 1.5 h, 3.17 h, and 1.505 microg/ml/h, respectively. CONCLUSION: The encouraging results confirmed the developed optimized RA-loaded SLNs formulation following the non-invasive nose-to-brain drug delivery that is a promising therapeutic approach for the effective management in Huntington disease.",

In particular, the grafted cells can sustain functional recovery in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative conditions including genetic and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood and aging, ischemic stroke, and brain and spinal cord trauma. In a restricted subset of such conditions, cell transplantation has progressed to application in humans in early-stage clinical trials. At the present stage of play, there is clear evidence of clinical efficacy of fetal cell transplants in Parkinson disease (notwithstanding a range of technical difficulties still to be fully resolved), and preliminary claims of promising outcomes in several other severe neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington disease and stroke. Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

However, no long-term analysis of graft survival and integration has been published. Here, we report the pathologic findings in two patients with HD who died 74 and 79 months after transplantation. METHODS: Methods used were pathologic examination, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Neostriatum from both patients showed typical neuropathologic changes of advanced HD. Surviving grafts were identified in both patients (6/6 sites and 7/8 sites, respectively) as well-demarcated nests within host neostriatum with associated needle tracts. Grafted neurons adopted either dominant calbindin/parvalbumin or calretinin immunoreactivity (IR). Few neurofilament, MAP-2, DARPP-32, tyrosine hydroxylase, or calbindin IR processes traversed the host parenchyma-graft interface despite minimal junctional gliosis. Immunohistochemistry for CD68 showed microgliosis that was more pronounced in host striatum than graft. Scattered CD45 and CD3 IR cells were present within grafts and host parenchyma. No ubiquitin IR neuronal intranuclear inclusions were identified in graft neurons, although these were prevalent in host cells. CONCLUSIONS: These two autopsies confirm previous findings of neuronal differentiation and survival of transplanted fetal tissue from the ganglionic eminence and also demonstrate viability of neurons from fetal transplants in human neostriatum for more than 6 years. Despite prolonged survival, these grafts had poor integration with host striatum that is likely responsible for lack of clear clinical improvement in these patients.",

                    "abstract": "Although neuroprotective strategies and pharmaceutical agents have been initiated in the treatment of numerous disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including trauma, epilepsy, stroke, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,and AIDS dementia, none have yet been applied to the treatment of glaucoma. A prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate CAG repeat length (36-39) of the Huntingtin gene, HTT. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation 0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Choreic movements of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) may result from an abnormal control of sensory inputs. In order to further examine the pathophysiology of facial choreic movements (FCM), we carried out a neurophysiological study, including prepulse inhibition of the blink reflex (BR), in HD patients with and without FCM. METHODS: The study was conducted in 20 genetically proven HD patients with Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores of FCM ranging between 0 and 3, and in 12 age-matched healthy volunteers who served as control subjects. We counted the number of spontaneous blinks, recorded the electromyographic activity underlying FCM, and analyzed latency, amplitude, and duration of the BR responses to electrical and auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition was studied by comparing the responses to test trials with those to control trials. In control trials BRs were obtained to either a single supraorbital nerve electrical stimulus (EBR) or to a 90dB auditory stimulus (ABR). In test trials, the same stimuli were preceded by the prepulse, which was either a weak acoustic tone or a weak electrical stimulus to the third finger, delivered 30-150 ms before. RESULTS: Spontaneous blinking rate was abnormally low in 3 patients, and abnormally high in 9 patients. Mean duration of the BR was longer in patients than in control subjects. In prepulse trials, the percentage inhibition of the BR was abnormally reduced in 15 patients to at least one sensory modality, and significantly correlated with the score of FCM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the severity of FCM in patients with HD might be an expression of a disturbance in motor control partly related to an abnormal processing of sensory inputs. Such abnormality involves circuits used in prepulse inhibition of the BR.",

                    "abstract": "Iron has been shown to accumulates at site where neurons degenerate in neurodegenerative diseases of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Friedreich ataxia. Iron is thought to participate or initiate oxidative stress via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radical. Iron chelators are neuroprotective and prevent 6-hydroxydoapmine and MPTP dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rats and mice. However, their action on monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B have not been determined previously since MAO-B inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease. The chelators 8-hydroxyquinoline, O-phenanthroline, 2,2'-dipyridyl, U74500A and U74600F showed a preference for inhibition of rat brain mitochondrial MAO-A over MAO-B. Their IC(50) ranged from 10(-3) M to 10(-6) M, with 21-amino steroids (U74500A and U74006F) showing a greater selectivity and potency for MAO-A. Desferrioxamine (desferal), a prototype potent iron chelator, exhibited relatively poor MAO inhibitory. The inhibitions of MAO-A and B by 21-amino steroids (Lazaroids) were time dependent and irreversible. Those initiated by 8-hydroxyquinoline, 2,2'-dipyridyl and O-phenanthroline were fully reversible by enzyme dilution experiments. Both Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) reverse the MAO-A and B inhibition induced by the latter chelators, but not those initiated by 21-amino steroids. The data infer that either the inhibition of MAO by 21-amino steroids is either the resultant of their conversion to an irreversible covalently bound ligand or that the iron chelation moiety and MAO inhibitory activity in these compounds are not mutually shared. The results suggest that bifunctional brain penetrable drugs with iron chelating property and MAO inhibitory activity in could be the most feasible approach for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. Such drug would prevent participation of elevated iron in oxidative stress and formation of reactive hydroxyl radical, via its interaction with H(2)O2 (Fenton chemistry), generated as a consequence MAO and other oxidative enzyme reactions to generative cytotoxic reactive hydroxyl radical. We have now developed several of these compounds with neuroprotective, MAO inhibitory and iron chelating properties from our prototype iron chelators, VK-28 possessing propargylamine moiety of our anti-parkinson drug, rasagiline.",

                    "abstract": "Iron has been shown to accumulates at site where neurons degenerate in neurodegenerative diseases of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Friedreich ataxia. Iron is thought to participate or initiate oxidative stress via generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radical. Iron chelators are neuroprotective and prevent 6-hydroxydoapmine and MPTP dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rats and mice. However, their action on monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B have not been determined previously since MAO-B inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease. The chelators 8-hydroxyquinoline, O-phenanthroline, 2,2'-dipyridyl, U74500A and U74600F showed a preference for inhibition of rat brain mitochondrial MAO-A over MAO-B. Their IC(50) ranged from 10(-3) M to 10(-6) M, with 21-amino steroids (U74500A and U74006F) showing a greater selectivity and potency for MAO-A. Desferrioxamine (desferal), a prototype potent iron chelator, exhibited relatively poor MAO inhibitory. The inhibitions of MAO-A and B by 21-amino steroids (Lazaroids) were time dependent and irreversible. Those initiated by 8-hydroxyquinoline, 2,2'-dipyridyl and O-phenanthroline were fully reversible by enzyme dilution experiments. Both Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) reverse the MAO-A and B inhibition induced by the latter chelators, but not those initiated by 21-amino steroids. The data infer that either the inhibition of MAO by 21-amino steroids is either the resultant of their conversion to an irreversible covalently bound ligand or that the iron chelation moiety and MAO inhibitory activity in these compounds are not mutually shared. The results suggest that bifunctional brain penetrable drugs with iron chelating property and MAO inhibitory activity in could be the most feasible approach for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. Such drug would prevent participation of elevated iron in oxidative stress and formation of reactive hydroxyl radical, via its interaction with H(2)O2 (Fenton chemistry), generated as a consequence MAO and other oxidative enzyme reactions to generative cytotoxic reactive hydroxyl radical. We have now developed several of these compounds with neuroprotective, MAO inhibitory and iron chelating properties from our prototype iron chelators, VK-28 possessing propargylamine moiety of our anti-parkinson drug, rasagiline.",

                    "abstract": "Although neuroprotective strategies and pharmaceutical agents have been initiated in the treatment of numerous disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including trauma, epilepsy, stroke, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,and AIDS dementia, none have yet been applied to the treatment of glaucoma. A prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.",

OBJECTIVE: In this article we will review and discuss recombinant antibodies that are being evaluated for neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical models and in clinical studies and will summarize new strategies that are being developed to optimize their stability, specificity and potency for advancing their use. METHODS: Articles describing recombinant antibody fragments used for neurological diseases were selected (PubMed) and evaluated for their significance. RESULTS: Different antibody formats such as single-chain fragment variable (scFv), single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs or sdAbs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), intrabodies and nanobodies, are currently being studied in pre-clinical models of cancer as well as infectious and autoimmune diseases and many of them are being tested as therapeutics in clinical trials. Immunotherapy approaches have shown therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of Alzheimer s disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington disease (HD), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that recombinant antibody fragments may neutralize toxic extra- and intracellular misfolded proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, DLB, FTD, HD or TSEs and may target toxic immune cells participating in the pathogenesis of MS. CONCLUSION: Recombinant antibody fragments represent a promising tool for the development of antibody-based immunotherapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

METHODS: Spanish participants of the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN) Registry study diagnosed with HD or premanifest HD gene carriers were included from June 2012 to August 2013. Self-reported dietary intake was collected by 3-day dietary record, MeDi adherence was assessed by 0-9 range (proposed by Trichopoulou et al.) and, other contributing factors related to nutrition were collected by telephone. Demographics and clinical variables were obtained from the EHDN Registry study database. Association of HD with MeDi adherence and nutritional characteristics were performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety eight participants were included in the study, median age of 48 years (38-60 range), and median total functional capacity (TFC) 9 (5-13 range). HD severity was similar between participants with low vs moderate/high MeDi; however, quality of life (P = 0.009) was significantly higher among participants with moderate/high MeDi adherence. In terms of nutrients, higher MUFA/SFA intake was moderately correlated with better TFC and Unified HD Rating Scale (UHDRS) cognitive. Better TFC was associated with having a caregiver (OR = 11.86, P < 0.001), and non-smoking (OR = 0.21, P = 0.013). Moderate adherence to MeDi, was associated with older participants (OR = 1.19, P = 0.031), lower comorbidity (OR = 0.18, P = 0.018), lower UHDRS motor (OR = 0.90, P = 0.041), and lower risk for abdominal obesity (OR = 0.02, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: In HD the moderate MeDi adherence is associated with better quality of life, lower comorbidity, lower motor impairment and lower risk for abdominal obesity compared to those participants with low MeDi adherence.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The ability to predetermine the fate of transplanted neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and specifically to direct their maturation has the potential to enhance the efficiency of cell-transplantation therapy for neurodegenerative disease. We previously demonstrated that transient exposure of subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived adult NPCs to lithium chloride during in vitro proliferation alters differential fate in vitro and increases the proportion of cells expressing neuronal markers while reducing glial progeny. To extend these findings, we examined whether in vitro priming of adult SVZ-derived NPCs with lithium chloride before transplantation into the quinolinic acid (QA) lesion rat model of Huntington disease altered in vivo neuronal differentiation and sensorimotor function compared with nonprimed NPC transplants. METHODS: NPCs were isolated from the SVZ of the adult rat brain and cultured for 2 weeks. Four days before transplantation into the QA-lesioned rat striatum, the cells were labeled with BrdU and primed with lithium chloride. The rats underwent regular evaluation of forelimb use and sensorimotor neglect to establish functional effects of NPC transplantation. Twelve weeks after transplantation, the brains were analyzed with immunohistochemistry to compare the differential fate of primed and nonprimed NPCs. RESULTS: We observed that in vitro priming of adult NPCs with lithium chloride reduced gliogenesis and enhanced the occurrence of DARPP-32-positive neurons when compared with nonprimed cells 12 weeks after transplantation into the QA-lesioned striatum. Lithium chloride priming also augmented the formation of efferent projections from newly formed neurons in the damaged host striatum to the globus pallidus. This was associated with acceleration of sensorimotor function recovery in rats receiving transplants of lithium chloride-primed adult NPCs compared with nonprimed transplants. CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings indicate that in vitro priming of adult NPCs with lithium chloride may augment transplant efficiency and accelerate sensorimotor function outcome in vivo.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Adherence to Mediterranean-type diet (MeDi) may delay onset of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Whether adherence to MeDi affects time to phenoconversion in Huntington disease (HD), a highly penetrant, single-gene disorder, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine if MeDi modifies the time to clinical onset of HD (phenoconversion) in premanifest carriers participating in Prospective Huntington at Risk Observational Study (PHAROS), and to examine the effects of body mass index and caloric intake on time to phenoconversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cohort study of 41 Huntington study group sites in the United States and Canada involving 1001 participants enrolled in PHAROS between July 1999 and January 2004 who were followed up every 9 months until 2010. A total of 211 participants aged 26 to 57 years had an expanded CAG repeat length (>= 37). EXPOSURE: A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered 33 months after baseline. We calculated daily gram intake for dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, and alcohol and constructed MeDi scores (0-9); higher scores indicate higher adherence. Demographics, medical history, body mass index, and Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) score were collected. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine the association of MeDi and phenoconversion. RESULTS Age, sex, caloric intake, education status, and UHDRS motor scores did not differ among MeDi tertiles (0-3, 4-5, and 6-9). The highest body mass index was associated with the lowest adherence to MeDi. Thirty-one participants phenoconverted. In a model adjusted for age, CAG repeat length, and caloric intake, MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion (P for trend = 0.14 for tertile of MeDi, and P = .22 for continuous MeDi). When individual components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.0-5.57; P = .05) and higher caloric intake (P = .04) were associated with risk of phenoconversion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion; however, higher consumption of dairy products had a 2-fold increased risk and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression in manifest HD). Studies of diet and energy expenditure in premanifest HD may provide data for interventions to modify specific components of diet that may delay the onset of HD.",

RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 mg. No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported, which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9 mg). There was no increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses.

METHODS: One hundred twelve patients were randomly assigned to laquinimod/placebo in a series of separate dose-escalating cohorts starting from a daily oral dose of 0.9 mg/1.2 mg escalating to 2.7 mg, in 0.3 mg increments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 mg. No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported, which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9 mg). There was no increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses. Laquinimod-treated patients showed more abnormal laboratory levels in liver enzymes, P-amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, but most shifts were clinically non-significant. The exposure of laquinimod was dose proportional and linear in the tested dose range. An immunological substudy showed significant dose-dependent decreases in 6-sulpho LacNAc + dendritic cell (slanDC) frequency following laquinimod compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Laquinimod doses up to 2.7 mg were safely administered to patients with RRMS. An in vivo effect of laquinimod on the innate immune system was demonstrated.

Emerging investigations have provided new understanding of how autophagy of mitochondria (also known as mitophagy) is associated with cellular oxidative stress and its impact on neurodegeneration. This impaired autophagic function may be considered as a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease. It can be suggested that autophagy dysfunction along with oxidative stress is considered main events in neurodegenerative disorders. New therapeutic approaches have now begun to target mitochondria as a potential drug target. This review discusses evidence supporting the notion that oxidative stress and autophagy are intimately associated with neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. This review also explores new approaches that can prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, improve neurodegenerative etiology, and also offer possible cures to the aforementioned neurodegenerative diseases.

The purposes of these analyses were to (1) determine the prevalence of EOL plans, including advance directives (ADs) among persons across 3 stages of Huntington disease (HD) and (2) examine factors associated with having ADs in this sample. METHODS: Data are from 503 participants in the HD Quality of Life study. Participants completed an online health-related quality-of-life survey that included questions regarding EOL planning and self-reported HD symptoms. Frequencies were calculated for EOL planning by the HD stage. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used to identify variables associated with having ADs. RESULTS: A total of 38.2% of participants stated they had ADs and fewer than half had other EOL plans. Being older, increased HD stage, more years of education, lower anxiety, more swallowing symptoms, and higher meaning and purpose were associated with having ADs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ADs in our sample is comparable to the general US population, but surprisingly low, considering the severity and long disease course of HD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health-care providers should develop specific interventions early in the disease process to increase ADs in this population.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim was to describe the short-term (6 months) effects of olanzapine on behavioral and motor clinical manifestations in a group of 11 patients with Huntington disease. METHOD: An open-pilot study of olanzapine (5 mg) in patients with clinical and genetic diagnosis of Huntington disease was used. The Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale for clinical assessment and the Total Functional Capacity score for the disease-stage evaluation were used. A statistical analysis was performed to compare the effects of olanzapine on the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale scores at time 0 (baseline) and at time 1 (6 months). Comparisons of motor scores, of single behavioral items, and of TFC scores were performed within the group. RESULTS: The behavioral assessment score of items regarding depression, anxiety, irritability, and obsessions showed a significant improvement (range of p, 0.0134-0.048). Given the total behavioral scores (sum of all the items investigated), five patients significantly improved their behavioral score after a 6-month treatment (range of p, 0.013-0.047). Choreic movements improved, although not significantly (0.05 < or = p < or = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine is a potentially useful antipsychotic drug, with significant short-term effects on behavioral changes, mainly in patients with severe psychiatric symptoms at the onset. It might be considered as a possible therapeutic choice for treatment of Huntington disease.",

In this study we used alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency with the piZZ mutant phenotype as a model system to evaluate the efficiency of gene-delivery approaches that both silence the piZZ transcript (e.g., shRNA) and restore circulating wild-type AAT expression from resistant codon-optimized AAT (AAT-opt) transgene cassette using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivery. After systemic injection of a self-complimentary AAV serotype 8 (scAAV8) vector encoding shRNA in piZZ transgenic mice, both mutant AAT mRNA in the liver and defected serum protein level were inhibited by 95%, whereas liver pathology, as monitored by dPAS and fibrosis staining, reversed. To restore blood AAT levels in AAV8/shRNA-treated mice, several strategies to restore functional AAT levels were tested, including using AAV AAT-opt transgene cassettes targeted to muscle and liver, or combination vectors carrying piZZ shRNA and AAT-opt transgenes separately, or a single bicistronic AAV vector. With these molecular approaches, we observed over 90% knockdown of mutant AAT with a 13- to 30-fold increase of circulating wild-type AAT protein from the shRNA-resistant AAT-opt cassette. The molecular approaches applied in this study can simultaneously prevent liver pathology and restore blood AAT concentration in AAT deficiencies. Based on these observations, similar gene-therapy strategies could be considered for any diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins.",

Unifying mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of polyQ-dependent neurodegenerative diseases including SBMA, Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxias. It has been suggested that mutant protein containing polyQ inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity, resulting in transcriptional dysfunction and subsequent neuronal dysfunction. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors alleviate neurological phenotypes in fly and mouse models of polyQ disease, although the therapeutic effect is limited by the toxicity of these compounds. We studied the therapeutic effects of sodium butyrate (SB), an HDAC inhibitor, in a transgenic mouse model of SBMA. Oral administration of SB ameliorated neurological phenotypes as well as increased acetylation of nuclear histone in neural tissues. These therapeutic effects, however, were seen only within a narrow range of SB dosage. Our results indicate that SB is a possible therapeutic agent for SBMA and other polyQ diseases, although an appropriate dose should be determined for clinical application.",

Laquinimod is in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Huntington Disease (HD). The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and cytoimmunologic effects following escalating doses of laquinimod in patients with RRMS. METHODS: One hundred twelve patients were randomly assigned to laquinimod/placebo in a series of separate dose-escalating cohorts starting from a daily oral dose of 0.9 mg/1.2 mg escalating to 2.7 mg, in 0.3 mg increments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received placebo and 84 received laquinimod ranging from 0.9 to 2.7 mg. No deaths occurred. One serious adverse event (SAE) of perichondritis was reported, which was unrelated to laquinimod (0.9 mg). There was no increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with escalating doses. Laquinimod-treated patients showed more abnormal laboratory levels in liver enzymes, P-amylase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen, but most shifts were clinically non-significant. The exposure of laquinimod was dose proportional and linear in the tested dose range. An immunological substudy showed significant dose-dependent decreases in 6-sulpho LacNAc + dendritic cell (slanDC) frequency following laquinimod compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Laquinimod doses up to 2.7 mg were safely administered to patients with RRMS. An in vivo effect of laquinimod on the innate immune system was demonstrated.

There is currently no treatment that can prevent the striatal neuropathology. Transglutaminase (TG) activity is increased in HD patients, is associated with cell death, and has been suggested to contribute to striatal neuronal loss in HD. This work assesses the therapeutic potential of cystamine, an inhibitor of TG activity with additional potentially beneficial effects. Specifically, we examine the effect of cystamine on striatal neuronal loss in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. We demonstrate here for the first time that YAC128 mice show a forebrain-specific increase in TG activity compared with wild-type (WT) littermates which is decreased by oral delivery of cystamine. Treatment of symptomatic YAC128 mice with cystamine starting at 7 months prevented striatal neuronal loss. Cystamine treatment also ameliorated the striatal volume loss and striatal neuronal atrophy observed in these animals, but was unable to prevent motor dysfunction or the down-regulation of dopamine and cyclic adenosine monophsophate-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) expression in the striatum. While the exact mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of cystamine in YAC128 mice is uncertain, our findings suggest that cystamine is neuroprotective and may be beneficial in the treatment of HD.",

                    "abstract": "Cognitive decline precedes motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD). A transgenic rat model for HD carrying only 51 CAG repeats recapitulates the late-onset HD phenotype. Here, we assessed prefrontostriatal function in this model through both behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Behavioral examination consisted in a temporal bisection task within a supra-second range (2 vs.8 s), which is thought to involve prefrontostriatal networks. In two independent experiments, the behavioral analysis revealed poorer temporal sensitivity as early as 4 months of age, well before detection of overt motor deficits. At a later symptomatic age, animals were impaired in their temporal discriminative behavior. In vivo recording of field potentials in the dorsomedial striatum evoked by stimulation of the prelimbic cortex were studied in 4- to 5-month-old rats. Input/output curves, paired-pulse function, and plasticity induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were assessed. Results showed an altered plasticity, with higher paired-pulse facilitation, enhanced short-term depression, as well as stronger long-term potentiation after TBS in homozygous transgenic rats. Results from the heterozygous animals mostly fell between wild-type and homozygous transgenic rats. Our results suggest that normal plasticity in prefrontostriatal circuits may be necessary for reliable and precise timing behavior. Furthermore, the present study provides the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of a presymptomatic alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in an animal model for Huntington disease and suggests that supra-second timing may be the earliest cognitive dysfunction in HD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials of fetal neural tissue transplantation for Huntington disease (HD) have been conducted with variable clinical results. However, no long-term analysis of graft survival and integration has been published. Here, we report the pathologic findings in two patients with HD who died 74 and 79 months after transplantation. METHODS: Methods used were pathologic examination, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Neostriatum from both patients showed typical neuropathologic changes of advanced HD. Surviving grafts were identified in both patients (6/6 sites and 7/8 sites, respectively) as well-demarcated nests within host neostriatum with associated needle tracts. Grafted neurons adopted either dominant calbindin/parvalbumin or calretinin immunoreactivity (IR). Few neurofilament, MAP-2, DARPP-32, tyrosine hydroxylase, or calbindin IR processes traversed the host parenchyma-graft interface despite minimal junctional gliosis. Immunohistochemistry for CD68 showed microgliosis that was more pronounced in host striatum than graft. Scattered CD45 and CD3 IR cells were present within grafts and host parenchyma. No ubiquitin IR neuronal intranuclear inclusions were identified in graft neurons, although these were prevalent in host cells. CONCLUSIONS: These two autopsies confirm previous findings of neuronal differentiation and survival of transplanted fetal tissue from the ganglionic eminence and also demonstrate viability of neurons from fetal transplants in human neostriatum for more than 6 years. Despite prolonged survival, these grafts had poor integration with host striatum that is likely responsible for lack of clear clinical improvement in these patients.",

The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease.

In specific diseases, selective silencing of only one copy of a gene may be advantageous over non-selective silencing of both copies. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Silencing both expanded and normal copies of HTT may be therapeutically beneficial, but preservation of normal HTT expression is preferred. Allele-specific methods can selectively silence the mutant HTT transcript by targeting either the expanded CAG repeat or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with the expansion. Both approaches require personalized treatment strategies based on patient genotypes. We compare the prospect of safe treatment of HD by CAG- and SNP-specific silencing approaches and review HD population genetics used to guide target identification in the patient population. Clinical implementation of allele-specific HTT silencing faces challenges common to personalized genetic medicine, requiring novel solutions from clinical scientists and regulatory authorities.",

At present, the HD field is experiencing exciting times with the assessment for the first time in human subjects of interventions aimed at core disease mechanisms. Out of a portfolio of interventions that claim a potential disease-modifying effect in HD, the target huntingtin has more robust validation. In this review, we discuss the spectrum of huntingtin-lowering therapies that are currently being considered. We provide a critical appraisal of the validation of huntingtin as a drug target, describing the advantages, challenges, and limitations of the proposed therapeutic interventions. The development of these new therapies relies strongly on the knowledge of HD pathogenesis and the ability to translate this knowledge into validated pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Altogether, the goal is to support a rational drug development that is ethical and cost-effective. Among the pharmacodynamic biomarkers under development, the quantification of mutant huntingtin in the cerebral spinal fluid and PET imaging targeting huntingtin or phosphodiesterase 10A deserve special attention. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics are eagerly awaited as the first interventions that may be able to change the course of HD in a meaningful way.",

A prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.",

METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

These chemokines bind and activate neuronal C - C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), which, in turn, promotes phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT) - mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway activation, which inhibits autophagy, thus causing the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins in the cytoplasm of neurons.

CCR5 accumulation might be due to a self-amplifying mechanism, since CCR5 is a substrate of autophagy and CCL5-CCR5-mediated autophagy inhibition impairs CCR5 degradation. Furthermore, pharmacological, or genetic inhibition of CCR5 rescues mTORC1-autophagy dysfunction and improves neurodegeneration in HD and tauopathy mouse models, suggesting that CCR5 hyperactivation is a pathogenic signal driving the progression of these diseases.",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed feasibility and outcomes of a 14-week physical activity self-management and coaching intervention compared with social contact in Huntington disease (HD) to inform the design of a future full-scale trial. DESIGN: Assessor blind, multisite, randomized pilot feasibility trial. SETTING: Participants were recruited and assessed at baseline, 16 weeks following randomization, and then again at 26 weeks in HD specialist clinics with intervention delivery by trained coaches in the participants' homes. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: People with HD were allocated to the ENGAGE-HD physical activity coaching intervention or a social interaction intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Eligibility, recruitment, retention, and intervention participation were determined at 16 weeks. Other outcomes of interest included measures of mobility, self-efficacy, physical activity, and disease-specific measures of motor and cognition. Fidelity and costs for both the physical activity and social comparator interventions were established. RESULTS: Forty percent ( n = 46) of eligible patients were enrolled; 22 were randomized to the physical intervention and 24 to social intervention. Retention rates in the physical intervention and social intervention were 77% and 92%, respectively. Minimum participation criteria were achieved by 82% of participants in the physical intervention and 100% in the social intervention. There was no indication of between-group treatment effects on function; however, increases in self-efficacy for exercise and self-reported levels of physical activity in the physical intervention lend support to our predefined intervention logic model. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures may have introduced bias. CONCLUSIONS: An HD physical activity self-management and coaching intervention is feasible and worthy of further investigation.",

While cognition-oriented treatments and physical exercise have shown efficacy in improving cognition in other populations, they have not been systematically reviewed in HD. This systematic review aims to examine the effects of cognitive and exercise interventions on cognition in HD, along with effects on psychosocial function, functional independence, and neuroimaging outcomes. Seventeen studies (three cognitive, seven exercise, seven combining cognitive and physical exercise) were included. While there was generally low certainty of evidence, interventions that included cognitive training appeared to have larger effect sizes on cognition, while physical exercise (alone or combined with cognitive rehabilitation or stimulation) showed negligible effect sizes. On the other hand, combined interventions had larger effects on psychosocial function. Finally, effects on functional independence appeared negligible following exercise and combined interventions, and effects on neuroimaging outcomes were inconclusive. Larger studies should seek to confirm the benefits of cognitive and physical interventions, and further explore changes in functional independence and neural outcomes.",

METHODS: Placebo data were obtained from an international, longitudinal, placebo-controlled trial for Huntington's disease (European Huntington's Disease Initiative Study Group). One-hundred and eighty patients were evaluated using the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale over 36 months. A placebo effect was defined as an improvement of at least 50% over baseline scores in the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale, and clinically relevant when at least 10% of the population met it. RESULTS: Only behavior showed a significant placebo effect, and the proportion of the patients with placebo effect ranged from 16% (first visit) to 41% (last visit). Nondepressed patients with better functional status were most likely to be placebo-responders over time. CONCLUSIONS: In Huntington's disease, behavior seems to be more vulnerable to placebo than overall motor function, cognition, and function",

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of latrepirdine on cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Sixty-four research centers in Australia, Europe, and North America. PATIENTS Four hundred three patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and baseline cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10-26). INTERVENTION Latrepirdine (20 mg) vs matching placebo administered orally 3 times daily for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary outcome measures were cognition as measured by the change in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to week 26 and global function at week 26 as measured by the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview, which ranges from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included behavior, daily function, motor function, and safety. RESULTS The mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination score among participants randomized to latrepirdine (1.5-point improvement) did not differ significantly from that among participants randomized to placebo (1.3-point improvement) (P=.39). Similarly, the distribution of the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview did not differ significantly among those randomized to latrepirdine compared with placebo (P=.84). No significant treatment effects were detected on the secondary efficacy outcome measures. The incidence of adverse events was similar between those randomized to latrepirdine (68.5%) and placebo (68.0%). CONCLUSION In patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and cognitive impairment, treatment with latrepirdine for 6 months was safe and well tolerated but did not improve cognition or global function relative to placebo.

Edgemoor, a distinct part of the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital, is a regional referral facility for patients with HD. Over the past 8 years, we have cared for 53 patients with advanced HD and describe our experiences by presenting their demographic characteristics and the lessons we have learned in caring for them. Ultimately, we found that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care Initiative provided a meaningful framework for setting clinical priorities.

                    "abstract": "Cognitive decline precedes motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD). A transgenic rat model for HD carrying only 51 CAG repeats recapitulates the late-onset HD phenotype. Here, we assessed prefrontostriatal function in this model through both behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Behavioral examination consisted in a temporal bisection task within a supra-second range (2 vs.8 s), which is thought to involve prefrontostriatal networks. In two independent experiments, the behavioral analysis revealed poorer temporal sensitivity as early as 4 months of age, well before detection of overt motor deficits. At a later symptomatic age, animals were impaired in their temporal discriminative behavior. In vivo recording of field potentials in the dorsomedial striatum evoked by stimulation of the prelimbic cortex were studied in 4- to 5-month-old rats. Input/output curves, paired-pulse function, and plasticity induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were assessed. Results showed an altered plasticity, with higher paired-pulse facilitation, enhanced short-term depression, as well as stronger long-term potentiation after TBS in homozygous transgenic rats. Results from the heterozygous animals mostly fell between wild-type and homozygous transgenic rats. Our results suggest that normal plasticity in prefrontostriatal circuits may be necessary for reliable and precise timing behavior. Furthermore, the present study provides the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of a presymptomatic alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in an animal model for Huntington disease and suggests that supra-second timing may be the earliest cognitive dysfunction in HD.",

It employs the use of polymerase chain reaction to amplify single cells from early embryos obtained with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques. PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring. Recent advances in sequencing may allow for higher success rates as the chromosomally abnormal embryos will be identified more easily and the embryos with the highest chance of survival will be transferred.",

Of the latter, 3 manifested symptoms of the disease and were referred to a neurologist or psychiatrist, and 3 had previously been tested by linkage analysis. Participants usually mentioned more than one reason for requesting predictive testing but the most frequent was to put an end to uncertainty concerning their risk of illness. The proportion of positive and negatives test results was 40% and 54.1% respectively, significantly different from the expected 50% (p<0.01). Prenatal testing was not frequently requested. CONCLUSION: All the participants expressed satisfaction regarding their decision to be tested. None to our knowledge had a catastrophic reaction (major depressive disorder or psychiatric hospitalization, declared suicide attempt or suicide). Our study highlights that preparation for receiving test results is a psychologically complex process for which appropriate support in a timely fashion is critical. We feel that a cautious and ethical case by case approach remains essential and that high standards of testing should be maintained because of the far reaching impact of test results.",

It employs the use of polymerase chain reaction to amplify single cells from early embryos obtained with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques. PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring. Recent advances in sequencing may allow for higher success rates as the chromosomally abnormal embryos will be identified more easily and the embryos with the highest chance of survival will be transferred.",

Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate if in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease is cost effective for heterozygous individuals with Huntington disease vs. unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a theoretical cohort of 3,851 couples, where one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. SETTING: N/A. PATIENTS/ANIMALS: None. INTERVENTION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing for couples attempting conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both parents in addition to secondary outcomes of procedure-related loss, spontaneous abortion, termination of pregnancy, and early/normal/late-onset Huntington disease. A willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is lower in cost and higher in effectiveness compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis among couples with one heterozygous Huntington disease individual, making it the dominant strategy. In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing was associated with 77 more QALYs and a cost savings of $46,394,268. All measured outcomes were lower in the IVF preimplantation genetic testing strategy, including 39 fewer procedure-related losses, 39 fewer spontaneous abortions, and 462 fewer terminations of pregnancy. Most notably, in our theoretical cohort of couples, IVF preimplantation genetic testing resulted in 1,079 fewer Huntington disease-affected offspring. Our results were robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is a cost-effective conception strategy compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis when one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. Not only can morbidity and mortality incurred by Huntington disease be mitigated for the offspring with the use of IVF preimplantation genetic testing, but this study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of using IVF preimplantation genetic testing for those with Huntington disease.",

                    "abstract": "A neurogenetic disorder is defined as a clinical disease caused by a defect in one or more genes which affect the differentiation and function of the neuroectoderm and its derivatives. Genetic findings in various neurogenetic disorders are discussed. Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant disorders caused by the expansion of trinucleotides (CAG) within disease genes. The CAG expansions appear to result in a gain of gene function. Prenatal, presymptomatic, and differential diagnostic tests are based on the detection of the repeat expansions. Point mutations within disease genes result in many additional neurogenetic disorders. An autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various types of craniosynostotic syndromes are described. The mutations in the disease genes also appear to result in a gain of gene function. Molecular diagnosis in these disorders is based on the direct examination of the mutated gene by methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing. In many neurogenetic disorders the disease gene has not yet been identified. Here molecular diagnosis relies on indirect approaches based on methods such as the analysis of linkage and of allelic association. Hereditary forms of dystonia are presented as examples. Common sporadic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases frequently have multifactorial causes. Investigations into the molecular basis and the development of diagnostic tests in these two important diseases are discussed. At present no curative therapies exist in neurogenetic disorders. Gene therapeutic approaches, however, provide promise for a cure in at least some of these diseases. Basic principles of gene therapy are explained and attempts at gene therapy in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are described. Finally, some of the many obstacles are summarized that must be overcome before gene therapy becomes feasible in most monogenic neurological diseases.",

The multidisciplinary study of HD has been the focus of an international collaborating effort of basic and applied research for several decades. HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low. Current treatment of HD is mostly symptomatic, but ongoing observational studies, clinical trials and development of new gene silencing technologies have provided hopeful results.",

In order to further examine the pathophysiology of facial choreic movements (FCM), we carried out a neurophysiological study, including prepulse inhibition of the blink reflex (BR), in HD patients with and without FCM. METHODS: The study was conducted in 20 genetically proven HD patients with Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores of FCM ranging between 0 and 3, and in 12 age-matched healthy volunteers who served as control subjects. We counted the number of spontaneous blinks, recorded the electromyographic activity underlying FCM, and analyzed latency, amplitude, and duration of the BR responses to electrical and auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition was studied by comparing the responses to test trials with those to control trials. In control trials BRs were obtained to either a single supraorbital nerve electrical stimulus (EBR) or to a 90dB auditory stimulus (ABR). In test trials, the same stimuli were preceded by the prepulse, which was either a weak acoustic tone or a weak electrical stimulus to the third finger, delivered 30-150 ms before. RESULTS: Spontaneous blinking rate was abnormally low in 3 patients, and abnormally high in 9 patients. Mean duration of the BR was longer in patients than in control subjects. In prepulse trials, the percentage inhibition of the BR was abnormally reduced in 15 patients to at least one sensory modality, and significantly correlated with the score of FCM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the severity of FCM in patients with HD might be an expression of a disturbance in motor control partly related to an abnormal processing of sensory inputs. Such abnormality involves circuits used in prepulse inhibition of the BR.",

METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%).

                    "abstract": "A neurogenetic disorder is defined as a clinical disease caused by a defect in one or more genes which affect the differentiation and function of the neuroectoderm and its derivatives. Genetic findings in various neurogenetic disorders are discussed. Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant disorders caused by the expansion of trinucleotides (CAG) within disease genes. The CAG expansions appear to result in a gain of gene function. Prenatal, presymptomatic, and differential diagnostic tests are based on the detection of the repeat expansions. Point mutations within disease genes result in many additional neurogenetic disorders. An autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various types of craniosynostotic syndromes are described. The mutations in the disease genes also appear to result in a gain of gene function. Molecular diagnosis in these disorders is based on the direct examination of the mutated gene by methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing. In many neurogenetic disorders the disease gene has not yet been identified. Here molecular diagnosis relies on indirect approaches based on methods such as the analysis of linkage and of allelic association. Hereditary forms of dystonia are presented as examples. Common sporadic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases frequently have multifactorial causes. Investigations into the molecular basis and the development of diagnostic tests in these two important diseases are discussed. At present no curative therapies exist in neurogenetic disorders. Gene therapeutic approaches, however, provide promise for a cure in at least some of these diseases. Basic principles of gene therapy are explained and attempts at gene therapy in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are described. Finally, some of the many obstacles are summarized that must be overcome before gene therapy becomes feasible in most monogenic neurological diseases.",

The multidisciplinary study of HD has been the focus of an international collaborating effort of basic and applied research for several decades. HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low. Current treatment of HD is mostly symptomatic, but ongoing observational studies, clinical trials and development of new gene silencing technologies have provided hopeful results.",

Emerging investigations have provided new understanding of how autophagy of mitochondria (also known as mitophagy) is associated with cellular oxidative stress and its impact on neurodegeneration. This impaired autophagic function may be considered as a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease. It can be suggested that autophagy dysfunction along with oxidative stress is considered main events in neurodegenerative disorders. New therapeutic approaches have now begun to target mitochondria as a potential drug target. This review discusses evidence supporting the notion that oxidative stress and autophagy are intimately associated with neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. This review also explores new approaches that can prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, improve neurodegenerative etiology, and also offer possible cures to the aforementioned neurodegenerative diseases.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.",

Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

Therefore, it's necessary to search for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study, we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We reported several potential genes may be associated with the kidney transplant rejection, which should provide novel biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance.",

BACKGROUND: The duration of the illness may be up to 30 years and there are far reaching implications for the affected person, family members and carers. Services for families need to provide expert psychological and practical support, whilst remaining planned and flexible. The aim of this research was to identify needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their carers and ascertain the extent to which they were supported by a specialised community service. METHODS: Five focus groups and three individual interviews were used to gather data from affected individuals, family, carers and staff of the unit (n = 33). A semi-structured discussion guide was used in every case. Data were analysed using an inductive coding technique. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged; (i) Transitions and the journey, (ii) Challenges in finding and providing support and (iii) The role of the unit in providing supportive care. While the service was seen as supportive, the need for flexibility was emphasised to facilitate the transition from unaffected to affected status. Affected individuals felt it was important to be known as the person they had been, despite the changes due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of service in a dedicated unit is an appropriate way to support affected patients and their carers. Enhancing understanding of the disease and allowing the individual to make choices can assist coping with this challenging disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is helpful to allow patients control over timing and frequency of contact with professionals. Improving understanding of the condition in the public and health professionals may enable patients to access a greater range of social activities.",

Recent case reports suggest beneficial effect of globus pallidus internus (GPi)-DBS in selected patients suffering from Huntington's disease with marked disabling chorea. We present a 41-year-old man with genetically confirmed HD following quadruple GPi- and subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS. Motor function was assessed by Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and by Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) presurgery and postsurgery for up to 4 years. Furthermore, cognitive, neuropsychiatric state and quality of life (QoL) including life satisfaction (QLS) were annually evaluated. Chorea assessed by AIMS and UHDRS subscores improved by 52 and 55 %, 45 and 60 %, 35 and 45 % and 55-66 % at 1-4 years, respectively, compared to presurgical state following GPi-STN-DBS. During these time periods bradykinesia did not increase following separate STN- and combined GPi-STN-DBS compared to presurgical state. Mood, QoL and QLS were ameliorated. However, dysexecutive symptoms increased at 4 years postsurgery. The present case report suggests that bilateral GPi- and STN-DBS may represent a new treatment avenue in selected HD patients. Clinically, GPi-DBS attenuated chorea and was associated with a larger effect-adverse effect window compared to STN-DBS. However, GPi-DBS-induced bradykinesia may emerge as one main limitation of GPi-DBS in HD. Thus, quadruple GPi-STN-DBS may be indicated, if separate GPi-DBS does not result in sufficient control of motor symptoms. Future controlled studies need to confirm if the present anecdotal observation of additive beneficial effects of GPi- and STN-DBS in a HD patient with severe generalized chorea and relatively intact cognitive and affective functions indeed represents a new therapeutic option.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin gene. At present, the HD field is experiencing exciting times with the assessment for the first time in human subjects of interventions aimed at core disease mechanisms. Out of a portfolio of interventions that claim a potential disease-modifying effect in HD, the target huntingtin has more robust validation. In this review, we discuss the spectrum of huntingtin-lowering therapies that are currently being considered. We provide a critical appraisal of the validation of huntingtin as a drug target, describing the advantages, challenges, and limitations of the proposed therapeutic interventions. The development of these new therapies relies strongly on the knowledge of HD pathogenesis and the ability to translate this knowledge into validated pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Altogether, the goal is to support a rational drug development that is ethical and cost-effective. Among the pharmacodynamic biomarkers under development, the quantification of mutant huntingtin in the cerebral spinal fluid and PET imaging targeting huntingtin or phosphodiesterase 10A deserve special attention. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics are eagerly awaited as the first interventions that may be able to change the course of HD in a meaningful way.",

Cell replacement using human embryonic stem cells may offer the opportunity to repair the damaged circuits and significantly ameliorate disease conditions. Here, we showed that in-vitro-differentiated human striatal progenitors undergo maturation and integrate into host circuits upon intra-striatal transplantation in a rat model of HD. By combining graft-specific immunohistochemistry, rabies virus-mediated synaptic tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology, we showed that grafts can extend projections to the appropriate target structures, including the globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the substantia nigra, and receive synaptic contact from both host and graft cells with 6.6 +- 1.6 inputs cell per transplanted neuron. We have also shown that transplants elicited a significant improvement in sensory-motor tasks up to 2 months post-transplant further supporting the therapeutic potential of this approach.",

The worn-out products of cell metabolism should be safely eliminated via the proteasome, autophago-lysosome and exocytosis. Insufficient activity of these degradation mechanisms within neurons leads to the accumulation of toxic protein oligomers, which represent a starting material for development of neurodegenerative proteinopathy. The spectrum of CNS linked proteinopathies is particularly broad and includes Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia, Pick disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many others. Although the primary events in etiopathogenesis of sporadic forms of these diseases are still unknown, it is clear that aging, in connection with decreased activity of ubiquitin proteasome system, is the most significant risk factor. In this review we discuss the pathogenic role and intracellular fate of the candidate molecules associated with onset and progression of AD and PD, the protein tau and alpha-synuclein in context with the function of ubiquitin proteasome system. We also discuss the possibility whether or not the strategies focused to re-establishment of neuroproteostasis via accelerated clearance of damaged proteins in proteasome could be a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of major neurodegenerative diseases.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Choreic movements of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) may result from an abnormal control of sensory inputs. In order to further examine the pathophysiology of facial choreic movements (FCM), we carried out a neurophysiological study, including prepulse inhibition of the blink reflex (BR), in HD patients with and without FCM. METHODS: The study was conducted in 20 genetically proven HD patients with Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) scores of FCM ranging between 0 and 3, and in 12 age-matched healthy volunteers who served as control subjects. We counted the number of spontaneous blinks, recorded the electromyographic activity underlying FCM, and analyzed latency, amplitude, and duration of the BR responses to electrical and auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition was studied by comparing the responses to test trials with those to control trials. In control trials BRs were obtained to either a single supraorbital nerve electrical stimulus (EBR) or to a 90dB auditory stimulus (ABR). In test trials, the same stimuli were preceded by the prepulse, which was either a weak acoustic tone or a weak electrical stimulus to the third finger, delivered 30-150 ms before. RESULTS: Spontaneous blinking rate was abnormally low in 3 patients, and abnormally high in 9 patients. Mean duration of the BR was longer in patients than in control subjects. In prepulse trials, the percentage inhibition of the BR was abnormally reduced in 15 patients to at least one sensory modality, and significantly correlated with the score of FCM. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the severity of FCM in patients with HD might be an expression of a disturbance in motor control partly related to an abnormal processing of sensory inputs. Such abnormality involves circuits used in prepulse inhibition of the BR.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compile a comprehensive profile of the participants who had predictive testing from Huntington disease (HD) between 1994 and 2008 in Montreal, Canada. METHOD: This is a retrospective cohort study. The predictive testing protocol consisted of a telephone interview to give information about predictive testing and collect demographic data; a psychological assessment and counseling session; a session focused on medical and family history of HD; a session reserved for genetic counseling; a session where results were given to participants; and a follow-up telephone interview. RESULTS: A total of 181 applicants requested presymptomatic testing. 135 applicants (77 women and 58 men) completed the protocol and received test results while 40 withdrew. Of the latter, 3 manifested symptoms of the disease and were referred to a neurologist or psychiatrist, and 3 had previously been tested by linkage analysis. Participants usually mentioned more than one reason for requesting predictive testing but the most frequent was to put an end to uncertainty concerning their risk of illness. The proportion of positive and negatives test results was 40% and 54.1% respectively, significantly different from the expected 50% (p<0.01). Prenatal testing was not frequently requested. CONCLUSION: All the participants expressed satisfaction regarding their decision to be tested. None to our knowledge had a catastrophic reaction (major depressive disorder or psychiatric hospitalization, declared suicide attempt or suicide). Our study highlights that preparation for receiving test results is a psychologically complex process for which appropriate support in a timely fashion is critical. We feel that a cautious and ethical case by case approach remains essential and that high standards of testing should be maintained because of the far reaching impact of test results.",

Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

METHODS: We examined factor structure (confirmatory factor analysis), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), floor and ceiling effects, convergent validity (Pearson correlations), and known-groups validity (multivariate analysis). RESULTS: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis replicated the six-factor latent model that reflects the six separate scales within the WHODAS 2.0 (understanding and communicating; getting around; self-care; getting along with others; life activities; participation). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.94, suggesting good internal consistency reliability. The WHODAS demonstrated a ceiling effect for 19.5 % of participants; there were no floor effects. There was evidence for convergent validity; the WHODAS demonstrated moderate significant correlations with other general measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL; i.e., RAND-12, EQ5D). Multivariate analyses indicated that late-stage HD participants indicated poorer HRQOL than both early-stage HD and prodromal HD participants for all HRQOL measures. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide support for both the reliability and validity of the WHODAS 2.0 in individuals with HD.",

Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

The development of new metabolic treatments will be useful not only for rare mitochondrial disorders but also for the wide spectrum of common age-related neurodegenerative diseases shown to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. A better understanding of the mitochondrial regulating pathways raised several promising perspectives of neuroprotection.

For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

BMCs have the potential to differentiate into neural cells, cardiac myocytes, liver hepatocytes, chondrocytes, renal, corneal, blood, and myogenic cells. The bone marrow cell cultures from stromal and mesenchymal cells are called multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs). MAPCs can differentiate into mesenchymal cells, visceral mesoderm, neuroectoderm and endoderm in vitro. It has been shown that the stem cells derived from bone marrow cells (BMCs) can regenerate cardiac myocytes after myocardial infarction (MI). Adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have the ability to regenerate neural cells. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PC) are ideal for treating central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington disease. However, there are important ethical issues about the therapeutic use of stem cells. Neurons, cardiac myocytes, hepatocytes, renal cells, blood cells, chondrocytes and adipocytes regeneration from BMCs are very important in disease control. It is known that limbal epithelial stem cells in the cornea can repair the eye sight and remove symptoms of blindness. Stem cell therapy (SCT) is progressing well in animal models, but the use of SCT in human remains to be explored further.",

Patients worldwide stand to benefit from the clinical applicability of iPS cell-based cell replacement therapy for a number of degenerative diseases.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

In this study we used alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency with the piZZ mutant phenotype as a model system to evaluate the efficiency of gene-delivery approaches that both silence the piZZ transcript (e.g., shRNA) and restore circulating wild-type AAT expression from resistant codon-optimized AAT (AAT-opt) transgene cassette using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivery. After systemic injection of a self-complimentary AAV serotype 8 (scAAV8) vector encoding shRNA in piZZ transgenic mice, both mutant AAT mRNA in the liver and defected serum protein level were inhibited by 95%, whereas liver pathology, as monitored by dPAS and fibrosis staining, reversed. To restore blood AAT levels in AAV8/shRNA-treated mice, several strategies to restore functional AAT levels were tested, including using AAV AAT-opt transgene cassettes targeted to muscle and liver, or combination vectors carrying piZZ shRNA and AAT-opt transgenes separately, or a single bicistronic AAV vector. With these molecular approaches, we observed over 90% knockdown of mutant AAT with a 13- to 30-fold increase of circulating wild-type AAT protein from the shRNA-resistant AAT-opt cassette. The molecular approaches applied in this study can simultaneously prevent liver pathology and restore blood AAT concentration in AAT deficiencies. Based on these observations, similar gene-therapy strategies could be considered for any diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins.",

                    "abstract": "Neural stem cells (NSCs)of the central nervous system (CNS) have recently received a great deal of attention and interest for their therapeutic potential for neurological disorders. NSCs are defined as CNS progenitor cells that have the capacity for self-renewal and multipotent potential to become neurons or glial cells. Recent studies have shown that NSCs isolated from mammalian CNS including human can be propagated in vitro and then implanted into the brain of animal models of human neurological disorders. Recently, we have generated clonally derived immortalized human NSC cell lines via a retroviral vector encoded with v-myc oncogene. One of the human NSC lines, HB1.F3, was utilized in stem-cell based therapy in animal models of human neurological disorders. When F3 human NSCs were implanted into the brain of murine models of lysosomal storage diseases, stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease or stroke, implanted F3 NSCs were found to migrate to the lesion sites, differentiate into neurons and glial cells, and restore functional deficits found in these neurological disorders. In animal models of brain tumors, F3 NSCs could deliver a bioactive therapeutically relevant molecules to effect a significant anti-tumor response intracranial tumor mass. Since these genetically engineered human NSCs are immortalized and continuously multiplying, there would be limitless supply of human neurons for treatment for patients suffering from neurological disorders including stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The promising field of stem cell research as it applies to regenerative medicine is still in infancy, but its potential appears limitless, and we are blessed to be involved in this exciting realm of research.",

Abnormal responses to anesthesia have been reported in case reports and raised concerns regarding the safety of anesthesia in this patient population. METHODS: We performed a computerized search of the Mayo Clinic medical records database searching for patients with HD who underwent general anesthesia. Medical records were reviewed for anesthetic technique, medications used, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: We identified 11 patients with genetically confirmed HD who underwent 17 general anesthetics. Psychiatric medication use was common, with 6 patients using antipsychotics, 7 patients using antidepressants, and 3 patients using benzodiazepines. Succinylcholine was used in 7 anesthetics, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs in 11 anesthetics, all without adverse effects. Patients had normal responses to induction and maintenance of anesthesia without adverse effects. Serious postoperative complications did not occur. CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous case reports, we found that patients with HD have normal responses to general anesthesia. However, the anesthesiologist should be aware of interactions between anesthetics and psychiatric medications frequently used by these patients. Measures should also be taken to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration because bulbar dysfunction may be a manifestation of this disease.",

The presence of this mutant protein is correlated with the characteristic loss of striatal neurons and the clinical manifestation of HD. Currently there is no effective treatment for the associated cell death. The aim of this study was to evaluate an innovative strategy combining RNA interference (RNAi) and gene transfer via the nonviral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system to down-regulate Htt expression. siRNA expression vectors were designed to target exons 1, 4, 6, and 62 of the human htt gene. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to quantify Htt mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in human cell lines. The results indicated that selected siRNA constructs significantly decreased Htt mRNA and protein levels relative to controls. In addition, SB transposition of the siRNA constructs into the genome reduced long-term protein expression of Htt by approximately 90%. The combination of siRNA, the SB transposon, and an accurate transgenic mouse model may permit evaluation of this approach in preventing the pathogenesis associated with expression of mutant Htt.",

The results from this Ionis trial have gained much attention from the patient community and the oligonucleotide therapeutics field, since it is the first trial targeting the cause of HD, namely the mutant huntingtin protein, using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The press release also states that the primary endpoints of the study (safety and tolerability) were met, but does not contain data. This news follows the approval of another therapeutic ASO nusinersen (trade name Spinraza) for a neurological disease, spinal muscular atrophy, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Combined, this offers hope for the development of the HTTRx therapy for HD patients.",

These anomalies include bioenergetic defect, respiratory chain-induced oxidative stress, defects of mitochondrial dynamics, increase sensitivity to apoptosis, and accumulation of damaged mitochondria with instable mitochondrial DNA. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited mitochondrial disorders but most have no effective therapies. The development of new metabolic treatments will be useful not only for rare mitochondrial disorders but also for the wide spectrum of common age-related neurodegenerative diseases shown to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. A better understanding of the mitochondrial regulating pathways raised several promising perspectives of neuroprotection. This review focuses on the pharmacological approaches to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis, the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy, scavenging free radicals and also dietary measures such as ketogenic diet.",

More innovative approaches are currently under active investigation, including screening using electrophysiological endpoints, as well as the recent use of primary blood mononuclear cells and of human embryonic stem cells derived from a variety of HD research participants. Here we describe how these cellular systems are being used to investigate HD biology as well as to identify mechanisms with therapeutic potential. ",

                    "abstract": "AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to examine the emotional experience of caregiving by family carers of people with Huntington disease and to describe strategies they used to deal with that experience. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease, commonly diagnosed in young to middle adulthood, is an inherited single gene disorder involving loss of cognitive, motor and neuropsychiatric function. Many family members become caregivers as well as continuing as parents and wage earners. The emotional aspects of caregiving contribute to mental health risks for family members. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 42 adult carers of people with Huntington disease in four United States and two Canadian Huntington disease centers between 2001 and 2005. Data were analyzed through descriptive coding and thematic analysis. FINDINGS: All participants reported multiple aspects of emotional distress. Being a carer was described as experiencing disintegration of one's life. Carers attempted to cope by seeking comfort from selected family members, anticipating the time when the care recipient had died and/or using prescription medications. Spousal carers were distressed by the loss of their relationship with their spouse and dealt with this by no longer regarding the person as an intimate partner. Carers were concerned about the disease risk for children in their families and hoped for a cure. CONCLUSION: Emotional distress can compromise the well-being of family carers, who attempt to maintain multiple roles. Nurses should monitor carer mental health, identify sources of emotional distress and support effective strategies used by carers to mediate distress.",

It employs the use of polymerase chain reaction to amplify single cells from early embryos obtained with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques. PGD allows the couple the chance to have a pregnancy and livebirth child without Huntington disease, although there are some risks and expenses related to the procedures. Success of the procedure may be greater than standard IVF because the patients are not infertility patients, but are undergoing the procedure to avoid passing a highly deleterious disease gene to offspring. Recent advances in sequencing may allow for higher success rates as the chromosomally abnormal embryos will be identified more easily and the embryos with the highest chance of survival will be transferred.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To delineate the progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: A survey of individuals with symptomatic HD completed by a first-degree relative. SETTING: The National Huntington Disease Research Roster for Patients and Families, Indianapolis, Ind. PARTICIPANTS: The survey included 1238 individuals with a minimum of a 6-year history of symptomatic HD. MEASURES: Participating families completed a series of surveys, including the Affected Individual Questionnaire, which consists of 19 physical, emotional, and cognitive signs commonly thought to occur during disease progression. The respondent indicates if each of the symptoms occurred and, if so, at what time during the course of the disease: (1) within 1 year, (2) within 2 to 5 years, (3) within 6 to 10 years, (4) after more than 10 years, (5) has not occurred, or (6) \"don't know.\" RESULTS: The symptoms are categorized into 6 onset periods. Involuntary movements are grouped alone as the earliest reported symptom. The second group is composed entirely of mental and emotional symptoms, including sadness, depression, and difficult to get along with. The third group includes clumsiness, sexual problems, lack of motivation, and suspiciousness/paranoia. As the disease progresses, a variety of motor, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive symptoms are experienced, including unsteadiness, trouble holding onto things, trouble walking, changes in sleeping patterns, delusions and hallucinations, intellectual decline, and memory loss. With the approach of late-stage HD, affected individuals begin to experience speech difficulty and weight loss. In the late stage, patients lose bowel and bladder control. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the symptoms of HD are fairly well characterized, their progression, especially in the early and middle stages, remains uncertain. Clarification of the disease progression is vital to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HD and to the evaluation of therapeutic agents that are designed to slow the progression of disease. The results of this study assist in clarifying HD progression from early involuntary movements and emotional changes to more overt motor symptoms and difficulty with activities of daily living.",

METHODS: Huntington Disease (HD) had to be diagnosed using short tandem repeat (STR) markers linked to the HTT gene. The mutation c.1551_1552ins20 was analyzed by fragment size and c.859G>C was minisequenced. Furthermore, STR markers linked to the POR gene were included to support the diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase (POR) deficiency. RESULTS: Nine embryos were diagnosed in total: three as POR deficiency affected, two as HD affected, one as POR deficiency and HD affected, and two as carriers of the paternal POR deficiency mutation and healthy for HD. These two last embryos were transferred but no pregnancy was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: A successful procedure combining direct and indirect methods for the detection of three different mutations in a single cell has been achieved for the first time.",

In this study we used alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency with the piZZ mutant phenotype as a model system to evaluate the efficiency of gene-delivery approaches that both silence the piZZ transcript (e.g., shRNA) and restore circulating wild-type AAT expression from resistant codon-optimized AAT (AAT-opt) transgene cassette using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivery. After systemic injection of a self-complimentary AAV serotype 8 (scAAV8) vector encoding shRNA in piZZ transgenic mice, both mutant AAT mRNA in the liver and defected serum protein level were inhibited by 95%, whereas liver pathology, as monitored by dPAS and fibrosis staining, reversed. To restore blood AAT levels in AAV8/shRNA-treated mice, several strategies to restore functional AAT levels were tested, including using AAV AAT-opt transgene cassettes targeted to muscle and liver, or combination vectors carrying piZZ shRNA and AAT-opt transgenes separately, or a single bicistronic AAV vector. With these molecular approaches, we observed over 90% knockdown of mutant AAT with a 13- to 30-fold increase of circulating wild-type AAT protein from the shRNA-resistant AAT-opt cassette. The molecular approaches applied in this study can simultaneously prevent liver pathology and restore blood AAT concentration in AAT deficiencies. Based on these observations, similar gene-therapy strategies could be considered for any diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins.",

We investigated the therapeutic potential of silencing Rhes in vivo using inhibitory RNAs (miRhes). While Rhes suppression was tolerated in wildtype mice, it failed to improve rotarod function in two distinct HD mouse models. Additionally, miRhes treated HD mice had increased anxiety-like behaviors and enhanced striatal atrophy as measured by longitudinal MRI when compared to control treated mice.

                    "abstract": "A neurogenetic disorder is defined as a clinical disease caused by a defect in one or more genes which affect the differentiation and function of the neuroectoderm and its derivatives. Genetic findings in various neurogenetic disorders are discussed. Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant disorders caused by the expansion of trinucleotides (CAG) within disease genes. The CAG expansions appear to result in a gain of gene function. Prenatal, presymptomatic, and differential diagnostic tests are based on the detection of the repeat expansions. Point mutations within disease genes result in many additional neurogenetic disorders. An autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various types of craniosynostotic syndromes are described. The mutations in the disease genes also appear to result in a gain of gene function. Molecular diagnosis in these disorders is based on the direct examination of the mutated gene by methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing. In many neurogenetic disorders the disease gene has not yet been identified. Here molecular diagnosis relies on indirect approaches based on methods such as the analysis of linkage and of allelic association. Hereditary forms of dystonia are presented as examples. Common sporadic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases frequently have multifactorial causes. Investigations into the molecular basis and the development of diagnostic tests in these two important diseases are discussed. At present no curative therapies exist in neurogenetic disorders. Gene therapeutic approaches, however, provide promise for a cure in at least some of these diseases. Basic principles of gene therapy are explained and attempts at gene therapy in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are described. Finally, some of the many obstacles are summarized that must be overcome before gene therapy becomes feasible in most monogenic neurological diseases.",

The presence of this mutant protein is correlated with the characteristic loss of striatal neurons and the clinical manifestation of HD. Currently there is no effective treatment for the associated cell death. The aim of this study was to evaluate an innovative strategy combining RNA interference (RNAi) and gene transfer via the nonviral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system to down-regulate Htt expression. siRNA expression vectors were designed to target exons 1, 4, 6, and 62 of the human htt gene. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to quantify Htt mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in human cell lines. The results indicated that selected siRNA constructs significantly decreased Htt mRNA and protein levels relative to controls. In addition, SB transposition of the siRNA constructs into the genome reduced long-term protein expression of Htt by approximately 90%. The combination of siRNA, the SB transposon, and an accurate transgenic mouse model may permit evaluation of this approach in preventing the pathogenesis associated with expression of mutant Htt.",

                    "abstract": "Since the discovery of the HTT gene in 1993, numerous animal models have been developed to study the progression of Huntington disease (HD) and to evaluate potential new therapeutics. In the present study, we used small-animal PET to characterize the expression of molecular targets in the recently reported HD animal model, the zQ175 mouse model. Methods: Male heterozygous zQ175 (Htttm1Mfc/190JChdi, CHDI-81003003) and wild-type (WT, C57BL/6J) animals were imaged with the dopamine D2 receptor radioligand 11C-raclopride, the PDE10A radioligand 18F-MNI-659, the dopamine D1 receptor radioligand 11C-NNC 112, and the 5-HT2A radioligand 11C-MDL 100907 at 6 and 9 mo of age. The outcome measure was the binding potential (BPND), using the cerebellum as the reference region. Selected regions of interest were the striatum for all radioligands and additionally the striatum, rostral cortex, caudal cortex, and hippocampus for 11C-NNC 112 and 11C-MDL 100907. Results: At 6 mo of age, the BPND in the striatum was lower in zQ175 than WT animals by 40% for 11C-raclopride, by 52% for 18F-MNI-659, by 28% for 11C-NNC, and by 11% for 11C-MDL 100907. In the rostral cortex, D1 receptor binding was 22% lower in zQ175 than WT animals. We found an overall reduction in D1 and 5-HT2A binding in the hippocampus of zQ175 compared with WT animals. The BPND of 11C-MDL 100907 in the caudal cortex was also lower in zQ175 WT animals. At 9 mo, there was a slight further reduction of D1, D2, and 5-HT2ABPND in the striatum, whereas PDE10A reached a plateau. Cortical markers were also slightly further decreased at 9 mo in zQ175 animals. Conclusion: Our study indicates a marked reduction of ligand binding to D1 and D2 and 5-HT2A receptors as well as loss of PDE10A enzyme in the striatum of zQ175 mice as compared with WT animals, in agreement with data obtained in clinical PET studies of patients with HD. The zQ175 mouse model recapitulates the expression pattern seen in humans with HD and may have value in further elucidating pathophysiologic events and therapeutic strategies.",

Therefore, it's necessary to search for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study, we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We reported several potential genes may be associated with the kidney transplant rejection, which should provide novel biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance.",

In particular, the grafted cells can sustain functional recovery in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative conditions including genetic and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood and aging, ischemic stroke, and brain and spinal cord trauma. In a restricted subset of such conditions, cell transplantation has progressed to application in humans in early-stage clinical trials. At the present stage of play, there is clear evidence of clinical efficacy of fetal cell transplants in Parkinson disease (notwithstanding a range of technical difficulties still to be fully resolved), and preliminary claims of promising outcomes in several other severe neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington disease and stroke. Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

Catatonia is an underdiagnosed psychomotor syndrome often associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders, but it has rarely been documented in patients with HD. Catatonia usually responds to standard treatment with benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy; however, this patient's catatonic syndrome did not improve until we augmented the standard treatment with amantadine and levodopa. The underlying pathophysiology and a neurochemical hypothesis of HD and catatonia can explain their comorbidity and the refractoriness of catatonia to treatment. Both conditions are linked to dysregulation of neurotransmitters in the striatocortical and corticocortical pathways. This understanding may serve as a guide for the use of nonstandard treatments. Our evidence also suggests that electroconvulsive therapy can be useful and safe in the treatment of HD.",

BMCs have the potential to differentiate into neural cells, cardiac myocytes, liver hepatocytes, chondrocytes, renal, corneal, blood, and myogenic cells. The bone marrow cell cultures from stromal and mesenchymal cells are called multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs). MAPCs can differentiate into mesenchymal cells, visceral mesoderm, neuroectoderm and endoderm in vitro. It has been shown that the stem cells derived from bone marrow cells (BMCs) can regenerate cardiac myocytes after myocardial infarction (MI). Adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have the ability to regenerate neural cells. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PC) are ideal for treating central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington disease. However, there are important ethical issues about the therapeutic use of stem cells. Neurons, cardiac myocytes, hepatocytes, renal cells, blood cells, chondrocytes and adipocytes regeneration from BMCs are very important in disease control. It is known that limbal epithelial stem cells in the cornea can repair the eye sight and remove symptoms of blindness. Stem cell therapy (SCT) is progressing well in animal models, but the use of SCT in human remains to be explored further.",

HD is pathologically characterized by loss of neurons in the striatum and cortex, which leads to progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline and behavioral symptoms. Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and may be effective in alleviating and/or halting the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HD. Several pre-clinical studies have used stem cells in animal models of HD. Here, we performed a systematic review of preclinical studies to estimate the treatment efficacy of stem cells in animal models of HD. Based on our systematic review, treatment with stem cells significantly improves neurological and behavioral outcomes in animal models of HD. Although promising results were found, the design of animal studies, the types of transplanted cells and the route of administration are poorly standardized and this greatly complicates comparative analysis.",

There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they would give directive counseling. Women were more likely than men to say that they would perform prenatal diagnosis for maternal anxiety or for sex selection.",

There are very limited treatments, and no cures, for most of these diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington Disease, and Motor Neuron Diseases. Mouse and other animal models provide hope by analysing them to understand pathogenic mechanisms, to identify drug targets, and to develop gene therapies and stem cell therapies. However, despite many decades of research, virtually no new treatments have reached the clinic. Increasingly, it is apparent that human heterogeneity within clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders, and between patients with the same genetic mutations, significantly impacts disease presentation and, potentially, therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, stratifying patients according to genetics, lifestyle, disease presentation, ethnicity, and other parameters may hold the key to bringing effective therapies from the bench to the clinic. Here, we discuss genetic and cellular humanised mouse models, and how they help in defining the genetic and environmental parameters associated with neurodegenerative disease, and so help in developing effective precision medicine strategies for future healthcare.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

Lifestyle factors, such as activity level and exercise, as well as specific motor training may be helpful in managing the functional sequelae of HD and possibly slowing disease progression. In this chapter, we focus on the role of rehabilitation therapy in secondary and tertiary prevention of the potentially devastating consequences of HD. We provide a brief overview of the range of motor and cognitive impairments in HD and their effect on functional abilities. We further discuss emerging evidence in terms of the role of exercise, physical activity, and physical therapies in helping to minimize functional loss and maximize quality of life throughout the disease process. Future directions with respect to intensive and goal-directed exercise, including aerobic and strengthening programs, are also discussed. This is an area of particular importance alongside exploring the potential that motor-training paradigms have in mediating the effects of disease-modifying drugs, cell replacement therapy, or genetic manipulations, when available.",

Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Mitochondrial diseases are neuromuscular disorders caused by impairment of the respiratory chain and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation is fundamental in patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Furthermore, coenzyme Q10 and its analogues, idebenone and mitoquinone (or MitoQ), have been also used in the treatment of other neurogenetic/neurodegenerative disorders. In Friedreich ataxia idebenone may reduce cardiac hypertrophy and, at higher doses, also improve neurological function. These compounds may also play a potential role in other conditions which have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer disease. This review introduces mitochondrial disorders and Friedreich ataxia as two paradigms of the tight links existing between oxidative stress, respiratory chain dysfunction and neurodegeneration, and focuses on current and emerging therapeutic uses of coenzyme Q10 and idebenone in neurology.",

Measurement tools can identify vulnerabilities, resources and the need for subsequent treatment to relieve suffering and support well-being. AIM: To systematically review available tools measuring attitudes towards dying, their operationalization, the method of measurement and the methodological quality including generalizability to different contexts. DESIGN: Systematic review according to the PRISMA Statement. Methodological quality of tools assessed by standardized review criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsyndexTests and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched from their inception to April 2017. RESULTS: A total of 94 identified studies reported the development and/or validation of 44 tools. Of these, 37 were questionnaires and 7 alternative measurement methods (e.g. projective measures). In 34 of 37 questionnaires, the emotional evaluation (e.g. anxiety) towards dying is measured. Dying is operationalized in general items ( n = 20), in several specific aspects of dying ( n = 34) and as dying of others ( n = 14). Methodological quality of tools was reported inconsistently. Nine tools reported good internal consistency. Of 37 tools, 4 were validated in a clinical sample (e.g. terminal cancer; Huntington disease), indicating questionable generalizability to clinical contexts for most tools. CONCLUSION: Many tools exist to measure attitudes towards the dying process using different endpoints. This overview can serve as decision framework on which tool to apply in which contexts. For clinical application, only few tools were available. Further validation of existing tools and potential alternative methods in various populations is needed.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease, commonly diagnosed in young to middle adulthood, is an inherited single gene disorder involving loss of cognitive, motor and neuropsychiatric function. Many family members become caregivers as well as continuing as parents and wage earners. The emotional aspects of caregiving contribute to mental health risks for family members. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 42 adult carers of people with Huntington disease in four United States and two Canadian Huntington disease centers between 2001 and 2005. Data were analyzed through descriptive coding and thematic analysis. FINDINGS: All participants reported multiple aspects of emotional distress. Being a carer was described as experiencing disintegration of one's life. Carers attempted to cope by seeking comfort from selected family members, anticipating the time when the care recipient had died and/or using prescription medications. Spousal carers were distressed by the loss of their relationship with their spouse and dealt with this by no longer regarding the person as an intimate partner. Carers were concerned about the disease risk for children in their families and hoped for a cure. CONCLUSION: Emotional distress can compromise the well-being of family carers, who attempt to maintain multiple roles. Nurses should monitor carer mental health, identify sources of emotional distress and support effective strategies used by carers to mediate distress.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. The mutant protein causes neuronal dysfunction and degeneration resulting in motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. Currently, there is no disease altering treatment, and symptomatic therapy has limited benefit. The pathogenesis of HD is complicated and multiple pathways are compromised. Addressing the problem at its genetic root by suppressing mutant huntingtin expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for HD. We have developed and evaluated antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly enriched on HD alleles (HD-SNPs). We describe our structure-activity relationship studies for ASO design and find that adjusting the SNP position within the gap, chemical modifications of the wings, and shortening the unmodified gap are critical for potent, specific, and well tolerated silencing of mutant huntingtin. Finally, we show that using two distinct ASO drugs targeting the two allelic variants of an HD-SNP could provide a therapeutic option for all persons with HD; allele-specifically for roughly half, and non-specifically for the remainder.

                    "abstract": "Fumaric acid esters have been used successfully in the therapy of psoriasis vulgaris since 1959. In the last 17 years, many of the underlying mechanisms of anti-psoriatic action, such as a Th1/Th2 shift, a suppression of important leukocyte adhesion molecules, the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways in T-cells and recently anti-angiogenic action, have been discovered. Based on the knowledge of these immunomodulatory characteristics, fumaric acid esters have been shown to be effective or potentially effective in a multitude of dermatological as well as non-dermatological diseases. The range of new therapeutic targets reaches from multiple sclerosis to illnesses such as necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare and sarcoidosis. Experimental approaches offer promising, although preliminary, results on the treatment of cancer, malaria, chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and Huntington disease, to name but a few. This valued and well-known drug mainly prescribed by dermatologists is now experiencing a renaissance far beyond dermatologic applications.",

Thus, therapies targeted at downstream pathology are likely to be disease specific.

Whereas germline expansion accounts for the phenomenon of anticipation, tissue-specific, age-dependent somatic expansion may contribute towards the tissue-specificity and progressive nature of the symptoms. Thus, somatic expansion presents as a novel therapeutic target in these disorders. Suppression of somatic expansion should be therapeutically beneficial, whilst reductions in repeat length could be curative. It is well established that both cis- and trans-acting genetic modifiers play key roles in the control of repeat dynamics.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set. CONCLUSION: SERS is proved as a highly sensitive and discriminating technique to detect and discriminate insulin structural changes after regular intervals of time at room temperature.",

In addition, a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, along with cognitive decline, contribute significantly to the patient's disability. Because there are no effective neuroprotective therapies that delay the progression of the disease, symptomatic treatment remains the cornerstone of medical management. Several classes of medications have been used to ameliorate the various symptoms of HD, including typical and atypical neuroleptics, dopamine depleters, antidepressants, antiglutamatergic drugs, GABA agonists, antiepileptic medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and botulinum toxin. Recently, surgical approaches including pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation, and fetal cell transplants have been used for the symptomatic treatment of HD. The selected therapy must be customized to the needs of each patient, minimizing the potential adverse effects. The primary aim of this article is to review the role of the different therapies, both available and investigational, for the treatment of the motor, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of HD, and to examine their impact on the patient's functionality and quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "Importance: Tetrabenazine is efficacious for chorea control; however, tolerability concerns exist. Deutetrabenazine, a novel molecule that reduces chorea, was well tolerated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Objectives: To evaluate the safety and explore the efficacy of conversion from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine in patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm study that started on December 21, 2013, 37 patients at 13 Huntington Study Group sites in the United States and Australia who were taking stable doses of tetrabenazine that provided a therapeutic benefit were switched overnight to deutetrabenazine therapy. After week 1, the deutetrabenazine dose was titrated on a weekly basis for optimal chorea control. Interventions: Deutetrabenazine administration at a dosage thought to provide comparable systemic exposure to the active metabolites of the prior, stable tetrabenazine regimen. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and validated scales. Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea score and total motor score were efficacy end points. Results: Of the 53 patients with HD screened for the study, 37 ambulatory patients with manifest HD (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [11.5] years; 22 [59%] male and 15 [41%] female; 36 white [97.3%]) were enrolled. Deutetrabenazine was generally well tolerated, with low rates of neuropsychiatric AEs. Safety scales did not reveal subclinical toxicity with deutetrabenazine treatment. Rates of dose reduction or suspension attributable to AEs were also low. Chorea control, as measured by the total maximal chorea score, was maintained at week 1 and significantly improved at week 8 (mean [SD] change from baseline, 2.1 [3.2]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with chorea, overnight conversion to deutetrabenazine therapy provided a favorable safety profile and effectively maintained chorea control.",

The multidisciplinary study of HD has been the focus of an international collaborating effort of basic and applied research for several decades. HD was the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low. Current treatment of HD is mostly symptomatic, but ongoing observational studies, clinical trials and development of new gene silencing technologies have provided hopeful results.",

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review. RESULTS: Dementia, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease are the neurological diseases that most frequently motivate requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Requests related to dementia constitute the largest group, are growing, and raise additional ethical and legal issues due to these patients' diminished decision-making capacity. In some countries, the ratios of euthanasia requests to all cases of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, or Huntington disease are higher than for any other disease.

In this study we used alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency with the piZZ mutant phenotype as a model system to evaluate the efficiency of gene-delivery approaches that both silence the piZZ transcript (e.g., shRNA) and restore circulating wild-type AAT expression from resistant codon-optimized AAT (AAT-opt) transgene cassette using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector delivery. After systemic injection of a self-complimentary AAV serotype 8 (scAAV8) vector encoding shRNA in piZZ transgenic mice, both mutant AAT mRNA in the liver and defected serum protein level were inhibited by 95%, whereas liver pathology, as monitored by dPAS and fibrosis staining, reversed. To restore blood AAT levels in AAV8/shRNA-treated mice, several strategies to restore functional AAT levels were tested, including using AAV AAT-opt transgene cassettes targeted to muscle and liver, or combination vectors carrying piZZ shRNA and AAT-opt transgenes separately, or a single bicistronic AAV vector. With these molecular approaches, we observed over 90% knockdown of mutant AAT with a 13- to 30-fold increase of circulating wild-type AAT protein from the shRNA-resistant AAT-opt cassette. The molecular approaches applied in this study can simultaneously prevent liver pathology and restore blood AAT concentration in AAT deficiencies. Based on these observations, similar gene-therapy strategies could be considered for any diseases caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins.",

These data are part of a survey of 682 geneticists in 19 nations. Of 490 U.S. geneticists asked to participate, 295 (60%) returned anonymous detailed questionnaires. There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they would give directive counseling. Women were more likely than men to say that they would perform prenatal diagnosis for maternal anxiety or for sex selection.",

Emerging investigations have provided new understanding of how autophagy of mitochondria (also known as mitophagy) is associated with cellular oxidative stress and its impact on neurodegeneration. This impaired autophagic function may be considered as a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease. It can be suggested that autophagy dysfunction along with oxidative stress is considered main events in neurodegenerative disorders. New therapeutic approaches have now begun to target mitochondria as a potential drug target. This review discusses evidence supporting the notion that oxidative stress and autophagy are intimately associated with neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. This review also explores new approaches that can prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, improve neurodegenerative etiology, and also offer possible cures to the aforementioned neurodegenerative diseases.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length immunoglobulins and offer important advantages compared with conventional monoclonal antibodies: extreme specificity, higher affinity, superior stability and solubility, reduced immunogenicity as well as easy and inexpensive large-scale production. OBJECTIVE: In this article we will review and discuss recombinant antibodies that are being evaluated for neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical models and in clinical studies and will summarize new strategies that are being developed to optimize their stability, specificity and potency for advancing their use. METHODS: Articles describing recombinant antibody fragments used for neurological diseases were selected (PubMed) and evaluated for their significance. RESULTS: Different antibody formats such as single-chain fragment variable (scFv), single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs or sdAbs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), intrabodies and nanobodies, are currently being studied in pre-clinical models of cancer as well as infectious and autoimmune diseases and many of them are being tested as therapeutics in clinical trials. Immunotherapy approaches have shown therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of Alzheimer s disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington disease (HD), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that recombinant antibody fragments may neutralize toxic extra- and intracellular misfolded proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, DLB, FTD, HD or TSEs and may target toxic immune cells participating in the pathogenesis of MS. CONCLUSION: Recombinant antibody fragments represent a promising tool for the development of antibody-based immunotherapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of goal-directed, task-specific mobility training for individuals with mid-stage HD. DESIGN: This study was a randomized, blinded, feasibility trial; participants were randomly assigned to control (usual care) and intervention groups. SETTING: This multisite study was conducted in 6 sites in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Thirty individuals with mid-stage HD (13 men, 17 women; mean age=57.0 years, SD=10.1) were enrolled and randomly assigned to study groups. INTERVENTION: Task-specific training was conducted by physical therapists in participants' homes, focusing on walking, sit-to-stand transfers, and standing, twice a week for 8 weeks. Goal attainment scaling was used to individualize the intervention and monitor achievement of personal goals. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence and adverse events were recorded. Adjusted between-group comparisons on standardized outcome measures were conducted at 8 and 16 weeks to determine effect sizes. RESULTS: Loss to follow-up was minimal (n=2); adherence in the intervention group was excellent (96.9%). Ninety-two percent of goals were achieved at the end of the intervention; 46% of the participants achieved much better than expected outcomes. Effect sizes on all measures were small. LIMITATIONS: Measurements of walking endurance were lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of and excellent adherence to a home-based, task-specific training program, in which most participants exceeded goal expectations, are encouraging given the range of motivational, behavioral, and mobility issues in people with HD. The design of the intervention in terms of frequency (dose), intensity (aerobic versus anaerobic), and specificity (focused training on individual tasks) may not have been sufficient to elicit any systematic effects. Thus, a larger-scale trial of this specific intervention does not seem warranted.",

METHODS: Thirty patients treated in the long term were randomized to 1 of 3 groups assigned to withdraw from TBZ in a double-blind, staggered fashion during a 5-day period. RESULTS: The chorea scores of subjects withdrawn from TBZ treatment increased by 5.3 units from days 1 to 3, whereas the scores of the group with partial or no withdrawal of TBZ treatment increased by 3.0 units (P = 0.0773). A post hoc analysis of the linear trend was positive for reemergent chorea (P = 0.0486). No serious adverse events were reported after abrupt withdrawal of TBZ treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The trend for reemergence of chorea in patients with Huntington disease who were withdrawn from TBZ treatment is consistent with the findings from previous studies, thus showing the effectiveness of TBZ in reducing chorea.",

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective survey of patients seen by UWAGMC that included patients seen from 1975 to 2016. Variables considered included referral indication, disease status, and clinic visit date. Indications for referral were then binned into clinical categories for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Of 30,780 patient visits during the 39 years for which data were available, 57.3% occurred in the last decade. Referrals for breast/ovarian cancer or colon/endometrial cancer account for 74.8% of cancer referrals since 1998. Huntington disease patients made up 46% of neurological referral indications. Telephone screening implemented in 2013 has reduced the number of referrals for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSION: Referral indications increased with clinical testing availability and because of the academic programs of UWAGMC providers. With increased public awareness of heritable conditions, prescreening self-referrals were used to allocate limited resources. These trends demonstrate the need for more geneticists in adult medicine to expand centers of excellence for rare diseases and to serve the increasing numbers of adult patients with genetic conditions.",

                    "abstract": "Cognitive decline precedes motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD). A transgenic rat model for HD carrying only 51 CAG repeats recapitulates the late-onset HD phenotype. Here, we assessed prefrontostriatal function in this model through both behavioral and electrophysiological assays. Behavioral examination consisted in a temporal bisection task within a supra-second range (2 vs.8 s), which is thought to involve prefrontostriatal networks. In two independent experiments, the behavioral analysis revealed poorer temporal sensitivity as early as 4 months of age, well before detection of overt motor deficits. At a later symptomatic age, animals were impaired in their temporal discriminative behavior. In vivo recording of field potentials in the dorsomedial striatum evoked by stimulation of the prelimbic cortex were studied in 4- to 5-month-old rats. Input/output curves, paired-pulse function, and plasticity induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) were assessed. Results showed an altered plasticity, with higher paired-pulse facilitation, enhanced short-term depression, as well as stronger long-term potentiation after TBS in homozygous transgenic rats. Results from the heterozygous animals mostly fell between wild-type and homozygous transgenic rats. Our results suggest that normal plasticity in prefrontostriatal circuits may be necessary for reliable and precise timing behavior. Furthermore, the present study provides the first behavioral and electrophysiological evidence of a presymptomatic alteration of prefrontostriatal processing in an animal model for Huntington disease and suggests that supra-second timing may be the earliest cognitive dysfunction in HD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Testosterone deficiency has been reported in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease, and Huntington disease. It is not known whether testosterone therapy (TT) in men with borderline hypogonadism and neurodegenerative diseases will be of substantial benefit. Previously, we reported that testosterone deficiency is more common in patients with PD compared with age-matched control subjects, and we also reported in 2 small open-label studies that some nonmotor symptoms responded favorably to TT. OBJECTIVE: To define the effects of TT on nonmotor and motor symptoms in men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. DESIGN: Double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center trial. PATIENTS: Two experimental groups: patients with PD who were receiving either TT or placebo. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received either the study drug by intramuscular injection (200 mg/mL of testosterone enanthate every 2 weeks for 8 weeks) or placebo (isotonic sodium chloride solution injections). In patients in each group, the testosterone serum concentration was obtained at each study visit. During 2 study visits, testosterone levels were blindly evaluated and the intramuscular testosterone dose was increased by 200 mg/mL if the free testosterone value failed to double from the baseline value. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variable was the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Questionnaire, and secondary outcome measures included measures of mood, cognition, fatigue, motor function, and frequency of adverse events. At the end of the double-blind phase, all patients were offered open-label TT and were followed up after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Fifteen patients in the placebo group (mean age, 69.9 years), receiving a mean total levodopa equivalent dose of 924 mg/d, had a baseline free testosterone level of 47.91 pg/mL, compared with 15 patients in the TT group (mean age, 66.7 years), receiving an average total levodopa equivalent dose of 734 mg/d, who had a baseline free testosterone level of 63.49 pg/mL. Testosterone was generally well tolerated. More subjects in the TT group experienced lower extremity edema (40% vs 20%). In 2 patients, 1 in each group, prostate-specific antigen levels were elevated from baseline. The improvement in the TT group compared with the placebo group (1.7 vs 1.1) on the St Louis Testosterone Deficiency Scale was not statistically significant. In addition, there were no significant differences in motor and nonmotor features of PD between the 2 groups, although a few subscales showed improvements (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, P<.04; and Backward Visual Span subtrial, P<.03). However, long-term open-label TT resulted in delayed but sustained improvement in subjects in the TT group who continued to receive treatment (n = 6) compared with subjects in the placebo group who elected not to receive TT (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone therapy was generally well tolerated in elderly men with PD and probable testosterone deficiency. While there was no significant difference in the motor and nonmotor scales between the TT and placebo groups at the end of 8 weeks compared with baseline, this may be due to several study limitations, including small sample size, a strong placebo effect with intramuscular therapy, and short follow-up that did not allow measurement of delayed effects of TT in some subjects. Until more definitive studies are reported, practitioners should be particularly cautious in treatment of low testosterone concentrations in men with PD and borderline testosterone deficiency, and careful consideration should be given to the risks vs the benefits of TT.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

In the last 17 years, many of the underlying mechanisms of anti-psoriatic action, such as a Th1/Th2 shift, a suppression of important leukocyte adhesion molecules, the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways in T-cells and recently anti-angiogenic action, have been discovered. Based on the knowledge of these immunomodulatory characteristics, fumaric acid esters have been shown to be effective or potentially effective in a multitude of dermatological as well as non-dermatological diseases. The range of new therapeutic targets reaches from multiple sclerosis to illnesses such as necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare and sarcoidosis. Experimental approaches offer promising, although preliminary, results on the treatment of cancer, malaria, chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and Huntington disease, to name but a few.

HD is pathologically characterized by loss of neurons in the striatum and cortex, which leads to progressive motor dysfunction, cognitive decline and behavioral symptoms. Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and may be effective in alleviating and/or halting the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HD. Several pre-clinical studies have used stem cells in animal models of HD. Here, we performed a systematic review of preclinical studies to estimate the treatment efficacy of stem cells in animal models of HD. Based on our systematic review, treatment with stem cells significantly improves neurological and behavioral outcomes in animal models of HD. Although promising results were found, the design of animal studies, the types of transplanted cells and the route of administration are poorly standardized and this greatly complicates comparative analysis.",

Based on the knowledge of these immunomodulatory characteristics, fumaric acid esters have been shown to be effective or potentially effective in a multitude of dermatological as well as non-dermatological diseases. The range of new therapeutic targets reaches from multiple sclerosis to illnesses such as necrobiosis lipoidica, granuloma annulare and sarcoidosis. Experimental approaches offer promising, although preliminary, results on the treatment of cancer, malaria, chronic inflammatory lung diseases, and Huntington disease, to name but a few.

This may in part be due to the lack of suitable outcome measures. Therefore, we investigated the applicability of novel quantitative and objective assessments of motor dysfunction in the evaluation of physical therapy interventions aimed at improving gait and posture. METHODS: Twelve patients with Huntington disease received a predefined twice-weekly intervention focusing on posture and gait over 6 weeks. The GAITRite mat and a force plate were used for objective and quantitative assessments. The Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score, the timed Up &Go test, and the Berg Balance Scale were used as clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen in GAITRite measures after therapy. Improvements were also seen in the Up & Go test and Berg Balance Scale, whereas force plate measures and Total Motor Scores did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that physical therapy has a positive effect on gait in Huntington's disease. The study shows that objective and quantitative measures of gait and posture may serve as endpoints in trials assessing the efficacy of physical therapy. They should be explored further in larger trials applying a randomized controlled setting.",

                    "abstract": "Most human tissues do not regenerate spontaneously; this is why cell therapies and tissue engineering are promising alternatives. The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..). A large number of clinical areas stand as candidates for clinical applications: leukaemia and cancers, cardiac insufficiency and vascular diseases, cartilage and bone repair, ligaments and tendons, liver diseases, ophthalmology, diabetes, neurological diseases (Parkinson, Huntington disease, ..), .. Various aspects of this new regenerative therapeutic medicine are developed in this work.",

METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Deutetrabenazine is a novel molecule containing deuterium, which attenuates CYP2D6 metabolism and increases active metabolite half-lives and may therefore lead to stable systemic exposure while preserving key pharmacological activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine treatment to control chorea associated with Huntington disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest Huntington disease and a baseline total maximal chorea score of 8 or higher (range, 0-28; lower score indicates less chorea) were enrolled from August 2013 to August 2014 and randomized to receive deutetrabenazine (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45) in a double-blind fashion at 34 Huntington Study Group sites. INTERVENTIONS: Deutetrabenazine or placebo was titrated to optimal dose level over 8 weeks and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was the total maximal chorea score change from baseline (the average of values from the screening and day-0 visits) to maintenance therapy (the average of values from the week 9 and 12 visits) obtained by in-person visits. This study was designed to detect a 2.7-unit treatment difference in scores. The secondary end points, assessed hierarchically, were the proportion of patients who achieved treatment success on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the change in 36-Item Short Form- physical functioning subscale score (SF-36), and the change in the Berg Balance Test. RESULTS: Ninety patients with Huntington disease (mean age, 53.7 years; 40 women [44.4%]) were enrolled. In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean total maximal chorea scores improved from 12.1 (95% CI, 11.2-12.9) to 7.7 (95% CI, 6.5-8.9), whereas in the placebo group, scores improved from 13.2 (95% CI, 12.2-14.3) to 11.3 (95% CI, 10.0-12.5); the mean between-group difference was -2.5 units (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.3) (P < .001). Treatment success, as measured by the PGIC, occurred in 23 patients (51%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 9 (20%) in the placebo group (P = .002). As measured by the CGIC, treatment success occurred in 19 patients (42%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 6 (13%) in the placebo group (P = .002). In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean SF-36 physical functioning subscale scores decreased from 47.5 (95% CI, 44.3-50.8) to 47.4 (44.3-50.5), whereas in the placebo group, scores decreased from 43.2 (95% CI, 40.2-46.3) to 39.9 (95% CI, 36.2-43.6), for a treatment benefit of 4.3 (95% CI, 0.4 to 8.3) (P = .03). There was no difference between groups (mean difference of 1.0 unit; 95% CI, -0.3 to 2.3; P = .14), for improvement in the Berg Balance Test, which improved by 2.2 units (95% CI, 1.3-3.1) in the deutetrabenazine group and by 1.3 units (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) in the placebo group. Adverse event rates were similar for deutetrabenazine and placebo, including depression, anxiety, and akathisia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in improved motor signs at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of the effect size and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01795859.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate CAG repeat length (36-39) of the Huntingtin gene, HTT. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation 0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinician-rated measures of functioning are often used as primary endpoints in clinical trials and other behavioral research in Huntington disease. As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible, there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM: The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures, differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related assessments are not feasible.",

They also have the potential to accelerate drug discovery in 3 ways. The first involves the delineation of chemical components for efficient reprogramming of patient's blood cells or cells from biopsies, obviating the need for cellular delivery of reprogramming exogenous transgenes, thereby converting hope into reality for patients suffering from degenerative diseases. Patients worldwide stand to benefit from the clinical applicability of iPS cell-based cell replacement therapy for a number of degenerative diseases. The second is the potential for discovering novel drugs in a high throughput manner using patient-specific iPS cell-derived somatic cells possessing the etiology of the specific disease. The third is their suitability for toxicological testing of drugs and environmental factors. This review focuses on these potential applications of iPS cells with special emphasis on recent updates of iPS cell research contributing to the accelerated drug discovery.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For reasons of cost and ethical concerns, models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) are currently being developed in farm animals, as an alternative to non-human primates. Developing reliable methods of testing cognitive function is essential to determining the usefulness of such models. Nevertheless, cognitive testing of farm animal species presents a unique set of challenges. The primary aims of this study were to develop and validate a mobile operant system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing of sheep. NEW METHOD: We designed a semi-automated testing system with the capability of presenting stimuli (visual, auditory) and reward at six spatial locations. Fourteen normal sheep were used to validate the system using a two-choice visual discrimination task. Four stages of training devised to acclimatise animals to the system are also presented. RESULTS: All sheep progressed rapidly through the training stages, over eight sessions. All sheep learned the 2CVDT and performed at least one reversal stage. The mean number of trials the sheep took to reach criterion in the first acquisition learning was 13.9+-1.5 and for the reversal learning was 19.1+-1.8. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): This is the first mobile semi-automated operant system developed for testing cognitive function in sheep. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed and validated an automated operant behavioural testing system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing in sheep and other medium-sized quadrupeds, such as pigs and dogs. Sheep performance in the two-choice visual discrimination task was very similar to that reported for non-human primates and strongly supports the use of farm animals as pre-clinical models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.",

METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Although fetal neural transplantation has been tried in both preclinical and clinical investigations, the efficacy is not satisfactory. With the recent explosive progress of stem cell biology, application of stem cell-based therapy in HD is an exciting prospect. Three kinds of stem cells, embryonic stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells, have previously been utilized in cell therapy in animal models of neurological disorders. However, neural stem cells were preferably used by investigators in experimental HD studies, since they have a clear capacity to become neurons or glial cells after intracerebral or intravenous transplantation, and they induce functional recovery.

In addition, distinct populations of nominally glial progenitor cells, which also have the capacity to generate several cell types, are dispersed throughout the subcortical white matter and cortex. A number of approaches have evolved for using neural progenitor cells in cell therapy. Four strategies are especially attractive for clinical translation: first, transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells as a means of treating the disorders of myelin; second, transplantation of phenotypically restricted neuronal progenitor cells to treat diseases of discrete loss of a single neuronal phenotype, such as Parkinson disease; third, implantation of mixed progenitor pools to treat diseases characterized by the loss of several discrete phenotypes, such as spinal cord injury; and fourth, mobilization of endogenous neural progenitor cells to restore neurons lost as a result of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Huntington disease. Together, these may present the most compelling strategies and near-term disease targets for cell-based neurological therapy.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by an extended CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HD pathology involves a loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and progressive neurodegeneration affects the striatum and other brain regions. Because HTT is involved in multiple cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms of HD pathogenesis should be investigated on multiple levels. On the cellular level, in vitro stem cell models, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HD patients and HD embryonic stem cells (ESCs), have yielded progress. Approaches to differentiate functional MSNs from ESCs, iPSCs, and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) have been established, enabling MSN differentiation to be studied and disease phenotypes to be recapitulated. Isolation of target stem cells and precursor cells may also provide a resource for grafting. In animal models, transplantation of striatal precursors differentiated in vitro to the striatum has been reported to improve disease phenotype. Initial clinical trials examining intrastriatal transplantation of fetal neural tissue suggest a more favorable clinical course in a subset of HD patients, though shortcomings persist. Here, we review recent advances in the development of cellular HD models and approaches aimed at cell regeneration with human stem cells. We also describe how genome editing tools could be used to correct the HTT mutation in patient-specific stem cells. Finally, we discuss the potential and the remaining challenges of stem cell-based approaches in HD research and therapy development. ",

There is currently no treatment that can prevent the striatal neuropathology. Transglutaminase (TG) activity is increased in HD patients, is associated with cell death, and has been suggested to contribute to striatal neuronal loss in HD. This work assesses the therapeutic potential of cystamine, an inhibitor of TG activity with additional potentially beneficial effects. Specifically, we examine the effect of cystamine on striatal neuronal loss in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. We demonstrate here for the first time that YAC128 mice show a forebrain-specific increase in TG activity compared with wild-type (WT) littermates which is decreased by oral delivery of cystamine. Treatment of symptomatic YAC128 mice with cystamine starting at 7 months prevented striatal neuronal loss. Cystamine treatment also ameliorated the striatal volume loss and striatal neuronal atrophy observed in these animals, but was unable to prevent motor dysfunction or the down-regulation of dopamine and cyclic adenosine monophsophate-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) expression in the striatum. While the exact mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of cystamine in YAC128 mice is uncertain, our findings suggest that cystamine is neuroprotective and may be beneficial in the treatment of HD.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Huntington disease (HD) mutation increases gain-of-toxic functions contributing to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Riluzole interferes with glutamatergic neurotransmission, thereby reducing excitotoxicity, enhancing neurite formation in damaged motoneurons and increasing serum concentrations of BDNF, a brain cortex neurotrophin protecting striatal neurons from degeneration. METHODS: We investigated metabolic and volumetric differences in distinct brain areas between 11 riluzole-treated and 12 placebo-treated patients by MRI and (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET scanning, according to fully automated protocols. We also investigated the influence of riluzole on peripheral growth factor blood levels. RESULTS: Placebo-treated patients showed significantly greater proportional volume loss of grey matter and decrease in metabolic FDG uptake than patients treated with riluzole in all cortical areas (p<0.05). The decreased rate of metabolic FDG uptake correlated with worsening clinical scores in placebo-treated patients, compared to those who were treated with riluzole. The progressive decrease in metabolic FDG uptake observed in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex correlated linearly with the severity of motor scores calculated by Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-I) in placebo-treated patients. Similarly, the rate of metabolic changes in the frontal and temporal areas of the brain cortex correlated linearly with worsening behavioural scores calculated by UHDRS-III in the placebo-treated patients. Finally, BDNF and transforming growth factor beta-1 serum levels were significantly higher in patients treated with riluzole. CONCLUSION: The linear correlation between decreased metabolic FDG uptake and worsening clinical scores in the placebo-treated patients suggests that FDG-PET may be a valuable procedure to assess brain markers of HD.",

The thoroughly investigated causes include oxidative stress, inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular neuronal protein aggregation. Withania somnifera has been used for more than 2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha, neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The current review substantially deciphered the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders. However, future studies are further required better to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their neuroprotective nature.",

There is currently no treatment that can prevent the striatal neuropathology. Transglutaminase (TG) activity is increased in HD patients, is associated with cell death, and has been suggested to contribute to striatal neuronal loss in HD. This work assesses the therapeutic potential of cystamine, an inhibitor of TG activity with additional potentially beneficial effects. Specifically, we examine the effect of cystamine on striatal neuronal loss in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. We demonstrate here for the first time that YAC128 mice show a forebrain-specific increase in TG activity compared with wild-type (WT) littermates which is decreased by oral delivery of cystamine. Treatment of symptomatic YAC128 mice with cystamine starting at 7 months prevented striatal neuronal loss. Cystamine treatment also ameliorated the striatal volume loss and striatal neuronal atrophy observed in these animals, but was unable to prevent motor dysfunction or the down-regulation of dopamine and cyclic adenosine monophsophate-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) expression in the striatum. While the exact mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of cystamine in YAC128 mice is uncertain, our findings suggest that cystamine is neuroprotective and may be beneficial in the treatment of HD.",

                    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Deutetrabenazine is a novel molecule containing deuterium, which attenuates CYP2D6 metabolism and increases active metabolite half-lives and may therefore lead to stable systemic exposure while preserving key pharmacological activity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of deutetrabenazine treatment to control chorea associated with Huntington disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety ambulatory adults diagnosed with manifest Huntington disease and a baseline total maximal chorea score of 8 or higher (range, 0-28; lower score indicates less chorea) were enrolled from August 2013 to August 2014 and randomized to receive deutetrabenazine (n = 45) or placebo (n = 45) in a double-blind fashion at 34 Huntington Study Group sites. INTERVENTIONS: Deutetrabenazine or placebo was titrated to optimal dose level over 8 weeks and maintained for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was the total maximal chorea score change from baseline (the average of values from the screening and day-0 visits) to maintenance therapy (the average of values from the week 9 and 12 visits) obtained by in-person visits. This study was designed to detect a 2.7-unit treatment difference in scores. The secondary end points, assessed hierarchically, were the proportion of patients who achieved treatment success on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), the change in 36-Item Short Form- physical functioning subscale score (SF-36), and the change in the Berg Balance Test. RESULTS: Ninety patients with Huntington disease (mean age, 53.7 years; 40 women [44.4%]) were enrolled. In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean total maximal chorea scores improved from 12.1 (95% CI, 11.2-12.9) to 7.7 (95% CI, 6.5-8.9), whereas in the placebo group, scores improved from 13.2 (95% CI, 12.2-14.3) to 11.3 (95% CI, 10.0-12.5); the mean between-group difference was -2.5 units (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.3) (P < .001). Treatment success, as measured by the PGIC, occurred in 23 patients (51%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 9 (20%) in the placebo group (P = .002). As measured by the CGIC, treatment success occurred in 19 patients (42%) in the deutetrabenazine group vs 6 (13%) in the placebo group (P = .002). In the deutetrabenazine group, the mean SF-36 physical functioning subscale scores decreased from 47.5 (95% CI, 44.3-50.8) to 47.4 (44.3-50.5), whereas in the placebo group, scores decreased from 43.2 (95% CI, 40.2-46.3) to 39.9 (95% CI, 36.2-43.6), for a treatment benefit of 4.3 (95% CI, 0.4 to 8.3) (P = .03). There was no difference between groups (mean difference of 1.0 unit; 95% CI, -0.3 to 2.3; P = .14), for improvement in the Berg Balance Test, which improved by 2.2 units (95% CI, 1.3-3.1) in the deutetrabenazine group and by 1.3 units (95% CI, 0.4-2.2) in the placebo group. Adverse event rates were similar for deutetrabenazine and placebo, including depression, anxiety, and akathisia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with chorea associated with Huntington disease, the use of deutetrabenazine compared with placebo resulted in improved motor signs at 12 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of the effect size and to determine longer-term efficacy and safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01795859.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

In addition, a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, along with cognitive decline, contribute significantly to the patient's disability. Because there are no effective neuroprotective therapies that delay the progression of the disease, symptomatic treatment remains the cornerstone of medical management. Several classes of medications have been used to ameliorate the various symptoms of HD, including typical and atypical neuroleptics, dopamine depleters, antidepressants, antiglutamatergic drugs, GABA agonists, antiepileptic medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and botulinum toxin. Recently, surgical approaches including pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation, and fetal cell transplants have been used for the symptomatic treatment of HD. The selected therapy must be customized to the needs of each patient, minimizing the potential adverse effects. The primary aim of this article is to review the role of the different therapies, both available and investigational, for the treatment of the motor, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of HD, and to examine their impact on the patient's functionality and quality of life.",

Here we investigated the viability of fresh and frozen sperm from rhesus macaques on the basis of motility, membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity. Sperm motility was determined by visual evaluation; membrane and acrosome integrity were assessed simultaneously through triple staining with Hoechst 33342, propidium iodide, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-peanut agglutinin. We compared thawed semen that had been cryopreserved by using 2 different media with fresh semen from wildtype (WT) macaques; fresh semen from a model of Huntington disease (HD) with fresh WT semen; and fresh HD with cryopreserved-thawed HD semen. Our new freezing media (TEST EQ) preserved the acrosome better, with less net damage, than did traditional TEST (egg yolk extender containing TES and Tris) media. In addition, the percentage of membrane-damaged cells was similar in fresh HD semen (38.6%+-2.9%) and WT semen (35.5%+-1.9%). Membrane and acrosomal damage were not different between HD and WT sperm after cryopreservation and subsequent thawing. Furthermore, cryopreservation had similar negative effects on the motility of HD and WT sperm. These data illustrate that semen from a rhesus macaque model of HD is similarly cryotoleratant to that from WT animals.",

Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluate the extent to which environmental enrichment can modify synaptic plasticity in the host-graft neuronal circuitry to try to find a physiological substrate for the observed improvements. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice, housed in enriched or standard environments, received unilateral quinolinic acid lesions of the striatum, followed by embryonic striatal grafts. Then, 3 months posttransplantation, synaptic physiology and plasticity were evaluated by extracellular recording from in vitro striatal slices. RESULTS: Environmental enrichment had no effect on the chance of long-term depression (LTD) induction or expression of LTD from either normal or grafted striatum. In contrast, enrichment increased the chance of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and level of expression associated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor within both the intact and grafted striatum compared with levels in the striatum of animals housed in standard environments. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental enrichment induces changes in host-graft corticostriatal LTP, thus providing a potential physiological substrate for the enrichment-induced improvement in motor and cognitive performance. The effect may be mediated by modulation of the trophic environment in which the grafted cells develop and integrate.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the neurological manifestations of patients with an indeterminate CAG repeat length (36-39) of the Huntingtin gene, HTT. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of 10 patients was performed. Duration of follow-up was mean=4.23 years (standard deviation 1.068; 95% CI 3.466-4.994; range 3-6.4 years). Three patients had a CAG repeat length of 37, three 38 and four 39. Mean CAG repeat length=38 (standard deviation 0.88; 95% CI 37.47-38.73; range 37-39). Data from clinical histories, neurological examinations, the United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and MRI imaging were collected. RESULTS: Four patients developed facial chorea, ataxia, impaired tongue protrusion, abnormal saccades and intermittent eye pursuits, dysarthria and impaired Luria 3 hand test. Early in its natural history the neurological syndrome is dominated by perioral chorea, subtle cognitive deficits and mild ataxia. Three patients developed a formal diagnosis of HD within 5 years. The illness progression was variable and associated with different co-morbidities. MRI scans showed ventricular dilatation as a common finding. Scores from UHDRS, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) suggested significant behavioural and functional impairment with compromised cognitive abilities. Two patients had subtle manifestations and four remained asymptomatic (3 patients CAG=37; 1 patient CAG=39). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the disease manifestations and natural history of people with CAG repeat lengths within the indeterminate range. The findings reveal heterogeneity in disease progression and have implications on the advice that should be given to patients and families on risk assessment and prognosis. Long-term follow up of such patients is essential as the neurological presentation of indeterminate CAG repeat length mutation might be accelerated by associated medical disorders and treatments, environmental and modifying genetic factors.",

In addition, a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, along with cognitive decline, contribute significantly to the patient's disability. Because there are no effective neuroprotective therapies that delay the progression of the disease, symptomatic treatment remains the cornerstone of medical management. Several classes of medications have been used to ameliorate the various symptoms of HD, including typical and atypical neuroleptics, dopamine depleters, antidepressants, antiglutamatergic drugs, GABA agonists, antiepileptic medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and botulinum toxin. Recently, surgical approaches including pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation, and fetal cell transplants have been used for the symptomatic treatment of HD. The selected therapy must be customized to the needs of each patient, minimizing the potential adverse effects. The primary aim of this article is to review the role of the different therapies, both available and investigational, for the treatment of the motor, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of HD, and to examine their impact on the patient's functionality and quality of life.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individualized exercise instruction on a regular basis may be desirable for people with Huntington disease (HD). Sustained interventions, however, may not be the most feasible for lifelong disease management. It is critical, therefore, for physical therapists to find ways to facilitate engagement in independent exercise programs. The capabilities of DVD technology can make the DVD a useful format to facilitate engagement for people with HD who have motivational and cognitive problems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore how people with HD used a home-based exercise DVD and how it was perceived by the participants and their caregivers. DESIGN: An exploratory, mixed-method design was used in this study. METHODS: Fifteen participants with HD were provided with an exercise DVD, developed by the authors, to support their engagement in a home-based exercise program. Exercise diaries were used to record adherence rates. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore what factors affected the usability of the DVD. Conversations were audio recorded and fully transcribed. Content analysis approach was used to analyze the interviews. RESULTS: Most of the participants (11/15, 73.3%) adhered well to the use of the DVD. Participants felt that the exercises were suitable. Commitment of the caregiver as a key to the success of the program was the main theme that emerged from the data. Participants identified barriers and facilitators that affected adherence to using the exercise DVD and described management strategies that helped promote adherence to the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: The DVD was perceived to be suitable and supportive. The DVD could be appropriate for use in supporting people with HD to engage in exercise at home, either outside of therapy sessions or upon completion of a therapy program.",

We have taken related literature of making this review article from ScienceDirect, springer, Research gate, PubMed, Sci-finder, etc. The current approaches for treating neurological conditions such as glioblastoma includes chemotherapy or combination anti-retro viral therapy for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or use of anti-Alzheimer drugs during cognitive impairment. These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization, multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted drug delivery with minimal side effects.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT). Other clinical trials for disease-modification in HD have generated negative results or are ongoing. Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies. Novel symptomatic treatment indications explored in clinical trials include motor disability, irritability and apathy. CONCLUSIONS: The years ahead are promising for novel and revolutionary therapies aimed at core disease mechanisms in HD. Clinical research platforms such as Enroll-HD are expected to potentiate the conduction of clinical trials in HD.",

Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis with the mutation allow for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT transcript as a therapeutic strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise heterozygosity estimates are needed across diverse HD patient populations. Here we present the first comprehensive investigation of all common target alleles across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives in Canada, Sweden, France, and Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and A3a) define mutually exclusive sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy in the greatest number of patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80% are treatable using these three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion found exclusively on the A1 haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of mutant HTT in approximately 40% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the deletion reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78% in patient cells while sparing wild-type HTT expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG occurs, we demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific therapy for a monogenic disorder. ",

The results from this Ionis trial have gained much attention from the patient community and the oligonucleotide therapeutics field, since it is the first trial targeting the cause of HD, namely the mutant huntingtin protein, using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The press release also states that the primary endpoints of the study (safety and tolerability) were met, but does not contain data. This news follows the approval of another therapeutic ASO nusinersen (trade name Spinraza) for a neurological disease, spinal muscular atrophy, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

                    "abstract": "Most human tissues do not regenerate spontaneously; this is why cell therapies and tissue engineering are promising alternatives. The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..). A large number of clinical areas stand as candidates for clinical applications: leukaemia and cancers, cardiac insufficiency and vascular diseases, cartilage and bone repair, ligaments and tendons, liver diseases, ophthalmology, diabetes, neurological diseases (Parkinson, Huntington disease, ..), .. Various aspects of this new regenerative therapeutic medicine are developed in this work.",

Neuronal dysfunction and degeneration contribute to progressive physiological, motor, cognitive, and emotional disturbances characteristic of HD. A major impetus for research into the treatment of HD has centered on cell therapy strategies to protect vulnerable neuronal cell populations or to replace dysfunctional or dying cells. The work underlying 3 approaches to HD cell therapy includes the potential for self-repair through the manipulation of endogenous stem cells and/or neurogenesis, the use of fetal or stem cell transplantation as a cell replacement strategy, and the administration of neurotrophic factors to protect susceptible neuronal populations. These approaches have shown some promising results in animal models of HD. Although striatal transplantation of fetal-derived cells has undergone clinical assessment since the 1990s, many cell therapy strategies have yet to be applied in the clinic environment. A more thorough understanding of the pathophysiologies underlying HD as well as the response of both endogenous and exogenous cells to the degenerating brain will inform their merit as potential therapeutic agents and enhance the framework by which the success of such strategies are determined.",

                    "abstract": "Most human tissues do not regenerate spontaneously; this is why cell therapies and tissue engineering are promising alternatives. The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..). Finally, gene therapy, has been nourishing high hopes but few clinical applications can be envisaged in the short term, although potential applications are multiple (haemophilia, myopathies, ..). A large number of clinical areas stand as candidates for clinical applications: leukaemia and cancers, cardiac insufficiency and vascular diseases, cartilage and bone repair, ligaments and tendons, liver diseases, ophthalmology, diabetes, neurological diseases (Parkinson, Huntington disease, ..), .. Various aspects of this new regenerative therapeutic medicine are developed in this work.",

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha mediates a broad, evolutionarily conserved, endogenous adaptive program to hypoxia, and manipulation of components of the HIF pathway is neuroprotective in a number of human neurological diseases and experimental models. In this review, we discuss molecular components of one aspect of hypoxic adaptation in detail and provide perspective on which targets within this pathway seem to be ripest for preventing and repairing neurodegeneration. Further, we highlight the role of HIF prolyl hydroxylases as emerging targets for the salutary effects of metal chelators on ferroptosis in vitro as well in animal models of neurological diseases. ",

On admission to the nursing home, the \"average\" HD patient was of either sex, 45 years old, previously employed, a high school graduate, and not married. One third had severe behavior problems. Half gained and half lost weight; weight loss was not a predictor of death. Almost all used central nervous system-active drugs, most commonly neuroleptics. Eighty-four percent were ambulatory on admission, but 88% of those who died were nonambulatory at the time of death. We concluded that (a) HD patients are demographically different from other residents of long-term care facilities, (b) weight gain can occur in some late-stage patients, (c) negative behavior is a significant problem but is restricted to a subset of patients, and (d) adapting creatively to increasing multifaceted disability is the greatest challenge to the staff in facilities caring for HD patients.",

                    "abstract": "This is a retrospective review of 97 Huntington disease (HD) patients living in long-term care facilities in the Twin Cities. The purpose of the study was to describe the demographic features, patterns of behavior, weight change, nursing issues, medication use, and hospitalization in this population. On admission to the nursing home, the \"average\" HD patient was of either sex, 45 years old, previously employed, a high school graduate, and not married. One third had severe behavior problems. Half gained and half lost weight; weight loss was not a predictor of death. Almost all used central nervous system-active drugs, most commonly neuroleptics. Eighty-four percent were ambulatory on admission, but 88% of those who died were nonambulatory at the time of death. We concluded that (a) HD patients are demographically different from other residents of long-term care facilities, (b) weight gain can occur in some late-stage patients, (c) negative behavior is a significant problem but is restricted to a subset of patients, and (d) adapting creatively to increasing multifaceted disability is the greatest challenge to the staff in facilities caring for HD patients.",

In experiment 1, plasmids expressing Hemaglutinin-tagged polypeptides with 20 glutamine repeats (Q20) or with extended 127-glutamine repeats (Q127) were complexed with ORMOSIL nanoparticles and injected twice (2 weeks apart) into the lateral ventricle of the mouse brain.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length immunoglobulins and offer important advantages compared with conventional monoclonal antibodies: extreme specificity, higher affinity, superior stability and solubility, reduced immunogenicity as well as easy and inexpensive large-scale production. OBJECTIVE: In this article we will review and discuss recombinant antibodies that are being evaluated for neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical models and in clinical studies and will summarize new strategies that are being developed to optimize their stability, specificity and potency for advancing their use. METHODS: Articles describing recombinant antibody fragments used for neurological diseases were selected (PubMed) and evaluated for their significance. RESULTS: Different antibody formats such as single-chain fragment variable (scFv), single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs or sdAbs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), intrabodies and nanobodies, are currently being studied in pre-clinical models of cancer as well as infectious and autoimmune diseases and many of them are being tested as therapeutics in clinical trials. Immunotherapy approaches have shown therapeutic efficacy in several animal models of Alzheimer s disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington disease (HD), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that recombinant antibody fragments may neutralize toxic extra- and intracellular misfolded proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, DLB, FTD, HD or TSEs and may target toxic immune cells participating in the pathogenesis of MS. CONCLUSION: Recombinant antibody fragments represent a promising tool for the development of antibody-based immunotherapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.",

To date, very few quantitative or qualitative studies have been conducted to guide physical therapists working with people with HD. The objective of this study was to characterize current physical therapist practice for people with HD, thus informing the development of standardized clinical care and future research studies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consultation with physical therapists working with people with HD was undertaken in the form of mailed questionnaires (n=49) and semistructured interviews (n=8). The development of the interview schedule was aided by consideration of the data obtained from the questionnaires. Themes identified from the interviews were considered in light of published literature and questionnaire responses. RESULTS: The main issues that emerged from the interviews were classified into 3 subthemes: (1) there is insufficient use of routine physical therapy-related outcome measures at different stages of HD, (2) there is underutilization of physical therapy services in managing HD (particularly in the early stages), and (3) the management of falls and mobility deficit progression is a key treatment aim for people with HD. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A conceptual framework for physical therapy intervention in HD was developed on the basis of the themes that emerged from the data in this study. Such a framework has utility for complex, progressive conditions such as HD and may facilitate clinical decision making and standardization of practice and affect the development of future physical therapy trials.",

METHOD: Participants (747 pr-HD: 188 NC) listened to tones presented at 550-ms intervals, matched that pace by tapping response keys and continued the rhythm (self-paced) after the tone had stopped. Standardized cross-sectional and longitudinal linear models examined the relationships between self-paced timing precision and estimated proximity to diagnosis, and other demographic factors. RESULTS: Pr-HD participants showed significantly less timing precision than NC. Comparison of pr-HD and NC participants showed a significant performance difference on two task administration conditions (dominant hand: p < .0001; alternating thumbs: p < .0001). Additionally, estimated proximity to diagnosis was related to timing precision in both conditions, (dominant hand: t = -11.14, df = 920, p < .0001; alternating thumbs: t = -11.32, df = 918, p < .0001). Longitudinal modeling showed that pr-HD participants worsen more quickly at the task than the NC group, and rate of decline increases with estimated proximity to diagnosis in both conditions (dominant hand: t = -2.85, df = 417, p = .0045; alternating thumbs: t = -3.56, df = 445, p = .0004). Effect sizes based on adjusted mean annual change ranged from -0.34 to 0.25 in the longitudinal model.

As HD advances, patients are frequently placed in institutional care settings, including nursing homes and hospices where family, nursing staff, and interdisciplinary team members are challenged to help patients live to their highest potential and die with dignity. Edgemoor, a distinct part of the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital, is a regional referral facility for patients with HD. Over the past 8 years, we have cared for 53 patients with advanced HD and describe our experiences by presenting their demographic characteristics and the lessons we have learned in caring for them. Ultimately, we found that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care Initiative provided a meaningful framework for setting clinical priorities. This framework is used to summarize the clinical lessons that nursing staff and interdisciplinary team members learned about caring well for institutionalized individuals with advanced HD.",

In addition, a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, along with cognitive decline, contribute significantly to the patient's disability. Because there are no effective neuroprotective therapies that delay the progression of the disease, symptomatic treatment remains the cornerstone of medical management. Several classes of medications have been used to ameliorate the various symptoms of HD, including typical and atypical neuroleptics, dopamine depleters, antidepressants, antiglutamatergic drugs, GABA agonists, antiepileptic medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and botulinum toxin. Recently, surgical approaches including pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation, and fetal cell transplants have been used for the symptomatic treatment of HD. The selected therapy must be customized to the needs of each patient, minimizing the potential adverse effects. The primary aim of this article is to review the role of the different therapies, both available and investigational, for the treatment of the motor, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms of HD, and to examine their impact on the patient's functionality and quality of life.",

Although the precise role of mhtt aggregates in the pathogenesis is unclear, attempts to reduce accumulated mhtt protein have ameliorated the phenotype in multiple cellular and in vivo HD models. Here, we provide critical results on intracranial delivery of a single-chain Fv intrabody, C4, which targets the first 17 amino acids of the htt protein, a region of httExon1 that is increasingly being recognized as pivotal. To assess long-term efficacy and safety issues, we used adenoassociated viral vectors (AAV2/1) to deliver intrabody genes to the striatum of inbred B6.HDR6/1 mice. Treatment initiation at various stages of the disease showed that early treatment preserved the largest number of cells without nuclear aggregates and that the accumulation of aggregated material could be delayed by several months. Even when intrabody treatment was not initiated until the clinical disease stage, significant, albeit smaller, effects were seen. These data indicate that neuronal intrabodies against critical N-terminal epitopes can be safely and effectively delivered using AAV2/1 to delay the aggregation phenotype during a sustained period in this HD model, even when delivery is initiated after disease onset.",

Although the interplay between perturbed BBB homeostasis and the pathogenesis of brain disorders needs further investigation, the development and validation of a reliable procedure to accurately detect BBB alterations may be crucial and represent a useful tool for potentially predicting disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we present an easy and efficient procedure for evaluating BBB leakage in a neurodegenerative condition like that occurring in a preclinical mouse model of Huntington disease, in which defects in the permeability of BBB are clearly detectable precociously in the disease. Specifically, the high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled (FITC)-albumin, which is able to cross the BBB only when the latter is impaired, is acutely infused into a mouse jugular vein and its distribution in the vascular or parenchymal districts is then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of green fluorescent-albumin in the brain parenchyma functions as an index of aberrant BBB permeability and, when quantitated by using Image J processing software, is reported as Green Fluorescence Intensity.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to examine the emotional experience of caregiving by family carers of people with Huntington disease and to describe strategies they used to deal with that experience. BACKGROUND: Huntington disease, commonly diagnosed in young to middle adulthood, is an inherited single gene disorder involving loss of cognitive, motor and neuropsychiatric function. Many family members become caregivers as well as continuing as parents and wage earners. The emotional aspects of caregiving contribute to mental health risks for family members. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with 42 adult carers of people with Huntington disease in four United States and two Canadian Huntington disease centers between 2001 and 2005. Data were analyzed through descriptive coding and thematic analysis. FINDINGS: All participants reported multiple aspects of emotional distress. Being a carer was described as experiencing disintegration of one's life. Carers attempted to cope by seeking comfort from selected family members, anticipating the time when the care recipient had died and/or using prescription medications. Spousal carers were distressed by the loss of their relationship with their spouse and dealt with this by no longer regarding the person as an intimate partner. Carers were concerned about the disease risk for children in their families and hoped for a cure. CONCLUSION: Emotional distress can compromise the well-being of family carers, who attempt to maintain multiple roles. Nurses should monitor carer mental health, identify sources of emotional distress and support effective strategies used by carers to mediate distress.",

The progressive nature of these diseases poses unique challenges for therapists aiming to effectively maximize physical functioning and minimize participation restrictions in these patient groups. Research is underway in both diseases to develop effective disease-modifying agents and pharmacological interventions, as well as mobility-focused rehabilitation protocols. Rehabilitation, and in particular task-specific interventions, has the potential to influence the upper extremity functional abilities of patients with these degenerative conditions. However to date, investigations of interventions specifically addressing upper extremity function have been limited in both PD, and in particular HD. In this paper, we provide an update of the known pathological features of PD and HD as they relate to upper extremity function. We further review the available literature on the use of outcome measures, and the clinical management of upper extremity function in both conditions. Due to the currently limited evidence base in both diseases, we recommend utilization of a clinical management framework specific for degenerative conditions that can serve as a guideline for disease management.",

Research is underway in both diseases to develop effective disease-modifying agents and pharmacological interventions, as well as mobility-focused rehabilitation protocols. Rehabilitation, and in particular task-specific interventions, has the potential to influence the upper extremity functional abilities of patients with these degenerative conditions. However to date, investigations of interventions specifically addressing upper extremity function have been limited in both PD, and in particular HD. In this paper, we provide an update of the known pathological features of PD and HD as they relate to upper extremity function. We further review the available literature on the use of outcome measures, and the clinical management of upper extremity function in both conditions. Due to the currently limited evidence base in both diseases, we recommend utilization of a clinical management framework specific for degenerative conditions that can serve as a guideline for disease management.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For reasons of cost and ethical concerns, models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease (HD) are currently being developed in farm animals, as an alternative to non-human primates. Developing reliable methods of testing cognitive function is essential to determining the usefulness of such models. Nevertheless, cognitive testing of farm animal species presents a unique set of challenges. The primary aims of this study were to develop and validate a mobile operant system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing of sheep. NEW METHOD: We designed a semi-automated testing system with the capability of presenting stimuli (visual, auditory) and reward at six spatial locations. Fourteen normal sheep were used to validate the system using a two-choice visual discrimination task. Four stages of training devised to acclimatise animals to the system are also presented. RESULTS: All sheep progressed rapidly through the training stages, over eight sessions. All sheep learned the 2CVDT and performed at least one reversal stage. The mean number of trials the sheep took to reach criterion in the first acquisition learning was 13.9+-1.5 and for the reversal learning was 19.1+-1.8. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): This is the first mobile semi-automated operant system developed for testing cognitive function in sheep. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed and validated an automated operant behavioural testing system suitable for high throughput cognitive testing in sheep and other medium-sized quadrupeds, such as pigs and dogs. Sheep performance in the two-choice visual discrimination task was very similar to that reported for non-human primates and strongly supports the use of farm animals as pre-clinical models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.",

METHODS: We examined factor structure (confirmatory factor analysis), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), floor and ceiling effects, convergent validity (Pearson correlations), and known-groups validity (multivariate analysis). RESULTS: Results of a confirmatory factor analysis replicated the six-factor latent model that reflects the six separate scales within the WHODAS 2.0 (understanding and communicating; getting around; self-care; getting along with others; life activities; participation). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.94, suggesting good internal consistency reliability. The WHODAS demonstrated a ceiling effect for 19.5 % of participants; there were no floor effects. There was evidence for convergent validity; the WHODAS demonstrated moderate significant correlations with other general measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL; i.e., RAND-12, EQ5D). Multivariate analyses indicated that late-stage HD participants indicated poorer HRQOL than both early-stage HD and prodromal HD participants for all HRQOL measures. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide support for both the reliability and validity of the WHODAS 2.0 in individuals with HD.",

A prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial of memantine is underway. One would not expect the treatment modalities that form the bases of nonpharmaceutical, traditional medical systems to be used to lower IOP. Glaucoma was unknown when these medicinal treatments were developed over the centuries. Their primary use is in improving the cardiovascular and immune systems and in what is now called neuro-protection. Rather than single compounds that target a specific receptor and have demarcated side effects in other systems, plant products are a blend of many compounds and, according to those most versed in them, they achieve a balanced therapy, helping in specific symptomatic complexes while reducing side effects through ameliorating effects in other areas. It is not insignificant that, now that the rain forests are rapidly dwindling, together with their inhabitants and the knowledge of medicinal plants (especially in South America), the pharmaceutical companies are spending large amounts of money in a sudden, almost frantic attempt to gather the knowledge about rainforest plants before all has been completely lost. Proof of effects clinically in a chronic disease such as glaucoma remains largely lacking, and controlled trials are unlikely to be initiated, except perhaps through the National Institutes of Health, because these compounds have been in the public domain for many years. Perhaps those as yet unknown or un-recorded are patentable and perhaps these include drugs known only to small surviving communities of hunter-gatherers, which explains the pharmaceutical interest in these areas. When more accurate and rapid means of assessment of progression of glaucomatous damage than perimetry and optic nerve head photography are eventually developed and trials can be reduced in time, number of subjects, or even the use of nonhuman subjects for the bulk of studies, studies could be done for verification of effect of various compounds and also comparative studies. At the present time, GBE is the best documented of all the complementary medicinal agents and seems to have the greatest potential value. Ginkgo biloba extract has numerous properties that theoretically should be beneficial in treating non-IOP-dependent mechanisms in glaucoma. Its multi-ple beneficial actions, including increased ocular blood flow, antioxidant activity, platelet activating factor inhibitory activity, nitric oxide inhibition, and neuroprotective activity, combine to suggest that GBE could prove to be of major therapeutic value in the treatment of glaucoma.",

Here we investigated the viability of fresh and frozen sperm from rhesus macaques on the basis of motility, membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity. Sperm motility was determined by visual evaluation; membrane and acrosome integrity were assessed simultaneously through triple staining with Hoechst 33342, propidium iodide, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-peanut agglutinin. We compared thawed semen that had been cryopreserved by using 2 different media with fresh semen from wildtype (WT) macaques; fresh semen from a model of Huntington disease (HD) with fresh WT semen; and fresh HD with cryopreserved-thawed HD semen. Our new freezing media (TEST EQ) preserved the acrosome better, with less net damage, than did traditional TEST (egg yolk extender containing TES and Tris) media. In addition, the percentage of membrane-damaged cells was similar in fresh HD semen (38.6%+-2.9%) and WT semen (35.5%+-1.9%). Membrane and acrosomal damage were not different between HD and WT sperm after cryopreservation and subsequent thawing. Furthermore, cryopreservation had similar negative effects on the motility of HD and WT sperm. These data illustrate that semen from a rhesus macaque model of HD is similarly cryotoleratant to that from WT animals.",

These data are part of a survey of 682 geneticists in 19 nations. Of 490 U.S. geneticists asked to participate, 295 (60%) returned anonymous detailed questionnaires. There was strong (greater than 75%) consensus that preserving the mother's confidentiality overrides disclosure of true paternity; that conflicting test results, new/controversial interpretations of results, and ambiguous/artifactual results should be disclosed; that artificial insemination by donor, adoption, taking chances, contraception, sterilization, and in-vitro fertilization with a donor egg should be presented as reproductive options to carriers of disorders not diagnosable prenatally; that prenatal diagnosis should be performed for patients who refuse abortion and for maternal anxiety in the absence of medical indications; that screening in the workplace should be voluntary. There was no consensus about disclosure of a diagnosis of Huntington disease or hemophilia A to relatives at risk, against the patient's wishes, or about disclosure of parental translocations. Geneticists in the U.S. differed from 18 other nations in presenting surrogate motherhood as an option (67%); willingness to perform prenatal diagnosis for sex selection or refer (62%); and disclosure of XY genotype in a female (62%). Men were more likely than women to say that they would give directive counseling.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To delineate the progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: A survey of individuals with symptomatic HD completed by a first-degree relative. SETTING: The National Huntington Disease Research Roster for Patients and Families, Indianapolis, Ind. PARTICIPANTS: The survey included 1238 individuals with a minimum of a 6-year history of symptomatic HD. MEASURES: Participating families completed a series of surveys, including the Affected Individual Questionnaire, which consists of 19 physical, emotional, and cognitive signs commonly thought to occur during disease progression. The respondent indicates if each of the symptoms occurred and, if so, at what time during the course of the disease: (1) within 1 year, (2) within 2 to 5 years, (3) within 6 to 10 years, (4) after more than 10 years, (5) has not occurred, or (6) \"don't know.\" RESULTS: The symptoms are categorized into 6 onset periods. Involuntary movements are grouped alone as the earliest reported symptom. The second group is composed entirely of mental and emotional symptoms, including sadness, depression, and difficult to get along with. The third group includes clumsiness, sexual problems, lack of motivation, and suspiciousness/paranoia. As the disease progresses, a variety of motor, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive symptoms are experienced, including unsteadiness, trouble holding onto things, trouble walking, changes in sleeping patterns, delusions and hallucinations, intellectual decline, and memory loss. With the approach of late-stage HD, affected individuals begin to experience speech difficulty and weight loss. In the late stage, patients lose bowel and bladder control. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the symptoms of HD are fairly well characterized, their progression, especially in the early and middle stages, remains uncertain. Clarification of the disease progression is vital to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HD and to the evaluation of therapeutic agents that are designed to slow the progression of disease. The results of this study assist in clarifying HD progression from early involuntary movements and emotional changes to more overt motor symptoms and difficulty with activities of daily living.",

Therefore, it's necessary to search for effective biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance. METHODS: In this study, we conducted time-series gene expression profiles analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients with different post-transplant days through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Associations between gene co-expression modules and days post-transplant were determined through spearman rank correlation analysis. Potential kidney transplant rejection-related modules were subjected to gene functional enrichment analysis through clusterProfiler and protein-protein interaction analysis via STRING database. RESULTS: A total of 11 gene co-expression modules were identified, and the pink module which was mainly involved in \"energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds\" and \"Huntington disease\" showed significant correlation with the phenotypic trait \"days post-transplant\". CYC1, SDHA, UQCRC1, UQCRQ, and SDHB in the pink module exhibited high scores in the protein-protein interaction network analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We reported several potential genes may be associated with the kidney transplant rejection, which should provide novel biomarkers for kidney transplant surveillance.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that mHtt is capable of spreading within cerebral tissue by examining genetically unrelated fetal neural allografts within the brains of patients with advancing HD. METHODS: The presence of mHtt aggregates within the grafted tissue was confirmed using 3 different types of microscopy (bright-field, fluorescence, and electron), 2 additional techniques consisting of Western immunoblotting and infrared spectroscopy, and 4 distinct antibodies targeting different epitopes of mHtt aggregates. RESULTS: We describe the presence of mHtt aggregates within intracerebral allografts of striatal tissue in 3 HD patients who received their transplants approximately 1 decade earlier and then died secondary to the progression of their disease. The mHtt(+) aggregates were observed in the extracellular matrix of the transplanted tissue, whereas in the host brain they were seen in neurons, neuropil, extracellular matrix, and blood vessels. INTERPRETATION: This is the first demonstration of the presence of mHtt in genetically normal and unrelated allografted neural tissue transplanted into the brain of affected HD patients. These observations raise questions on protein spread in monogenic neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system characterized by the formation of mutant protein oligomers/aggregates.",

Disease prevention can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

Among the various options, the development of antisense oligonucleotides is the most advanced. Further options at the RNA level include micro-RNAs and modulators of RNA processing (splicing), at the DNA level zinc finger proteins. Several products are in clinical trials. These differ in their mode of application and in the extent of systemic availability. Another important difference between therapeutic strategies could be whether all forms of the huntingtin protein are targeted in the same extent, or whether a therapy preferentially targets particular toxic forms such as the exon1 protein. The results of the recently terminated GENERATION HD1 trial were somewhat sobering, most likely due to the side effect-related hydrocephalus. Therefore they represent just one step towards the development of an effective gene therapy against Huntington's disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurological disease, experience impairments in mobility and cognition throughout their disease course. The Medical Research Council framework provides a schema that can be applied to the development and evaluation of complex interventions, such as those provided by physical therapists. Treatment-based classifications, based on expert consensus and available literature, are helpful in guiding physical therapy management across the stages of HD. Such classifications also contribute to the development and further evaluation of well-defined complex interventions in this highly variable and complex neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this case series was to illustrate the use of these classifications in the management of 2 individuals with late-stage HD. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two females, 40 and 55 years of age, with late-stage HD participated in this case series. Both experienced progressive declines in ambulatory function and balance as well as falls or fear of falling. Both individuals received daily care in the home for activities of daily living. INTERVENTION: Physical therapy Treatment-Based Classifications for HD guided the interventions and outcomes. Eight weeks of in-home balance training, strength training, task-specific practice of functional activities including transfers and walking tasks, and family/carer education were provided. OUTCOMES: Both individuals demonstrated improvements that met or exceeded the established minimal detectible change values for gait speed and Timed Up and Go performance. Both also demonstrated improvements on Berg Balance Scale and Physical Performance Test performance, with 1 of the 2 individuals exceeding the established minimal detectible changes for both tests. Reductions in fall risk were evident in both cases. DISCUSSION: These cases provide proof-of-principle to support use of treatment-based classifications for physical therapy management in individuals with HD. Traditional classification of early-, mid-, and late-stage disease progression may not reflect patients' true capabilities; those with late-stage HD may be as responsive to interventions as those at an earlier disease stage.Video Abstract available for additional insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A172).",

In particular, the grafted cells can sustain functional recovery in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative conditions including genetic and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood and aging, ischemic stroke, and brain and spinal cord trauma. In a restricted subset of such conditions, cell transplantation has progressed to application in humans in early-stage clinical trials. At the present stage of play, there is clear evidence of clinical efficacy of fetal cell transplants in Parkinson disease (notwithstanding a range of technical difficulties still to be fully resolved), and preliminary claims of promising outcomes in several other severe neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington disease and stroke. Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

                    "abstract": "Most human tissues do not regenerate spontaneously; this is why cell therapies and tissue engineering are promising alternatives. The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells. Finally, the properties of foetal stem cells (blood cells from the umbilical cord) are forerunners of the haematopoietic system but the ability of these cells to participate to the formation of other tissues is more problematic. Another field for therapeutic research is that of dendritic cells, antigen presenting cells. Their efficiency in cell therapy relies on the initiation of specific immune responses. They represent a promising tool in the development of a protective immune response against antigens which the host is usually unable to generate an efficient response (melanomas, breast against cancer, prostate cancer, ..).

                    "abstract": "One of the chief contemporary goals of neurologists and neuroscientists is to find a way to overcome the debilitating effects of brain diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Since very few molecules have been found to be efficient in curing the patients and even halting the progression of the symptoms, cell therapy is now seen as an attractive alternative. Two therapeutic strategies are currently under investigation: i) the \"substitution\" strategy, based on grafts of cells capable of differentiating in the appropriate cells and restoring lost functions and ii) the \"neuroprotective\" or \"conservative\" strategy aiming to increase the resistance of spared cells to the toxicity of their environment and to reinforce the body's own mechanisms of healing. Twenty years ago, foetal neuroblasts were the first cells to be transplanted in the brains of patients with Parkinson's or Huntington disease. A phase II clinical trial is presently conducted in France for the latter disorder. However, the numerous ethical and technical issues raised by the use of embryonic and foetal cells have directed the focus of clinicians and researchers towards substitute cell types. In this review, we summarise the main findings of the most recent basic studies and clinical trials based on: i) the grafting of surrogate adult cells such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and olfactory ensheathing cells; ii) the potential therapeutic applications of neuropoiesis - the persistent neurogenesis in the brain - as a source for tissue engraftment and as self-repair by a person's own indigenous population of pluripotent cells and iii) immune-based therapy (autologous activated macrophages and T cell vaccination) as well as administration of immunomodulatory molecules. Unexpectedly, it has been found that undifferentiated adult stem cells can display immune-like functions when they home in on an inflamed brain area while immune cells and immunosuppressors can improve functional and morphological recovery when administered within the appropriate time-window. On the one hand, outcomes from substitution therapy trials are encouraging. They pave the way for an enlarged use of various adult cell types for various neurological disorders. On the other hand, clinical benefits of the neuroprotective therapy, still under close scrutiny, look rather promising. It is likely that, in a close future, the two strategies will be combined in order to efficiently repair the pathological, the damaged or the senescent brain.",

The principle is simple: cells are collected in a patient and introduced in the damaged tissue or in a tridimentional porous support and harvested in a bioreactor in which the physico-chemical and mechanical parameters are controlled. Once the tissues (or the cells) are mature they may be implanted. In parallel, the development of biotherapies with stem cells is a field of research in turmoil given the hopes for clinical applications that it brings up. Embryonic stem cells are potentially more interesting since they are totipotent, but they can only be obtained at the very early stages of the embryo. The potential of adult stem cells is limited but isolating them induces no ethical problem and it has been known for more than 40 years that bone marrow does possess the regenerating functions of blood cells.

Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care. METHODS: Literature review and expert-based statement. RESULTS: Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD. CONCLUSION: There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004), the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p = 0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50 to 3.16; p = 0.007). No benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of programs PA were observed for walking endurance lower limb functionality strenght and cognition function in low and moderate stage of HD. However, no benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. All authors included aerobic exercises in their programs but is unclear if vigorous and intensive PA is optimal for individuals with HD.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Systemic 3-NP administration caused widespread neuropathological deficits similar to ones found in Huntington disease (HD) including impairment in motor function (rotarod balance test) and extensive degeneration of neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN)(+) neurons, calbindin(+) neurons and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)(+) striatal neurons. Animals receiving intrastriatal implantation of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) 1 week before 3-NP treatments exhibited significantly improved motor performance and reduced damage to striatal neurons compared with control sham injections. In contrast, transplantation of hNSCs at 12 h after the initial 3-NP administration did not lead to any improvement in motor performance or protect striatal neurons from the 3-NP-induced toxicity. These results indicate that the presence of grafted hNSCs before 3-NP treatment is required for host striatal neuronal protection and enhanced motor function. Immunoreactivity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was found in vitro in cultured hNSCs and in vivo in grafted NSCs with expression and secretion of BDNF demonstrated by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, dot-blot, and ELISA analyses. Thus, protective effects of proactive transplantation of hNSCs may be due, in part, to effects mediated by BDNF. The findings in this work have particular relevance to a rat model of HD in that proactive transplanted hNSCs protect host striatal neurons against neuronal injury and improve motor impairment induced by 3-NP toxicity.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies. Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

                    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies. Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

Here, we show that ASC transplantation rescues the striatal pathology of Huntington disease (HD) models. METHODS: ASCs were isolated from human subcutaneous adipose tissue. In a quinolinic acid (QA)-induced rat model of striatal degeneration, human ASCs (1 million cells) were transplanted into the ipsilateral striatal border immediately after the QA injection. In 60-day-old R6/2 mice transgenic for HD, ASCs (0.5 million cells) were transplanted into each bilateral striata. In in vitro experiments, we treated mutant huntingtin gene-transfected cerebral neurons with ASC-conditioned media. RESULTS: In the QA model, human ASCs reduced apomorphine-induced rotation behavior, lesion volume, and striatal apoptosis. In R6/2 transgenic mice, transplantation of ASCs improved Rota-Rod performance and limb clasping, increased survival, attenuated the loss of striatal neurons, and reduced the huntingtin aggregates. ASC-transplanted R6/2 mice expressed elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and reactive oxygen defense enzymes and showed activation of the Akt/cAMP-response element-binding proteins. ASC-conditioned media decreased the level of N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin and associated apoptosis, and increased PGC-1alpha expression. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, ASC transplantation slowed striatal degeneration and behavioral deterioration of HD models, possibly via secreted factors.",

In addition, distinct populations of nominally glial progenitor cells, which also have the capacity to generate several cell types, are dispersed throughout the subcortical white matter and cortex. A number of approaches have evolved for using neural progenitor cells in cell therapy. Four strategies are especially attractive for clinical translation: first, transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells as a means of treating the disorders of myelin; second, transplantation of phenotypically restricted neuronal progenitor cells to treat diseases of discrete loss of a single neuronal phenotype, such as Parkinson disease; third, implantation of mixed progenitor pools to treat diseases characterized by the loss of several discrete phenotypes, such as spinal cord injury; and fourth, mobilization of endogenous neural progenitor cells to restore neurons lost as a result of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Huntington disease. Together, these may present the most compelling strategies and near-term disease targets for cell-based neurological therapy.",

                    "abstract": "We have investigated the effectiveness of transplantation of human neural stem cells into adult rat striatum prior to induction of striatal damage with the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP). Systemic 3-NP administration caused widespread neuropathological deficits similar to ones found in Huntington disease (HD) including impairment in motor function (rotarod balance test) and extensive degeneration of neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN)(+) neurons, calbindin(+) neurons and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)(+) striatal neurons. Animals receiving intrastriatal implantation of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) 1 week before 3-NP treatments exhibited significantly improved motor performance and reduced damage to striatal neurons compared with control sham injections. In contrast, transplantation of hNSCs at 12 h after the initial 3-NP administration did not lead to any improvement in motor performance or protect striatal neurons from the 3-NP-induced toxicity. These results indicate that the presence of grafted hNSCs before 3-NP treatment is required for host striatal neuronal protection and enhanced motor function. Immunoreactivity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was found in vitro in cultured hNSCs and in vivo in grafted NSCs with expression and secretion of BDNF demonstrated by RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, dot-blot, and ELISA analyses. Thus, protective effects of proactive transplantation of hNSCs may be due, in part, to effects mediated by BDNF. The findings in this work have particular relevance to a rat model of HD in that proactive transplanted hNSCs protect host striatal neurons against neuronal injury and improve motor impairment induced by 3-NP toxicity.",

The head CT and gait change suggested normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Lumbar puncture (LP) led to improved neuropsychologic test scores and walking thereby supporting the diagnosis of NPH. Surprisingly, the LP also led to an 80% improvement of chorea. There are two other reports of an association between HD and NPH.

The disease usually occurs during the fourth or fifth decade of life; however, it may present at any age. Clinical suspicion is confirmed by genetic testing. Death occurs, on average, 15 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms. Here we report about a Hispanic woman and her family who were affected by the disease; this case illustrates the role of cultural values and beliefs in the decision-making process, as well as the importance of the physician's cultural competency in fostering a trusting relationship that may lessen the burden of catastrophic diseases on individuals, families, and society at-large.",

NSCs are defined as CNS progenitor cells that have the capacity for self-renewal and multipotent potential to become neurons or glial cells. Recent studies have shown that NSCs isolated from mammalian CNS including human can be propagated in vitro and then implanted into the brain of animal models of human neurological disorders. Recently, we have generated clonally derived immortalized human NSC cell lines via a retroviral vector encoded with v-myc oncogene. One of the human NSC lines, HB1.F3, was utilized in stem-cell based therapy in animal models of human neurological disorders. When F3 human NSCs were implanted into the brain of murine models of lysosomal storage diseases, stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease or stroke, implanted F3 NSCs were found to migrate to the lesion sites, differentiate into neurons and glial cells, and restore functional deficits found in these neurological disorders. In animal models of brain tumors, F3 NSCs could deliver a bioactive therapeutically relevant molecules to effect a significant anti-tumor response intracranial tumor mass. Since these genetically engineered human NSCs are immortalized and continuously multiplying, there would be limitless supply of human neurons for treatment for patients suffering from neurological disorders including stroke, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The promising field of stem cell research as it applies to regenerative medicine is still in infancy, but its potential appears limitless, and we are blessed to be involved in this exciting realm of research.",

A number of approaches have evolved for using neural progenitor cells in cell therapy. Four strategies are especially attractive for clinical translation: first, transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells as a means of treating the disorders of myelin; second, transplantation of phenotypically restricted neuronal progenitor cells to treat diseases of discrete loss of a single neuronal phenotype, such as Parkinson disease; third, implantation of mixed progenitor pools to treat diseases characterized by the loss of several discrete phenotypes, such as spinal cord injury; and fourth, mobilization of endogenous neural progenitor cells to restore neurons lost as a result of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Huntington disease.

We have taken related literature of making this review article from ScienceDirect, springer, Research gate, PubMed, Sci-finder, etc. The current approaches for treating neurological conditions such as glioblastoma includes chemotherapy or combination anti-retro viral therapy for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or use of anti-Alzheimer drugs during cognitive impairment. These approaches can provide only symptomatic relief as they do not target the cause of the disease due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. On long-term use, they may cause CNS toxicity due to accumulation in the brain. So nanodiamonds could prove as a promising approach in the brain targeting of the bioactive and to treat many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, brain tumor (glioblastoma), HIV, amyotrophic multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, stroke (cerebrovascular attack), batten disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bacterial infections (encephalitis, sepsis, and meningitis) due to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and owing to their excellent surface properties, i.e., nano size and high surface area, ease of functionalization, multiple drug binding, and biocompatibility; they can be useful for brain targeted drug delivery with minimal side effects.",

In particular, the grafted cells can sustain functional recovery in animal models of a range of neurodegenerative conditions including genetic and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases of adulthood and aging, ischemic stroke, and brain and spinal cord trauma. In a restricted subset of such conditions, cell transplantation has progressed to application in humans in early-stage clinical trials. At the present stage of play, there is clear evidence of clinical efficacy of fetal cell transplants in Parkinson disease (notwithstanding a range of technical difficulties still to be fully resolved), and preliminary claims of promising outcomes in several other severe neurodegenerative conditions, including Huntington disease and stroke. Moreover, the experimental literature is increasingly suggesting that the experience and training of the graft recipient materially affects the functional outcome. For example, environmental enrichment, behavioral activity, and specific training can enhance the recovery process to maximize functional recovery. There are even circumstances where the grafted cells have been demonstrated to restore the neural substrate for new learning. Consequently, it is not sufficient to replace lost cells anatomically; rather, for the grafts to be effective, they need to be integrated functionally into the host circuitry, and the host animal requires training and rehabilitation to maximize function of the reconstructed graft-host circuitry. Such observations require reconsideration of the design of the next generation of clinical trials and subsequent service delivery, to include physiotherapists, cognitive therapists, and rehabilitation experts as core members of the transplant team, along with the neurologists and neurosurgeons that have conventionally led the field.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To delineate the progression of symptoms in the early and middle stages of Huntington disease (HD). DESIGN: A survey of individuals with symptomatic HD completed by a first-degree relative. SETTING: The National Huntington Disease Research Roster for Patients and Families, Indianapolis, Ind. PARTICIPANTS: The survey included 1238 individuals with a minimum of a 6-year history of symptomatic HD. MEASURES: Participating families completed a series of surveys, including the Affected Individual Questionnaire, which consists of 19 physical, emotional, and cognitive signs commonly thought to occur during disease progression. The respondent indicates if each of the symptoms occurred and, if so, at what time during the course of the disease: (1) within 1 year, (2) within 2 to 5 years, (3) within 6 to 10 years, (4) after more than 10 years, (5) has not occurred, or (6) \"don't know.\" RESULTS: The symptoms are categorized into 6 onset periods. Involuntary movements are grouped alone as the earliest reported symptom. The second group is composed entirely of mental and emotional symptoms, including sadness, depression, and difficult to get along with. The third group includes clumsiness, sexual problems, lack of motivation, and suspiciousness/paranoia. As the disease progresses, a variety of motor, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive symptoms are experienced, including unsteadiness, trouble holding onto things, trouble walking, changes in sleeping patterns, delusions and hallucinations, intellectual decline, and memory loss. With the approach of late-stage HD, affected individuals begin to experience speech difficulty and weight loss. In the late stage, patients lose bowel and bladder control. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the symptoms of HD are fairly well characterized, their progression, especially in the early and middle stages, remains uncertain. Clarification of the disease progression is vital to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HD and to the evaluation of therapeutic agents that are designed to slow the progression of disease. The results of this study assist in clarifying HD progression from early involuntary movements and emotional changes to more overt motor symptoms and difficulty with activities of daily living.",

BACKGROUND: The duration of the illness may be up to 30 years and there are far reaching implications for the affected person, family members and carers. Services for families need to provide expert psychological and practical support, whilst remaining planned and flexible. The aim of this research was to identify needs and coping strategies of individuals with Huntington disease and their carers and ascertain the extent to which they were supported by a specialised community service. METHODS: Five focus groups and three individual interviews were used to gather data from affected individuals, family, carers and staff of the unit (n = 33). A semi-structured discussion guide was used in every case. Data were analysed using an inductive coding technique. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged; (i) Transitions and the journey, (ii) Challenges in finding and providing support and (iii) The role of the unit in providing supportive care. While the service was seen as supportive, the need for flexibility was emphasised to facilitate the transition from unaffected to affected status. Affected individuals felt it was important to be known as the person they had been, despite the changes due to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of service in a dedicated unit is an appropriate way to support affected patients and their carers. Enhancing understanding of the disease and allowing the individual to make choices can assist coping with this challenging disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is helpful to allow patients control over timing and frequency of contact with professionals. Improving understanding of the condition in the public and health professionals may enable patients to access a greater range of social activities.",

                    "abstract": "Neurological disorders are one of the major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

Several preclinical and clinical trials for gene-based therapy and immunotherapy/antibody-based have been conducted. AREAS COVERED: This review focused on the potential use of gene therapy and immuno-based therapies to treat HD, including the current status, the rationale for these approaches as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting it. Growing knowledge of HD pathogenesis has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets, some of which are now in clinical trials. Focus has been allocated to RNA and DNA-based gene therapies for the reduction of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), using Immuno/antibody-based therapies. EXPERT OPINION: While safety and efficacy of gene therapy and immunotherapy has been well demonstrated for HD, therefore much focus has now been shifted to disease-modifying therapies. This review defines the current status and future directions of gene therapy and immunotherapies. The review summarizes by what means HD genetic root cause modification and functional restoration of mHtt protein could be achieved by using targeted multimodality gene therapy and immunotherapy to target intracellular and extracellular mHtt.",

Although the precise role of mhtt aggregates in the pathogenesis is unclear, attempts to reduce accumulated mhtt protein have ameliorated the phenotype in multiple cellular and in vivo HD models. Here, we provide critical results on intracranial delivery of a single-chain Fv intrabody, C4, which targets the first 17 amino acids of the htt protein, a region of httExon1 that is increasingly being recognized as pivotal. To assess long-term efficacy and safety issues, we used adenoassociated viral vectors (AAV2/1) to deliver intrabody genes to the striatum of inbred B6.HDR6/1 mice. Treatment initiation at various stages of the disease showed that early treatment preserved the largest number of cells without nuclear aggregates and that the accumulation of aggregated material could be delayed by several months. Even when intrabody treatment was not initiated until the clinical disease stage, significant, albeit smaller, effects were seen. These data indicate that neuronal intrabodies against critical N-terminal epitopes can be safely and effectively delivered using AAV2/1 to delay the aggregation phenotype during a sustained period in this HD model, even when delivery is initiated after disease onset.",

                    "abstract": "A neurogenetic disorder is defined as a clinical disease caused by a defect in one or more genes which affect the differentiation and function of the neuroectoderm and its derivatives. Genetic findings in various neurogenetic disorders are discussed. Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant disorders caused by the expansion of trinucleotides (CAG) within disease genes. The CAG expansions appear to result in a gain of gene function. Prenatal, presymptomatic, and differential diagnostic tests are based on the detection of the repeat expansions. Point mutations within disease genes result in many additional neurogenetic disorders. An autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and various types of craniosynostotic syndromes are described. The mutations in the disease genes also appear to result in a gain of gene function. Molecular diagnosis in these disorders is based on the direct examination of the mutated gene by methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct DNA sequencing. In many neurogenetic disorders the disease gene has not yet been identified. Here molecular diagnosis relies on indirect approaches based on methods such as the analysis of linkage and of allelic association. Hereditary forms of dystonia are presented as examples. Common sporadic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases frequently have multifactorial causes. Investigations into the molecular basis and the development of diagnostic tests in these two important diseases are discussed. At present no curative therapies exist in neurogenetic disorders. Gene therapeutic approaches, however, provide promise for a cure in at least some of these diseases. Basic principles of gene therapy are explained and attempts at gene therapy in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases are described. Finally, some of the many obstacles are summarized that must be overcome before gene therapy becomes feasible in most monogenic neurological diseases.",

Of six patients treated long enough to be clinically evaluated, one showed marked and two others showed signifciant improvement.

As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.

Collaborative models of care depend on: (1) clear communication; (2) ongoing education and support programs; with (3) pharmacologic and rehabilitation interventions, always in the context of respect for the person with HD, a preservation of the individuals' dignity, autonomy, and individual preferences.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients suffering from Huntington disease (HD) have been shown to present with poor self-awareness of a variety of symptoms. The study aimed to assess the self-awareness of memory impairment in HD in comparison to advanced Parkinson disease (PD), mild PD and cervical dystonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-awareness was tested in 23 patients with HD by comparing patient and caregiver ratings in reference to clinical control groups (25 patients with advanced PD, 21 with mild PD and 20 with cervical dystonia). Self-awareness was tested using the Self Rating Scale of Memory Functions, which was administered to both the patients and the caregivers. Neuropsychological assessment addressed general cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination), verbal learning (Auditory Verbal Learning Test, 15-word list) and mood (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). RESULTS: Patients with HD significantly underestimated their memory dysfunction. Underestimation of memory deficit correlated with disease duration and disease severity in HD. CONCLUSIONS: Huntington disease patients underestimate memory dysfunction. These results add to the previous reports on poor insight in HD in other domains and suggest that anosognosia in HD, albeit usually rather mild, may be a generalized phenomenon.",
