Excitotoxicity, due to overstimulation of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), has a pivotal role in many neurological disorders. However, NMDAR antagonists often cause side effects, and identifying more druggable therapeutic targets for NMDAR excitotoxicity is an important goal. Activation of caspases is a downstream effect of excitotoxicity that may be critically involved in NMDAR-mediated cell death. Caspase-6 (casp6) in particular has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer disease. Using N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic injuries of primary rat neurons, we demonstrate that there is an early increase in caspase profiles after an excitotoxic event at the level of mRNA, protein, and activity. Casp6 is elevated and activated first, followed by caspase-8 and caspase-3. Similarly, known casp6 substrates huntingtin, as well as novel casp6 substrates serine/threonine kinase 3 and death domain-associated protein, are cleaved in similar temporal patterns post NMDA. On the basis of these data, we propose that casp6 may be an initiator caspase in apoptotic cascades leading to neuronal death after an excitotoxic event and suggest casp6 as a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders where NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity has been shown to play a role.",

Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) is an expansion of traditional, static FNC that measures connectivity variation among brain networks throughout scan duration. We used a large resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) sample from the PREDICT-HD study (N = 183 Huntington disease gene mutation carriers [HDgmc] and N = 78 healthy control [HC] participants) to examine whole-brain dFNC and its associations with CAG repeat length as well as the product of scaled CAG length and age, a variable representing disease burden. We also tested for relationships between functional connectivity and motor and cognitive measurements. Group independent component analysis was applied to rs-fMRI data to obtain whole-brain resting state networks. FNC was defined as the correlation between RSN time-courses. Dynamic FNC behavior was captured using a sliding time window approach, and FNC results from each window were assigned to four clusters representing FNC states, using a k-means clustering algorithm. HDgmc individuals spent significantly more time in State-1 (the state with the weakest FNC pattern) compared to HC. However, overall HC individuals showed more FNC dynamism than HDgmc. Significant associations between FNC states and genetic and clinical variables were also identified. In FNC State-4 (the one that most resembled static FNC), HDgmc exhibited significantly decreased connectivity between the putamen and medial prefrontal cortex compared to HC, and this was significantly associated with cognitive performance. In FNC State-1, disease burden in HDgmc participants was significantly associated with connectivity between the postcentral gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, as well as between the inferior occipital gyrus and posterior parietal cortex.",

Similarly, its correlation with other clinical markers is still not fully known. We aimed at defining clinical risk factors and neural correlates for compromised swallowing safety in HD more precisely. METHODS: Thirty-four HD subjects (16 female, Shoulson & Fahn Stage I-IV, two premanifest) underwent a full clinical-neurological examination including the cranial nerves, the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score, and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was performed by a trained speech and language therapist.

                    "text": "Cerebellar degeneration correlates with motor symptoms in Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioral symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilizes postmortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles. METHODS: Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorized into 2 groups: \"motor\" or \"mood.\" RESULTS: The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, postmortem delay, CAG repeat in the IT15 gene, or age at death. INTERPRETATION: This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provides novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia, and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Electrophysiologic abnormalities of the globus pallidus externus have been shown in several disease processes including Parkinson disease, dystonia, and Huntington disease. However, the connectivity, nuclear structure, and function of the globus pallidus externus are still not well-understood. Increasing evidence for the existence of direct corticopallidal connections challenges traditional understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus; nevertheless, these corticopallidal connections have yet to be fully characterized in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the corticopallidal connections of the globus pallidus externus by means of probabilistic diffusion-weighted MR imaging tractography using high-resolution, multishell data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging data from the open-access Human Connectome Project data base were used to perform probabilistic tractography between the globus pallidus externus and the cerebral cortex using 34 distinct cortical regions. Group averages were calculated for normalized percentages of tracts reaching each of the cortical targets, and side-to-side comparison was made. RESULTS: Cortical connectivity was demonstrated between the globus pallidus externus and multiple cortical regions, including direct connection to putative sensorimotor, associative, and limbic areas. Connectivity patterns were not significantly different between the right and left hemispheres with the exception of the frontal pole, which showed a greater number of connections on the right (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo study of the human globus pallidus externus using probabilistic tractography supports the existence of extensive corticopallidal connections and a tripartite functional division, as found in animal studies. A better understanding of the connectivity of the globus pallidus externus may help to understand its function and elucidate the effects of programming the higher contacts in pallidal deep brain stimulation.",

PURPOSE: We analyzed the patients served by the University of Washington Adult Genetic Medicine Clinic (UWAGMC) over a 42-year period to determine how clinical services have changed and to evaluate the contributing factors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective survey of patients seen by UWAGMC that included patients seen from 1975 to 2016. Variables considered included referral indication, disease status, and clinic visit date. Indications for referral were then binned into clinical categories for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Of 30,780 patient visits during the 39 years for which data were available, 57.3% occurred in the last decade. Referrals for breast/ovarian cancer or colon/endometrial cancer account for 74.8% of cancer referrals since 1998. Huntington disease patients made up 46% of neurological referral indications. Telephone screening implemented in 2013 has reduced the number of referrals for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. CONCLUSION: Referral indications increased with clinical testing availability and because of the academic programs of UWAGMC providers. With increased public awareness of heritable conditions, prescreening self-referrals were used to allocate limited resources. These trends demonstrate the need for more geneticists in adult medicine to expand centers of excellence for rare diseases and to serve the increasing numbers of adult patients with genetic conditions.",

                    "text": "Clinical recommendations to guide physical therapy practice for Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have examined the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in people with Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We performed a mixed-methods systematic review using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and included experimental and observational study designs. The search resulted in 23 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies from which we extracted data using JBI standardized extraction tools. Results of this review suggested that physical therapy interventions may improve motor impairments and activity limitations in people with HD. Here, we expand on the review findings to provide specific recommendations to guide clinical practice. RESULTS: We recommend the following specific physical therapy interventions for people with HD: aerobic exercise (grade A evidence), alone or in combination with resistance training to improve fitness and motor function, and supervised gait training (grade A evidence) to improve spatiotemporal features of gait. In addition, there is weak (grade B) evidence that exercise training improves balance but does not show a reduction in the frequency of falls; inspiratory and expiratory training improves breathing function and capacity; and training of transfers, getting up from the floor, and providing strategies to caregivers for involvement in physical activity in the midstages of HD may improve performance. There is expert consensus for the use of positioning devices, seating adaptations, and caregiver training in late stages of HD. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence to support physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, motor function, and gait in persons with HD.",

Synaptic dysfunction is a primary mechanism underlying Huntington disease (HD) progression. This study investigated changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density by means of 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging in the central nervous system of mice with HD. Methods: Dynamic 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging was performed at clinically relevant disease stages (at 3, 7, 10, and 16 mo) in the heterozygous knock-in Q175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates (16-18 mice per genotype and time point). Cerebral 11C-UCB-J analyses were performed to assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16 mo) disease stages. 11C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo. 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in mouse and human brain tissues. Results:11C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11C-UCB-J binding was detectable in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant reduction (P < 0.0001). 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice (P < 0.05). Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion:11C-UCB-J PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical application, 11C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.",

Synaptic dysfunction is a primary mechanism underlying Huntington disease (HD) progression. This study investigated changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density by means of 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging in the central nervous system of mice with HD. Methods: Dynamic 11C-UCB-J small-animal PET imaging was performed at clinically relevant disease stages (at 3, 7, 10, and 16 mo) in the heterozygous knock-in Q175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type littermates (16-18 mice per genotype and time point). Cerebral 11C-UCB-J analyses were performed to assess genotypic differences during presymptomatic (3 mo) and symptomatic (7-16 mo) disease stages. 11C-UCB-J binding in the spinal cord was quantified at 16 mo. 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence were performed postmortem in mouse and human brain tissues. Results:11C-UCB-J binding was lower in symptomatic heterozygous mice than in wild-type littermates in parallel with disease progression (7 and 10 mo: P < 0.01; 16 mo: P < 0.0001). Specific 11C-UCB-J binding was detectable in the spinal cord, with symptomatic heterozygous mice displaying a significant reduction (P < 0.0001). 3H-UCB-J autoradiography and SV2A immunofluorescence corroborated the in vivo measurements demonstrating lower SV2A in heterozygous mice (P < 0.05). Finally, preliminary analysis of SV2A in the human brain postmortem suggested lower SV2A in HD gene carriers than in controls without dementia. Conclusion:11C-UCB-J PET detected SV2A deficits during symptomatic disease in heterozygous mice in both the brain and the spinal cord and therefore may be suitable as a novel marker of synaptic integrity widely distributed in the central nervous system. On clinical application, 11C-UCB-J PET imaging may have promise for SV2A measurement in patients with HD during disease progression and after disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.",

OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. No disease-modifying therapy exists for the treatment of patients with HD. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate early disease mechanisms that potentially could be used as a target therapeutically. METHODS: Lymphocyte activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 4 cohorts of HTT gene expansion carriers (n = 121 in total) and controls was analyzed by techniques based on flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The data of this study provide evidence of immune abnormalities before motor onset of disease. In CSF of HTT gene expansion carriers, we found increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, and increased consumption of the lymphocyte growth factor IL-7 before motor onset of HD. In concordance, we observed an increased prevalence of IL-17-producing Th17.1 cells in the CSF of HTT gene expansion carriers, predominantly in pre-motor manifest individuals. The frequency of intrathecal Th17.1 cells correlated negatively with progression of HD and the level of neurodegeneration, suggesting a role of Th17.1 cells in the early disease stage. We also observed a skewing in the balance between proinflammatory and regulatory T cells potentially favoring a proinflammatory intrathecal environment in HTT gene expansion carriers.

METHODS: Lymphocyte activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 4 cohorts of HTT gene expansion carriers (n = 121 in total) and controls was analyzed by techniques based on flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The data of this study provide evidence of immune abnormalities before motor onset of disease. In CSF of HTT gene expansion carriers, we found increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, and increased consumption of the lymphocyte growth factor IL-7 before motor onset of HD. In concordance, we observed an increased prevalence of IL-17-producing Th17.1 cells in the CSF of HTT gene expansion carriers, predominantly in pre-motor manifest individuals. The frequency of intrathecal Th17.1 cells correlated negatively with progression of HD and the level of neurodegeneration, suggesting a role of Th17.1 cells in the early disease stage. We also observed a skewing in the balance between proinflammatory and regulatory T cells potentially favoring a proinflammatory intrathecal environment in HTT gene expansion carriers. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that Th17.1 cells are implicated in the earliest pathogenic phases of HD and suggest that treatment to dampen T -cell-driven inflammation before motor onset might be of benefit in HTT gene expansion carriers.

INTRODUCTION: Huntington's disease (HD) is a degeneration of the brain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence of the physical activity (PA) to improve motor function, gait speed, and walking endurance in individuals with HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references and selected relevant studies to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT), from MEDLINE/PubMed, CENTRAL, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science databases from inception to September 2021. Two reviewers evaluated risk of bias by the PEDro scale. The primary outcome was assessed motor function, gait speed and walking endurance as a secondary outcome was evaluated activities of daily living (ADL), lower limb functionality strenght, balance, mobility and cognition function in HD. RESULTS: Eight RCT were finally included (231 individuals). Forest plots showed a positive effect for gait endurance, the mean difference (MD) was 17.40 (95% CI from 5.40 to 29.35; p = 0.004), the MD lower limb functionality strength was 1.76 (95% CI from 0.18 to 3.33; p = 0.03) favoring PA group and the MD cognition function was 1.83 (95% CI from 0.50 to 3.16; p = 0.007). No benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of programs PA were observed for walking endurance lower limb functionality strenght and cognition function in low and moderate stage of HD. However, no benefits were found for motor function, gait speed, ADL, balance and mobility. All authors included aerobic exercises in their programs but is unclear if vigorous and intensive PA is optimal for individuals with HD.",

BACKGROUND: People with Huntington's disease (HD) often become institutionalized and more frequently die away from the home setting. The reasons behind differences in end-of-life care are poorly understood. Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for this neurodegenerative disease. It is unknown what factors are associated with in-patient specialty PC consultation in this population and how PC might be related to discharge disposition. OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge disposition. DESIGN: We analyzed factors associated with PC consultation for people with HD using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. An anonymized, cross-sectional, and stratified sample of 20% of United States hospitalizations from 2007 through 2014 were included using ICD-9 codes. RESULTS: 8521 patients with HD were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 321 (3.8%) received specialty PC. Payer type, (specifically private insurer or other insurer as compared to Medicare), income, (specifically the top quartile as compared to the bottom quartile), mortality risk, D.N.R., aspiration pneumonia, and depression were significantly associated with PC in a multivariate model. Among those who received PC, the odds ratio (OR) of discharge to a facility was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.32-0.58), whereas the OR of discharge to home with services was 2.25 (95% CI 1.57-3.23), even after adjusting for possible confounders.

                    "text": "Disparities in Palliative Care Utilization Among Hospitalized People With Huntington Disease: A National Cross-Sectional Study. BACKGROUND: People with Huntington's disease (HD) often become institutionalized and more frequently die away from the home setting. The reasons behind differences in end-of-life care are poorly understood. Less than 5% of people with HD report utilization of palliative care (PC) or hospice services, regardless of the lack of curative therapies for this neurodegenerative disease. It is unknown what factors are associated with in-patient specialty PC consultation in this population and how PC might be related to discharge disposition. OBJECTIVES: To determine what HD-specific (e.g., psychosis) and serious illness-specific factors (e.g., resuscitation preferences) are associated with PC encounters in people with HD and explore how PC encounters are associated with discharge disposition. DESIGN: We analyzed factors associated with PC consultation for people with HD using discharge data from the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. An anonymized, cross-sectional, and stratified sample of 20% of United States hospitalizations from 2007 through 2014 were included using ICD-9 codes. RESULTS: 8521 patients with HD were admitted to the hospital. Of those, 321 (3.8%) received specialty PC. Payer type, (specifically private insurer or other insurer as compared to Medicare), income, (specifically the top quartile as compared to the bottom quartile), mortality risk, D.N.R., aspiration pneumonia, and depression were significantly associated with PC in a multivariate model. Among those who received PC, the odds ratio (OR) of discharge to a facility was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.32-0.58), whereas the OR of discharge to home with services was 2.25 (95% CI 1.57-3.23), even after adjusting for possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HD, economic factors, depression, and serious illness-specific factors were associated with PC, and PC was associated with discharge disposition. These findings have implications for the adaptation of inpatient PC models to meet the needs of persons with HD.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Huntington disease is a devastating genetic neurodegenerative disorder for which no effective treatment is yet available. Although progressive striatal atrophy is its pathologic hallmark, concomitant cortical deterioration is assumed to occur, but it is poorly characterized. Our objective was to study the loss of cortical integrity and its association with clinical indicators throughout the course of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a cohort of 39 patients with Huntington disease and 25 controls with available MR imaging (T1WI and DTI), we compared cortical atrophy and intracortical diffusivity across disease stages. Intracortical diffusivity is a DTI-derived metric that has recently been suggested to detect incipient neuronal death because water can diffuse more freely in cortical regions with reduced neural density. RESULTS: We observed progressive thinning and increasing diffusivity within the cerebral cortex of patients with Huntington disease (P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Most important, in the absence of pronounced atrophy, widespread increased diffusivity was already present in individuals with premanifest Huntington disease, correlating, in turn, with clinical and disease-specific progression markers. CONCLUSIONS: Intracortical diffusivity may be more sensitive than cortical thinning for tracking early neurodegeneration in Huntington disease. Moreover, our findings provide further evidence of an early cortical compromise in Huntington disease, which contributes to our understanding of its clinical phenotype and could have important therapeutic implications.",

However, few studies have clearly discussed the neuromodulatory effects of naringenin against different neurodegenerative disorders. AIM: We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of naringenin against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in rats. METHODS: Albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered group, received saline. Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received naringenin (50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP administration. On the 5th day, neurobehavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes and the striatum tissue was used for analysis of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and serotonin (5-HT) levels. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. RESULTS: Our results showed that naringenin co-treatment provides neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced neurological disorders. Naringenin also increased the MAO activity and 5-HT levels in the striatum. Moreover, co-treatment with naringenin reduced the expression of GFAP protein in the striatal part and significantly attenuated the neuronal cell death.

                    "text": "Naringenin mitigates behavioral alterations and provides neuroprotection against 3-nitropropinoic acid-induced Huntington's disease like symptoms in rats. BACKGROUND: Naringenin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory flavonoid which has been widely used as a therapeutic agent in various toxic models. However, few studies have clearly discussed the neuromodulatory effects of naringenin against different neurodegenerative disorders. AIM: We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of naringenin against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in rats. METHODS: Albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered group, received saline. Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received naringenin (50 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP administration. On the 5th day, neurobehavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes and the striatum tissue was used for analysis of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and serotonin (5-HT) levels. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining. RESULTS: Our results showed that naringenin co-treatment provides neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced neurological disorders. Naringenin also increased the MAO activity and 5-HT levels in the striatum. Moreover, co-treatment with naringenin reduced the expression of GFAP protein in the striatal part and significantly attenuated the neuronal cell death. The findings of the present study suggest that naringenin provides neuroprotection and mitigates neurobehavioral alterations in experimental rats. CONCLUSION: The results show that co-treatment with naringenin ameliorates 3-NP-induced HD-like symptoms in rats.",

We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.",

The expanded CAG repeat number in HTT gene causes Huntington disease (HD), which is a severe, dominant neurodegenerative illness. The accurate determination of the expanded allele size is crucial to confirm the genetic status in symptomatic and presymptomatic at-risk subjects and avoid genetic polymorphism-related false-negative diagnoses. Precise CAG repeat number determination is critical to discriminate the cutoff between unexpanded and intermediate mutable alleles (IAs, 27-35 CAG) as well as between IAs and pathological, low-penetrance alleles (i.e., 36-39 CAG repeats), and it is also critical to detect large repeat expansions causing pediatric HD variants. We analyzed the HTT-CAG repeat number of 14 DNA reference materials and of a DNA collection of 43 additional samples carrying unexpanded, IAs, low and complete penetrance alleles, including large (>60 repeats) and very large (>100 repeats) expansions using a novel triplet-primed PCR-based assay, the AmplideX PCR/CE HTT Kit. The results demonstrate that the method accurately genotypes both normal and expanded HTT-CAG repeat numbers and reveals previously undisclosed and very large CAG expansions >200 repeats. We also show that this technique can improve genetic test reliability and accuracy by detecting CAG expansions in samples with sequence variations within or adjacent to the repeat tract that cause allele drop-outs or inaccuracies using other PCR methods.",

The expanded CAG repeat number in HTT gene causes Huntington disease (HD), which is a severe, dominant neurodegenerative illness. The accurate determination of the expanded allele size is crucial to confirm the genetic status in symptomatic and presymptomatic at-risk subjects and avoid genetic polymorphism-related false-negative diagnoses. Precise CAG repeat number determination is critical to discriminate the cutoff between unexpanded and intermediate mutable alleles (IAs, 27-35 CAG) as well as between IAs and pathological, low-penetrance alleles (i.e., 36-39 CAG repeats), and it is also critical to detect large repeat expansions causing pediatric HD variants. We analyzed the HTT-CAG repeat number of 14 DNA reference materials and of a DNA collection of 43 additional samples carrying unexpanded, IAs, low and complete penetrance alleles, including large (>60 repeats) and very large (>100 repeats) expansions using a novel triplet-primed PCR-based assay, the AmplideX PCR/CE HTT Kit. The results demonstrate that the method accurately genotypes both normal and expanded HTT-CAG repeat numbers and reveals previously undisclosed and very large CAG expansions >200 repeats. We also show that this technique can improve genetic test reliability and accuracy by detecting CAG expansions in samples with sequence variations within or adjacent to the repeat tract that cause allele drop-outs or inaccuracies using other PCR methods.",

INTRODUCTION: While individuals with Huntington disease (HD) show memory impairment that indicates hippocampal dysfunction, the available literature does not consistently identify structural evidence for involvement of the whole hippocampus but rather suggests that hippocampal atrophy may be confined to certain hippocampal subregions. METHODS: We processed T1-weighted MRI from IMAGE-HD study using FreeSurfer 7.0 and compared the volumes of the hippocampal subfields among 36 early motor symptomatic (symp-HD), 40 pre-symptomatic (pre-HD), and 36 healthy control individuals across three timepoints over 36 months. RESULTS: Mixed-model analyses revealed significantly lower subfield volumes in symp-HD, compared with pre-HD and control groups, in the subicular regions of the perforant-pathway: presubiculum, subiculum, dentate gyrus, tail, and right molecular layer. These adjoining subfields aggregated into a single principal component, which demonstrated an accelerated rate of atrophy in the symp-HD. Volumes between pre-HD and controls did not show any significant difference. In the combined HD groups, CAG repeat length and disease burden score were associated with presubiculum, molecular layer, tail, and perforant-pathway subfield volumes. Hippocampal left tail and perforant-pathway subfields were associated with motor onset in the pre-HD group. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal subfields atrophy in early symptomatic HD affects key regions of the perforant-pathway, which may implicate the distinctive memory impairment at this stage of illness. Their volumetric associations with genetic and clinical markers suggest the selective susceptibility of these subfields to mutant Huntingtin and disease progression.",

INTRODUCTION: Modulation of gene expression using gene therapy as well as modulation of immune activation using immunotherapy has attracted considerable attention as rapidly emerging potential therapeutic intervention for the treatment of HD. Several preclinical and clinical trials for gene-based therapy and immunotherapy/antibody-based have been conducted. AREAS COVERED: This review focused on the potential use of gene therapy and immuno-based therapies to treat HD, including the current status, the rationale for these approaches as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting it. Growing knowledge of HD pathogenesis has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets, some of which are now in clinical trials. Focus has been allocated to RNA and DNA-based gene therapies for the reduction of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), using Immuno/antibody-based therapies. EXPERT OPINION: While safety and efficacy of gene therapy and immunotherapy has been well demonstrated for HD, therefore much focus has now been shifted to disease-modifying therapies. This review defines the current status and future directions of gene therapy and immunotherapies. The review summarizes by what means HD genetic root cause modification and functional restoration of mHtt protein could be achieved by using targeted multimodality gene therapy and immunotherapy to target intracellular and extracellular mHtt.",

Huntington Disease (HD) is a late-onset autosomal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the aggregations of mutant Huntingtin proteins (mHTT). A glutamine stretch (PolyQ) at the N-terminal of the Huntingtin protein is generated by the abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in exon 1 of the HTT gene.

Overall, our FLIM study combined with confocal fluorescence imaging visualizes the absorption of the mutant Htt protein aggregates which results in a distinct NADH fluorescence lifetime between control cells and acceptor cells.

In this randomized double-blind study, 4 groups of healthy subjects (50 per arm) participated to evaluate the effect of laquinimod, an oral treatment in development for multiple sclerosis and Huntington disease, on the QTc interval. Subjects received a dose of either 0.6 or 1.2 mg/day laquinimod for 14 days, placebo for 14 days, or 13 days of placebo followed by a dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin on day 14. Continuous 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded on day -1 (baseline) and days 14 to 17,  and quadruplicate electrocardiograms were extracted at predefined time points. The primary measure was time-matched change from baseline in individual QTc (QTcI), and an analysis of variance was conducted on the placebo-corrected change from baseline data (ddQTcI). Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and safety assessments were included. Results showed that the upper limits of the 2-sided 90%CI for ddQTcI for both laquinimod doses were below 10 millisconds at all time points, whereas lower limits for moxifloxacin were above 5 milliseconds. No notable changes in ECG parameters were observed. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis showed no positive correlation between laquinimod plasma levels and QTcI. In conclusion, laquinimod was not found to affect cardiac repolarization or to cause prolongation of QTcI at doses of 0.6 and 1.2 mg/day.",

Movement disorders and neurodegenerative diseases are a variety of conditions that involve progressive neuronal degeneration, injury, or death. Establishing the correct diagnosis of a movement disorder or neurodegenerative process can be difficult due to the variable features of these conditions, unusual clinical presentations, and overlapping symptoms and characteristics. MRI has an important role in the initial assessment of these patients, although a combination of imaging and laboratory and genetic tests is often needed for complete evaluation and management. This document summarizes the imaging appropriateness data for rapidly progressive dementia, chorea, Parkinsonian syndromes, suspected neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, and suspected motor neuron disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.",

Recent studies have reported visual dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD). However, little is known about retinal structural changes in HD. METHODS: A total of 50 subjects, including 25 motor-manifest HD patients and 25 gender- and age-matched controls, were enrolled. Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Score-Motor part was assessed in HD patients. Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was used to evaluate the macular thickness and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). Superficial and deep capillary plexus densities were measured using OCT angiography (OCTA). To account for inter-eye correlation, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used. RESULTS: HD patients had a significant reduction in macular thickness in both inner and outer superior sectors and the inferior outer sector. Inferior pRNFLs were significantly decreased in thickness. There was no significant difference in retinal capillary plexus density between the two groups. Age and disease duration were negatively correlated with macular thickness in HD patients. However, the severity of motor involvement was not correlated with SD-OCT or OCTA parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We observed attenuated pRNFL and macular retinal thickness in patients with HD, independent of macular capillary plexus parameters.

Importance: Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor and phonic tics, often accompanied by behavioral and psychiatric comorbidities. Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved in the US for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia. Objective: To report results of the ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in Tourette Syndrome 2) study examining deutetrabenazine for treatment of Tourette syndrome. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted over 8 weeks with a 1-week follow-up (June 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019). Children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and active tics causing distress or impairment were enrolled in the study. Children were recruited from 52 sites in 10 countries. Data were analyzed from February 4 to April 22, 2020. Interventions: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/d), high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/d), or a matching placebo, which were titrated over 4 weeks to the target dose followed by a 4-week maintenance period. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine. Key secondary end points included changes in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine, Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression score, Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact score, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and questionnaires. Results: The study included 158 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 11.7 [2.6] years). A total of 119 participants (75%) were boys; 7 (4%), Asian; 1 (1%), Black; 32 (20%), Hispanic; 4 (3%), Native American; 135 (85%), White; 2 (1%), multiracial; 9 (6%), other race; and 1 (0.6%), of unknown ethnic origin. Fifty-two participants were randomized to the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 54 to the low-dose deutetrabenazine group, and 52 to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics for participants were similar between groups. Of the total 158 participants, 64 (41%) were aged 6 to 11 years, and 94 (59%) were aged 12 to 16 years at baseline. Mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 (2.8) years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 (6.6) points. At week 8, the difference in YGTSS-TTS was not significant between the high-dose deutetrabenazine and placebo groups (least-squares mean difference, -0.8 points; 95% CI, -3.9 to 2.3 points; P = .60; Cohen d, -0.11). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 34 participants (65%) treated with high-dose deutetrabenazine, 24 (44%) treated with low-dose deutetrabenazine, and 25 (49%) treated with placebo and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this fixed-dose randomized clinical trial of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met.

Huntingtin N-terminal fragments (Htt-NTFs) with expanded polyglutamine tracts form a range of neurotoxic aggregates that are associated with Huntington's disease. Here, we show that aggregation of Htt-NTFs, irrespective of polyglutamine length, yields at least three phases (designated M, S, and F) that are delineated by sharp concentration thresholds and distinct aggregate sizes and morphologies. We found that monomers and oligomers make up the soluble M phase, ~25-nm spheres dominate in the soluble S phase, and long, linear fibrils make up the insoluble F phase. Previous studies showed that profilin, an abundant cellular protein, reduces Htt-NTF aggregation and toxicity in cells. We confirm that profilin achieves its cellular effects through direct binding to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Htt-NTFs. We show that profilin preferentially binds to Htt-NTF M-phase species and destabilizes aggregation and phase separation by shifting the concentration boundaries for phase separation to higher values through a process known as polyphasic linkage. Our experiments, aided by coarse-grained computer simulations and theoretical analysis, suggest that preferential binding of profilin to the M-phase species of Htt-NTFs is enhanced through a combination of specific interactions between profilin and polyproline segments and auxiliary interactions between profilin and polyglutamine tracts. Polyphasic linkage may be a general strategy that cells utilize to regulate phase behavior of aggregation-prone proteins.

                    "text": "Profilin reduces aggregation and phase separation of huntingtin N-terminal fragments by preferentially binding to soluble monomers and oligomers. Huntingtin N-terminal fragments (Htt-NTFs) with expanded polyglutamine tracts form a range of neurotoxic aggregates that are associated with Huntington's disease. Here, we show that aggregation of Htt-NTFs, irrespective of polyglutamine length, yields at least three phases (designated M, S, and F) that are delineated by sharp concentration thresholds and distinct aggregate sizes and morphologies. We found that monomers and oligomers make up the soluble M phase, ~25-nm spheres dominate in the soluble S phase, and long, linear fibrils make up the insoluble F phase. Previous studies showed that profilin, an abundant cellular protein, reduces Htt-NTF aggregation and toxicity in cells. We confirm that profilin achieves its cellular effects through direct binding to the C-terminal proline-rich region of Htt-NTFs. We show that profilin preferentially binds to Htt-NTF M-phase species and destabilizes aggregation and phase separation by shifting the concentration boundaries for phase separation to higher values through a process known as polyphasic linkage. Our experiments, aided by coarse-grained computer simulations and theoretical analysis, suggest that preferential binding of profilin to the M-phase species of Htt-NTFs is enhanced through a combination of specific interactions between profilin and polyproline segments and auxiliary interactions between profilin and polyglutamine tracts. Polyphasic linkage may be a general strategy that cells utilize to regulate phase behavior of aggregation-prone proteins. Accordingly, detailed knowledge of phase behavior and an understanding of how ligands modulate phase boundaries may pave the way for developing new therapeutics against a variety of aggregation-prone proteins.",

We evaluated NfL correlations with ages, CAG repeat sizes, clinical scores and volumetric brain MRIs. NfL levels were significantly higher in SCAs than controls at both time points (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted NfL levels were significantly correlated at baseline with clinical scores (p < 0.01). We identified optimal NfL cut-off concentrations to differentiate controls from carriers for each genotype (SCA1 16.87 pg/mL, SCA2, 19.1 pg/mL, SCA3 16.04 pg/mL, SCA7 16.67 pg/mL). For all SCAs, NfL concentration was stable over two years (p = 0.95) despite a clinical progression (p < 0.0001). Clinical progression between baseline and follow-up was associated with higher NfL concentrations at baseline (p = 0.04). Of note, all premanifest carriers with NfL levels close to cut off concentrations had signs of the disease at follow-up. For all SCAs, the higher the observed NfL, the lower the pons volume at baseline (p < 0.01) and follow-up (p = 0.02). Higher NfL levels at baseline in all SCAs predicted a decrease in cerebellar volume (p = 0.03). This result remained significant for SCA2 only among all genotypes (p = 0.02). Overall, plasma NfL levels at baseline in SCA expansion carriers predict cerebellar volume change and clinical score progression. NfL levels might help refine inclusion criteria for clinical trials in carriers with very subtle signs.",

In Huntington disease (HD), the mutant huntingtin (mtHTT) protein is the principal cause of pathological changes that initiate primarily along the cortico-striatal axis. mtHTT is ubiquitously expressed and there is, accordingly, growing recognition that HD is a systemic disorder with functional interplay between the brain and the periphery. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, C6-17, targeting an exposed region of HTT near the aa586 Caspase 6 cleavage site. As recently published, mAB C6-17 can block cell-to-cell propagation of mtHTT in vitro. In order to reduce the burden of the mutant protein in vivo, we queried whether extracellular mtHTT could be therapeutically targeted in YAC128 HD mice. In a series of proof of concept experiments, we found that systemic mAB C6-17 treatment resulted in the distribution of the mAB C6-17 to peripheral and CNS tissues and led to the reduction of HTT protein levels. Compared to CTRL mAB or vehicle treated mice, the mAB C6-17 treated YAC128 animals showed improved body weight and motor behaviors, a delayed progression in motor deficits and reduced striatal EM48 immunoreactivity. These results provide the first proof of concept for the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of an antibody-based anti-HTT passive immunization approach and suggest this modality as a potential new HD treatment strategy.",

In Huntington disease (HD), the mutant huntingtin (mtHTT) protein is the principal cause of pathological changes that initiate primarily along the cortico-striatal axis. mtHTT is ubiquitously expressed and there is, accordingly, growing recognition that HD is a systemic disorder with functional interplay between the brain and the periphery. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, C6-17, targeting an exposed region of HTT near the aa586 Caspase 6 cleavage site. As recently published, mAB C6-17 can block cell-to-cell propagation of mtHTT in vitro. In order to reduce the burden of the mutant protein in vivo, we queried whether extracellular mtHTT could be therapeutically targeted in YAC128 HD mice.

To better understand emotion production in both voice and language in Huntington's Disease (HD), we tested 115 individuals: 68 patients (HD), 22 participants carrying the mutant HD gene without any motor symptoms (pre-manifest HD), and 25 controls in a single-centre prospective observational follow-up study. Participants were recorded in interviews in which they were asked to recall sad, angry, happy, and neutral stories. Emotion expression through voice and language was investigated by comparing the identifiability of emotions expressed by controls, preHD and HD patients in these interviews. To assess separately vocal and linguistic expression of emotions in a blind design, we used machine learning models instead of a human jury performing a forced-choice recognition test. Results from this study showed that patients with HD had difficulty expressing emotions through both voice and language compared to preHD participants and controls, who behaved similarly and above chance. In addition, we did not find any differences in expression of emotions between preHD and healthy controls. We further validated our newly proposed methodology with a human jury on the speech produced by the controls. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that emotional deficits in HD are caused by impaired sensori-motor representations of emotions, in line with embodied cognition theories.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) represents a potential therapeutic target for Huntington disease. Using 11C-ABP688 (3-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-ylethynyl)-cyclohex-2-enone-O-11C-methyl-oxime), a noncompetitive and highly selective antagonist for mGluR5, we aimed to longitudinally characterize in vivo changes in mGluR5 by means of PET imaging in the Q175 mouse model of Huntington disease. Methods:11C-ABP688 PET imaging, followed by a CT scan, was performed on 18 heterozygous mice and 18 wild-type (WT) littermates at 3 different time points (6, 9, and 13 mo old). 11C-ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated for each time point in striatum and cortex using the cerebellum as the reference region. In addition, voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was performed on BPND images. Postmortem validation of mGluR5 level and neuronal density was performed on the mice at 6 mo old. Results: The 11C-ABP688 BPND of heterozygous animals was significantly reduced at all time points in the striatum (-13.1%, -13.5%, and -14.2% at 6, 9, and 13 mo, respectively; P < 0.001 for all) and in the cortex (-9.8%, -10.2%, and -10.6%, respectively; P < 0.01 for all), when compared with WT animals. Longitudinal changes in 11C-ABP688 BPND were also found in heterozygous mice, showing a reduction at 13 mo compared with 6 mo (-10.4%, P < 0.05). SPM analysis confirmed reduced BPND in heterozygous compared with WT mice, as well as a time-related decline in 11C-ABP688 binding in the striatum of heterozygous mice. Postmortem analysis confirmed a mGluR5 decrease in both striatum (-36.6%; P < 0.01) and cortex (-16.6%; P < 0.05) in heterozygous mice, whereas no difference in neuronal density was found. Conclusion: In vivo imaging of mGluR5 using 11C-ABP688 PET/CT revealed a marked reduction in ligand binding in the striatum and cortex of heterozygous mice, compared with WT mice, as well as a temporal decline. This study suggests that 11C-ABP688 PET imaging is a potential biomarker to monitor the progression of, and therapeutic strategies for, Huntington disease.",

                    "text": "Longitudinal Characterization of mGluR5 Using 11C-ABP688 PET Imaging in the Q175 Mouse Model of Huntington Disease. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) represents a potential therapeutic target for Huntington disease. Using 11C-ABP688 (3-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-ylethynyl)-cyclohex-2-enone-O-11C-methyl-oxime), a noncompetitive and highly selective antagonist for mGluR5, we aimed to longitudinally characterize in vivo changes in mGluR5 by means of PET imaging in the Q175 mouse model of Huntington disease. Methods:11C-ABP688 PET imaging, followed by a CT scan, was performed on 18 heterozygous mice and 18 wild-type (WT) littermates at 3 different time points (6, 9, and 13 mo old). 11C-ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated for each time point in striatum and cortex using the cerebellum as the reference region. In addition, voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was performed on BPND images. Postmortem validation of mGluR5 level and neuronal density was performed on the mice at 6 mo old. Results: The 11C-ABP688 BPND of heterozygous animals was significantly reduced at all time points in the striatum (-13.1%, -13.5%, and -14.2% at 6, 9, and 13 mo, respectively; P < 0.001 for all) and in the cortex (-9.8%, -10.2%, and -10.6%, respectively; P < 0.01 for all), when compared with WT animals. Longitudinal changes in 11C-ABP688 BPND were also found in heterozygous mice, showing a reduction at 13 mo compared with 6 mo (-10.4%, P < 0.05). SPM analysis confirmed reduced BPND in heterozygous compared with WT mice, as well as a time-related decline in 11C-ABP688 binding in the striatum of heterozygous mice. Postmortem analysis confirmed a mGluR5 decrease in both striatum (-36.6%; P < 0.01) and cortex (-16.6%; P < 0.05) in heterozygous mice, whereas no difference in neuronal density was found. Conclusion: In vivo imaging of mGluR5 using 11C-ABP688 PET/CT revealed a marked reduction in ligand binding in the striatum and cortex of heterozygous mice, compared with WT mice, as well as a temporal decline. This study suggests that 11C-ABP688 PET imaging is a potential biomarker to monitor the progression of, and therapeutic strategies for, Huntington disease.",

Importance: Predictive genetic testing in Huntington disease (HD) enables therapeutic trials in HTT gene expansion mutation carriers prior to a motor diagnosis. Progression-free survival (PFS) is the composite of a motor diagnosis or a progression event, whichever comes first. Objective: To determine if PFS provides feasible sample sizes for trials with mutation carriers who have not yet received a motor diagnosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study uses data from the 2-phase, longitudinal cohort studies called Track and from a longitudinal cohort study called the Cooperative Huntington Observational Research Trial (COHORT). Track had 167 prediagnosis mutation carriers and 156 noncarriers, whereas COHORT had 366 prediagnosis mutation carriers and noncarriers. Track studies were conducted at 4 sites in 4 countries (Canada, France, England, and the Netherlands) from which data were collected from January 17, 2008, through November 17, 2014. The COHORT was conducted at 38 sites in 3 countries (Australia, Canada, and the United States) from which data were collected from February 14, 2006, through December 31, 2009. Results from the Track data were externally validated with data from the COHORT. The required sample size was estimated for a 2-arm prediagnosis clinical trial.

Huntington disease progression events are defined for the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score, total functional capacity, symbol digit modalities test, and Stroop word test. Results: Of Track's 167 prediagnosis mutation carriers, 93 (55.6%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 40.06 (8.92) years; of the 156 noncarriers, 87 (55.7%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 45.58 (10.30) years. Of the 366 COHORT participants, 229 (62.5%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 42.21 (12.48) years. The PFS curves of the Track mutation carriers showed good external validity with the COHORT mutation carriers after adjusting for initial progression. For required sample size, PFS with a motor diagnosis or total motor score progression required about 4 times fewer participants than a motor diagnosis alone. Including additional cognitive progression events further reduced the number. For example, a 3-year trial with 10% attrition and a treatment effect of 50% requires a total of 661 with motor diagnosis as the survival end point but only 177 with a total motor score PFS. Conclusions and Relevance: Reasonably sized prediagnosis Huntington disease trials can be planned with PFS, and there is evidence of generalizability of this approach.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntington disease gene. The symptomatic stage of the disease is defined by the onset of motor symptoms. However, psychiatric disturbances, including depression, are common features of HD and can occur a decade before the manifestation of motor symptoms. We used the YAC128 transgenic mice (which develop motor deficits at a later stage, allowing more time to study depressive behaviors without the confounding effects of motor impairment) to test the effects of intranasal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment for 15 days in the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors. Using multiple well-validated behavioral tests, we found that BDNF treatment alleviated anhedonic and depressive-like behaviors in the YAC128 HD mice. Furthermore, we also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effects of BDNF were associated with an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, BDNF treatment only increased cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of wild-type (WT) mice, without altering these parameters in their YAC128 counterparts. Moreover, BDNF treatment did not cause an increase in the number of dendritic branches in the hippocampal DG when compared with animals treated with vehicle.

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntington disease gene. The symptomatic stage of the disease is defined by the onset of motor symptoms. However, psychiatric disturbances, including depression, are common features of HD and can occur a decade before the manifestation of motor symptoms. We used the YAC128 transgenic mice (which develop motor deficits at a later stage, allowing more time to study depressive behaviors without the confounding effects of motor impairment) to test the effects of intranasal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment for 15 days in the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors. Using multiple well-validated behavioral tests, we found that BDNF treatment alleviated anhedonic and depressive-like behaviors in the YAC128 HD mice. Furthermore, we also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effects of BDNF were associated with an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, BDNF treatment only increased cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of wild-type (WT) mice, without altering these parameters in their YAC128 counterparts. Moreover, BDNF treatment did not cause an increase in the number of dendritic branches in the hippocampal DG when compared with animals treated with vehicle. In conclusion, our results suggest that non-invasive administration of BDNF via the intranasal route may have important therapeutic potential for treating mood disturbances in early-symptomatic HD patients.",

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited disorder hallmarked by progressive deterioration of specific neurons, followed by movement and cognitive anomalies. Cell therapy approaches in neurodegenerative conditions have concentrated on the replenishment of lost/dying neurons with functional ones. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been represented as a potential remedy for HD. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) and their paracrine effect against oxidative stress with a specific focus on HD. To this end, UCMSCs were isolated, immunophenotypically characterized by the positive expression of MSC markers, and exhibited multilineage potentiality. Besides, synthesis of neurotrophic factors of GDNF and VEGF by UCMSC was confirmed. Initially, PC12 cells were exposed to superoxide in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from UCMSC (UCMSC-CM) and cell viability plus neuritogenesis were measured. Next, bilateral striatal transplantation of UCMSC in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) lesioned rat models was conducted, and 1 month later, post-graft analysis was performed. According to our in vitro results, CM of UCMSC protected PC12 cells against oxidative stress and considerably enhanced cell viability and neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, transplanted UCMSC survived, decreased gliosis, and ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, along with an increase in striatal volume as well as in dendritic length of the striatum in HD rats. Collectively, our findings imply that UCMSCs provide an enriched platform by largely their paracrine factors, which downgrades the unfavorable effects of oxidative stress.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of microRNA (miRNA) levels in CSF as biomarkers for prodromal Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: miRNA levels were measured in CSF from 60 PREDICT-HD study participants using the HTG protocol. Using a CAG-Age Product score, 30 prodromal HD participants were selected based on estimated probability of imminent clinical diagnosis of HD (i.e., low, medium, high; n = 10/group). For comparison, participants already diagnosed (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were also selected. RESULTS: A total of 2,081 miRNAs were detected and 6 were significantly increased in the prodromal HD gene expansion carriers vs controls at false discovery rate q < 0.05 (miR-520f-3p, miR-135b-3p, miR-4317, miR-3928-5p, miR-8082, miR-140-5p). Evaluating the miRNA levels in each of the HD risk categories, all 6 revealed a pattern of increasing abundance from control to low risk, and from low risk to medium risk, which then leveled off from the medium to high risk and HD diagnosed groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports miRNAs as CSF biomarkers of prodromal and diagnosed HD. Importantly, miRNAs were detected in the prodromal HD groups furthest from diagnosis where treatments are likely to be most consequential and meaningful.

                    "text": "Brain structure in juvenile-onset Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess brain morphometry in a sample of patients with juvenile-onset Huntington disease (JOHD) and several mouse models of Huntington disease (HD) that likely represent the human JOHD phenotype. METHODS: Despite sharing the mutation in the Huntingtin gene, adult-onset HD characteristically presents as a hyperkinetic motor disorder, while JOHD typically presents as a hypokinetic motor disease. The University of Iowa Kids-JHD program enrolls individuals 5 to 25 years of age who have already received the clinical diagnosis. A total of 19 children with juvenile HD (JHD) (mean CAG = 72) were studied. Patients with JHD were compared to healthy controls (n = 234) using a cross-sectional study design. Volumetric data from structural MRI was compared between groups. In addition, we used the same procedure to evaluate brain morphology of R6/2, zQ175, HdhQ250 HD mice models. RESULTS: Participants with JHD had substantially reduced intracranial volumes. After controlling for the small intracranial volume size, the volumes of subcortical regions (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus) and of cortical white matter were significantly decreased in patients with JHD. However, the cerebellum was proportionately enlarged in the JHD sample. The cerebral cortex was largely unaffected. Likewise, HD mice had a lower volume of striatum and a higher volume of cerebellum, mirroring the human MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: The primary pathology of JOHD extends beyond changes in the striatal volume. Brain morphology in both mice and human patients with JHD shows proportional cerebellar enlargement. This pattern of brain changes may explain the unique picture of hypokinetic motor symptoms in JHD, which is not seen in the hyperkinetic chorea-like phenotype of adult-onset HD.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene. Results from previous studies have suggested that transcriptional dysregulation is one of the key mechanisms underlying striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) degeneration in HD. However, some of the critical genes involved in HD etiology or pathology could be masked in a common expression profiling assay because of contamination with non-MSN cells. To gain insight into the MSN-specific gene expression changes in presymptomatic R6/2 mice, a common HD mouse model, here we used a transgenic fluorescent protein marker of MSNs for purification via FACS before profiling gene expression with gene microarrays and compared the results of this \"FACS-array\" with those obtained with homogenized striatal samples (STR-array). We identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enhanced detection of MSN-specific DEGs by comparing the results of the FACS-array with those of the STR-array.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Previously, we showed strong huntingtin reduction and prevention of neuronal dysfunction in HD rodents using an engineered microRNA targeting human huntingtin, delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 5 vector with a transgene encoding an engineered miRNA against HTT mRNA (AAV5-miHTT). One of the challenges of rodents as a model of neurodegenerative diseases is their relatively small brain, making successful translation to the HD patient difficult. This is particularly relevant for gene therapy approaches, where distribution achieved upon local administration into the parenchyma is likely dependent on brain size and structure. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the translation of huntingtin-lowering gene therapy to a large-animal brain. We investigated the feasibility, efficacy, and tolerability of one-time intracranial administration of AAV5-miHTT in the transgenic HD (tgHD) minipig model. We detected widespread dose-dependent distribution of AAV5-miHTT throughout the tgHD minipig brain that correlated with the engineered microRNA expression. Both human mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in all brain regions transduced by AAV5-miHTT. The combination of widespread vector distribution and extensive huntingtin lowering observed with AAV5-miHTT supports the translation of a huntingtin-lowering gene therapy for HD from preclinical studies into the clinic.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease is cost effective for heterozygous individuals with Huntington disease vs. unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis in a theoretical cohort of 3,851 couples, where one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. SETTING: N/A. PATIENTS/ANIMALS: None. INTERVENTION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing for couples attempting conception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for both parents in addition to secondary outcomes of procedure-related loss, spontaneous abortion, termination of pregnancy, and early/normal/late-onset Huntington disease. A willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is lower in cost and higher in effectiveness compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis among couples with one heterozygous Huntington disease individual, making it the dominant strategy. In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing was associated with 77 more QALYs and a cost savings of $46,394,268. All measured outcomes were lower in the IVF preimplantation genetic testing strategy, including 39 fewer procedure-related losses, 39 fewer spontaneous abortions, and 462 fewer terminations of pregnancy. Most notably, in our theoretical cohort of couples, IVF preimplantation genetic testing resulted in 1,079 fewer Huntington disease-affected offspring. Our results were robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSION: In vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic testing is a cost-effective conception strategy compared to unassisted conception with prenatal diagnosis when one individual is heterozygous for Huntington disease. Not only can morbidity and mortality incurred by Huntington disease be mitigated for the offspring with the use of IVF preimplantation genetic testing, but this study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of using IVF preimplantation genetic testing for those with Huntington disease.",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Synaptic damage has been proposed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of Huntington disease (HD), but in vivo evidence in humans is lacking. We performed a PET imaging study to assess synaptic damage and its clinical correlates in early HD in vivo. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, premanifest and early manifest (Shoulson-Fahn stage 1 and 2) HD mutation carriers and age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent clinical assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations and time-of-flight PET with 11C-UCB-J, a radioligand targeting the ubiquitous presynaptic terminal marker synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). We also performed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET in all participants because regional cerebral glucose consumption is thought to largely reflect synaptic activity. Volumes of interest were delineated on the basis of individual 3-dimensional T1 MRI. Standardized uptake value ratio-1 images were calculated for 11C-UCB-J with the centrum semiovale as reference region. 18F-FDG-PET activity was normalized to the pons. All PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. Volume of interest- and voxel-based analyses were performed. Correlations between clinical scores and 11C-UCB-J PET data were calculated. RESULTS: Eighteen HD mutation carriers (age 51.4 +- 11.6 years; 6 female; 7 premanifest, 11 early manifest) and 15 healthy controls (age 52.3 +- 3.5 years; 4 female) were included. In the HD group, significant loss of SV2A binding was found in putamen, caudate, pallidum, cerebellum, parietal, and temporal and frontal cortex, whereas reduced 18F-FDG uptake was restricted to caudate and putamen. In the premanifest subgroup, 11C-UCB-J and 18F-FDG-PET showed significant reductions in putamen and caudate only. In the total HD group, SV2A loss in the putamen correlated with motor impairment. DISCUSSION: Our data reveal loss of presynaptic terminal integrity in early HD, which begins in the striatum in the premanifest phase, spreads extensively to extrastriatal regions in the early manifest phase, and correlates with motor impairment. 11C-UCB-J PET is more sensitive than 18F-FDG-PET for detection of extrastriatal changes in early HD.

                    "text": "Factors Associated with the Place of Death in Huntington Disease: Analysis of Enroll-HD. Background: Most people prefer to die at home. Hospice is the standard in end-of-life care for people with Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects people in middle adulthood. Yet, we have little knowledge regarding the place of death for people with HD. Therefore, the current state of knowledge limits HD clinicians' ability to conduct high-quality goals of care conversations. Objectives: We sought to determine the factors associated with the place of death in people with HD. Design: We obtained cross-sectional data from Enroll-HD and included participants with a positive HD mutation of 36 or more CAG repeats. Results: Out of 16,120 participants in the Enroll-HD study, 536 were reported as deceased. The mean age at death was 60. The leading place of death was home (29%), followed by the hospital (23%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of dying at a skilled nursing facility was significantly lower for those partnered (aOR: 0.48, confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.26-0.86). The aOR for dying on hospice compared to home was increased in a person with some college and above (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.21-4.75). Conclusions: Our data further suggest that models that predict the place of death for serious illnesses do not appear to generalize to HD. The distribution in the places of death within HD was not uniform. Our findings may assist HD clinicians in communication during goals of care conversations.",

                    "text": "Preclinical motor manifestations of Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by multiple movement disorders, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive decline. As an insidious, progressive disorder, clinical phenoconversion in HD can be quite subtle and difficult to pinpoint. In light of this ambiguity, substantial interest has developed in HD research for biomarker identification, with the intent of establishing specific changes or \"stages\" of disease progression. Presumably, earlier stages of dysfunction offer greater chance for intervention or modification of disease mechanisms. As such, identifying disease processes as early as possible, in a prediagnostic period if possible, has been of paramount interest. Emerging evidence suggests motor dysfunction in HD long precedes clinical diagnosis, raising questions about the initiation of HD pathology and in turn our understanding of disease progression. This chapter summarizes advances in characterizing and understanding preclinical motor manifestations in HD, including changes in eye movements, gait, and fine motor performance. Development of the most sensitive and specific outcome measures for trial design is a rapidly evolving field in HD experimental therapeutics, with exciting implications for the study and treatment of this challenging disorder.",

Mapping the spatiotemporal progression of neuroanatomical change in Huntington's Disease (HD) is fundamental to the development of bio-measures for prognostication. Statistical shape analysis to measure the striatum has been performed in HD, however there have been a limited number of longitudinal studies. To address these limitations, we utilised the Spherical Harmonic Point Distribution Method (SPHARM-PDM) to generate point distribution models of the striatum in individuals, and used linear mixed models to test for localised shape change over time in pre-manifest HD (pre-HD), symp-HD (symp-HD) and control individuals. Longitudinal MRI scans from the IMAGE-HD study were used (baseline, 18 and 30 months). We found significant differences in the shape of the striatum between groups. Significant group-by-time interaction was observed for the putamen bilaterally, but not for caudate. A differential rate of shape change between groups over time was observed, with more significant deflation in the symp-HD group in comparison with the pre-HD and control groups. CAG repeats were correlated with bilateral striatal shape in pre-HD and symp-HD. Robust statistical analysis of the correlates of striatal shape change in HD has confirmed the suitability of striatal morphology as a potential biomarker correlated with CAG-repeat length, and potentially, an endophenotype.",

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical reliability of subjective sleep evaluation, based on sleep and psychometric questionnaires, by comparing the results with those obtained with laboratory-based video-polysomnography (V-PSG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty consecutive Huntington disease (HD) patients were enrolled. Subjective evaluation of sleep included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the sleep questionnaire for HD (HDQ), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Bologna questionnaire for sleepiness (BQ), the Berlin questionnaire, and the RBD questionnaire; the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group scale was administered to patients with positive screening. The psychometric evaluation included the Zung Anxiety Scale, the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory. All patients underwent V-PSG. RESULTS: In sleepiness evaluation, the Epworth score was above the cutoff in 6 subjects, and the BQ detected a \"high risk\" of sleepiness in 7 cases. The results were concordant in 24 and discordant in 5 cases. In the evaluation of sleep quality, the PSQI score was above the cutoff in 18 subjects. According to the HDQ, 10 subjects were poor sleepers. The results were concordant with the PSQI in 20 subjects. DISCUSSION: All comparisons between scale scores and PSG results showed poor or totally absent concordance between subjective and objective measures. SIGNIFICANCE: The subjective evaluation of sleep in HD patients shows a poor correlation with PSG results.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative autosomal dominant genetic condition. Predictive testing (PT) is available through a defined protocol for at-risk individuals. We analyzed the over-24-years evolution of practices regarding PT for HD in a single center. METHODS: We gathered data from the files of all individuals seeking PT for HD in Lyon, France, from 1994 to 2017. RESULTS: 448 out of 567 participants had exploitable data. Age at consultation dichotomized over 24 years toward an eightfold increase in individuals aged >55 (2/94 vs. 30/183; 2% to 16%; p < .0001) and twice as many individuals aged 18-20 (3/94 vs. 12/183; 3%-7%; p < .05). Motives for testing remained stable. The rate of withdrawal doubled over 24 years (9/94 vs. 38/183; 9%-21%; p < .02). Independently of the time period, less withdrawal was observed for married, accompanied, at 50% risk, and symptomatic individuals, and in those able to explicit the motives for testing or taking the test to inform their children. We also assessed the consistency between the presence of subtle symptoms compatible with HD found before the test by the team's neurologist, and the positivity of the molecular test. The concordance was 100% (17/17) for associated motor and cognitive signs, 87% (27/31) for isolated motor signs, and 70% (7/10) for isolated cognitive signs. Furthermore, 91% (20/22) of individuals who requested testing because they thought they had symptoms, were indeed found carriers. CONCLUSION: This over-24 years study underlines an increasing withdrawal from protocol and a dichotomization of participants' age. We also show a strong concordance between symptoms perceived by the neurologist or by the patient, and the subsequent positivity of the predictive molecular test.",

Laquinimod, an immunomodulatory agent under clinical development for Huntington disease (HD), has recently been shown to confer behavioural improvements that are coupled with prevention of atrophy of the white matter (WM)-rich corpus callosum (CC) in the YAC128 HD mice. However, the nature of the WM improvements is not known yet. Here we investigated the effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination deficits at the cellular, molecular and ultrastructural levels. We showed that laquinimod treatment improves motor learning and motor function deficits in YAC128 HD mice, and confirmed its antidepressant effect even at the lowest dose used. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time the beneficial effects of laquinimod on myelination in the posterior region of the CC where it reversed changes in myelin sheath thickness and rescued Mbp mRNA and protein deficits. Furthermore, the effect of laquinimod on myelin-related gene expression was not region-specific since the levels of the Mbp and Plp1 transcripts were also increased in the striatum. Also, we did not detect changes in immune cell densities or levels of inflammatory genes in 3-month-old YAC128 HD mice, and these were not altered with laquinimod treatment. Thus, the beneficial effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination abnormalities in YAC128 HD mice do not appear to be dependent on its immunomodulatory activity. Altogether, our findings describe the beneficial effects of laquinimod treatment on HD-related myelination abnormalities and highlight its therapeutic potential for the treatment of WM pathology in HD patients.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is associated with increased risk of suicide. OBJECTIVE: This study compares suicide ideation in HD to the general population, assesses factors associated with increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts, and compares clinician-rated to self-reported assessments of suicidal ideation. METHODS: We examined 496 participants with premanifest or manifest HD. Clinician-rated suicidal ideation was measured using the Problem Behaviors Assessment - short form. Self-reported ideation was measured using two items from the HDQLIFE Concern with Death and Dying item bank. Independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare the prevalence of suicidal thoughts between our HD sample and the U.S. POPULATION: Logistic regression analyses were used to determine characteristics associated with higher odds of clinically significant suicidal ideation. Kappa agreement coefficients were calculated to evaluate concurrence between clinician-rated and self-reported assessments. RESULTS: Our sample had a significantly higher occurrence of suicidal ideation (19.76%) and suicidal plans (2.1%) than the general population (p < 0.0001). Odds of clinically significant suicidal ideation were 6.8 times higher in females (p = 0.04) on the clinician measure, and Hispanic/Latinos had 10.9 times higher odds than non-Hispanics (p = 0.025) on the self-report measure. Clinician-rated assessment had fair agreement (k = 0.2-0.4) with self-reported assessments, except in early stage HD where there was no overlap in the identification of participants with clinically significant suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: Assessment for suicidal ideation and clinically significant suicidal thoughts in HD with a multimodal approach that includes clinician-rated and self-report measures is critical at all stages of the disease.",

BACKGROUND: The study of emotion recognition could be crucial for detecting alterations in certain cognitive areas or as an early sign of neurological disorders. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the study is to characterize research development on emotion recognition, identifying the intellectual structure that supports this area of knowledge, and the main lines of research attracting investigators' interest. METHODS: We identified publications on emotion recognition and dementia included in the Web of Science Core Collection, analyzing the scientific output and main disciplines involved in generating knowledge in the area. A co-citation analysis and an analysis of the bibliographic coupling between the retrieved documents elucidated the thematic orientations of the research and the reference works that constitute the foundation for development in the field. RESULTS: A total of 345 documents, with 24,282 bibliographic references between them, were included. This is an emerging research area, attracting the interest of investigators in Neurosciences, Psychology, Clinical Neurology, and Psychiatry, among other disciplines. Four prominent topic areas were identified, linked to frontotemporal dementia, autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's and Huntington disease. Many recent papers focus on the detection of mild cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Impaired emotion recognition may be a key sign facilitating the diagnosis and early treatment of different neurodegenerative diseases as well as for triggering the necessary provision of social and family support, explaining the growing research interest in this area.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for two Chinese pedigrees affected with Huntington disease and provide prenatal diagnosis for them. METHODS: Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the probands. PCR and capillary gel electrophoresis were used to determine the number of CAG repeats in their IT15 gene. Pre-symptomatic testing was offered to their children and relatives, and prenatal diagnosis was provided to three pregnant women from the two pedigrees. RESULTS: The two probands, in addition with three asymptomatic members, were found to have a (CAG)n repeat number greater than 40. Upon prenatal diagnosis, the numbers of CAG repeats in two fetuses from pedigree 1 were determined as (16, 19) and (18, 19), both were within the normal range. A fetus from pedigree 2 was found to have a CAG repeat number of (15, 41), which exceeded the normal range. CONCLUSION: Genetic testing can facilitate the diagnosis of Huntington disease and avoid further birth of affected children.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for two Chinese pedigrees affected with Huntington disease and provide prenatal diagnosis for them. METHODS: Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the probands. PCR and capillary gel electrophoresis were used to determine the number of CAG repeats in their IT15 gene. Pre-symptomatic testing was offered to their children and relatives, and prenatal diagnosis was provided to three pregnant women from the two pedigrees. RESULTS: The two probands, in addition with three asymptomatic members, were found to have a (CAG)n repeat number greater than 40. Upon prenatal diagnosis, the numbers of CAG repeats in two fetuses from pedigree 1 were determined as (16, 19) and (18, 19), both were within the normal range. A fetus from pedigree 2 was found to have a CAG repeat number of (15, 41), which exceeded the normal range.

Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene that encodes the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). Visualization and quantification of cerebral mHTT will provide a proxy for target engagement and a means to evaluate therapeutic interventions aimed at lowering mHTT in the brain. Here, we validated the novel radioligand 11C-labeled 6-(5-((5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one (11C-CHDI-180R) using PET imaging to quantify cerebral mHTT aggregates in a macaque model of HD. Methods: Rhesus macaques received MRI-guided intrastriatal delivery of a mixture of AAV2 and AAV2.retro viral vectors expressing an HTT fragment bearing 85 CAG repeats (85Q, n = 5), a control HTT fragment bearing 10 CAG repeats (10Q, n = 4), or vector diluent only (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 5). Thirty months after surgery, 90-min dynamic PET/CT imaging was used to investigate 11C-CHDI-180R brain kinetics, along with serial blood sampling to measure input function and stability of the radioligand. The total volume of distribution was calculated using a 2-tissue-compartment model as well as Logan graphical analysis for regional quantification. Immunostaining for mHTT was performed to corroborate the in vivo findings. Results: 11C-CHDI-180R displayed good metabolic stability (51.4% +- 4.0% parent in plasma at 60 min after injection). Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid uptake and reversible binding, which were described by a 2-tissue-compartment model. Logan graphical analysis was associated with the 2-tissue-compartment model (r 2 = 0.96, P < 0.0001) and used to generate parametric volume of distribution maps. Compared with controls, animals administered the 85Q fragment exhibited significantly increased 11C-CHDI-180R binding in several cortical and subcortical brain regions (group effect, P < 0.0001). No difference in 11C-CHDI-180R binding was observed between buffer and 10Q animals. The presence of mHTT aggregates in the 85Q animals was confirmed histologically. Conclusion: We validated 11C-CHDI-180R as a radioligand to visualize and quantify mHTT aggregated species in a HD macaque model. These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.",

These findings corroborate our previous work in rodent HD models and show that 11C-CHDI-180R is a promising tool to assess the mHTT aggregate load and the efficacy of therapeutic strategies.",

Huntington Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the exon1 of huntingtin gene (HTT). The mutant HTT affects the transcriptional profile of neurons by disrupting the activities of transcriptional machinery and alters expression of many genes. In this study, we identified dysregulated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in medium spiny neurons of 4-week-old HD model mouse. Also, we observed the intracellular localizations of Abhd11os and Neat1 ncRNAs by ViewRNA in situ hybridization, which could provide more precise detection, suggesting that it is a useful method to investigate the expression changes of genes with low expression levels.",

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the retinal and choriocapillaris vascular networks in macular region and the central choroidal thickness (CCT) in patients affected by Huntington disease (HD), using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain OCT (EDI SD-OCT). METHODS: We assessed the vessel density (VD) in superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC) using OCTA, while CCT was measured by EDI SD-OCT. RESULTS: Sixteen HD patients (32 eyes) and thirteen healthy controls (26 eyes) were enrolled in this prospective study. No significant difference in retinal and choriocapillaris VD was found between HD patients and controls while CCT turned to be thinner in patients respect to controls. There were no significant relationships between OCTA findings and neurological parameters. CONCLUSION: The changes in choroidal structure provide useful information regarding the possible neurovascular involvement in the physiopathology of HD. Choroidal vascular network could be a useful parameter to evaluate the vascular impairment that occurs in this neurodegenerative disease.",

                    "text": "Optical coherence tomography angiography findings in Huntington's disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the retinal and choriocapillaris vascular networks in macular region and the central choroidal thickness (CCT) in patients affected by Huntington disease (HD), using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain OCT (EDI SD-OCT). METHODS: We assessed the vessel density (VD) in superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC) using OCTA, while CCT was measured by EDI SD-OCT. RESULTS: Sixteen HD patients (32 eyes) and thirteen healthy controls (26 eyes) were enrolled in this prospective study. No significant difference in retinal and choriocapillaris VD was found between HD patients and controls while CCT turned to be thinner in patients respect to controls. There were no significant relationships between OCTA findings and neurological parameters. CONCLUSION: The changes in choroidal structure provide useful information regarding the possible neurovascular involvement in the physiopathology of HD. Choroidal vascular network could be a useful parameter to evaluate the vascular impairment that occurs in this neurodegenerative disease.",

BACKGROUND: With the advent of smart sensing technology, mobile and wearable devices can provide continuous and objective monitoring and assessment of motor function outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the existing scientific literature on wearable and mobile technologies that are being used or tested for assessing motor functions in mobility-impaired and healthy adults and to evaluate the degree to which these devices provide clinically valid measures of motor function in these populations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted by searching Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL (January 1, 2015, to June 24, 2020), the United States and European Union clinical trial registries, and the United States Food and Drug Administration website using predefined study selection criteria. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 91 publications representing 87 unique studies were included. The most represented clinical conditions were Parkinson disease (n=51 studies), followed by stroke (n=5), Huntington disease (n=5), and multiple sclerosis (n=2). A total of 42 motion-detecting devices were identified, and the majority (n=27, 64%) were created for the purpose of health care-related data collection, although approximately 25% were personal electronic devices (eg, smartphones and watches) and 11% were entertainment consoles (eg, Microsoft Kinect or Xbox and Nintendo Wii). The primary motion outcomes were related to gait (n=30), gross motor movements (n=25), and fine motor movements (n=23). As a group, sensor-derived motion data showed a mean sensitivity of 0.83 (SD 7.27), a mean specificity of 0.84 (SD 15.40), a mean accuracy of 0.90 (SD 5.87) in discriminating between diseased individuals and healthy controls, and a mean Pearson r validity coefficient of 0.52 (SD 0.22) relative to clinical measures. We did not find significant differences in the degree of validity between in-laboratory and at-home sensor-based assessments nor between device class (ie, health care-related device, personal electronic devices, and entertainment consoles). CONCLUSIONS: Sensor-derived motion data can be leveraged to classify and quantify disease status for a variety of neurological conditions. However, most of the recent research on digital clinical measures is derived from proof-of-concept studies with considerable variation in methodological approaches, and much of the reviewed literature has focused on clinical validation, with less than one-quarter of the studies performing analytical validation. Overall, future research is crucially needed to further consolidate that sensor-derived motion data may lead to the development of robust and transformative digital measurements intended to predict, diagnose, and quantify neurological disease state and its longitudinal change.",

OBJECTIVE: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction has been described in adults with motor-manifest Huntington's Disease (HD) or those who are near their predicted motor onset. It is unclear if ANS dysfunction is present years prior to the onset of motor symptoms of HD. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we compared crude markers of ANS function between children with the gene-expansion that causes HD (GE group) who were decades from their predicted motor onset and gene-non-expanded children (GNE group). METHODS: We included participants from the Kids-HD study who were <18 years old. Linear mixed effects regression models were constructed that controlled for sex, age, and BMI, and included a random effect per participant and per family. We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84) and GNE (n = 238) groups. We then grouped participants from the GE group based on their predicted years to onset (YTO) and compared their vital signs to the GNE group. RESULTS: The GE group had higher rHR (  = 3.83, p = 0.0064), SBP (  = 2.38, p = 0.032), and CBT (  = 0.16, t = 2.92, p = 0.007). The mean rHR and CBT became significantly elevated compared to the GNE group in participants who had 15-25 YTO and those who had <15 YTO. The mean SBP of participants who had 25-35 YTO was significantly elevated compared to the GNE group.

The mean rHR and CBT became significantly elevated compared to the GNE group in participants who had 15-25 YTO and those who had <15 YTO. The mean SBP of participants who had 25-35 YTO was significantly elevated compared to the GNE group. CONCLUSION: ANS dysfunction in HD seems to occur approximately 20 years prior to the predicted onset of motor symptoms of HD.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments (including chorea), along with behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Tetrabenazine was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for chorea related to HD. OBJECTIVE: To examine pharmacologic treatment patterns among patients using tetrabenazine, including reasons for treatment initiation, non-initiation, dose adjustments, and discontinuation, and to quantify the burden of chorea based on healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: In this retrospective patient chart review, neurologists were recruited from the Medefield (http://www.medefield.com) opt-in panel, and selected <=5 medical charts based on the criteria provided and abstracted data on demographics, disease history, healthcare resource use, and treatment patterns. RESULTS: 138 neurologists participated and 512 HD patient charts were reviewed. Among these patients, 26.4% did not initiate tetrabenazine. Most HD patients (66.5%) received a tetrabenazine dose <=50 mg. The most common reasons for stopping upward titration were optimal chorea control (55.5%), intolerability of higher doses (31.2%), and reaching the maximum recommended dosage despite suboptimal chorea control (11.4%). Chorea severity and non-persistence to tetrabenazine were associated with increased emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Although tetrabenazine was the sole FDA-approved treatment for HD chorea until April 2017, more than one-quarter of respondents never initiated therapy. Tetrabenazine dosing was lower than predicted, and many patients experienced adverse symptoms of intolerability at high doses. New safer and more tolerable treatment options, such as deutetrabenazine, may improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare resource use.",

Particularly concerning are those testing candidates who are highly anxious or depressed at the time of presentation. Balancing the ethical principles of autonomy with beneficence and nonmaleficence requires careful exploration of the motivations behind testing to ensure that all are fully informed of alternatives, and opportunities for further support are offered when needed.

Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient but excessive levels induce neurotoxic effects. Increasing evidence suggests a deficit of bioavailable Mn in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and cognitive disturbances. Previous studies have shown rescue of some molecular HD phenotypes by acute Mn exposure. This study simultaneously examined the potential for chronic Mn exposure to attenuate HD behavioral phenotypes, and for the HD genotype to offer protection against detrimental effects of chronic Mn exposure. In two independent studies a chronic Mn exposure paradigm was implemented in the YAC128 mouse model of HD and behavior was assessed at several timepoints. Study 1 exposed WT and YAC128 mice to twice weekly subcutaneous injections of 0, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 32 weeks of age. A promising protective effect against motor coordination decline in 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate-treated YAC128 mice was detected. Study 2 thus exposed WT and YAC128 mice to either 0 or 5 mg/kg MnCl[2] tetrahydrate from 12 to 52 weeks of age (with a partial randomized treatment crossover at 31 weeks). The same protective effect was not observed under these conditions at higher statistical power. We report subtle toxicological changes in exploratory behavior and total activity induced by chronic Mn exposure in WT mice only, despite similar total increases in brain Mn in WT and YAC128 mice. Further, chronic Mn treatment resulted in a 10-12 % decrease in striatal NeuN positive cell density in WT mice but not YAC128 mice, despite vehicle cell counts already being reduced compared to WT mice as expected for the HD genotype. The subtle changes observed in specific outcome measures, but not others, following long-term low-level Mn exposure in WT mice delineate the neurobehavioral and neuropathological effects at the threshold of chronic Mn toxicity. We conclude that these chronic low-dose Mn exposures do not significantly rescue behavioral HD phenotypes, but YAC2128 mice are protected against the subtle Mn-induced behavioral changes and decreased striatal neuron density observed in Mn-exposed WT mice.",

BACKGROUND: European studies identified the C9orf72 repeat expansion as the most frequent genetic alteration in patients with Huntington disease (HD)-like phenotypes but negative HD genetic testing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate C9orf72 repeat expansion frequency in individuals tested for HD in a North American tertiary referral laboratory. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three cases (115 positive and 258 negative for HD) were evaluated by genotyping PCR, with follow-up Southern blot and 5' repeat methylation status assessment by combined repeat-primed and methylation-specific PCR in a subset. RESULTS: Three cases (all HD-negative) tested positive: 2 had > 2,000 repeats and were methylated, 1 had 80-100 repeats and was unmethylated. Two cases (1 HD-positive and 1 HD-negative) had intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) and were unmethylated. The remaining 368 cases were negative (< 20 repeats). C9orf72 repeat expansion was absent in patients with HD and was identified in a small subset (1.2%) of patients with negative HD genetic testing. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C9orf72 repeat expansion does not coexist with HTT repeat expansion and that C9orf72 repeat expansion testing is unnecessary for patients with HD. In addition, C9orf72 evaluation may be considered for individuals negative for HD genetic testing.

METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three cases (115 positive and 258 negative for HD) were evaluated by genotyping PCR, with follow-up Southern blot and 5' repeat methylation status assessment by combined repeat-primed and methylation-specific PCR in a subset. RESULTS: Three cases (all HD-negative) tested positive: 2 had > 2,000 repeats and were methylated, 1 had 80-100 repeats and was unmethylated. Two cases (1 HD-positive and 1 HD-negative) had intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) and were unmethylated. The remaining 368 cases were negative (< 20 repeats). C9orf72 repeat expansion was absent in patients with HD and was identified in a small subset (1.2%) of patients with negative HD genetic testing. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C9orf72 repeat expansion does not coexist with HTT repeat expansion and that C9orf72 repeat expansion testing is unnecessary for patients with HD. In addition, C9orf72 evaluation may be considered for individuals negative for HD genetic testing. Similar to in previous studies, methylation of C9orf72 repeat expansion was limited to large expansions.",

                    "text": "Imaging of Synaptic Density in Neurodegenerative Disorders. PET technology has produced many radiopharmaceuticals that target specific brain proteins and other measures of brain function. Recently, a new approach has emerged to image synaptic density by targeting the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), an integral glycoprotein in the membrane of synaptic vesicles and widely distributed throughout the brain. Multiple SV2A ligands have been developed and translated to human use. The most successful of these to date is 11C-UCB-J, because of its high uptake, moderate metabolism, and effective quantification with a 1-tissue-compartment model. Further, since SV2A is the target of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, human blocking studies have characterized specific binding and potential reference regions. Regional brain SV2A levels were shown to correlate with those of synaptophysin, another commonly used marker of synaptic density, providing the basis for SV2A PET imaging to have broad utility across neuropathologic diseases. In this review, we highlight the development of SV2A tracers and the evaluation of quantification methods, including compartment modeling and simple tissue ratios. Mouse and rat models of neurodegenerative diseases have been studied with small-animal PET, providing validation by comparison to direct tissue measures. Next, we review human PET imaging results in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Studies on Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease have progressed most rapidly at multiple centers, with generally consistent results of patterns of SV2A or synaptic loss. In Alzheimer disease, the synaptic loss patterns differ from those of amyloid, tau, and 18F-FDG, although intertracer and interregional correlations have been found. Smaller studies have been reported in other disorders, including Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In conclusion, PET imaging of SV2A has rapidly developed, and qualified radioligands are available. PET studies on humans indicate that SV2A loss might be specific to disease-associated brain regions and consistent with synaptic density loss. The recent availability of new 18F tracers, 18F-SynVesT-1 and 18F-SynVesT-2, will substantially broaden the application of SV2A PET. Future studies are needed in larger patient cohorts to establish the clinical value of SV2A PET and its potential for diagnosis and progression monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as efficacy assessment of disease-modifying therapies.",

                    "text": "Imaging of Synaptic Density in Neurodegenerative Disorders. PET technology has produced many radiopharmaceuticals that target specific brain proteins and other measures of brain function. Recently, a new approach has emerged to image synaptic density by targeting the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), an integral glycoprotein in the membrane of synaptic vesicles and widely distributed throughout the brain. Multiple SV2A ligands have been developed and translated to human use. The most successful of these to date is 11C-UCB-J, because of its high uptake, moderate metabolism, and effective quantification with a 1-tissue-compartment model. Further, since SV2A is the target of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, human blocking studies have characterized specific binding and potential reference regions. Regional brain SV2A levels were shown to correlate with those of synaptophysin, another commonly used marker of synaptic density, providing the basis for SV2A PET imaging to have broad utility across neuropathologic diseases. In this review, we highlight the development of SV2A tracers and the evaluation of quantification methods, including compartment modeling and simple tissue ratios. Mouse and rat models of neurodegenerative diseases have been studied with small-animal PET, providing validation by comparison to direct tissue measures. Next, we review human PET imaging results in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Studies on Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease have progressed most rapidly at multiple centers, with generally consistent results of patterns of SV2A or synaptic loss. In Alzheimer disease, the synaptic loss patterns differ from those of amyloid, tau, and 18F-FDG, although intertracer and interregional correlations have been found. Smaller studies have been reported in other disorders, including Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In conclusion, PET imaging of SV2A has rapidly developed, and qualified radioligands are available. PET studies on humans indicate that SV2A loss might be specific to disease-associated brain regions and consistent with synaptic density loss. The recent availability of new 18F tracers, 18F-SynVesT-1 and 18F-SynVesT-2, will substantially broaden the application of SV2A PET. Future studies are needed in larger patient cohorts to establish the clinical value of SV2A PET and its potential for diagnosis and progression monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as efficacy assessment of disease-modifying therapies.",

Synaptic structure and function are compromised prior to cell death and symptom onset in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In Huntington disease (HD), a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein results in a presymptomatic stage that typically spans multiple decades and is followed by striking degeneration of striatal tissue and the progression of debilitating motor symptoms. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that the HD presymptomatic window is associated with injurious effects to striatal synapses, many of which appear to be prerequisites to subsequent cell death. While the striatum is the most vulnerable region in the HD brain, it is widely recognized that HD is a brain-wide disease, affecting numerous extrastriatal regions that contribute to debilitating non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction. Currently, we have a poor understanding of the synaptic integrity, or lack thereof, in extrastriatal regions in the presymptomatic HD brain. If early therapeutic intervention seeks to maintain healthy synaptic function, it is important to understand early HD-associated synaptopathy at a brain-wide, rather than striatal-exclusive, level. Here, we focused on the hippocampus as this structure is generally thought to be affected only in manifest HD despite the subtle cognitive deficits known to emerge in prodromal HD. We used super-resolution microscopy and multi-electrode array electrophysiology as sensitive measures of excitatory synapse structure and function, respectively, in the hippocampus of presymptomatic heterozygous HD mice (Q175FDN model). We found clear evidence for enhanced AMPA receptor subunit clustering and hyperexcitability well before the onset of a detectable HD-like behavioral phenotype. In addition, activity-dependent re-organization of synaptic protein nanostructure, and functional measures of synaptic plasticity were impaired in presymptomatic HD mice. These data demonstrate that synaptic abnormalities in the presymptomatic HD brain are not exclusive to the striatum, and highlight the need to better understand the region-dependent complexities of early synaptopathy in the HD brain.",

RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death.

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Because the end result of Huntington disease is death due to Huntington disease-related causes, there is a need for better understanding and caring for individuals at their end of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop a new measure to evaluate end of life planning. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative focus groups, solicited expert input, and completed a literature review to develop a 16-item measure to evaluate important aspects of end of life planning for Huntington disease. Item response theory and differential item functioning analyses were utilized to examine the psychometric properties of items; exploratory factor analysis was used to establish meaningful subscales. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 508 individuals with pre-manifest or manifest Huntington disease. RESULTS: Item response theory supported the retention of all 16 items on the huntington disease quality of life (\"HDQLIFE\") end of life planning measure. Exploratory factor analysis supported a four-factor structure: legal planning, financial planning, preferences for hospice care, and preferences for conditions (locations, surroundings, etc.) at the time of death. Although a handful of items exhibited some evidence of differential item functioning, these items were retained due to their relevant clinical content. The final 16-item scale includes an overall total score and four subscale scores that reflect the different end of life planning constructs. CONCLUSIONS: The 16-item HDQLIFE end of life planning measure demonstrates adequate psychometric properties; it may be a useful tool for clinicians to clarify patients' preferences about end of life care.",

BACKGROUND: Cell replacement therapy (CRT) for Huntington disease (HD) requires a source of striatal (STR) progenitors capable of restoring the function lost due to STR degeneration. Authentic STR progenitors can be collected from the fetal putative striatum, or whole ganglionic eminence (WGE), but these tissues remain impractical for widespread clinical application, and alternative donor sources are required. Here we begin exploring the possibility that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from WGE may retain an epigenetic memory of their tissue of origin, which could enhance their ability to differentiate into STR cells. RESULTS: We generate four iPSC lines from human WGE (hWGE) and establish that they have a capacity similar to human embryonic stem cells with regard to their ability to differentiate toward an STR phenotype, as measured by expression and demethylation of key STR genes, while maintaining an overall different methylome. Finally, we demonstrate that these STR-differentiated hWGE iPSCs share characteristics with hWGE (i.e., authentic STR tissues) both in vitro and following transplantation into an HD model. Overall, iPSCs derived from human WGE show promise as a donor source for CRT for HD.",

Neurological disorders are one of the major threat for health care system as they put enormous socioeconomic burden. All aged populations are susceptible to one or other neurological problems with symptoms of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. At present, available pharmacotherapeutics are insufficient to treat these diseased conditions and in most cases, they provide only palliative effect. It was also found that the molecular etiology of neurological disorders is directly linked with the alteration in genetic makeup, which can be inherited or triggered by the injury, environmental toxins and by some existing disease. Therefore, to take care of this situation, gene therapy has emerged as an advanced modality that claims to permanently cure the disease by deletion, silencing or edition of faulty genes and by insertion of healthier genes. In this modality, vectors (viral and non-viral) are used to deliver targeted gene into a specific region of the brain via various routes. At present, gene therapy has shown positive outcomes in complex neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Multiple sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in lysosomal storage disease. However, there are some limitations such as immunogenic reactions non-specificity of viral vectors and a lack of effective biomarkers to understand the efficacy of therapy. Considerable progress has been made to improve vector design, gene selection and targeted delivery. This review article deals with the current status of gene therapy in neurological disorders along with its clinical relevance, challenges and future prospective.",

White matter (WM) alterations have been observed in Huntington disease (HD) but their role in the disease-pathophysiology remains unknown. We assessed WM changes in premanifest HD by exploiting ultra-strong-gradient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This allowed to separately quantify magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and hindered and restricted diffusion-weighted signal fractions, and assess how they drove WM microstructure differences between patients and controls. We used tractometry to investigate region-specific alterations across callosal segments with well-characterized early- and late-myelinating axon populations, while brain-wise differences were explored with tract-based cluster analysis (TBCA). Behavioral measures were included to explore disease-associated brain-function relationships. We detected lower MTR in patients' callosal rostrum (tractometry: p = .03; TBCA: p = .03), but higher MTR in their splenium (tractometry: p = .02). Importantly, patients' mutation-size and MTR were positively correlated (all p-values < .01), indicating that MTR alterations may directly result from the mutation.

White matter (WM) alterations have been observed in Huntington disease (HD) but their role in the disease-pathophysiology remains unknown. We assessed WM changes in premanifest HD by exploiting ultra-strong-gradient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This allowed to separately quantify magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and hindered and restricted diffusion-weighted signal fractions, and assess how they drove WM microstructure differences between patients and controls. We used tractometry to investigate region-specific alterations across callosal segments with well-characterized early- and late-myelinating axon populations, while brain-wise differences were explored with tract-based cluster analysis (TBCA). Behavioral measures were included to explore disease-associated brain-function relationships. We detected lower MTR in patients' callosal rostrum (tractometry: p = .03; TBCA: p = .03), but higher MTR in their splenium (tractometry: p = .02). Importantly, patients' mutation-size and MTR were positively correlated (all p-values < .01), indicating that MTR alterations may directly result from the mutation. Further, MTR was higher in younger, but lower in older patients relative to controls (p = .003), suggesting that MTR increases are detrimental later in the disease.

BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication. We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease. RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1 out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100). They were less in favour of gamete donation (48.3+-39.8 out of 100) or pregnancy abstention (43.3+-40.3 out of 100).

                    "text": "Reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication in neurogenetic diseases with different self-estimated severities. BACKGROUND: Low uptake of presymptomatic testing and medically assisted reproduction in families impacted by neurogenetic diseases prompted us to investigate how reproductive options are considered and whether there is a relationship with perceived severity of the disease. We hypothesised that self-estimated severity would influence opinion on reproductive options and that prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis would be a motivation to inform relatives about their risk. METHODS: We invited people impacted by neurogenetic diseases to evaluate the severity of their familial disease using analogic visual scales and to answer questionnaires about reproductive choices and intrafamilial communication. We compared answers between diseases and with the perceived severity of each disease. RESULTS: We analysed 562 questionnaires. Participants were impacted by Huntington disease (n=307), spinocerebellar ataxias (n=114), Steinert myotonic dystrophy (n=82) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (n=59). Self-estimated severity differed between pathologies (p<0.0001). Overall, participants considered prenatal diagnosis (78.0+-34.4 out of 100) and preimplantation diagnosis (75.2+-36.1 out of 100) justified more than termination of pregnancy (68.6+-38.5 out of 100). They were less in favour of gamete donation (48.3+-39.8 out of 100) or pregnancy abstention (43.3+-40.3 out of 100). The greater the perceived severity of the disease, the more reproductive options were considered justified, except for gamete donation. Prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis was a motivation to inform relatives for only 55.3% of participants (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Self-estimated severity minimally impacts opinions towards reproductive options. Medically assisted reproduction procedures are rarely sought and do not motivate familial communication.",

Libido can affect the semen quality of male, and the sperm motility in semen quality parameters is a reliable index to evaluate the fertility of male. In drakes, the sperm motility is gradually acquired in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. However, the relationship between libido and sperm motility in drakes has not been reported and the mechanisms of testis, epididymis, and spermaduct regulating the sperm motility of drakes are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the semen quality of drakes with libido level 4 (LL4) and libido level 5 (LL5), and tried to identify the mechanisms regulating the sperm motility in drakes by performing RNA-seq in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct. Phenotypically, the sperm motility of drakes (P < 0.01), weight of testis (P < 0.05), and organ index of epididymis (P < 0.05) in the LL5 group were significantly better than those in LL4 group. Moreover, compared with the LL4 group, the ductal square of seminiferous tubule (ST) in testis was significantly bigger in the LL5 group (P < 0.05), and the seminiferous epithelial thickness (P < 0.01) of ST in testis and lumenal diameter (P < 0.05) of ductuli conjugentes/dutus epididymidis in epididymis were significantly longer in the LL5 group. In transcriptional regulation, in addition to KEGG pathways related to metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, lots of KEGG pathways associated with immunity, proliferation, and signaling were also significantly enriched in testis, epididymis, and spermaduct, respectively. Furthermore, through the integrated analysis of coexpression network and protein-protein interaction network, 3 genes (including COL11A1, COL14A1, and C3AR1) involved in protein digestion and absorption pathway and Staphylococcus aureus infection pathway were identified in testis, 2 genes (including BUB1B and ESPL1) involved in cell cycle pathway were identified in epididymis, and 13 genes (including DNAH1, DNAH3, DNAH7, DNAH10, DNAH12, DNAI1, DNAI2, DNALI1, NTF3, ITGA1, TLR2, RELN, and PAK1) involved in Huntington disease pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were identified in spermaduct.

The thoroughly investigated causes include oxidative stress, inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular neuronal protein aggregation. Withania somnifera has been used for more than 2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha, neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The current review substantially deciphered the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders. However, future studies are further required better to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their neuroprotective nature.",

                    "text": "Withania somnifera in Neurological Disorders: Ethnopharmacological Evidence, Mechanism of Action and its Progress in Delivery Systems. BACKGROUND: The underlying cause of major neurodegenerative disorders remains a healthcare mystery. The thoroughly investigated causes include oxidative stress, inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial dysfunction, and irregular neuronal protein aggregation. Withania somnifera has been used for more than 2500 years as a useful medicinal plant to improve disease defense, prevent aging, rejuvenate the body in a vulnerable situation, and generate a feeling of mental well-being. However, a persuasive paper emphasizing its neuroprotective nature is missing. OBJECTIVE: In the current review, we have delineated the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders and its progress in delivery systems. METHODS: The database used in the retrieval of data were PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and SciFinder. The keywords used were W. somnifera, Ashwagandha, neuroprotective activities, etc. The principal source of the data retrieval includes research articles, review papers, and short communications from reputed publishers, including the New England Journal of Medicine, Elsevier, Nature, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. RESULTS: After an extensive literature review, we found that W. somnifera mitigates various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, tardive dyskinesia, stroke, and anxiety. Furthermore, natural compounds in nano sizes range possess better neuroprotective activity. Consequently, polymeric nanomicelles, nanoparticles, and nanofibers of natural products are used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. CONCLUSION: The current review substantially deciphered the protective role of W. somnifera against various neurological disorders. However, future studies are further required better to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their neuroprotective nature.",

                    "text": "Recent advances in the therapeutic development for Huntington disease. INTRODUCTION: Huntington disease (HD) is a rare genetic neurodegenerative condition. The availability of a genetic diagnosis makes HD an attractive model for the development of therapies that can delay or, at best, halt the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are the only treatment options with a formal indication (chorea) for this patient population. METHODS: Literature review on HD and clinical trials using the medical databases Pubmed, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries. Recent clinical trials conducted with the goal of disease-modification or new symptomatic treatment indications were included. Non-pharmacological interventions were excluded. RESULTS: Therapeutic approaches aiming at disease-modification include huntingtin-lowering strategies, the modulation of huntingtin homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are of particular interest by targeting the mRNA of the huntingtin (HTT) gene at the core of HD biology. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) are the only huntingtin-lowering strategies in clinical development. The initial results suggest that the first non-allele specific ASO was safe and associated with a reduction in the levels of mutated huntingtin protein (mHTT).

Assays to measure CSF mHTT and brain nuclear imaging specific to HD can support the rational development of these therapies.

Artificial microRNAs targeting HTT transcripts for degradation have shown preclinical promise and will soon enter human clinical trials. Here, we examine the tolerability and efficacy of non-selective HTT lowering with an AAV5 encoded miRNA targeting human HTT (AAV5-miHTT) in the humanized Hu128/21 mouse model of HD. We show that intrastriatal administration of AAV5-miHTT results in potent and sustained HTT suppression for at least 7 months post-injection. Importantly, non-selective suppression of huntingtin was generally tolerated, however high dose AAV5-miHTT did induce astrogliosis. We observed an improvement of select behavioural and modest neuropathological HD-like phenotypes in Hu128/21 mice, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of miRNA-mediated non-selective HTT lowering. Finally, we also observed that potent reduction of wild type HTT (wtHTT) in Hu21 control mice was tolerated up to 7 months post-injection but may induce impairment of motor coordination and striatal atrophy.

Finally, we also observed that potent reduction of wild type HTT (wtHTT) in Hu21 control mice was tolerated up to 7 months post-injection but may induce impairment of motor coordination and striatal atrophy. Taken together, our data suggests that in the context of HD, the therapeutic benefits of mHTT reduction may outweigh the potentially detrimental effects of wtHTT loss following non-selective HTT lowering.",

                    "text": "Potent and sustained huntingtin lowering via AAV5 encoding miRNA preserves striatal volume and cognitive function in a humanized mouse model of Huntington disease. Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a pathogenic expansion of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. There are no disease-modifying therapies for HD. Artificial microRNAs targeting HTT transcripts for degradation have shown preclinical promise and will soon enter human clinical trials. Here, we examine the tolerability and efficacy of non-selective HTT lowering with an AAV5 encoded miRNA targeting human HTT (AAV5-miHTT) in the humanized Hu128/21 mouse model of HD. We show that intrastriatal administration of AAV5-miHTT results in potent and sustained HTT suppression for at least 7 months post-injection. Importantly, non-selective suppression of huntingtin was generally tolerated, however high dose AAV5-miHTT did induce astrogliosis. We observed an improvement of select behavioural and modest neuropathological HD-like phenotypes in Hu128/21 mice, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of miRNA-mediated non-selective HTT lowering.

BACKGROUND: Gray matter (GM) atrophy in the striatum and across the brain is a consistently reported feature of the Huntington Disease (HD) prodrome. More recently, widespread prodromal white matter (WM) degradation has also been detected. However, longitudinal WM studies are limited and conflicting, and most analyses comparing WM and clinical functioning have also been cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: We simultaneously assessed changes in WM and cognitive and motor functioning at various prodromal HD stages. METHODS: Data from 1,336 (1,047 prodromal, 289 control) PREDICT-HD participants were analyzed (3,700 sessions). MRI images were used to create GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid probability maps. Using source-based morphometry, independent component analysis was applied to WM probability maps to extract covarying spatial patterns and their subject profiles. WM profiles were analyzed in two sets of linear mixed model (LMM) analyses: one to compare WM profiles across groups cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and one to concurrently compare WM profiles and clinical variables cross-sectionally and longitudinally within each group. RESULTS: Findings illustrate widespread prodromal changes in GM-adjacent-WM, with premotor, supplementary motor, middle frontal and striatal changes early in the prodrome that subsequently extend sub-gyrally with progression. Motor functioning agreed most with WM until the near-onset prodromal stage, when Stroop interference was the best WM indicator. Across groups, Trail-Making Test part A outperformed other cognitive variables in its similarity to WM, particularly cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that distinct regions coincide with cognitive compared to motor functioning. Furthermore, at different prodromal stages, distinct regions appear to align best with clinical functioning.

RESULTS: Findings illustrate widespread prodromal changes in GM-adjacent-WM, with premotor, supplementary motor, middle frontal and striatal changes early in the prodrome that subsequently extend sub-gyrally with progression. Motor functioning agreed most with WM until the near-onset prodromal stage, when Stroop interference was the best WM indicator. Across groups, Trail-Making Test part A outperformed other cognitive variables in its similarity to WM, particularly cross-sectionally. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that distinct regions coincide with cognitive compared to motor functioning. Furthermore, at different prodromal stages, distinct regions appear to align best with clinical functioning. Thus, the informativeness of clinical measures may vary according to the type of data available (cross-sectional or longitudinal) as well as age and CAG-number.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological disorder that causes severe motor symptoms that adversely impact health-related quality of life. Patient-reported physical function outcome measures in HD have shown cross-sectional evidence of validity, but responsiveness has not yet been assessed. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the responsiveness of the Huntington Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (HDQLIFE) and the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) physical function measures in persons with HD. METHODS: A total of 347 participants completed baseline and at least 1 follow-up (12-month and 24-month) measure (HDQLIFE Chorea, HDQLIFE Swallowing Difficulties, HDQLIFE Speech Difficulties, Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function, and/or Neuro-QoL Lower Extremity Function). Of the participants that completed the baseline assessment, 338 (90.9%) completed the 12-month assessment, and 293 (78.8%) completed the 24-month assessment. Standardized response means and general linear models evaluated whether the physical function measures were responsive to self-reported and clinician-rated change over time. RESULTS: Small to moderate effect sizes for the standardized response means supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness of the HDQLIFE and Neuro-QoL measures for those with either self-reported or clinician-rated declines in function. General linear models supported 12-month and 24-month responsiveness for all HRQOL measures relative to self-reported declines in health, but generally only 24-month responsiveness was supported relative to clinician-rated declines in function.

Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) was performed, and group differences in [11C]-ER176 binding (used to evaluate the extent of microglial activation) were assessed by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Microglial activation was correlated with ROIs volumes, disease burden, and the scores obtained in the clinical scales. As an exploratory aim, we evaluated the dynamic functions of microglia in vitro, by using induced microglia-like (iMG) cells from peripheral blood monocytes. RESULTS: Individuals with manifest HD present higher [11C]-ER176 SUVR in both globi pallidi and putamina in comparison with controls. No differences were observed when we compared premanifest HD with controls or with manifest HD. We also found a significant correlation between increased microglial activation and cumulative disease burden, and with reduced volumes. iMG from controls, premanifest HD, and manifest HD patients showed similar phagocytic capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data demonstrate that microglial activation is involved in HD pathophysiology and is associated with disease progression.",

                    "text": "Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 Activation Improves Motor Performance and Reduces Pathology in Heterozygous zQ175 Huntington Disease Mice. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

                    "text": "Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 Activation Improves Motor Performance and Reduces Pathology in Heterozygous zQ175 Huntington Disease Mice. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive motor impairments with no available disease-modifying treatment. Current evidence indicates that exacerbated postsynaptic glutamate signaling in the striatum plays a key role in the pathophysiology of HD. However, it remains unclear whether reducing glutamate release can be an effective approach to slow the progression of HD. Here, we show that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3), which inhibit presynaptic glutamate release, improves HD symptoms and pathology in heterozygous zQ175 knockin mice. Treatment of both male and female zQ175 mice with the potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 for either 4 or 8 weeks improves both limb coordination and locomotor function in all mice. LY379268 also reduces mutant huntingtin aggregate formation, neuronal cell death, and microglial activation in the striatum of both male and female zQ175 mice. The reduction in mutant huntingtin aggregates correlates with the activation of a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent autophagy pathway in male, but not female, zQ175 mice. Furthermore, LY379268 reduces both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in male zQ175 mice but increases both Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in female zQ175 mice. Taken together, our results indicate that mGluR2/3 activation mitigates HD neuropathology in both male and female mice but is associated with the differential activation and inactivation of cell signaling pathways in heterozygous male and female zQ175 mice. This further highlights the need to take sex into consideration when developing future HD therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 improves motor impairments and reduces pathology in male and female zQ175 Huntington's disease mice. The beneficial outcomes of LY379268 treatment in Huntington's disease mice were mediated by divergent cell signaling pathways in both sexes. We provide evidence that mGluR2/3 agonists can be repurposed for the treatment of Huntington's disease, and we emphasize the importance of investigating sex as a biological variable in preclinical disease-modifying studies.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is emerging evidence that music therapy and other methods using music and rhythm may meaningfully improve a broad range of symptoms in neurological and non-neurological disorders. This review highlights the findings of recent studies utilizing music and rhythm-based interventions for gait impairment, other motor symptoms, and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) and other movement disorders. Limitations of current studies as well as future research directions are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple studies have demonstrated short-term benefits of rhythmic auditory stimulation on gait parameters including gait freezing in PD, with recent studies indicating that it may reduce falls. Demonstration of benefits for gait in both dopaminergic \"on\" and \"off\" states suggests that this intervention can be a valuable addition to the current armamentarium of PD therapies. There is also emerging evidence of motor and non-motor benefits from group dancing, singing, and instrumental music performance in PD. Preliminary evidence for music therapy and music-based interventions in movement disorders other than PD (such as Huntington disease, Tourette syndrome, and progressive supranuclear palsy) is limited but promising. Music therapy and other music and rhythm-based interventions may offer a range of symptomatic benefits to patients with PD and other movement disorders. Studies investigating the potential mechanisms of music's effects and well-controlled multicenter trials of these interventions are urgently needed.",

There is also emerging evidence of motor and non-motor benefits from group dancing, singing, and instrumental music performance in PD. Preliminary evidence for music therapy and music-based interventions in movement disorders other than PD (such as Huntington disease, Tourette syndrome, and progressive supranuclear palsy) is limited but promising. Music therapy and other music and rhythm-based interventions may offer a range of symptomatic benefits to patients with PD and other movement disorders. Studies investigating the potential mechanisms of music's effects and well-controlled multicenter trials of these interventions are urgently needed.",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether posturography and GAITRite  measures reveal (1) changes in manifest or premanifest HD mutation-carriers, (2) a correlation to the UHDRS-TMS and functional measures in manifest HD, and (3) a correlation to the disease-burden-score (based on CAG-repeat-length and age). METHODS: Posturography and GAITRite  were applied in premanifest (n = 26) and manifest HD gene-mutation-carriers (n = 40) in different paradigms compared to age-matched controls (n = 30) in a cross-sectional multi-site study conducted in three centers. Subjects were assessed clinically with the UHDRS Total-Motor-Score, Total-Functional-Capacity and Functional-Assessment-Scale. RESULTS: Several posturography measures were able to discriminate between controls, premanifest, and manifest mutation-carriers in both conditions assessed. Only one GAITRite  measure separated controls and premanifest participants, while discrimination between controls and manifest same as between premanifest and manifest participants was possible in several measures. Correlation with all clinical measures was seen in only one measure per device while correlations to the disease-burden-score seen in posturography only.

BACKGROUND: The imaging features of Huntington disease are well known in adults, unlike in juvenile-onset Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis in three juvenile Huntington disease patients (ages 2, 4 and 6 years old) to determine whether quantitative cerebral and cerebellar morphological metrics may provide diagnostically interesting patterns of cerebellar and cerebellar atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the cases of three siblings with extremely early presentations of juvenile Huntington disease associated with dramatic expansions of the morbid paternal allele from 43 to more than 100 CAG trinucleotide repeats. Automatic segmentation of MRI images of the cerebrum and cerebellum was performed and volumes of cerebral substructures and cerebellar lobules of juvenile Huntington disease patients were compared to those of 30 normal gender- and age-matched controls. Juvenile Huntington disease segmented volumes were compared to those of age-matched controls by using a z-score. RESULTS: Three cerebral substructures (caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus) demonstrated a reduction in size of more than three standard deviations from the normal mean although it was not salient in one of them at clinical reading and was not diagnosed. The size of cerebellum lobules, cerebellum grey matter and cerebellum cortex was reduced by more than two standard deviations in the three patients. The cerebellar atrophy was predominant in the posterior lobe. CONCLUSION: Our study sheds light on atrophic cerebral and cerebellar structures in juvenile Huntington disease. Automatic segmentations of the cerebellum provide patterns that may be of diagnostic interest in this disease.",

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis in three juvenile Huntington disease patients (ages 2, 4 and 6 years old) to determine whether quantitative cerebral and cerebellar morphological metrics may provide diagnostically interesting patterns of cerebellar and cerebellar atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the cases of three siblings with extremely early presentations of juvenile Huntington disease associated with dramatic expansions of the morbid paternal allele from 43 to more than 100 CAG trinucleotide repeats. Automatic segmentation of MRI images of the cerebrum and cerebellum was performed and volumes of cerebral substructures and cerebellar lobules of juvenile Huntington disease patients were compared to those of 30 normal gender- and age-matched controls. Juvenile Huntington disease segmented volumes were compared to those of age-matched controls by using a z-score. RESULTS: Three cerebral substructures (caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus) demonstrated a reduction in size of more than three standard deviations from the normal mean although it was not salient in one of them at clinical reading and was not diagnosed. The size of cerebellum lobules, cerebellum grey matter and cerebellum cortex was reduced by more than two standard deviations in the three patients. The cerebellar atrophy was predominant in the posterior lobe. CONCLUSION: Our study sheds light on atrophic cerebral and cerebellar structures in juvenile Huntington disease. Automatic segmentations of the cerebellum provide patterns that may be of diagnostic interest in this disease.",

Intrastriatal administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has shown beneficial effects in rodent models of Huntington disease (HD). However, the invasive nature of surgical procedure and its potential to trigger the host immune response may limit its clinical use. Hence, we sought to evaluate the non-invasive intranasal administration (INA) of MSC delivery as an effective alternative route in HD. GFP-expressing MSCs derived from bone marrow were intranasally administered to 4-week-old R6/2 HD transgenic mice. MSCs were detected in the olfactory bulb, midbrain and striatum five days post-delivery. Compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated littermates, MSC-treated R6/2 mice showed an increased survival rate and attenuated circadian activity disruption assessed by locomotor activity. MSCs increased the protein expression of DARPP-32 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and downregulated gene expression of inflammatory modulators in the brain 7.5 weeks after INA. While vehicle treated R6/2 mice displayed decreased Iba1 expression and altered microglial morphology in comparison to the wild type littermates, MSCs restored both, Iba1 level and the thickness of microglial processes in the striatum of R6/2 mice. Our results demonstrate significantly ameliorated phenotypes of R6/2 mice after MSCs administration via INA, suggesting this method as an effective delivering route of cells to the brain for HD therapy.",

The aim of this research was to explore the relation between visual scanning behavior and complex mental state recognition in individuals with pre-manifest HD (preHD). Eighteen preHD and eighteen age- and gender-matched healthy controls took the revised \"Reading the Mind in the Eyes\" test while their eye-movements were tracked. In addition to the expected deficits in mental state recognition, preHD showed abnormalities concerning all three scanning variables we considered, namely the absolute number of fixations (FC), the average fixation duration (AFD), and the percentage of time spent fixating (FTR). In preHD, FC and FTR but not AFD predicted mental state recognition over and beyond general disease-related declines in cognition and motor functioning. Notably, preHD showed abnormal vertical and horizontal fixation patterns, and these patterns predicted mental state recognition, suggesting the involvement of mechanisms related to the embodied processing of emotional stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that impaired facial mental state recognition in pre-manifest HD is partly due to emotional-motivational factors affecting the visual scanning of facial expressions.",

Notably, preHD showed abnormal vertical and horizontal fixation patterns, and these patterns predicted mental state recognition, suggesting the involvement of mechanisms related to the embodied processing of emotional stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that impaired facial mental state recognition in pre-manifest HD is partly due to emotional-motivational factors affecting the visual scanning of facial expressions.",

OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar ataxia.

OBJECTIVE: The huntingtin gene is critical for the formation and differentiation of the CNS, which raises questions about the neurodevelopmental effect of CAG expansion mutations within this gene (mHTT) that cause Huntington disease (HD). We sought to test the hypothesis that child and adolescent carriers of mHTT exhibit different brain growth compared to peers without the mutation by conducting structural MRI in youth who are at risk for HD. We also explored whether the length of CAG expansion affects brain development. METHODS: Children and adolescents (age 6-18) with a parent or grandparent diagnosed with HD underwent MRI and blinded genetic testing to confirm the presence or absence of mHTT. Seventy-five individuals were gene-expanded (GE) and 97 individuals were gene-nonexpanded (GNE). The GE group was estimated to be on average 35 years from clinical onset. Following an accelerated longitudinal design, age-related changes in brain regions were estimated. RESULTS: Age-related striatal volume changes differed significantly between the GE and GNE groups, with initial hypertrophy and more rapid volume decline in GE. This pattern was exaggerated with CAG expansion length for CAG > 50. A similar age-dependent group difference was observed for the globus pallidus, but not in other major regions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pathogenesis of HD begins with abnormal brain development. An understanding of potential neurodevelopmental features associated with mHTT may be needed for optimized implementation of preventative gene silencing therapies, such that normal aspects of neurodevelopment are preserved as neurodegeneration is forestalled.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative inherited genetic disorder, which leads to the onset of motor, neuropsychiatric and cognitive disturbances. HD is characterized by the loss of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs). To date, there is no treatment for HD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a substantial therapeutic opportunity for the HD treatment. Herein, we investigated the therapeutic potential of human immature dental pulp stem cells (hIDPSC), a special type of MSC originated from the neural crest, for HD treatment. Two different doses of hIDPSC were intravenously administrated in a subacute 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP)-induced rat model. We demonstrated hIDPSC homing in the striatum, cortex and subventricular zone using specific markers for human cells. Thirty days after hIDPSC administration, the cells found in the brain are still express hallmarks of undifferentiated MSC.

BACKGROUND: Deutetrabenazine is approved in the USA, China, Australia, Israel, Brazil, and South Korea for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of deutetrabenazine for the treatment of Huntington disease. METHODS: This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study included patients who completed a double-blind study (Rollover) and patients who converted overnight from a stable tetrabenazine dose (Switch). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (adverse events per person-year) were calculated. Efficacy was analyzed using a stable post-titration timepoint (8 weeks). Changes in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score and total maximal chorea score from baseline to week 8, as well as those from week 8 to week 145 (or the last visit on the study drug if that occurred earlier), were evaluated as both efficacy and safety endpoints during the study. RESULTS: Of 119 patients (Rollover, n = 82; Switch, n = 37), 100 (84%) completed >= 1 year of treatment. End-of-study exposure-adjusted incidence rates for adverse events in Rollover and Switch, respectively, were: any, 2.57 and 4.02; serious, 0.11 and 0.14; leading to dose suspension, 0.05 and 0.04. Common adverse events (>= 4% either cohort) included somnolence (Rollover, 20%; Switch, 30%), depression (32%; 22%), anxiety (27%; 35%), insomnia (23%; 16%), and akathisia (6%; 11%). Adverse events of interest included suicidality (9%; 5%) and parkinsonism (4%; 8%). Mean dose at week 8 was 38.1 mg (Rollover) and 36.5 mg (Switch). Mean dose across cohorts after titration was 37.6 mg; at the final visit, mean dose across cohorts was 45.7 mg. Patients showed minimal change in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total maximal chorea scores with stable dosing from weeks 8-145 or at the end of treatment, but total motor score increased versus week 8 (mean change [standard deviation]: 8.2 [11.9]). There were no unexpected adverse events upon drug withdrawal, and mean (standard deviation) total maximal chorea scores increased 4.7 (4.6) units from week 8 to 1-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events observed with long-term deutetrabenazine exposure were consistent with previous studies. Reductions in chorea persisted over time.

OBJECTIVE: After MRI studies suggested the efficacy of ethyl-EPA in reducing the progressive brain atrophy in Huntington disease (HD), trials were conducted to test its efficacy as a treatment for HD. Trials that continued for 6 months did not find any significant improvement, urging discontinuation of the drug. However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of motor functions in these patients. METHODS: We searched 12 electronic databases to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening, only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score-4 in both fixed and quality effect models [MD = -2.720, 95% CI (-4.76, -.68), p = 0.009; MD = -2.225, 95% CI (-3.842, -0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score showed significant results [MD = -1.013, 95% CI (-1.793, -0.233), p = 0.011] in only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming test or symbol digit modality. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement of motor scores only after 12 months.

Multiple targeted therapeutics for Huntington's disease are now in clinical trials, including intrathecally delivered compounds. Previous research suggests that CSF dynamics may be altered in Huntington's disease, which could be of paramount relevance to intrathecal drug delivery to the brain. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective cross-sectional study comparing people with early stage Huntington's disease with age- and gender-matched healthy controls. CSF peak velocity, mean velocity and mean flow at the level of the cerebral aqueduct, and sub-arachnoid space in the upper and lower spine, were quantified using phase contrast MRI. We calculated Spearman's rank correlations, and tested inter-group differences with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Ten people with early Huntington's disease, and 10 controls were included. None of the quantified measures was associated with potential modifiers of CSF dynamics (demographics, osmolality, and brain volumes), or by known modifiers of Huntington's disease (age and HTTCAG repeat length); and no significant differences were found between the two studied groups. While external validation is required, the attained results are sufficient to conclude tentatively that a clinically relevant alteration of CSF dynamics - that is, one that would justify dose-adjustments of intrathecal drugs - is unlikely to exist in Huntington's disease.",

None of the quantified measures was associated with potential modifiers of CSF dynamics (demographics, osmolality, and brain volumes), or by known modifiers of Huntington's disease (age and HTTCAG repeat length); and no significant differences were found between the two studied groups. While external validation is required, the attained results are sufficient to conclude tentatively that a clinically relevant alteration of CSF dynamics - that is, one that would justify dose-adjustments of intrathecal drugs - is unlikely to exist in Huntington's disease.",

BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder most commonly manifesting in adulthood. Identification of biomarkers tracking neurodegeneration before the onset of motor symptoms is important for future interventional studies. Our study aimed to contribute in the phenotypic characterization of the premanifest HD phase. METHODS: 28 premanifest subjects (preHD), 25 age-matched controls, and 12 manifest HD patients were enrolled for the study. The participants underwent a multimodal protocol including cognitive evaluations, arithmetic ability test, posturography, composite cerebellar functional test (CCFS), and brain 3T-MRI. PreHD were divided at the group median for predicted years to expected onset into \"far-from-onset\" (>15 years, PreHD-far), and \"close-to-onset\" (<=15 years, preHD-close). Basal ganglia volumes and cortical thickness were computed using FreeSurfer. RESULTS: PreHD-close showed significantly lower scores than controls in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (p = 0.017), Arithmetic subtraction task (p = 0.04), and MMSE (p < 0.006). At posturography, preHD-close showed increased sway velocity (<0.04) and distance (p < 0.02) compared to controls. PreHD-close had reduced striatum and globus pallidus volumes and left occipital cortical thinning compared to controls. Compared to PreHD far-from-onset, PreHD-close showed bilateral cortical thinning in occipital and parahippocampal regions, inversely correlating with burden score and prognostic index for HD. CCFS only differed between controls and manifest HD. PreHD far-from-onset did not show significant differences in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that quantitative brain MRI represents a valid biomarker of neurodegeneration in preHD. Posturography and Arithmentic tests seem promising tools for detecting early changes in premanifest HD, but need to be further confirmed in large cohorts.",

Many Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers already have cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in the premanifest (premotor) phase of the disease (pre-HD), but the molecular underpinnings of these symptoms are not well understood. Previous work has shown reduced availability of the cerebral type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) in manifest HD. Here, we investigated whether CB1R binding is related to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in pre-HD mutation carriers. Methods: CB1R binding was measured with 18F-MK-9470 (N-[(2S,3S)-3-(3-cyanophenyl)-4-(4-ethoxyphenyl)butan-2-yl]-2-methyl-2-(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)oxypropanamide) PET in 15 pre-HD subjects (8 men, 7 women; age, 39.3 +- 9.9 y), 15 gene-negative controls from HD families (9 men, 6 women; age, 37.0 +- 10.6 y), and 12 community controls (6 men and 6 women; age, 39.9 +- 15.1 y). All subjects also underwent extensive assessment of motor and cognitive function, as well as a behavioral test battery including the Problem Behavior Assessment for HD (PBA-HD), and MRI. Parametric binding images of 18F-MK-9470 were corrected for partial-volume effect. Results: There was no difference in CB1R binding, gray matter volume, cognitive function, or psychiatric scores between gene-negative controls from HD families and community controls, which were therefore pooled to one control group. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects showed striatal atrophy, a decrease in CB1R binding in the prefrontal cortex, and higher PBA-HD scores on depression, apathy, and irritability (range, P = 0.01-0.005). The PBA-HD scores inversely correlated with CB1R binding in prefrontal regions and cingulate cortex in pre-HD (range: r = -0.64 to -0.72; P = 0.01-0.008). Conclusion: The association between behavioral symptoms and reduced prefrontal CB1R levels may provide new insight into the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pre-HD and suggest new therapeutic avenues.",

                    "text": "Behavioral Symptoms in Premanifest Huntington Disease Correlate with Reduced Frontal CB1R Levels. Many Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers already have cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in the premanifest (premotor) phase of the disease (pre-HD), but the molecular underpinnings of these symptoms are not well understood. Previous work has shown reduced availability of the cerebral type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) in manifest HD. Here, we investigated whether CB1R binding is related to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in pre-HD mutation carriers. Methods: CB1R binding was measured with 18F-MK-9470 (N-[(2S,3S)-3-(3-cyanophenyl)-4-(4-ethoxyphenyl)butan-2-yl]-2-methyl-2-(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)oxypropanamide) PET in 15 pre-HD subjects (8 men, 7 women; age, 39.3 +- 9.9 y), 15 gene-negative controls from HD families (9 men, 6 women; age, 37.0 +- 10.6 y), and 12 community controls (6 men and 6 women; age, 39.9 +- 15.1 y). All subjects also underwent extensive assessment of motor and cognitive function, as well as a behavioral test battery including the Problem Behavior Assessment for HD (PBA-HD), and MRI. Parametric binding images of 18F-MK-9470 were corrected for partial-volume effect. Results: There was no difference in CB1R binding, gray matter volume, cognitive function, or psychiatric scores between gene-negative controls from HD families and community controls, which were therefore pooled to one control group. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects showed striatal atrophy, a decrease in CB1R binding in the prefrontal cortex, and higher PBA-HD scores on depression, apathy, and irritability (range, P = 0.01-0.005). The PBA-HD scores inversely correlated with CB1R binding in prefrontal regions and cingulate cortex in pre-HD (range: r = -0.64 to -0.72; P = 0.01-0.008). Conclusion: The association between behavioral symptoms and reduced prefrontal CB1R levels may provide new insight into the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pre-HD and suggest new therapeutic avenues.",

BACKGROUND: Assisted dying is frequently debated publicly and research often includes the views of health professionals on this issue. However, the views of people with life-limiting conditions, for whom this issue is likely to have a different resonance, are less well represented. AIM: The purpose of this study was to explore the views of people who live with the inevitability of developing Huntington's disease, a genetically transmitted disease which significantly limits life, on assisted dying. DESIGN: Using thematic analysis methodology, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Seven participants (five women and two men) who were gene positive for Huntington's disease took part in the study. RESULTS: Four themes were extracted: (1) autonomy and kindness in assisted dying: the importance of moral principles; (2) Huntington's disease threatens life and emphasises issues relating to death; (3) dilemmas in decision-making on assisted dying: \"There are no winners\" and (4) the absence of explicit discussion on dying and Huntington's disease: \"Elephants in the room\". CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that talking to patients about assisted death may not cause harm and may even be invited by many patients with Huntington's disease. The perspectives of those who live with Huntington's disease, especially given its extended effects within families, add significant clinical and theoretical insights.",

Importance: Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor and phonic tics; treatments for tics are associated with safety concerns. Deutetrabenazine is a selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia in adults. Objective: To examine whether deutetrabenazine is effective and safe for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in children and adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2/3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-titration study included children and adolescents (aged 6-16 years) with Tourette syndrome with active tics causing distress or impairment (ie, Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score [YGTSS-TTS] >=20). The trial was conducted over 12 weeks, with 1 week of follow-up from February 2018 to November 2019 at 36 centers in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Russia, Serbia, and Spain. Data analysis was conducted from January 31 to April 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive deutetrabenazine or placebo, titrated during 7 weeks to an optimal level, followed by a 5-week maintenance period. The maximum total daily deutetrabenazine dose was 48 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 12 in YGTSS-TTS. Key secondary end points included changes in Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression, Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety was assessed based on treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, questionnaires, and laboratory parameters. Results: A total of 119 participants were randomized to deutetrabenazine (59 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.5] years; 53 [90%] boys; 49 [83%] White; 3 [5%] Black) and placebo (60 participants; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [2.6] years; 51 [85%] boys; 53 [88%] White; 3 [5%] Black). At week 12, the difference in YGTSS-TTS score was not significant between deutetrabenazine and placebo (least squares mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -4.1 to 2.8; P = .69; Cohen d, -0.07). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 38 patients (66%) and 33 patients (56%) receiving deutetrabenazine and placebo, respectively, and were generally mild or moderate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified. These results may be informative for future studies of treatments for tics in Tourette syndrome. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03452943.",

METHODS: Board-certified/board-eligible neurologists, in practice for >=5 years, who had treated treat >=3 HD patients in the past 2 years, were recruited from an online physician panel to participate in a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Respondents provided information about themselves, their practice, approaches to HD chorea management and perceptions of available treatments. RESULTS: Two hundred neurologists responded to the survey. Based on clinician responses, the most common reasons to treat chorea are impairment in activities of daily living (54%) and quality of life (41%). Although tetrabenazine was the only approved treatment for chorea in HD patients at the time of this analysis, it was only prescribed to ~50% of patients with HD-related chorea. More than half of physicians perceive tetrabenazine as having minimal or no effectiveness in improving chorea. More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns.

More than 40% of physicians consider tetrabenazine to be a non-optimal treatment, and 51% of physicians agree that they are unable to titrate to efficacious doses due to adverse side effects or tolerability concerns. Physicians report that side effects leading to dose interruptions (33%) and reductions (30%) occur in their patients \"often\" or \"almost always\". The most common side effects that led to insufficient dosing and disruptions in titration were sedation and somnolence (41%), depression (24%) and anxiety (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians who treat HD-related chorea report that tolerability issues with tetrabenazine impact their ability to effectively use tetrabenazine in their clinical practice.",

PURPOSE: Pridopidine is an investigational drug for Huntington disease (HD). Pridopidine was originally thought to act as a dopamine stabilizer. However, pridopidine shows highest affinity to the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) and enhances neuroprotection via the S1R in preclinical studies. Using [18F] fluspidine and [18F] fallypride PET, the purpose of this study was to assess in vivo target engagement/receptor occupancy of pridopidine to the S1R and dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) at clinical relevant doses in healthy volunteers (HVs) and as proof-of-concept in a small number of patients with HD. METHODS: Using [18F] fluspidine PET (300 MBq, 0-90 min), 11 male HVs (pridopidine 0.5 to 90 mg; six dose groups) and three male patients with HD (pridopidine 90 mg) were investigated twice, without and 2 h after single dose of pridopidine. Using [18F] fallypride PET (200 MBq, 0-210 min), four male HVs were studied without and 2 h following pridopidine administration (90 mg). Receptor occupancy was analyzed by the Lassen plot. RESULTS: S1R occupancy as function of pridopidine dose (or plasma concentration) in HVs could be described by a three-parameter Hill equation with a Hill coefficient larger than one. A high degree of S1R occupancy (87% to 91%) was found throughout the brain at pridopidine doses ranging from 22.5 to 90 mg. S1R occupancy was 43% at 1 mg pridopidine. In contrast, at 90 mg pridopidine, the D2/D3R occupancy was only minimal (~ 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our PET findings indicate that at clinically relevant single dose of 90 mg, pridopidine acts as a selective S1R ligand showing near to complete S1R occupancy with negligible occupancy of the D2/D3R. The dose S1R occupancy relationship suggests cooperative binding of pridopidine to the S1R. Our findings provide significant clarification about pridopidine's mechanism of action and support further use of the 45-mg twice-daily dose to achieve full and selective targeting of the S1R in future clinical trials of neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to follow tonic and phasic autonomic nervous activity in Huntington disease (HD) mutation carriers and patients. METHODS: Evaluation of motor functions and total functional capacity was performed in 30 HD mutation carriers or patients at the beginning and in 22 subjects after 8-10 years. Continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and ECG at rest were measured, and HR variability analysis was performed in four different ways. A group of matched controls was also evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were assorted in 3 groups: 6 HD mutation carriers without motor symptoms (PHD) who remained so (PHD-PHD); 6 early symptomatic patients (EHD) who remained so (EHD-EHD); and 6 early symptomatic patients who deteriorated to a late symptomatic (LHD) (EHD-LHD). At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress. There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of an outbreak of clinical disease phase.",

At the beginning, sympathetic tonic activity in PHD was elevated, according to mean arterial pressure (99 +- 10.6 mm Hg) higher than in controls (85 +- 8.7 mm Hg) and EHD (82 +- 9.9 mm Hg) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) and higher HR (78 +- 16 beats/min) than after 8-10 years (64 +- 11.3 beats/min) (paired t test, p < 0.05). There was also a decreased phasic sympathetic activity in EHD patients compared controls at the beginning (219 +- 106 vs. 664 +- 466 s2/Hz) and after 8-10 years (182 +- 136 vs. 1,012 +- 1,369 s2/Hz) (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). In patients who deteriorated from EHD to LHD, there was a drop in phasic parasympathetic activity from 887 +- 433 to 230 +- 235 s2/Hz (paired t test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term observational study provides important information on the timeline of ANS activity in HD progress. There was a temporary increase in cardiac and vascular sympathetic activity in PHD subjects. The normalization of HR in PHD subjects might indicate the approach of an outbreak of clinical disease phase.",

OBJECTIVE: Although Huntington's disease (HD) is a disease of the central nervous system, HD mortality surveys indicate heart disease as a major cause of death. Cardiac dysfunction in HD might be a primary consequence of peripherally expressed mutant huntingtin or secondary to either a general decline in health or the onset of neurological dysfunction. The aim of the study was to clarify the heart muscle involvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured conventional and advanced resting ECG indices. Thirty-one subjects with a confirmed huntingtin gene mutation and 31 age- and gender-matched controls were included. The HD subjects were divided into four groups based on their Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score. RESULTS: We detected changes in advanced ECG variables connected with electrical ventricular remodeling (t test, p < 0.01). The increase in the unexplained part of both QT variability and the standard deviation of normal-to-normal QT intervals, presumably reflecting beat-to-beat changes in repolarization, was most pronounced. Further, both variables correlated with the product of the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) triplets' repeat length and the subjects' age (CAP), the former R = 0.423 (p = 0.018) and the latter R = 0.499 (p = 0.004). There was no correlation between the CAP score and any of variables representing autonomic nervous system activity. CONCLUSIONS: Both autonomic nervous system dysfunction and cardiac electrical remodeling are present in patients with HD.

BACKGROUND: Clinician-rated measures of functioning are often used as primary endpoints in clinical trials and other behavioral research in Huntington disease. As study costs for clinician-rated assessments are not always feasible, there is a question of whether patient self-report of commonly used clinician-rated measures may serve as acceptable alternatives in low risk behavioral trials. AIM: The purpose of this paper was to determine the level of agreement between self-report and clinician-ratings of commonly used functional assessment measures in Huntington disease. DESIGN: 486 participants with premanifest or manifest Huntington disease were examined. Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment, and Independence Scale assessments from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating scale were completed by clinicians; a self-report version was also completed by individuals with Huntington disease. Cronbach's alpha was used to examine internal consistency, one-way analysis of variance was used to examine group differences, and paired t tests, kappa agreement coefficients, and intra-class correlations were calculated to determine agreement between raters. RESULTS: Internal consistency for self-reported ratings of functional capacity and ability were good. There were significant differences between those with premanifest, early-, and late-stage disease; those with later-stage disease reported less ability and independence than the other clinical groups. Although self-report ratings were not a perfect match with associated clinician-rated measures, differences were small. Cutoffs for achieving specified levels of agreement are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the acceptable margin of error in a study, self-reported administration of these functional assessments may be appropriate when clinician-related assessments are not feasible.",

                    "text": "SGTA associates with intracellular aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. Intracellular aggregates are a common pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Aggregates are mainly formed by aberrant disease-specific proteins and are accompanied by accumulation of other aggregate-interacting proteins. Although aggregate-interacting proteins have been considered to modulate the formation of aggregates and to be involved in molecular mechanisms of disease progression, the components of aggregate-interacting proteins remain unknown. In this study, we showed that small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alfa (SGTA) is an aggregate-interacting protein in neurodegenerative diseases. Immunohistochemistry showed that SGTA interacted with intracellular aggregates in Huntington disease (HD) cell models and neurons of HD model mice. We also revealed that SGTA colocalized with intracellular aggregates in postmortem brains of patients with polyQ diseases including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. In addition, SGTA colocalized with glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the brains of MSA patients, whereas no accumulation of SGTA was observed in neurons of PD and ALS patients. In vitro study showed that SGTA bound to polyQ aggregates through its C-terminal domain and SGTA overexpression reduced intracellular aggregates. These results suggest that SGTA may play a role in the formation of aggregates and may act as potential modifier of molecular pathological mechanisms of polyQ diseases and MSA.",

In the prodromal phase of neurodegenerative diseases, microglia switch to an activated state resulting in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. We reported that C - C chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), C - C chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) and C - C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) contained in the secretome of activated microglia inhibit neuronal autophagy via a non-cell autonomous mechanism. These chemokines bind and activate neuronal C - C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), which, in turn, promotes phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT) - mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway activation, which inhibits autophagy, thus causing the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins in the cytoplasm of neurons. The levels of CCR5 and its chemokine ligands are increased in the brains of pre-manifesting Huntington disease (HD) and tauopathy mouse models. CCR5 accumulation might be due to a self-amplifying mechanism, since CCR5 is a substrate of autophagy and CCL5-CCR5-mediated autophagy inhibition impairs CCR5 degradation. Furthermore, pharmacological, or genetic inhibition of CCR5 rescues mTORC1-autophagy dysfunction and improves neurodegeneration in HD and tauopathy mouse models, suggesting that CCR5 hyperactivation is a pathogenic signal driving the progression of these diseases.",

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to study the changes in white matter integrity in R6/2, a well-established animal model of Huntington's disease (HD) that are captured by ex vivo diffusion imaging (DTI) using a high field MRI (17.6 T). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and continuous time random walk (CTRW) models were used to fit changes in the diffusion-weighted signal intensity in the corpus callosum of controls and in R6/2 mice. RESULTS: A significant 13% decrease in fractional anisotropy, a 7% increase in axial diffusion, and a 33% increase in radial diffusion were observed between R6/2 and control mice. No change was observed in the CTRW beta parameter, but a significant decrease in the alpha parameter (- 21%) was measured. Histological analysis of the corpus callosum showed a decrease in axonal organization, myelin alterations, and astrogliosis.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to study the changes in white matter integrity in R6/2, a well-established animal model of Huntington's disease (HD) that are captured by ex vivo diffusion imaging (DTI) using a high field MRI (17.6 T). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI and continuous time random walk (CTRW) models were used to fit changes in the diffusion-weighted signal intensity in the corpus callosum of controls and in R6/2 mice. RESULTS: A significant 13% decrease in fractional anisotropy, a 7% increase in axial diffusion, and a 33% increase in radial diffusion were observed between R6/2 and control mice. No change was observed in the CTRW beta parameter, but a significant decrease in the alpha parameter (- 21%) was measured. Histological analysis of the corpus callosum showed a decrease in axonal organization, myelin alterations, and astrogliosis. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated ultrastructural changes in degenerating axons, such as an increase in tortuosity in the R6/2 mice.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) have impairments in performing dual-tasks, however, there is limited information about the effects of changing postural and cognitive demands as well as which measures are best suited as markers of underlying motor-cognitive interference. METHODS: Forty-three individuals with HD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed single tasks of walking (Timed Up & Go (TUG), 7 m walk), standing (feet together, feet apart and foam surface) and seated cognitive performance (Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting test) and dual cognitive-motor tasks while standing (+ Stroop) and walking (+ DKEFS, TUG cognitive). APDM Opal sensors recorded measures of postural sway and time to complete motor tasks. RESULTS: Individuals with HD had a greater increase in standing postural sway compared to HC from single to dual-tasks and with changes to support surface. Both groups demonstrated a decrease in gait performance during the TUG cognitive, however, this difference was greater in people with HD compared to HC. While those with HD showed a greater dual-task motor cost compared to HC, both groups behaved similarly as condition complexity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Standing postural sway is a more sensitive marker of instability than change in standard gait speed, particularly under dual-task conditions. The more complex TUG cognitive is a sensitive measure of walking dual-task performance.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with Huntington's disease (HD) have impairments in performing dual-tasks, however, there is limited information about the effects of changing postural and cognitive demands as well as which measures are best suited as markers of underlying motor-cognitive interference. METHODS: Forty-three individuals with HD and 15 healthy controls (HC) completed single tasks of walking (Timed Up & Go (TUG), 7 m walk), standing (feet together, feet apart and foam surface) and seated cognitive performance (Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting test) and dual cognitive-motor tasks while standing (+ Stroop) and walking (+ DKEFS, TUG cognitive). APDM Opal sensors recorded measures of postural sway and time to complete motor tasks. RESULTS: Individuals with HD had a greater increase in standing postural sway compared to HC from single to dual-tasks and with changes to support surface. Both groups demonstrated a decrease in gait performance during the TUG cognitive, however, this difference was greater in people with HD compared to HC. While those with HD showed a greater dual-task motor cost compared to HC, both groups behaved similarly as condition complexity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Standing postural sway is a more sensitive marker of instability than change in standard gait speed, particularly under dual-task conditions. The more complex TUG cognitive is a sensitive measure of walking dual-task performance. The results of this study provide insights about the nature of motor-cognitive impairments in HD and provide support for a distinction between static and dynamic postural control mechanisms during performance of dual-tasks.",

OBJECTIVE: Normalization to an appropriate reference region in F-FDG PET imaging may enhance diagnostic performance in Huntington disease (HD). We aimed to identify stable brain areas that could be used to model neurometabolic degeneration in HD correlating imaging (SUVrvalues at the basal ganglia [BBGG]) and clinical parameters (disease burden score [DBS]). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed brain F-FDG PET/CT in 38 manifest HD patients (meanage +- SD, 54 +- 14.3 years; CAGrepeats +- SD, 44.2 +- 3.1), 20 premanifest HD patients (meanage +- SD, 42.7 +- 11.7 years; CAGrepeats +- SD, 40 +- 3.8), and 18 healthy controls (NC; meanage +- SD, 45 +- 13.2 years). For quantitative analysis, we selected (a) defined reference regions from the Montreal Neurological Institute space atlas (pons, whole cerebellum, cerebral white matter, thalamus, and a pons-cerebellar vermis region of interest), and (b) reference clusters obtained by voxelwise statistical comparison across groups (P < 0.05 FWE; extent voxel threshold k = 200). Each candidate reference region and reference cluster was quantitatively assessed using imaging and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Comparing HD and NC groups, we obtained a reference cluster in the cerebellum, and in temporal and frontal lobes. Comparing manifest HD and premanifest HD patients, we observed reference clusters in the cerebellum, pons, thalamus, parietal lobe, and cuneus. The set of reference regions showed a significant correlation between SUVrvalues at the BBGG and DBS in all HD patients. In premanifest HD patients, the correlation between SUVrvalues at the BBGG and DBS was significant using the pons-cerebellar vermis region of interest, the thalamus as defined reference regions, and the pons and thalamus as reference clusters. In manifest HD patients, the correlation was significant using the temporal and white matter frontal lobe clusters. Variance between SUVrvalues in the set of reference regions and reference clusters was minimal within NC.

                    "text": "The Prospective Huntington At-Risk Observational Study (PHAROS): The Emotional Well-Being, Safety and Feasibility of Long-Term Research Participation. BACKGROUND: There is limited understanding of the feasibility of conducting long-term research among undiagnosed (pre-symptomatic) adults at risk to develop Huntington disease (HD), while protecting their emotional well-being and safety. OBJECTIVE: To assess pre-specified events pertaining to emotional well-being, safety, and feasibility among healthy consenting adults at risk for developing HD who have chosen not to undergo genetic testing. METHODS: PHAROS research participants prospectively reported the occurrence of events pertaining to psychological distress (psychiatric evaluations, depression, suicidality) and feasibility (maintaining confidentiality, study attrition). PHAROS enrolled 1001 participants. RESULTS: Events pertaining to psychological distress were reported by 35% of participants. The most common events included heightened suicide risk (26%), new onset depression (12%), and new mental health evaluation (9%); all occurred significantly more frequently among participants with expanded trinucleotide CAG repeats (>=37). Five deaths occurred, none related to suicide. Forty-one percent of participants reported self-disclosure of their HD at-risk status, and 15% reported that someone else (usually a family member) had done so. Confidentiality of CAG test results was maintained by investigators. The withdrawal rate was largely uniform over the study period and did not differ significantly by gender or CAG status. CONCLUSIONS: The potentially vulnerable research participants in PHAROS showed good emotional tolerability and safety. Individual CAG data were not disclosed, and confidentiality about disclosure of at-risk HD status was well maintained by others (family, friends, etc.). Long-term research participation of adults at risk for HD who choose not to undergo pre-symptomatic DNA testing is well tolerated, safe and feasible.",

Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The typical motor symptoms have been associated with basal ganglia pathology. However, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms often precede the motor component and may be due to changes in the limbic system. Recent work has indicated pathology in the hypothalamus in HD but other parts of the limbic system have not been extensively studied. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in HD also include white matter pathology. Here we investigated if the main white matter tract of the limbic system, the fornix, is affected in HD. We demonstrate that the fornix is 34% smaller already in prodromal HD and 41% smaller in manifest HD compared to controls using volumetric analyses of MRI of the IMAGE-HD study. In post-mortem fornix tissue from HD cases, we confirm the smaller fornix volume in HD which is accompanied by signs of myelin breakdown and reduced levels of the transcription factor myelin regulating factor but detect no loss of oligodendrocytes. Further analyses using RNA-sequencing demonstrate downregulation of oligodendrocyte identity markers in the fornix of HD cases. Analysis of differentially expressed genes based on transcription-factor/target-gene interactions also revealed enrichment for binding sites of SUZ12 and EZH2, components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, as well as RE1 Regulation Transcription Factor. Taken together, our data show that there is early white matter pathology of the fornix in the limbic system in HD likely due to a combination of reduction in oligodendrocyte genes and myelin break down.",

Using Rotarod and electromyography setups, we showed that EB diet significantly recovered motor failure and muscle incoordination in 3-NP injected rats compared to the control group. Also, the molecular findings implied that EB diet led to a significant drop in 3-NP induced growth in caspase-3 and TNF-alpha concentration. The treatment also improved striatal antioxidative capacity by a significant reduction in ROS and a remarkable rise in GSH, which might be correlated with motor recovery in the tests.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the percent volume of dilated perivascular space (PVS) in the subcortical forebrain in patients with early Huntington disease (HD) and to explore the relationship between PVS and disease severity. METHODS: MRI scans were performed on 25 patients with HD and 23 healthy age-matched controls at Massachusetts General Hospital. The imaging data were analyzed with a novel algorithm to determine regional PVS volume. A fractional logistic regression analysis was used to quantify the association between regional percent PVS volume and (1) disease designation (HD or control) and (2) disease severity as assessed by normalized caudate volume. RESULTS: Patients with HD had the greatest percent volume of dilated PVS in the putamen (left putamen: odds ratio 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-2.62], HD 3.27% [95% CI 2.83-3.78] vs controls 1.62% [95% CI 1.32-1.97], p fdr < 0.001; right putamen: odds ratio 1.66 [95% CI 1.33-2.08], HD 3.43% [95% CI 2.94-4.01] vs controls 2.09% [95% CI 1.79-2.45], p fdr < 0.001) and several subcortical white matter regions compared to controls. Dilated PVS increased with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The objective quantification of dilated PVS suggests that PVS burden is high, is associated with disease severity, and may affect the distribution and success of treatments administered either intrathecally such as antisense oligonucleotides or by intraparenchymal administration such as cell and gene therapies.

In this study, we investigated differences in the large fascicular bundles of the cerebral white matter of gene-positive HD carriers, including pre-manifest individuals and early symptomatic patients, using recently developed diffusion tractography procedures. We examined eighteen major fiber bundles in 37 patients with early HD (average age 55.2 +- 11.5, 14 male, 23 female), 31 gene-positive, motor negative pre-symptomatic HD (PHD) (average age 48.1 +- 11.5, 13 male, 18 female), and 38 healthy age-matched controls (average age 55.7 +- 8.6, 14 male, 24 female), using the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) procedure available as part of the FreeSurfer image processing software package. We calculated the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean radial (RD) and axial diffusivities (AD) for each fiber bundle. We also evaluated the relationships between diffusion measures, cognition and regional cortical thinning. We found that early changes in RD of select tracts in PHD subjects were associated with impaired performance on neuropsychological tests, suggesting that early changes in myelin might underlie early cognitive dysfunction. Finally, we found that increases in AD of select tracts were associated with regionally select cortical thinning of areas known to atrophy in HD, including the sensorimotor, supramarginal and fusiform gyrus, suggesting that AD may be reflecting pyramidal cell degeneration in HD. Together, these results suggest that white matter microstructural changes in HD reflect a complex, clinically relevant and dynamic process.",

METHODS: We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT-HD, TRACK-HD, and IMAGE-HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease-affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.

Neurodegenerative diseases that affect serious gait abnormalities include Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington disease (HD). These diseases lead to gait rhythm distortion that can be determined by stride time interval of footfall contact times. In this paper, we present a new method for gait classification of neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we utilize a symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm to convert left-foot stride-stride interval into a sequence of symbols using a symbolic aggregate approximation. We then find string prototypes of each class using the newly proposed string grammar unsupervised possibilistic fuzzy C-medians. Then in the testing process the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor is used. We implement the system on three 2-class problems, i.e., the classification of ALS against healthy patients, that of HD against healthy patients , and that of PD against healthy patients. The system is also implemented on one 4-class problem (the classification of ALS, HD, PD, and healthy patients altogether) called NDDs versus healthy. We found that our system yields a very good detection result. The average correct classification for ALS versus healthy is 96.88%, and that for HD versus healthy is 97.22%, whereas that for PD versus healthy is 96.43%. When the system is implemented on 4-class problem, the average accuracy is approximately 98.44%. It can provide prototypes of gait signals that are more understandable to human.",

                    "text": "Retina Oculomics in Neurodegenerative Disease. Ophthalmic biomarkers have long played a critical role in diagnosing and managing ocular diseases. Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disease.",

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the trajectory of functional connections over time of the striatum and the cerebellum differs between presymptomatic patients with the Huntington disease (HD) gene expansion (GE) and patients with a family history of HD but without the GE (GNE), we evaluated functional MRI data from the Kids-HD study. METHODS: We utilized resting-state, functional MRI data from participants in the Kids-HD study between 6 and 18 years old. Participants were divided into GE (CAG 36-59) and GNE (CAG <36) groups. Seed-to-seed correlations were calculated among 4 regions that provide input signals to the anterior cerebellum: (1) dorsocaudal putamen, (2) globus pallidus externa, (3) subthalamic nucleus, and (4) pontine nuclei; and 2 regions that represented output from the cerebellum: the dentate nucleus to the (1) ventrolateral thalamus and (2) dorsocaudal putamen. Linear mixed effects regression models evaluated differences in developmental trajectories of these connections over time between groups. RESULTS: Four of the six striatal-cerebellum correlations showed significantly different trajectories between groups. All showed a pattern where in the early age ranges (6-12 years) there was hyperconnectivity in the GE compared to the GNE, with those trajectories showing linear decline in the latter half of the age range. CONCLUSION: These results parallel previous findings showing striatal hypertrophy in children with GE as early as age 6. These findings support the notion of developmentally higher connectivity between the striatum and cerebellum early in the life of the child with HD GE, possibly setting the stage for cerebellar compensatory mechanisms.",

This group can be divided into CAG- versus non-CAG-repeat diseases. Apart from spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 and 12 (SCA6 and SCA12), these CAG-repeat diseases, as well as Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) and SCA8, can be neuropathologically identified using 1C2 polyglutamine antibodies. In fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia, SCA6 and SCA12 ubiquitin/p62-positive and 1C2-negative inclusion bodies can be observed. In the other diseases proteinaceous inclusions are not found.

OBJECTIVES: Apathy is a debilitating symptom of Huntington's disease (HD) and manifests before motor diagnosis, making it an excellent therapeutic target in the preclinical phase of Huntington's disease (prHD). HD is a neurological genetic disorder characterized by cognitive and motor impairment, and psychiatric abnormalities. Apathy is not well characterized within the prHD. In previous literature, damage to the caudate and putamen has been correlated with increased apathy in other neurodegenerative and movement disorders. The objective of this study was to determine whether apathy severity in individuals with prHD is related to striatum volumes and cognitive control. We hypothesized that, within prHD individuals, striatum volumes and cognitive control scores would be related to apathy. METHODS: We constructed linear mixed models to analyze striatum volumes and cognitive control, a composite measure that includes tasks assessing with apathy scores from 797 prHD participants. The outcome variable for each model was apathy, and the independent variables for the four separate models were caudate volume, putamen volume, cognitive control score, and motor symptom score. We also included depression as a covariate to ensure that our results were not solely related to mood. RESULTS: Caudate and putamen volumes, as well as measures of cognitive control, were significantly related to apathy scores even after controlling for depression. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral apathy expressed by these individuals was related to regions of the brain commonly associated with isolated apathy, and not a direct result of mood symptoms.

PURPOSE: To employ an off-resonance saturation method to measure the mineral-iron pool in the postmortem brain, which is an endogenous contrast agent that can give information on cellular iron status. METHODS: An off-resonance saturation acquisition protocol was implemented on a 7 Tesla preclinical scanner, and the contrast maps were fitted to an established analytical model. The method was validated by correlation and Bland-Altman analysis on a ferritin-containing phantom. Mineral-iron maps were obtained from postmortem tissue of patients with neurological diseases characterized by brain iron accumulation, that is, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and aceruloplasminemia, and validated with histology. Transverse relaxation rate and magnetic susceptibility values were used for comparison. RESULTS: In postmortem tissue, the mineral-iron contrast colocalizes with histological iron staining in all the cases. Iron concentrations obtained via the off-resonance saturation method are in agreement with literature. CONCLUSIONS: Off-resonance saturation is an effective way to detect iron in gray matter structures and partially mitigate for the presence of myelin. If a reference region with little iron is available in the tissue, the method can produce quantitative iron maps.

When suffering Huntington Disease the patient will experience physical, cognitive and psychological issues, so that the patient won't be able to communicate or express his will in the end-of-life-phase of his disease. The problem is, after suffering a while the patient often won't be able to eat by himself, so a feeding tube must be implanted. In some cases a tracheostomy tube is needed because of the respiratory insufficiency. The cause of death in most cases is an infection like a respiratory disease. That's why it's most important when diagnosed with Huntington Disease to advance care planning to end-of-life care like life-sustaining measures that engages patients in decision-making regarding future care, while they are still able to make and express decisions by themselves.",

OBJECTIVES: People with Huntington's disease (HD) experience poor social quality of life, relationship breakdown, and social withdrawal, which are mediated to some extent by socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy and disinhibition. Social cognitive symptoms, such as impaired emotion recognition, also occur in HD, however, the extent of their association with these socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms is unknown. Our study examined the relationship between emotion recognition and symptom ratings of apathy and disinhibition in HD. METHODS: Thirty-two people with premanifest or symptomatic-HD completed Part 1 of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT), which is a facial emotion recognition task. In addition, we obtained severity ratings for apathy and disinhibition on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) from a close family member. Our analyses used motor symptom severity as a proxy for disease progression. RESULTS: Emotion recognition performance was significantly associated with family-ratings of apathy, above and beyond their shared association with disease severity. We found a similar pattern for disinhibition ratings, which fell short of statistical significance. As expected, worse emotion recognition performance was correlated with higher severity in FrSBe symptom ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emotion recognition abilities relate to key socially debilitating neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. Our results help to understand the functional significance of emotion recognition impairments in HD, and may have implications for the development of remediation programs aimed at improving patients' social quality of life.

This qualitative study gathered opinions about genetic testing from people who received presymptomatic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) 20-30 years ago and have lived with the implications of that testing for decades. During the last section of a semi-structured interview, participants were asked open-ended questions about their opinions on the importance of autonomy in the decision to be tested for HD, whether a formal HD testing protocol is necessary, whether physician ordering for HD is acceptable without a formal protocol, whether online direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for HD is acceptable, and whether incidental/secondary findings should be returned in the context of whole exome/genome sequencing. Most-but not all-participants were in favor of an individual's right to decide whether and when to pursue HD testing, use of a formal HD testing protocol, and returning medically actionable secondary findings. However, the majority of participants were opposed not only to physician ordering and DTC HD testing in the absence of a formal protocol but also to returning a secondary finding of an expanded HD allele. This study presents the opinions of a unique and extremely well-informed cohort on issues that need to be taken into careful consideration by genetic counselors and other medical professionals who are developing genetic testing protocols, making decisions about the availability of genetic tests, and making decisions about whether and how to return incidental findings.",

During the last section of a semi-structured interview, participants were asked open-ended questions about their opinions on the importance of autonomy in the decision to be tested for HD, whether a formal HD testing protocol is necessary, whether physician ordering for HD is acceptable without a formal protocol, whether online direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing for HD is acceptable, and whether incidental/secondary findings should be returned in the context of whole exome/genome sequencing. Most-but not all-participants were in favor of an individual's right to decide whether and when to pursue HD testing, use of a formal HD testing protocol, and returning medically actionable secondary findings. However, the majority of participants were opposed not only to physician ordering and DTC HD testing in the absence of a formal protocol but also to returning a secondary finding of an expanded HD allele. This study presents the opinions of a unique and extremely well-informed cohort on issues that need to be taken into careful consideration by genetic counselors and other medical professionals who are developing genetic testing protocols, making decisions about the availability of genetic tests, and making decisions about whether and how to return incidental findings.",

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology characterized by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism (MSA-P) and cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). The phenotypic spectrum may present overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders. To investigate the possible contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype, we analyzed the triplet repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients. As comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the basis of CAG repeat length as \"normal\", \"intermediate\" or \"expanded\" according to literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 years and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had significantly younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P (p < 0.0001). We identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 CAG), a SCA2 intermediate allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36 CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA alleles were detected in controls. The distribution of CAG repeat length was similar among groups except for SCA1 gene that showed a higher percentage of longer normal alleles in MSA-C as compared to MSA-P and controls (p < 0.0001). This study supports the utility of polyQ genetic testing in the differential diagnosis of MSA, and may suggest a possible role of SCA1 repeat length as risk factor for MSA-C.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development of CRC. With the deep understanding of TME function, growing studies have demonstrated that alteration in tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and gene expressions are associated with clinical outcomes of various tumors. In this study, we aimed to recognize critical prognostic genes involved in immune states in TME of CRC. Hence, the proportion of TICs and the number of immune and stromal components in CRC samples from TCGA datasets were calculated by the use of CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE calculation methods. Different assays were applied to collect differential expression genes (DEGs) shared by the ImmuneScore and StromalScore. DEGs were further analyzed by the use of univariate Cox regression. Our attention focused on neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) which was highly expressed in CRC specimens and associated with an advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis of CRC patients. KEGG assays revealed that NAV3 may be involved in Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, FoxO signaling pathway, and human papillomavirus infection. Correlation assays showed that macrophage M0 and B cells memory, NK cells activated, dendritic cells resting, T cells CD4 memory activated, and T cells CD8 were correlated with NAV3 expression, indicating that NAV3 may represent the immune status of TME. Finally, RT-PCR confirmed that NAV3 expression was distinctly increased in CRC cells, and its knockdown suppressed the proliferation of CRC cells. Overall, NAV3 could be used as a novel predictor for TME of CRC and might be a novel prognostic biomarker. In the future, drugs targeting NAV3 might be developed as a potential immunotherapy for CRC patients.",

OBJECTIVE: Understanding the body composition (BC) of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) could help to delay disease progression and improve treatment efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess BC parameters, including bone mineral density (BMD), and to find new biomarkers that can be early indicators for weight loss in patients with HD. METHODS: Twenty-one age- and sex-matched patients with HD and 29 healthy controls (CT) were enrolled. For each patient, body weight (BW), height, and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. BC and BMD were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subsamples were created according to sex and percent fat mass (FM) (obese and nonobese). All analyses were carried out using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: In all comparisons, BMD and T-score were lower in the HD group, but were not correlated with lean body mass (LBM) or FM. In the HD group, LBM and truncal fat were mostly reduced, except in women with HD whose BC appeared to be less affected by the disease than men. Furthermore, LBM (r = 0.80) and truncal fat (r = 0.68) were better correlated with BW than BMI (r = 0.56).

Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic, fully penetrant neurodegenerative disorder. Widespread white matter damage affects the brain of patients with HD at very early stages of the disease. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) is a novel method to investigate the contribution of individual crossing fibers to the white matter damage and to detect possible alterations in both fiber density and fiber-bundle morphology. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DW-MRS), on the other hand, quantifies the motion of brain metabolites in vivo, thus enabling the investigation of microstructural alteration of specific cell populations. The aim of this study was to identify novel specific microstructural imaging markers of white matter degeneration in HD, by combining FBA and DW-MRS. Twenty patients at an early stage of HD and 20 healthy controls were recruited in a monocentric study. Using diffusion imaging we observed alterations to the brain microstructure and their morphology in patients with HD.

                    "text": "Characterization of structural changes occurring in insulin at different time intervals at room temperature by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. BACKGROUND: Insulin storage above the temperature recommended by food and drug administration (FDA) causes decrease in its functional efficacy due to degradation and aggregation of its protein based active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that results poor glycemic control in diabetic patients. The aggregation of protein causes serious neurodegenerative diseases such as type-2 diabetes, Huntington disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been employed for the denaturation study of many proteins at the temperature above the recommendations of food and drug administration (FDA) (above 30  C) which indicates potential of technique for such studies. OBJECTIVE: SERS along with multivariate discriminating analysis techniques-based analysis of degradation of liquid pharmaceutical insulin protein after regular intervals of time at room temperature to analyze the structural changes in this protein during the storage of insulin pharmaceutical at room temperature. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) prepared by chemical reduction method are used as SERS active substrate for the surface enhancement of the insulin spectral signal. SERS spectral measurements of insulin were collected from eight different samples of insulin in the time range of 7pm to 7am first at fridge temperature (5  C), second after half hour and next six with the time difference of 2 hours each time at room temperature. The acquired SERS spectral data was preprocessed and analyzed. SERS structural transformations detection and discrimination potential in insulin was further confirmed by applying multivariate discriminating analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least square regression analysis (PLSR). RESULTS: SERS significantly detects the structural changes produced in insulin even after 2h of insulin placement at room temperature. PCA successfully differentiates the insulin spectral data obtained after regular intervals of time according to PC-1 (77%) explained variance. Application of PLSR model provides quantitative confirmation of SERS efficiency, by providing insulin data regression coefficients plot, efficient prediction of time with calibration data set having 0.77 mean square absolute error of calibration (RMSAEC), validation data set with 0.80 mean square absolute error of prediction (RMSAEP) and 0.98 coefficient of determination (R2) for both calibration and validation data set.
