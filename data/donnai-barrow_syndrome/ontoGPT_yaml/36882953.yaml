input_text: 'Myopia control in Mendelian forms of myopia. PURPOSE: To study the effectiveness
  of high-dose atropine for reducing eye growth in Mendelian myopia in children and
  mice. METHODS: We studied the effect of high-dose atropine in children with progressive
  myopia with and without a monogenetic cause. Children were matched for age and axial
  length (AL) in their first year of treatment. We considered annual AL progression
  rate as the outcome and compared rates with percentile charts of an untreated general
  population. We treated C57BL/6J mice featuring the myopic phenotype of Donnai-Barrow
  syndrome by selective inactivation of Lrp2 knock out (KO) and control mice (CTRL)
  daily with 1% atropine in the left eye and saline in the right eye, from postnatal
  days 30-56. Ocular biometry was measured using spectral-domain optical coherence
  tomography. Retinal dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were
  measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Children with a
  Mendelian form of myopia had average baseline spherical equivalent (SE) -7.6 +-
  2.5D and AL 25.8 +- 0.3 mm; children with non-Mendelian myopia had average SE -7.3
  +- 2.9 D and AL 25.6 +- 0.9 mm. During atropine treatment, the annual AL progression
  rate was 0.37 +- 0.08 and 0.39 +- 0.05 mm in the Mendelian myopes and non-Mendelian
  myopes, respectively. Compared with progression rates of untreated general population
  (0.47 mm/year), atropine reduced AL progression with 27% in Mendelian myopes and
  23% in non-Mendelian myopes. Atropine significantly reduced AL growth in both KO
  and CTRL mice (male, KO: -40 +- 15; CTRL: -42 +- 10; female, KO: -53 +- 15; CTRL:
  -62 +- 3 mum). The DA and DOPAC levels 2 and 24 h after atropine treatment were
  slightly, albeit non-significantly, elevated. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose atropine had
  the same effect on AL in high myopic children with and without a known monogenetic
  cause. In mice featuring a severe form of Mendelian myopia, atropine reduced AL
  progression. This suggests that atropine can reduce myopia progression even in the
  presence of a strong monogenic driver.'
