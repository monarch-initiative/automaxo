input_text: 'Cochlear implantation in Donnai-Barrow syndrome. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE:
  Donnai-Barrow syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with severe
  sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Several ocular abnormalities have also been described
  in this syndrome, including hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, myopia
  and retinal detachment. The condition is also associated with diaphragmatic hernia,
  exomphalos, absent corpus callosum and developmental delay. We describe the first
  recorded case of cochlear implantation in this rare disorder. CLINICAL PRESENTATION:
  This case of Donnai-Barrow syndrome was identified from our paediatric cochlear
  implant database. A case-note review was performed identifying patient demographics,
  operative findings and surgical outcome. In addition, pre- and post-operative auditory
  and communication performance was analysed. INTERVENTION: The child initially received
  a right cochlear implant at 39 months of age, but unfortunately the device failed
  4 years post-operatively. Subsequently, bilateral simultaneous cochlear implantation
  was performed. BKB scores were 98% for bilateral implant use when tested 2 years
  post-operatively. Individual testing revealed a score of 94% for the right ear alone,
  and 80% for the left. The child achieved a 100% score on sound localisation testing
  using 3 speakers. CONCLUSIONS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome is a rare cause of SNHL compounded
  by the potential for visual impairment. To our knowledge this is the first report
  of cochlear implantation to rehabilitate hearing loss in this condition.'
