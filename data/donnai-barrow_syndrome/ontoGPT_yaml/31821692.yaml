input_text: 'A prenatally diagnosed case of Donnai-Barrow syndrome: Highlighting the
  importance of whole exome sequencing in cases of consanguinity. Donnai-Barrow syndrome
  (DBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by typical craniofacial features,
  vision and hearing loss, intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum
  (ACC), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and omphalocele. This condition is
  associated with loss-of-function mutations in the LRP2 gene. Few cases have been
  described in the literature. In our case, CDH and ACC were prenatally diagnosed
  by ultrasound, and the fetus was the product of a first-degree union. Single-nucleotide
  polymorphism-microarray showed large regions of homozygosity. Whole exome sequencing
  (WES) was performed and revealed a homozygous frameshift pathogenic variant in LRP2
  (c.6978dupG). Here, we present a case of DBS, which diagnosed prenatally via WES
  in a fetus with CDH and ACC.'
