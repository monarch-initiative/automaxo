input_text: Ocular manifestations of Donnai-Barrow syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome
  is a rare autosomal recessive disorder first described in 1993. This report presents
  ocular manifestations of this rare autosomal recessive disorder through 2 additional
  cases. Ocular features include hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures,
  iris coloboma, high myopia, and retinal detachment. The extreme congenital myopia
  in these patients is a significant risk factor for retinal detachment, and prophylactic
  barrier photocoagulation may be considered to prevent retinal detachment and its
  associated functional disability.
