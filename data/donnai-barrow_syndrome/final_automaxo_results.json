                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Donnai-Barrow syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Several ocular abnormalities have also been described in this syndrome, including hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, myopia and retinal detachment. The condition is also associated with diaphragmatic hernia, exomphalos, absent corpus callosum and developmental delay. We describe the first recorded case of cochlear implantation in this rare disorder. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: This case of Donnai-Barrow syndrome was identified from our paediatric cochlear implant database. A case-note review was performed identifying patient demographics, operative findings and surgical outcome. In addition, pre- and post-operative auditory and communication performance was analysed. INTERVENTION: The child initially received a right cochlear implant at 39 months of age, but unfortunately the device failed 4 years post-operatively. Subsequently, bilateral simultaneous cochlear implantation was performed. BKB scores were 98% for bilateral implant use when tested 2 years post-operatively. Individual testing revealed a score of 94% for the right ear alone, and 80% for the left. The child achieved a 100% score on sound localisation testing using 3 speakers. CONCLUSIONS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome is a rare cause of SNHL compounded by the potential for visual impairment. To our knowledge this is the first report of cochlear implantation to rehabilitate hearing loss in this condition.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To present our experience treating hypotony maculopathy with a simple, minimally invasive, and removable ab interno tube Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion. METHODS: Under topical anesthesia a 5-0 polypropylene suture (Prolene; Ethicon) was inserted into the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube. The length of the tube was measured, and an external suture cauterization was performed to allow an easier and safer fixation in the tube. The suture was introduced into the tube itself with the viscoelastic 27-gauge cannula. RESULTS: This technique was performed in three cases of hypotony maculopathy with a complex history of medical treatments: a 4-year-old boy with Donnai-Barrow syndrome and previous pars plana vitrectomy that developed hypotony maculopathy the day after Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion and two male patients (69 and 49 years old) that underwent hypotony maculopathy after cyclophotocoagulation as a last option to reduce intraocular pressure. One of the men had three filtering surgeries, two 5-fluorouracil needlings and Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. The other male patient had keratoplasty and posterior Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. In the three cases, both hypotony and maculopathy were reversed within a week and a month, respectively, after Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion with no complications. When hypotony maculopathy develops it seems suitable to occlude completely the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube to swiftly reverse clinical and anatomic changes. CONCLUSION: Intraluminal Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion with cauterized suture is a simple, quick, reversible, and effective technique that may offer a minimally invasive way to resolve hypotony maculopathy in complex cases and avoid severe loss of vision.",

METHODS: Under topical anesthesia a 5-0 polypropylene suture (Prolene; Ethicon) was inserted into the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube. The length of the tube was measured, and an external suture cauterization was performed to allow an easier and safer fixation in the tube. The suture was introduced into the tube itself with the viscoelastic 27-gauge cannula. RESULTS: This technique was performed in three cases of hypotony maculopathy with a complex history of medical treatments: a 4-year-old boy with Donnai-Barrow syndrome and previous pars plana vitrectomy that developed hypotony maculopathy the day after Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion and two male patients (69 and 49 years old) that underwent hypotony maculopathy after cyclophotocoagulation as a last option to reduce intraocular pressure. One of the men had three filtering surgeries, two 5-fluorouracil needlings and Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. The other male patient had keratoplasty and posterior Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. In the three cases, both hypotony and maculopathy were reversed within a week and a month, respectively, after Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion with no complications. When hypotony maculopathy develops it seems suitable to occlude completely the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube to swiftly reverse clinical and anatomic changes. CONCLUSION: Intraluminal Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion with cauterized suture is a simple, quick, reversible, and effective technique that may offer a minimally invasive way to resolve hypotony maculopathy in complex cases and avoid severe loss of vision.",

Because of the acute presentation of an infant with multiple life-threatening defects, a genetic diagnosis of a rare disorder took weeks to delineate. CLINICAL FINDINGS: This case describes a late preterm infant who presented at birth with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tetralogy of Fallot, cleft lip, low-set ears, and hypertelorism. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome was the final diagnosis confirmed by a defect observed on the LRP2 (2q31.1) gene using sequence analysis. This is a rare disorder that presents with a variety of phenotypic features in infants. INTERVENTIONS: Initial neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room included intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and oxygen supplementation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was initiated from day of life 3 to 15. Initial surgery included correction of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and further surgical procedures included tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, circumcision, ventricular septal defect repair, and cleft lip repair. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies were also initiated. OUTCOMES: The infant was transported to a pediatric rehabilitation facility at 6 months of life for further management of his chronic lung disease requiring tracheostomy with ventilator dependence. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of genetic syndromes can improve family education and guide treatment interventions. An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple congenital defects.

Because of the acute presentation of an infant with multiple life-threatening defects, a genetic diagnosis of a rare disorder took weeks to delineate. CLINICAL FINDINGS: This case describes a late preterm infant who presented at birth with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tetralogy of Fallot, cleft lip, low-set ears, and hypertelorism. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome was the final diagnosis confirmed by a defect observed on the LRP2 (2q31.1) gene using sequence analysis. This is a rare disorder that presents with a variety of phenotypic features in infants. INTERVENTIONS: Initial neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room included intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and oxygen supplementation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was initiated from day of life 3 to 15. Initial surgery included correction of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and further surgical procedures included tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, circumcision, ventricular septal defect repair, and cleft lip repair.
