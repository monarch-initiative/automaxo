                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To study the effectiveness of high-dose atropine for reducing eye growth in Mendelian myopia in children and mice. METHODS: We studied the effect of high-dose atropine in children with progressive myopia with and without a monogenetic cause. Children were matched for age and axial length (AL) in their first year of treatment. We considered annual AL progression rate as the outcome and compared rates with percentile charts of an untreated general population. We treated C57BL/6J mice featuring the myopic phenotype of Donnai-Barrow syndrome by selective inactivation of Lrp2 knock out (KO) and control mice (CTRL) daily with 1% atropine in the left eye and saline in the right eye, from postnatal days 30-56. Ocular biometry was measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Retinal dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Children with a Mendelian form of myopia had average baseline spherical equivalent (SE) -7.6 +- 2.5D and AL 25.8 +- 0.3 mm; children with non-Mendelian myopia had average SE -7.3 +- 2.9 D and AL 25.6 +- 0.9 mm. During atropine treatment, the annual AL progression rate was 0.37 +- 0.08 and 0.39 +- 0.05 mm in the Mendelian myopes and non-Mendelian myopes, respectively. Compared with progression rates of untreated general population (0.47 mm/year), atropine reduced AL progression with 27% in Mendelian myopes and 23% in non-Mendelian myopes. Atropine significantly reduced AL growth in both KO and CTRL mice (male, KO: -40 +- 15; CTRL: -42 +- 10; female, KO: -53 +- 15; CTRL: -62 +- 3 mum). The DA and DOPAC levels 2 and 24 h after atropine treatment were slightly, albeit non-significantly, elevated. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose atropine had the same effect on AL in high myopic children with and without a known monogenetic cause. In mice featuring a severe form of Mendelian myopia, atropine reduced AL progression. This suggests that atropine can reduce myopia progression even in the presence of a strong monogenic driver.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A genetic disorder should be considered when an infant presents with multiple congenital anomalies. Because of the acute presentation of an infant with multiple life-threatening defects, a genetic diagnosis of a rare disorder took weeks to delineate. CLINICAL FINDINGS: This case describes a late preterm infant who presented at birth with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tetralogy of Fallot, cleft lip, low-set ears, and hypertelorism. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome was the final diagnosis confirmed by a defect observed on the LRP2 (2q31.1) gene using sequence analysis. This is a rare disorder that presents with a variety of phenotypic features in infants. INTERVENTIONS: Initial neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room included intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and oxygen supplementation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was initiated from day of life 3 to 15. Initial surgery included correction of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and further surgical procedures included tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, circumcision, ventricular septal defect repair, and cleft lip repair. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies were also initiated. OUTCOMES: The infant was transported to a pediatric rehabilitation facility at 6 months of life for further management of his chronic lung disease requiring tracheostomy with ventilator dependence. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of genetic syndromes can improve family education and guide treatment interventions. An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple congenital defects. Infants with Donnai-Barrow syndrome should have thorough cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and renal examinations due to the gene mutation effects on those systems.",

Several ocular abnormalities have also been described in this syndrome, including hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, myopia and retinal detachment. The condition is also associated with diaphragmatic hernia, exomphalos, absent corpus callosum and developmental delay. We describe the first recorded case of cochlear implantation in this rare disorder. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: This case of Donnai-Barrow syndrome was identified from our paediatric cochlear implant database. A case-note review was performed identifying patient demographics, operative findings and surgical outcome. In addition, pre- and post-operative auditory and communication performance was analysed. INTERVENTION: The child initially received a right cochlear implant at 39 months of age, but unfortunately the device failed 4 years post-operatively. Subsequently, bilateral simultaneous cochlear implantation was performed. BKB scores were 98% for bilateral implant use when tested 2 years post-operatively. Individual testing revealed a score of 94% for the right ear alone, and 80% for the left. The child achieved a 100% score on sound localisation testing using 3 speakers. CONCLUSIONS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome is a rare cause of SNHL compounded by the potential for visual impairment. To our knowledge this is the first report of cochlear implantation to rehabilitate hearing loss in this condition.",

A literature review and a retrospective analysis of our cochlear implant database were performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, in the English literature, there was only one case reported with CCA who had undergone CI surgery. This case had Donnai-Barrow syndrome. In the Cukurova University School of Medicine Department of Otorhinolaryngology database, 5 of the 1317 patients who underwent CI surgery who had CCA were selected. The patients' demographic characteristics, operative findings, surgical outcomes, and additional disabilities were investigated. The patients' preoperative and postoperative Listening Progress Profile (LiP) and Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS) tests were done to analyze the auditory performances. RESULTS: The participants of the study were 5 (0.38%) individuals (2 male and 3 female patients; ages 5.5, 7.5, 8, 9, and 12 years). Two of the patients had total agenesis, and the other three had partial agenesis of the CCA. In the histories of the patients, one patient had parental consanguinity, and one had febrile convulsion. No patient had an additional disability. None had experienced device failure. No patients were non-users or limited users of cochlear implants. Postoperative LiP and MAIS test scores were improved for all patients nearly as the patients without any deformity. They showed normal auditory performance in the analysis in their postoperative 48 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Patients who had CCA are good candidates for CI surgery.",

The suture was introduced into the tube itself with the viscoelastic 27-gauge cannula. RESULTS: This technique was performed in three cases of hypotony maculopathy with a complex history of medical treatments: a 4-year-old boy with Donnai-Barrow syndrome and previous pars plana vitrectomy that developed hypotony maculopathy the day after Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion and two male patients (69 and 49 years old) that underwent hypotony maculopathy after cyclophotocoagulation as a last option to reduce intraocular pressure. One of the men had three filtering surgeries, two 5-fluorouracil needlings and Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. The other male patient had keratoplasty and posterior Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. In the three cases, both hypotony and maculopathy were reversed within a week and a month, respectively, after Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion with no complications. When hypotony maculopathy develops it seems suitable to occlude completely the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube to swiftly reverse clinical and anatomic changes. CONCLUSION: Intraluminal Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion with cauterized suture is a simple, quick, reversible, and effective technique that may offer a minimally invasive way to resolve hypotony maculopathy in complex cases and avoid severe loss of vision.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A genetic disorder should be considered when an infant presents with multiple congenital anomalies. Because of the acute presentation of an infant with multiple life-threatening defects, a genetic diagnosis of a rare disorder took weeks to delineate. CLINICAL FINDINGS: This case describes a late preterm infant who presented at birth with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tetralogy of Fallot, cleft lip, low-set ears, and hypertelorism. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome was the final diagnosis confirmed by a defect observed on the LRP2 (2q31.1) gene using sequence analysis. This is a rare disorder that presents with a variety of phenotypic features in infants. INTERVENTIONS: Initial neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room included intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and oxygen supplementation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was initiated from day of life 3 to 15. Initial surgery included correction of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and further surgical procedures included tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, circumcision, ventricular septal defect repair, and cleft lip repair. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies were also initiated. OUTCOMES: The infant was transported to a pediatric rehabilitation facility at 6 months of life for further management of his chronic lung disease requiring tracheostomy with ventilator dependence. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of genetic syndromes can improve family education and guide treatment interventions. An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple congenital defects. Infants with Donnai-Barrow syndrome should have thorough cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and renal examinations due to the gene mutation effects on those systems.",

                    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a common birth defect with high mortality and morbidity. Two hundred seventy CDH patients were ascertained, carefully phenotyped, and classified as isolated (diaphragm defects alone) or complex (with additional anomalies) cases. We established different strategies to reveal CDH-critical chromosome loci and genes in humans. Candidate genes for sequencing analyses were selected from CDH animal models, genetic intervals of recurrent chromosomal aberration in humans, such as 15q26.1-q26.2 or 1q41-q42.12, as well as genes in the retinoic acid and related pathways and those known to be involved in embryonic lung development. For instance, FOG2, GATA4, and COUP-TFII are all needed for both normal diaphragm and lung development and are likely all in the same genetic and molecular pathway. Linkage analysis was applied first in a large inbred family and then in four multiplex families with Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) associated with CDH. 10K SNP chip and microsatellite markers revealed a DBS locus on chromosome 2q23.3-q31.1. We applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) techniques to over 30, mostly complex, CDH patients and found a de novo microdeletion in a patient with Fryns syndrome related to CDH. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques allowed us to further define the deletion interval. Our aim is to identify genetic intervals and, in those, to prioritize genes that might reveal molecular pathways, mutations in any step of which, might contribute to the same phenotype. More important, the elucidation of pathways may ultimately provide clues to treatment strategies.",

OUTCOMES: The infant was transported to a pediatric rehabilitation facility at 6 months of life for further management of his chronic lung disease requiring tracheostomy with ventilator dependence. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of genetic syndromes can improve family education and guide treatment interventions. An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple congenital defects. Infants with Donnai-Barrow syndrome should have thorough cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and renal examinations due to the gene mutation effects on those systems.",

METHODS: Under topical anesthesia a 5-0 polypropylene suture (Prolene; Ethicon) was inserted into the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube. The length of the tube was measured, and an external suture cauterization was performed to allow an easier and safer fixation in the tube. The suture was introduced into the tube itself with the viscoelastic 27-gauge cannula. RESULTS: This technique was performed in three cases of hypotony maculopathy with a complex history of medical treatments: a 4-year-old boy with Donnai-Barrow syndrome and previous pars plana vitrectomy that developed hypotony maculopathy the day after Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion and two male patients (69 and 49 years old) that underwent hypotony maculopathy after cyclophotocoagulation as a last option to reduce intraocular pressure. One of the men had three filtering surgeries, two 5-fluorouracil needlings and Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. The other male patient had keratoplasty and posterior Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. In the three cases, both hypotony and maculopathy were reversed within a week and a month, respectively, after Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion with no complications. When hypotony maculopathy develops it seems suitable to occlude completely the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube to swiftly reverse clinical and anatomic changes. CONCLUSION: Intraluminal Ahmed glaucoma valve occlusion with cauterized suture is a simple, quick, reversible, and effective technique that may offer a minimally invasive way to resolve hypotony maculopathy in complex cases and avoid severe loss of vision.",

An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple congenital defects. Infants with Donnai-Barrow syndrome should have thorough cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and renal examinations due to the gene mutation effects on those systems.",

Two hundred seventy CDH patients were ascertained, carefully phenotyped, and classified as isolated (diaphragm defects alone) or complex (with additional anomalies) cases. We established different strategies to reveal CDH-critical chromosome loci and genes in humans. Candidate genes for sequencing analyses were selected from CDH animal models, genetic intervals of recurrent chromosomal aberration in humans, such as 15q26.1-q26.2 or 1q41-q42.12, as well as genes in the retinoic acid and related pathways and those known to be involved in embryonic lung development. For instance, FOG2, GATA4, and COUP-TFII are all needed for both normal diaphragm and lung development and are likely all in the same genetic and molecular pathway. Linkage analysis was applied first in a large inbred family and then in four multiplex families with Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) associated with CDH. 10K SNP chip and microsatellite markers revealed a DBS locus on chromosome 2q23.3-q31.1. We applied array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) techniques to over 30, mostly complex, CDH patients and found a de novo microdeletion in a patient with Fryns syndrome related to CDH. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques allowed us to further define the deletion interval. Our aim is to identify genetic intervals and, in those, to prioritize genes that might reveal molecular pathways, mutations in any step of which, might contribute to the same phenotype. More important, the elucidation of pathways may ultimately provide clues to treatment strategies.",

A literature review and a retrospective analysis of our cochlear implant database were performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, in the English literature, there was only one case reported with CCA who had undergone CI surgery. This case had Donnai-Barrow syndrome. In the Cukurova University School of Medicine Department of Otorhinolaryngology database, 5 of the 1317 patients who underwent CI surgery who had CCA were selected. The patients' demographic characteristics, operative findings, surgical outcomes, and additional disabilities were investigated. The patients' preoperative and postoperative Listening Progress Profile (LiP) and Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS) tests were done to analyze the auditory performances. RESULTS: The participants of the study were 5 (0.38%) individuals (2 male and 3 female patients; ages 5.5, 7.5, 8, 9, and 12 years). Two of the patients had total agenesis, and the other three had partial agenesis of the CCA. In the histories of the patients, one patient had parental consanguinity, and one had febrile convulsion. No patient had an additional disability. None had experienced device failure. No patients were non-users or limited users of cochlear implants.

                    "abstract": "Two siblings, from a consanguineous Iraqi family, were investigated to identify the underlying genetic cause of their high myopia, esotropia, vitreous changes and cataract. Subsequent investigation identified low molecular weight proteinuria as part of their syndrome. Exome sequencing of one of the probands revealed a new non-synonymous variant in the LRP2 gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation and segregation in the family. No mutation was identified in COL9A1/2, COL11A1/2, or COL2A1 genes. The variant (c.11483A>G; p.Asp3828Gly) is predicted to be damaging and is conserved among vertebrate species. Mutations in LRP2 have been shown to cause the Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) or facio-oculo-acoustico-renal (FOAR) syndrome, a syndrome associated with facial dysmorphism, ocular anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss, low molecular weight proteinuria, and diaphragmatic hernia and absent corpus callosum, although there is variability in the expression of some features. This family shows a milder phenotype with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome and only a few features of the DBS, including microglobulinuria. The presence of microglobulinuria was only detected after molecular results were known. In conclusion, with the identification of a new mutation in LRP2 associated with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome, we have broadened the phenotypic spectrum of LRP2 mutations.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To study the effectiveness of high-dose atropine for reducing eye growth in Mendelian myopia in children and mice. METHODS: We studied the effect of high-dose atropine in children with progressive myopia with and without a monogenetic cause. Children were matched for age and axial length (AL) in their first year of treatment. We considered annual AL progression rate as the outcome and compared rates with percentile charts of an untreated general population. We treated C57BL/6J mice featuring the myopic phenotype of Donnai-Barrow syndrome by selective inactivation of Lrp2 knock out (KO) and control mice (CTRL) daily with 1% atropine in the left eye and saline in the right eye, from postnatal days 30-56. Ocular biometry was measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Retinal dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Children with a Mendelian form of myopia had average baseline spherical equivalent (SE) -7.6 +- 2.5D and AL 25.8 +- 0.3 mm; children with non-Mendelian myopia had average SE -7.3 +- 2.9 D and AL 25.6 +- 0.9 mm. During atropine treatment, the annual AL progression rate was 0.37 +- 0.08 and 0.39 +- 0.05 mm in the Mendelian myopes and non-Mendelian myopes, respectively. Compared with progression rates of untreated general population (0.47 mm/year), atropine reduced AL progression with 27% in Mendelian myopes and 23% in non-Mendelian myopes. Atropine significantly reduced AL growth in both KO and CTRL mice (male, KO: -40 +- 15; CTRL: -42 +- 10; female, KO: -53 +- 15; CTRL: -62 +- 3 mum). The DA and DOPAC levels 2 and 24 h after atropine treatment were slightly, albeit non-significantly, elevated. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose atropine had the same effect on AL in high myopic children with and without a known monogenetic cause. In mice featuring a severe form of Mendelian myopia, atropine reduced AL progression. This suggests that atropine can reduce myopia progression even in the presence of a strong monogenic driver.",

Because of the acute presentation of an infant with multiple life-threatening defects, a genetic diagnosis of a rare disorder took weeks to delineate. CLINICAL FINDINGS: This case describes a late preterm infant who presented at birth with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tetralogy of Fallot, cleft lip, low-set ears, and hypertelorism. PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Donnai-Barrow syndrome was the final diagnosis confirmed by a defect observed on the LRP2 (2q31.1) gene using sequence analysis. This is a rare disorder that presents with a variety of phenotypic features in infants. INTERVENTIONS: Initial neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room included intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and oxygen supplementation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was initiated from day of life 3 to 15. Initial surgery included correction of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and further surgical procedures included tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, circumcision, ventricular septal defect repair, and cleft lip repair. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies were also initiated. OUTCOMES: The infant was transported to a pediatric rehabilitation facility at 6 months of life for further management of his chronic lung disease requiring tracheostomy with ventilator dependence. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of genetic syndromes can improve family education and guide treatment interventions. An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple congenital defects. Infants with Donnai-Barrow syndrome should have thorough cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and renal examinations due to the gene mutation effects on those systems.",

Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation and segregation in the family. No mutation was identified in COL9A1/2, COL11A1/2, or COL2A1 genes.

This family shows a milder phenotype with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome and only a few features of the DBS, including microglobulinuria.

                    "abstract": "Two siblings, from a consanguineous Iraqi family, were investigated to identify the underlying genetic cause of their high myopia, esotropia, vitreous changes and cataract. Subsequent investigation identified low molecular weight proteinuria as part of their syndrome. Exome sequencing of one of the probands revealed a new non-synonymous variant in the LRP2 gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation and segregation in the family. No mutation was identified in COL9A1/2, COL11A1/2, or COL2A1 genes. The variant (c.11483A>G; p.Asp3828Gly) is predicted to be damaging and is conserved among vertebrate species. Mutations in LRP2 have been shown to cause the Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS) or facio-oculo-acoustico-renal (FOAR) syndrome, a syndrome associated with facial dysmorphism, ocular anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss, low molecular weight proteinuria, and diaphragmatic hernia and absent corpus callosum, although there is variability in the expression of some features. This family shows a milder phenotype with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome and only a few features of the DBS, including microglobulinuria. The presence of microglobulinuria was only detected after molecular results were known. In conclusion, with the identification of a new mutation in LRP2 associated with a predominant eye phenotype similar to the Stickler syndrome, we have broadened the phenotypic spectrum of LRP2 mutations.
