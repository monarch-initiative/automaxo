Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 107-110. Continious renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a well recognizied treatment of choice in acute renal failure, however CRRT became a preferred treatment of metabolic emergencies with high leucine and ammonia levels like Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). MSUD is a rare metabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the activity of the branched-chain a-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The toxic accumulation of branched chain amino acids during acute metabolic decompensation is associated with the appearance of permanent neurological symptoms. Four patients were admitted to our pediatric intensive care department with complains of poor feeding, vomitting, irratibility and coma. Physical examination of the neonates were similar having stupor, hypotonia and depressed newborn reflexes. The leucine levels were between 930-4400 mumol/L. The diagnosis of MSUD was confirmed in all four. They were treated successfully with high flow CRRT having the rates were between 4120 ml/h/1.73m2 and 9830 ml/h/1.73m2. Early treatment is essential to prevent neurotoxicity and death. CRRT is a choice of treatment in metabolic crisis of MSUD. Herein, we report the successful treatment of acute metabolic decompensation of MSUD with CRRT in 4 neonates.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data describing the technical aspects of living donor (LD) domino liver transplantation (DLT) in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) are limited. The largest published series includes only 3 cases. One great challenge of this procedure is to ensure adequate vascular stumps for the LD, the MSUD patient, and the recipient of the domino graft. Here, we describe our experience in 11 cases of LD-DLT in MSUD, highlighting the technical aspects of LD-DLT. METHODS: From September 2012 to September 2017, 11 patients with MSUD underwent LD liver transplantation at our institution, and MSUD livers were used as domino grafts in 11 children. RESULTS: (1) MSUD patients: 10 patients received a left lateral segment. The donor's left hepatic vein (HV) was anastomosed to the confluence of the recipient's 3 HVs. No vascular grafts (VG) were required for portal vein (PV) anastomosis. Single arterial anastomosis was performed with microsurgery in 10 of 11 patients. (2) MSUD graft recipients: In 8 cases, HV reconstruction was performed between the graft's HV confluence and the recipient's HV confluence, and in 3 cases, a vena cava triangulation was necessary; 6 MSUD grafts required HV venoplasty. No VG were needed for HV reconstruction. VG were used for PV reconstruction in 3 cases due to sclerotic PV. In 2 cases, double arterial anastomoses were performed in the MSUD liver. All patients remain alive and well. CONCLUSIONS: Living donor liver transplantation followed by DLT for MSUD is a complex procedure and demands technical refinement. Special attention must be paid to vascular reconstruction.",

Because of a sufficient extrahepatic enzyme activity in non-MSUD individuals, the organ of MSUD patients can be used as a domino graft. We performed a retrospective data collection of all LTs for MSUD carried out at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (2016-2018). Moreover, data from all consecutive domino LTs of the MSUD grafts either transplanted at our institution or allocated to other transplant centers were analyzed. During the study period, 15 LTs in MSUD patients were performed (12 children, 3 adults; median age, 10.9 years; range, 0.3-26.1 years). Biliary complications occurred in 20%, and 13.3% suffered from bleeding complications. No further surgical problems occurred. At present, all MSUD patients are alive with a well-functioning liver graft and on an unrestricted diet. In total, 14 consecutive domino LTs were performed. No surgical complications requiring intervention occurred. One patient died because of HCC relapse, and all other patients are alive with good liver graft function. In conclusion, the use of MSUD livers as domino grafts is safe and allows application of LT in MSUD patients without net extraction of a liver graft from the limited donor pool.",

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is an emergency option in affected newborns, mostly performed as ultima ratio. We report our 10-year experience using emergency RRT in newborns with UCD, OA and MSUD. Twelve newborns (eight with UCD, two with methylmalonic acidemia and two with MSUD) underwent emergency RRT. The overall survival rate to RRT was 58.3%. Hyperammonemic newborns required earlier RRT with respect to MSUD patients (75 (65-102) vs 301 (192-410) h of life, P < 0.01). Hyperammonemic neonates surviving (n = 5) and non-surviving (n = 5) the acute neonatal decompensation showed similar birth weight (P = 0.690), duration of intubation (P = 0.917), ammonia at onset (P = 0.916) and at the start of RRT (P = 0.426), age at RRT (P = 0.999) and duration of coma before RRT (P = 0.691). Remarkably, all survivors quickly responded to RRT, with ammonia concentration less than 300 mumol/L after 8 h of treatment. One patient with UCD successfully treated by neonatal RRT died at 4 months of life because of sepsis. All patients with MSUD had normalized leucine levels after 12 h of RRT, surviving the acute neonatal decompenstation. All long-term survivors (five liver transplanted, one waiting for liver transplantation) currently show normal or near-normal neurological development (48 +- 39 months of age). Early response to RRT was associated with survival irrespective of pre-treatment picture. RRT can be considered even in huge neonatal metabolic decompensations. Early liver transplantation may be an option for select patients.",

We collected data about treatment, survival, hospitalization, metabolic control, and liver transplantation from patients with classic (i.e., severe; n = 176), intermediate (n = 6) and intermittent (n = 2) forms of MSUD. A total of 13,589 amino acid profiles were used to analyze leucine tolerance, amino acid homeostasis, estimated cerebral amino acid uptake, quantitative responses to anabolic therapy, and metabolic control after liver transplantation. Standard instruments were used to measure neuropsychiatric outcomes. Despite advances in clinical care, classic MSUD remains a morbid and potentially fatal disorder. Stringent dietary therapy maintains metabolic variables within acceptable limits but is challenging to implement, fails to restore appropriate concentration relationships among circulating amino acids, and does not fully prevent cognitive and psychiatric disabilities. Liver transplantation eliminates the need for a prescription diet and safeguards patients from life-threatening metabolic crises, but is associated with predictable morbidities and does not reverse pre-existing neurological sequelae. There is a critical unmet need for safe and effective disease-modifying therapies for MSUD which can be implemented early in life. The biochemistry and physiology of MSUD and its response to liver transplantation afford key insights into the design of new therapies based on gene replacement or editing.",

STUDY DESIGN: A single center, retrospective review collected clinical data including branched-chain amino acid (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) levels following liver transplant and determined achievement of an ideal long-term outcome profile of a first allograft stable on immunosuppression monotherapy, normal growth, and absence of common transplant-related sequelae. RESULTS: Of 77 patients meeting inclusion criteria identified, 23 were long-term (>=10-year) survivors and were additionally assessed for ideal outcome attainment. Patient and graft survival were 100% and 99%, respectively, and all patients were on an unrestricted protein intake diet. Although significant variation was noted in mean isoleucine (P < .01) and leucine (P < .05) levels postliver transplantation, no difference was seen in valine (P = .29) and overall clinical impact was likely negligible as metabolic stability was achieved and sustained beyond 3 years postliver transplantation and no metabolic crises were identified. Of 23 long-term survivors with available data, 9 (39%) achieved all composite metrics determined to define \"ideal\" outcomes in pediatric postliver transplantation populations. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplant enables long-term metabolic stability for patients with maple syrup urine disease. A combination of experience and improvement in both pre- and postliver transplantation care has enabled excellent survival and minimal comorbidities following transplant.",

Patients were stratified into three clusters according to clinical outcome at the time of data collection, including developmental, clinical, and IQ data. A fourth cluster comprised of two early childhood deaths; a third patient died as an adult. We present neuroimaging and electroencephalography together with clinical and biochemical data. Incidence of MSUD (1972-2018) was 1 in 147 975. Overall good clinical outcomes were achieved with 15/18 patients alive and with essentially normal functioning (with only the lowest performing cluster lying beyond a single SD on their full scale intelligence quotient). Molecular genetic analysis revealed genotypes hitherto not reported, including a possible digenic inheritance state for the BCKDHA and DBT genes in one family. Treatment has been based on early implementation of emergency treatment, diet, close monitoring, and even dialysis in the setting of acute metabolic decompensation. A plasma leucine >=400 mumol/L (outside therapeutic range) was more frequently observed in infancy or during adolescence, possibly due to infections, hormonal changes, or noncompliance. Children require careful management during metabolic decompensations in early childhood, and this represented a key risk period in our cohort. A high level of metabolic control can be achieved through diet with early implementation of a \"sick day\" regime and, in some cases, dialysis as a rescue therapy. The Irish cohort, despite largely classical phenotypes, achieved good outcomes in the NBS era, underlining the importance of early diagnosis and skilled multidisciplinary team management.",

Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

The most technically challenging part of LD-Domino LT is the reconstruction of the vessels. For the reconstruction of HVs, the native HVs were exteriorized as far as possible using a CUSA because longer extensive HVs are essential for facilitating the reconstruction. At the back table, the HVs of the domino graft were sutured together, and the single cuff of the HVs was anastomosed to the IVC by joining the orifices. The HAs, the presence of insufficient length, and multiple vessels in the whole liver rendered the reconstruction more difficult. We determined the dividing sites of the vessels according to the preoperative 3D-CT findings obtained in two institutions. This is the first case series using grafts in DLT obtained from LDLT for patients with MSUD between two institutions. In conclusion, LD-Domino LT is a safe and feasible therapeutic option to expand the donor pool by technical refinement in the reconstruction of the second recipient. Further studies with a greater accumulation of patients and a longer follow-up will be necessary to establish LD-Domino LT using an MSUD donor.",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by an inborn error in metabolism resulting from a deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex activity. This blockage leads to accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine and valine, as well as their corresponding alpha-keto acids and alpha-hydroxy acids. High levels of BCAAs are associated with neurological dysfunction and the role of pro- and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the neurological dysfunction of MSUD is still unclear. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effect of an acute BCAA pool administration on BDNF levels and on the pro-BDNF cleavage-related proteins S100A10 and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in rat brains. Our results demonstrated that acute Hyper-BCAA (H-BCAA) exposure during the early postnatal period increases pro-BDNF and total-BDNF levels in the hippocampus and striatum. Moreover, tPA levels were significantly decreased, without modifications in the tPA transcript levels in the hippocampus and striatum. On the other hand, the S100A10 mRNA and S100A10 protein levels were not changed in the hippocampus and striatum. In the 30-day-old rats, we observed increased pro-BDNF, total-BDNF and tPA levels only in the striatum, whereas the tPA and S100A10 mRNA expression and the immunocontent of S100A10 were not altered. In conclusion, we demonstrated that acute H-BCAA administration increases the pro-BDNF/total-BDNF ratio and decreases the tPA levels in animals, suggesting that the BCAA effect may depend, at least in part, on changes in BDNF post-translational processing.

Patients with MSUD are at risk of life-threatening metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy. These episodes are often triggered by physiological stress. Only few cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers have been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the favorable outcome of a pregnancy in a woman with classical MSUD. She presented in the metabolic outpatient clinic in week 7 of gestation. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations were measured at least weekly to adjust dietary leucine intake. Despite excellent compliance, leucine concentrations frequently exceeded the target value of < 300 mumol/L during the first trimester. From the second trimester until delivery, protein and leucine intake increased continuously to about threefold compared to pre-pregnancy values. To maximize patient safety during delivery and the postpartum period, a detailed plan including peripartal infusion therapy, dietary recommendations and monitoring parameters was developed. Primary Caesarean section was performed in week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.",

Despite the perioperative prophylactic administration of 12.5% hypertonic dextrose solution with insulin and a 20% intralipid emulsion, the blood levels of the branched-chain amino acids increased dramatically during surgery, consistent with an acute intraoperative metabolic decompensation. However, these blood levels normalized soon after liver transplantation with an excellent outcome.

PC deficiency causes abnormal blood clotting that is difficult to regulate by anticoagulative treatments. Four reports of PC deficiency treated with LTx have been published; however, no report of DLT as a therapy for PC deficiency is available. We describe a case of a 23-month-old girl who received DLT for compound heterozygous PC deficiency. Her PC activity was below 5%. She developed intracranial lesion and frequent refractory purpura fulminans. Both her parents had heterozygous mutations of PC genes and were excluded as living donors. Furthermore, she was a low priority on the waiting list of deceased-donor transplantation. We performed living DLT using the liver from a patient with MSUD. Activated PC concentrate safely supported the perioperative period. After DLT, she maintained normal PC activities and BCAA levels. This is the first case of PC deficiency successfully treated by living DLT with MSUD. We propose that DLT using liver from patients with MSUD is a treatment option for PC deficiency. ",

The present study evaluates efficiency and complications of CKRT in children with IEM. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with IEM who underwent CKRT in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units were analyzed. CKRT were initiated in patients with persistently high blood ammonia levels (>= 500 mumol/L), blood ammonia levels > 250 mumol/L in the presence of moderate encephalopathy, high blood leucine levels (>= 1500 mumol/L), and blood leucine levels < 1500 mumol/L in the presence of deteriorating neurological status or persistent metabolic acidosis. RESULTS: Of 22 patients enrolled, nine (40.9%) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), eight (36.4%) urea cycle disorders (UCD), and five (22.7%) organic acidemias (OA). Median age was 72.3 [9.9-1040.8] days. In total, 28 dialysis sessions were analyzed [16 (57.1%) continuous venovenous hemodialysis, and 12 (42.9%) continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration]. A significant decrease was noted in leucine levels (from 1608.4 +- 885.3 to 314.6 +- 109.9 micromol/L) of patients with MSUD, while ammonia levels were significantly decreased in patients with UCD and OA (from 1279.9 +- 612.1 to 85.1 +- 21.6 micromol/L). The most frequent complications of CKRT were thrombocytopenia (60.7%), hypotension (53.6%), and hypocalcemia (42.9%). Median age of patients with hypotension treated with vasoactive medications was significantly lower than median age of those with normal blood pressure. CONCLUSION: CKRT is a reliable approach for effective and rapid removal of toxic metabolites in children with IEM, and CKRT modalities can be safely used and are well-tolerated in infants.",

In the present study, we assess the clinical features and outcome of 14 MSUD Spanish patients with similar treatment protocol diagnosed either by NBS or by clinical symptoms. Eight patients were detected by NBS, four classic and four moderate MSUD. The average age at detection was 4.6 days, the mean plasmatic concentration of leucine at diagnosis was 1807 muM; the average number of days with leucine >1000 muM was 0.7 (0-4) and the mean number of total hospitalizations was 1.6 (0-5). Mean follow-up time was 70 months. They had good evolution: all remain asymptomatic, but 2 patients have attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Six patients with late diagnosis of classic MSUD were followed during 41 months. All presented with acute encephalopathy during the first month of life, mean leucine levels of 2355 muM, mean number of days with leucine >1000 muM of 6.6 (1-13) and mean number of total hospitalizations of 5.3 (4-7). Only two patients have a psychomotor development index in the lower limit (80 and 83). For all patients a good genotype-phenotype correlation was found and four novel mutations were identified: p.A311H, p.T84S, p.T397L, pL398P. Our study support that NBS improves prognosis of MSUD patients. But early diagnosis and an aggressive treatment together with a close monitoring of leucine levels improve neurological evolution in MSUD patients, even for those not detected by NBS. ",

METHODS: During the period of study, 724 (81% eligible cases) dried blood filter-paper samples were collected from a NICU. The samples were analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. The diagnosis was further confirmed through clinical symptoms and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were also confirmed by clinical follow-up of all positive patients in an overall interval of 1 year. The mean observation period was 11 months per neonate. RESULTS: In total, 22 cases were screen positive and 8 cases of inborn errors of metabolism were detected. The incidence of IEM in the population of patients admitted to the authors' NICU was 1.1%. The most common inborn error found was methylmalonic acidemia (3 cases, 37.5%), and all of the cases needed aggressive treatment and invasive mechanical ventilation. There were two cases of Tyrosinemia type 1, one case each of Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Propionic Acidemia, and Multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Five of the eight patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median length of NICU stay was 3 days (1~7 days) and early therapeutic intervention was effective for four of them and other four patients (50%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IEM in NICU was 1.1%, indicating an underestimation of the incidence of metabolic disorders prior to implementing screening. Most patients with IEM in the NICU required invasive mechanical ventilation and the mortality was increased due to underlying IEM.",

In the present study, we assess the clinical features and outcome of 14 MSUD Spanish patients with similar treatment protocol diagnosed either by NBS or by clinical symptoms. Eight patients were detected by NBS, four classic and four moderate MSUD. The average age at detection was 4.6 days, the mean plasmatic concentration of leucine at diagnosis was 1807 muM; the average number of days with leucine >1000 muM was 0.7 (0-4) and the mean number of total hospitalizations was 1.6 (0-5). Mean follow-up time was 70 months. They had good evolution: all remain asymptomatic, but 2 patients have attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Six patients with late diagnosis of classic MSUD were followed during 41 months. All presented with acute encephalopathy during the first month of life, mean leucine levels of 2355 muM, mean number of days with leucine >1000 muM of 6.6 (1-13) and mean number of total hospitalizations of 5.3 (4-7). Only two patients have a psychomotor development index in the lower limit (80 and 83). For all patients a good genotype-phenotype correlation was found and four novel mutations were identified: p.A311H, p.T84S, p.T397L, pL398P. Our study support that NBS improves prognosis of MSUD patients. But early diagnosis and an aggressive treatment together with a close monitoring of leucine levels improve neurological evolution in MSUD patients, even for those not detected by NBS. ",

However, clinical shortages of suitable livers for hepatocyte isolation indicate a need for alternative cell sources. Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) share stem cell characteristics without the latter's safety and ethical concerns and differentiate to hepatocyte-like cells. Eight direct hepatic hAEC transplantations were performed in iMSUD mice over the first 35 days beginning at birth; animals were provided a normal protein diet and sacrificed at 35 and 100 days. Treatment at the neonatal stage is clinically relevant for MSUD and may offer a donor cell engraftment advantage. Survival was significantly extended and body weight was normalized in iMSUD mice receiving hAEC transplantations compared with untreated iMSUD mice, which were severely cachectic and died <=28 days after birth. Branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme activity was significantly increased in transplanted livers. The branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, valine, and alloisoleucine were significantly improved in serum and brain, as were other large neutral amino acids. CONCLUSION: Placental-derived stem cell transplantation lengthened survival and corrected many amino acid imbalances in a mouse model of iMSUD. This highlights the potential for their use as a viable alternative clinical therapy for MSUD and other liver-based metabolic diseases.",

We collected data about treatment, survival, hospitalization, metabolic control, and liver transplantation from patients with classic (i.e., severe; n = 176), intermediate (n = 6) and intermittent (n = 2) forms of MSUD. A total of 13,589 amino acid profiles were used to analyze leucine tolerance, amino acid homeostasis, estimated cerebral amino acid uptake, quantitative responses to anabolic therapy, and metabolic control after liver transplantation. Standard instruments were used to measure neuropsychiatric outcomes. Despite advances in clinical care, classic MSUD remains a morbid and potentially fatal disorder. Stringent dietary therapy maintains metabolic variables within acceptable limits but is challenging to implement, fails to restore appropriate concentration relationships among circulating amino acids, and does not fully prevent cognitive and psychiatric disabilities. Liver transplantation eliminates the need for a prescription diet and safeguards patients from life-threatening metabolic crises, but is associated with predictable morbidities and does not reverse pre-existing neurological sequelae. There is a critical unmet need for safe and effective disease-modifying therapies for MSUD which can be implemented early in life. The biochemistry and physiology of MSUD and its response to liver transplantation afford key insights into the design of new therapies based on gene replacement or editing.",

We aimed to identify the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases that may arise from nutritional therapies and suggests approaches that may prevent the development of the noncommunicable diseases. METHODS: The present study evaluates 112 patients, on long-term nutritional therapy for at least the last 2 years with a diagnosis of an inborn error of the amino acid metabolism, and their 28 healthy siblings. The participants are assessed for the development of overweight and metabolic syndrome based on an analysis of anthropometric parameters, body composition and the results of biochemical tests. RESULTS: Anthropometric measurements including BMI, weight Z-score, waist circumference and fat mass were not significantly different between patients and controls. Height Z-scores were similar in phenylketonuria patients compared to controls, but lower in urea cycle disorders, organic acidemia and maple syrup urine disease groups. No increased risk of development of overweight or metabolic syndrome was detected in the patient group, while there were findings suggesting malnutrition in patients diagnosed with urea cycle disorders. There was a correlation between patients' BMI and C3-carnitine levels in organic acidemia patients and leucine levels in maple syrup urine disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: All forms of malnutrition can be prevented in patient groups receiving limited nutrients under a dietary management protocol, based on the findings of anthropometric and biochemical evaluations and analyses of body composition.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data describing the technical aspects of living donor (LD) domino liver transplantation (DLT) in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) are limited. The largest published series includes only 3 cases. One great challenge of this procedure is to ensure adequate vascular stumps for the LD, the MSUD patient, and the recipient of the domino graft. Here, we describe our experience in 11 cases of LD-DLT in MSUD, highlighting the technical aspects of LD-DLT. METHODS: From September 2012 to September 2017, 11 patients with MSUD underwent LD liver transplantation at our institution, and MSUD livers were used as domino grafts in 11 children. RESULTS: (1) MSUD patients: 10 patients received a left lateral segment. The donor's left hepatic vein (HV) was anastomosed to the confluence of the recipient's 3 HVs. No vascular grafts (VG) were required for portal vein (PV) anastomosis. Single arterial anastomosis was performed with microsurgery in 10 of 11 patients. (2) MSUD graft recipients: In 8 cases, HV reconstruction was performed between the graft's HV confluence and the recipient's HV confluence, and in 3 cases, a vena cava triangulation was necessary; 6 MSUD grafts required HV venoplasty. No VG were needed for HV reconstruction. VG were used for PV reconstruction in 3 cases due to sclerotic PV. In 2 cases, double arterial anastomoses were performed in the MSUD liver. All patients remain alive and well. CONCLUSIONS: Living donor liver transplantation followed by DLT for MSUD is a complex procedure and demands technical refinement. Special attention must be paid to vascular reconstruction.",

METHODS: The present study evaluates 112 patients, on long-term nutritional therapy for at least the last 2 years with a diagnosis of an inborn error of the amino acid metabolism, and their 28 healthy siblings.

PC deficiency causes abnormal blood clotting that is difficult to regulate by anticoagulative treatments. Four reports of PC deficiency treated with LTx have been published; however, no report of DLT as a therapy for PC deficiency is available. We describe a case of a 23-month-old girl who received DLT for compound heterozygous PC deficiency. Her PC activity was below 5%. She developed intracranial lesion and frequent refractory purpura fulminans. Both her parents had heterozygous mutations of PC genes and were excluded as living donors. Furthermore, she was a low priority on the waiting list of deceased-donor transplantation. We performed living DLT using the liver from a patient with MSUD. Activated PC concentrate safely supported the perioperative period. After DLT, she maintained normal PC activities and BCAA levels. This is the first case of PC deficiency successfully treated by living DLT with MSUD. We propose that DLT using liver from patients with MSUD is a treatment option for PC deficiency. ",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by severe deficiency of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex activity, resulting in tissue accumulation of branched-chain alpha-keto acids and amino acids, particularly alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) and leucine. Affected patients regularly manifest with acute episodes of encephalopathy including seizures, coma, and potentially fatal brain edema during the newborn period. The present work investigated the ex vivo effects of a single intracerebroventricular injection of KIC to neonate rats on redox homeostasis and neurochemical markers of neuronal viability (neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN)), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)), and myelination (myelin basic protein (MBP) and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)) in the cerebral cortex and striatum. KIC significantly disturbed redox homeostasis in these brain structures 6 h after injection, as observed by increased 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein oxidation (reactive oxygen species generation), malondialdehyde levels (lipid oxidative damage), and carbonyl formation (protein oxidative damage), besides impairing the antioxidant defenses (diminished levels of reduced glutathione and altered glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase activities) in both cerebral structures. Noteworthy, the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and melatonin attenuated or normalized most of the KIC-induced effects on redox homeostasis. Furthermore, a reduction of NeuN, MBP, and CNPase, and an increase of GFAP levels were observed at postnatal day 15, suggesting neuronal loss, myelination injury, and astrocyte reactivity, respectively. Our data indicate that disruption of redox homeostasis, associated with neural damage caused by acute intracerebral accumulation of KIC in the neonatal period may contribute to the neuropathology characteristic of MSUD patients.",

The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes about diet, barriers to and facilitators of dietary adherence, and experiences with the health care system in promoting dietary adherence among adolescent and adult women with inborn errors of metabolism to identify policy-level interventions to improve adherence. We analyzed the results of four focus groups including a total of 19 women between the ages of 12 and 52 years with phenylketonuria, methylmalonic acidemia, or maple syrup urine disease attending an educational summer camp in 2008. Themes were identified after independent analysis of transcripts. Most participants were highly knowledgeable about their dietary requirements and some could describe their own specific negative experiences of nonadherence. Many reported specific challenges, such as feelings of being different, that they experienced in elementary and middle school. Friends and family play an important role in maintaining dietary adherence. Participants identified one registered dietitian in particular who has played an important supportive role. Insurance coverage for medical foods was a common concern. Most participants identified concerns about transitioning from pediatric to adult medical services. We identified four specific strategies for future evaluation that may improve dietary adherence and health outcomes for women and their potential offspring: symptom-based dietary monitoring for some, educating school officials about medical diets, expanding the role of registered dietitians; and assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care providers.",

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: In vitro fertilization unit. PATIENT(S): Couples presenting for PGT-SR (n = 15) and PGT-M (n = 2). INTERVENTION(S): Blastocyst biopsy with molecular testing for translocation breakpoints or mutations (targets). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Detailed, parental-phased, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles around targets for selection of informative polymorphic markers to simplify and facilitate clinical preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) designs that enable discrimination between carrier and noncarrier embryos. RESULT(S): High definition of chromosome breakpoints together with closely phased polymorphic markers was achieved for all 15 couples presenting for PGT-SR. Similarly, for the two couples presenting for PGT-M, tightly linked informative markers around the mutations were also simply identified. Three couples with translocations t(1;17)(q21;p13), t(3;13)(p25;q21.2), and t(12;13)(q23;q22) proceeded with PGT-SR, requesting preferential identification of noncarrier embryos for transfer. Following selection of a set of informative SNPs linked to breakpoints, we successfully performed PGT-SR tests, resulting in ongoing pregnancies with a noncarrier fetus for all couples. Similarly, with the use of tests based on informative SNPs linked to the parental mutations, one couple proceeded with PGT-M for maple syrup urine disease, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy with a disease-free fetus. CONCLUSION(S): For couples contemplating clinical PGT, variant haplophasing around the target reduces the workup process by enabling rapid selection of closely linked informative markers for patient-specific test design.",

METHODS: Neonates treated with PD in our neonatal intensive care unit during 2007-2010 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among 4036 hospitalized neonates; 20 neonates (0.5%) who underwent 21 cycles of PD [7 preterm, 13 term; 13 female, 7 male] were included. The mean birth weight was 2930.2 +- 720.6 g (1120-4570), mean gestational age was 37.5 +- 3.5 weeks (27-41). The etiologic disorders included inborn errors of metabolism (propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, citrullinemia, glutaric aciduria type 2, maple syrup urine disease, 10), or acute renal failure secondary to perinatal asphyxia (4), sepsis (2), prematurity (2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (1), kernicterus (1). The complications included peritonitis (2), early leakage (4), hemorrhage (1), catheter removal (3) and occlusion (2). The mortality rate was 50%. The gestational ages and birth weights of surviving neonates were higher (p < 0.05). Among surviving neonates, chronic renal failure (1), severe (4) and moderate neuromotor impairment (2) developed within 4-43 months. CONCLUSION: PD, although invasive, is an effective therapy in neonates. The complexity and invasiveness of the procedure is probably responsible for high rate of complications and mortality. If appropriate catheter selection and technique in the placement should be done, PD might improve outcome.",

METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients were identified through a national reference laboratory for the diagnosis of MSUD and through contact with other medical genetics services across Brazil. Data were collected by means of a chart review. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients from 75 families were enrolled in the study (median age, 3 years; interquartile range [IQR], 0.57-7). Median age at onset of symptoms was 10 days (IQR 5-30), whereas median age at diagnosis was 60 days (IQR 29-240, p=0.001). Only three (3.6%) patients were diagnosed before the onset of clinical manifestations. A comparison between patients with (n=12) and without (n=71) an early diagnosis shows that early diagnosis is associated with the presence of positive family history and decreased prevalence of clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, but not with a better outcome. Overall, 98.8% of patients have some psychomotor or neurodevelopmental delay. CONCLUSION: In Brazil, patients with MSUD are usually diagnosed late and exhibit neurological involvement and poor survival even with early diagnosis. We suggest that specific public policies for diagnosis and treatment of MSUD should be developed and implemented in the country.",

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 35 patients with classical MSUD (age 9.9 +- 7.9 years) underwent liver transplantation between 2004 and 2009. Six patients donated their liver to recipients without MSUD (\"domino\" transplant). We analyzed clinical outcomes for our cohort and 17 additional cases from the national United Network for Organ Sharing registry; 33 patients completed IQ and adaptive testing before transplantation, and 14 completed testing 1 year later. RESULTS: Patient and graft survival were 100% at 4.5 +- 2.2 years of follow-up. Liver function was normal in all patients. Branched-chain amino acid levels were corrected within hours after surgery and remained stable, with leucine tolerance increasing more than 10-fold. All domino transplant recipients were alive and well with normal branched-chain amino acid homeostasis at the time of this report. Patient and graft survival for all 54 patients with MSUD undergoing liver transplantation in the United States during this period were 98% and 96%, respectively. One-third of our patients were mentally impaired (IQ <= 70) before transplantation, with no statistically significant change 1 year later. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation is an effective long-term treatment for classical MSUD and may arrest brain damage, but will not reverse it.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of Inborn errors of metobolism (IEM) in Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using tandem mass spectrometry and to determine the impact that these disorders have on NICU resources. METHODS: During the period of study, 724 (81% eligible cases) dried blood filter-paper samples were collected from a NICU. The samples were analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. The diagnosis was further confirmed through clinical symptoms and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were also confirmed by clinical follow-up of all positive patients in an overall interval of 1 year. The mean observation period was 11 months per neonate. RESULTS: In total, 22 cases were screen positive and 8 cases of inborn errors of metabolism were detected. The incidence of IEM in the population of patients admitted to the authors' NICU was 1.1%. The most common inborn error found was methylmalonic acidemia (3 cases, 37.5%), and all of the cases needed aggressive treatment and invasive mechanical ventilation. There were two cases of Tyrosinemia type 1, one case each of Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Propionic Acidemia, and Multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Five of the eight patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median length of NICU stay was 3 days (1~7 days) and early therapeutic intervention was effective for four of them and other four patients (50%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IEM in NICU was 1.1%, indicating an underestimation of the incidence of metabolic disorders prior to implementing screening. Most patients with IEM in the NICU required invasive mechanical ventilation and the mortality was increased due to underlying IEM.",

In the present study, we assess the clinical features and outcome of 14 MSUD Spanish patients with similar treatment protocol diagnosed either by NBS or by clinical symptoms. Eight patients were detected by NBS, four classic and four moderate MSUD. The average age at detection was 4.6 days, the mean plasmatic concentration of leucine at diagnosis was 1807 muM; the average number of days with leucine >1000 muM was 0.7 (0-4) and the mean number of total hospitalizations was 1.6 (0-5). Mean follow-up time was 70 months. They had good evolution: all remain asymptomatic, but 2 patients have attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Six patients with late diagnosis of classic MSUD were followed during 41 months. All presented with acute encephalopathy during the first month of life, mean leucine levels of 2355 muM, mean number of days with leucine >1000 muM of 6.6 (1-13) and mean number of total hospitalizations of 5.3 (4-7). Only two patients have a psychomotor development index in the lower limit (80 and 83). For all patients a good genotype-phenotype correlation was found and four novel mutations were identified: p.A311H, p.T84S, p.T397L, pL398P. Our study support that NBS improves prognosis of MSUD patients. But early diagnosis and an aggressive treatment together with a close monitoring of leucine levels improve neurological evolution in MSUD patients, even for those not detected by NBS. ",

This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION: The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

Despite its profound metabolic implications, the molecular alterations underlying this metabolic impairment had not yet been completely elucidated. We performed a comprehensive multi-omics integration analysis, including genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from fibroblasts derived from a cohort of MSUD patients and unaffected controls to genetically characterize an MSUD case and to unravel the MSUD pathophysiology. MSUD patients exhibit a defined episignature that reshapes the global DNA methylation landscape, resulting in the stimulation of HOX cluster genes and the restriction of cell cycle gene-related signatures. Subsequent data integration revealed the impact of AP1-related and CEBPB transcription factors on the observed molecular reorganization, with MEIS1 emerging as a potential downstream candidate affected by robust epigenetic repression in MSUD patients. Furthermore, the integration of multi-omics layers facilitated the identification of a strong epigenetic repression in the DBT promoter in a patient wherein no BCKDH pathogenic variants had been detected. A Circular Chromatin Conformation Capture assay indicated a disturbance of the interactions of DBT promoter, thereby unveiling alternative modes of disease inheritance. Integration of multi-omics data unveiled underlying molecular networks rewired in MSUD patients and represents a powerful approach with diagnostic potential for rare genetic disorders with unknown genetic bases.",

Patients with MSUD who were over 3 years old, not treated with liver transplantation, and who provided written consent, were included. The study aimed to describe the dietary treatment of patients with MSUD, evaluate growth data, and analyze the effect of a low-protein and semi-synthetic diet on body composition. Data on height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, food intake, physical activity, and DEXA scans were collected. Thirteen subjects (11 classic MSUD, 2 intermediate MSUD) were included, of which 5 < 18 years old. Results indicated that patients with MSUD follow a balanced diet and have body compositions like healthy subjects in terms of fat and lean mass. A high incidence of osteopenia was observed from a young age, with a positive correlation between protein intake and lean mass and a negative correlation between BCAA-free mixture consumption and bone mineral density z-score. The study highlights the positive effects and potential consequences of the semi-synthetic diet on the body composition of patients with MSUD.

METHODS: The patients underwent continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) as renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: Eleven (68.75%) patients underwent CVVHDF and five (31.25%) underwent peritoneal dialysis. The median leucine reduction rate per hour was 2.56% (1.75-7.6) in the CVVHDF group, 0.78% (0.54-1.83) in the PD group, and was significantly higher in the CVVHDF group (p = 0.001). Posttreatment plasma leucine levels were found to be 198 (20-721) mumol/L in the CVVHDF group and 600 (250-967) mumol/L in the PD group, and CVVHDF was found to be significantly lower (p = 0.08). Complications such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and filter obstruction occurred in the CVVHDF group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that CVVHDF is more effective than PD for rapidly eliminating elevated leucine levels caused by MSUD in the newborn and it is not associated with increased complication rates.",

The median leucine reduction rate per hour was 2.56% (1.75-7.6) in the CVVHDF group, 0.78% (0.54-1.83) in the PD group, and was significantly higher in the CVVHDF group (p = 0.001). Posttreatment plasma leucine levels were found to be 198 (20-721) mumol/L in the CVVHDF group and 600 (250-967) mumol/L in the PD group, and CVVHDF was found to be significantly lower (p = 0.08). Complications such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and filter obstruction occurred in the CVVHDF group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that CVVHDF is more effective than PD for rapidly eliminating elevated leucine levels caused by MSUD in the newborn and it is not associated with increased complication rates.",

However, the efficacy and safety of IHD in infants and young children with inborn errors of metabolism are still not clear. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and methylmalonic acidemia who received IHD or non-IHD RRT at our hospital between 2001 and 2012 to remove ammonia, leucine, or methylmalonic acid. Both the efficacy and safety of the RRT were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-five courses of RRT, including 25 courses of IHD and ten courses of non-IHD RRT, for 15 patients were included in the analysis. Before 2006, non-IHD RRT procedures, including peritoneal dialysis (PD) and continuous venous-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), were the most often used; from 2006 onwards IHD was used. There was one procedure-unrelated death. Catheter penetration occurred in one course of IHD. The efficacy data revealed that both the median duration of dialysis and the median 50 % toxin reduction time were shorter in IHD than in non-IHD RRT. CONCLUSIONS: In infants and young children with inborn errors of metabolism, IHD is safe and more efficient than non-IHD RRT at removing toxins.",

                    "abstract": "Several recent studies have reported that toxic metabolites accumulated in the body as a product of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are eliminated more rapidly with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) than with peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, there is still uncertainty about the impacts of dialysis modalities on the short-term outcome. Here, it was aimed to investigate the effects of dialysis modalities on the short-term outcome. This retrospective study included 40 newborn infants who underwent PD (29 patients) or CVVHDF (11 patients) due to inborn errors of metabolism at a tertiary centre, between June 2013 and March 2018. The outcomes and the potential effects of the dialysis modality were evaluated. Of 40 patients, 21 were urea cycle defect, 14 were organic academia, and 5 were maple syrup urine disease. The median 50% reduction time of toxic metabolites were shorter in patients treated with CVVHDF (p < 0.05). Catheter blockage was the most common complication observed in PD group (24.1%), whereas in CVVHDF group hypotension and filter blockage were more common. There was no significant difference in mortality between dialysis groups (38% vs. 45.4%, p > 0.05). In patients with hyperammonaemia, duration of plasma ammonia > 200 mug/dL was the most important factor influencing mortality (OR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, p = 0.007).Conclusion: This study showed that CVVHDF is more efficient than PD to rapidly eliminate toxic metabolites caused by IEM in newborn infants, but not in improving survival. What is Known:  Toxic metabolites are eliminated more rapidly with CVVHDF than with PD.  Higher complication rates were reported with rigid peritoneal catheters in PD and catheter blockage in CVVHDF. What is New:  Prolonged duration of plasma ammonia levels above a safe limit (200 mug/dL) was associated with increased mortality.  Lower catheter-related complication rates may have been associated with the use of Tenckhoff catheters in PD and the use of right internal jugular vein in CVVHDF.",

RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent 15 sessions of CVVHDF (age range 15 days to 87 months, mean 40.8 +- 31.4 months). One patient required additional CVVHDF 1 week after cessation of CVVHDF. Twenty seven percent (n = 4) of the patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Twelve patients responded to treatment and dramatic neurological improvement was observed within 24 h. Two of the 14 patients required 36 h of CVVHDF for neurological improvement. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 20.2 +- 8.6 (9-36) h.

The accumulation of toxic metabolites may cause acute metabolic crisis with long-term neurological dysfunction and death. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities allow the efficient removal of toxic metabolites. In this study, we reviewed our experience with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) as RRT for newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with an inborn metabolic disease and who received CVVHDF treatment at our neonatal intensive care unit between January 2014 and December 2017 were included in this study. Their demographic and clinical data were collected, and the efficacy and safety of CVVHDF was evaluated. Results: A total of nine continuous RRT (CRRT) sessions as CVVHDF were performed in eight newborns with a diagnosis of urea cycle defect (n = 5), maple syrup urine disease (n = 2), or methylmalonic acidemia (n = 1). The mean age at admission was 10 +- 8.6 days (range: 3-28 days). The mean plasma levels of ammonium were 1120 +- 512.6 mg/dL and 227.5 +- 141.6 mg/dL before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. Plasma levels of leucine were 2053.5 +- 1282 mumol/L and 473.5 +- 7.8 mumol/L before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. The CVVHDF duration was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (median: 37 h; range: 16-44 h), and the mean length of hospitalization was 14.6 +- 12.9 days. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (range: 16-44 h). Circuit clotting was the most common observed complication (37.5%) and the survival rate was 50%. Among surviving patients, two developed severe and two developed mild mental and motor retardation. Conclusion: CVVHDF is a CRRT modality that can be used to treat newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Early diagnosis, commencement of specific medical therapy, diet, and extracorporeal support, if needed, are likely to result in improved short and long- term outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

The accumulation of toxic metabolites may cause acute metabolic crisis with long-term neurological dysfunction and death. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities allow the efficient removal of toxic metabolites. In this study, we reviewed our experience with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) as RRT for newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with an inborn metabolic disease and who received CVVHDF treatment at our neonatal intensive care unit between January 2014 and December 2017 were included in this study. Their demographic and clinical data were collected, and the efficacy and safety of CVVHDF was evaluated. Results: A total of nine continuous RRT (CRRT) sessions as CVVHDF were performed in eight newborns with a diagnosis of urea cycle defect (n = 5), maple syrup urine disease (n = 2), or methylmalonic acidemia (n = 1). The mean age at admission was 10 +- 8.6 days (range: 3-28 days). The mean plasma levels of ammonium were 1120 +- 512.6 mg/dL and 227.5 +- 141.6 mg/dL before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. Plasma levels of leucine were 2053.5 +- 1282 mumol/L and 473.5 +- 7.8 mumol/L before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. The CVVHDF duration was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (median: 37 h; range: 16-44 h), and the mean length of hospitalization was 14.6 +- 12.9 days. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (range: 16-44 h). Circuit clotting was the most common observed complication (37.5%) and the survival rate was 50%. Among surviving patients, two developed severe and two developed mild mental and motor retardation. Conclusion: CVVHDF is a CRRT modality that can be used to treat newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Early diagnosis, commencement of specific medical therapy, diet, and extracorporeal support, if needed, are likely to result in improved short and long- term outcomes.",

METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients were identified through a national reference laboratory for the diagnosis of MSUD and through contact with other medical genetics services across Brazil. Data were collected by means of a chart review. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients from 75 families were enrolled in the study (median age, 3 years; interquartile range [IQR], 0.57-7). Median age at onset of symptoms was 10 days (IQR 5-30), whereas median age at diagnosis was 60 days (IQR 29-240, p=0.001). Only three (3.6%) patients were diagnosed before the onset of clinical manifestations. A comparison between patients with (n=12) and without (n=71) an early diagnosis shows that early diagnosis is associated with the presence of positive family history and decreased prevalence of clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, but not with a better outcome. Overall, 98.8% of patients have some psychomotor or neurodevelopmental delay. CONCLUSION: In Brazil, patients with MSUD are usually diagnosed late and exhibit neurological involvement and poor survival even with early diagnosis. We suggest that specific public policies for diagnosis and treatment of MSUD should be developed and implemented in the country.",

MSUD is an autosomal recessive hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by ketoacidosis, ataxia, coma, and mental and psychomotor retardation. The mechanisms involved in the brain damage caused by MSUD are not fully understood. Early diagnosis and treatment, as well as proper control of metabolic decompensation crises, are crucial for patients' survival and for a better prognosis. The recommended treatment consists of a high-calorie diet with restricted protein intake and specific formulas containing essential amino acids, except those accumulated in MSUD. This treatment will be maintained throughout life, being adjusted according to the patients' nutritional needs and BCAA concentration. Because dietary treatment may not be sufficient to prevent neurological damage in MSUD patients, other therapeutic strategies have been studied, including liver transplantation. With transplantation, it is possible to obtain an increase of about 10% of the normal BCKD in the body, an amount sufficient to maintain amino acid homeostasis and reduce metabolic decompensation crises. However, the experience related to this practice is very limited when considering the shortage of liver for transplantation and the risks related to the surgical procedure and immunosuppression. Thus, the purpose of this review is to survey the benefits, risks, and challenges of liver transplantation in the treatment of MSUD.",

Although accumulation of toxic metabolites is associated with neurotoxicity, mechanisms underlying brain damage remain unclear. Aim of this study is to evaluate thiol/disulphide homeostasis as a novel indicator of oxidative stress in MSUD patients under treatment. Twenty patients with MSUD and 20 healthy individuals were included in study. All patients were under regular follow-up and had a good metabolic control. Serum native thiol (-SH), total thiol (-SH + -S-S-), disulphide (-S-S) levels were measured in all subjects. Disulphide/native thiol, disulphide/total thiol and native thiol/total thiol ratios were calculated from these values. Simultaneous blood sampling for plasma quantitative amino acid analysis was performed in both groups. Any significant difference was not observed in -SH, -SH + -S-S-, -S-S levels between two groups. In addition no increase of disulphide/native thiol and disulphide/total thiol ratios was detected in patient group. This study is the first study that evaluates dynamic thiol/disulphide homeostasis as an indicator of oxidative stress in MSUD patients. Among previous studies that were made to determine oxidative stress in treated MSUD patients, this study had the largest sample size also. In recent studies, it was claimed that oxidative stress could be responsible from neurotoxicity even in treated patients. Here, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis status showed that providing good metabolic control in MSUD patients prevent oxidative stress. Under regular follow-up and good compliance with diet, additional antioxidant therapies would possibly not be necessary.",

Transplantation of liver from an unrelated deceased donor restores 9-13% whole-body BCKA oxidation capacity and stabilizes MSUD. Recent reports document encouraging short-term outcomes for MSUD patients who received a liver segment from mutation heterozygous living related donors (LRDT). To investigate effects of living related versus deceased unrelated grafts, we studied four Brazilian MSUD patients treated with LRDT who were followed for a mean 19 +- 12 postoperative months, and compared metabolic and clinical outcomes to 37 classical MSUD patients treated with deceased donor transplant. Patient and graft survival for LRDT were 100%. Three of 4 MSUD livers were successfully domino transplanted into non-MSUD subjects. Following LRDT, all subjects resumed a protein-unrestricted diet as mean plasma leucine decreased from 224 +- 306 muM to 143 +- 44 muM and allo-isoleucine decreased 91%. We observed no episodes of hyperleucinemia during 80 aggregate postoperative patient-months. Mean plasma leucine:isoleucine:valine concentration ratios were ~2:1:4 after deceased donor transplant compared to ~1:1:1.5 following LRDT, resulting in differences of predicted cerebral amino acid uptake. Mutant heterozygous liver segments effectively maintain steady-state BCAA and BCKA homeostasis on an unrestricted diet and during most catabolic states, but might have different metabolic effects than grafts from unrelated deceased donors. Neither living related nor deceased donor transplant affords complete protection from metabolic intoxication, but both strategies represent viable alternatives to nutritional management.",

Because of sufficient enzyme activity in extrahepatic tissues in healthy people, the MSUD liver graft is a suitable domino organ. We present the first case of a technical challenging ex situ split of a MSUD domino organ transplanted into two pediatric recipients. The domino graft donor was a 21-year-old female (58 kg) suffering from MSUD with recurrent metabolic decompensation despite strict diet. The organ was allocated to a 14-year-old girl (55 kg) with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Due to excellent organ quality and suitable anatomy, a backward split for a girl of 3 months (5 kg) with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to biliary atresia was performed. The postoperative course was without relevant complications, and the three recipients were discharged on postoperative days 28, 29, and 45, respectively, with good organ function. BCAAs in plasma were normal in the two domino graft recipients, and the MSUD patient showed mildly elevated but stable BCAA concentrations despite an unrestricted diet. Split-domino LTX enabled successful transplantation of three patients of the waiting list with only one deceased donor graft.",

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study at the Metabolic Rare Disease Unit, Fondazione IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza, Italy. Patients with MSUD who were over 3 years old, not treated with liver transplantation, and who provided written consent, were included. The study aimed to describe the dietary treatment of patients with MSUD, evaluate growth data, and analyze the effect of a low-protein and semi-synthetic diet on body composition. Data on height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, food intake, physical activity, and DEXA scans were collected. Thirteen subjects (11 classic MSUD, 2 intermediate MSUD) were included, of which 5 < 18 years old. Results indicated that patients with MSUD follow a balanced diet and have body compositions like healthy subjects in terms of fat and lean mass. A high incidence of osteopenia was observed from a young age, with a positive correlation between protein intake and lean mass and a negative correlation between BCAA-free mixture consumption and bone mineral density z-score. The study highlights the positive effects and potential consequences of the semi-synthetic diet on the body composition of patients with MSUD. A similar study involving all Italian metabolic centers treating MSUD is recommended.",

The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes about diet, barriers to and facilitators of dietary adherence, and experiences with the health care system in promoting dietary adherence among adolescent and adult women with inborn errors of metabolism to identify policy-level interventions to improve adherence. We analyzed the results of four focus groups including a total of 19 women between the ages of 12 and 52 years with phenylketonuria, methylmalonic acidemia, or maple syrup urine disease attending an educational summer camp in 2008. Themes were identified after independent analysis of transcripts. Most participants were highly knowledgeable about their dietary requirements and some could describe their own specific negative experiences of nonadherence. Many reported specific challenges, such as feelings of being different, that they experienced in elementary and middle school. Friends and family play an important role in maintaining dietary adherence. Participants identified one registered dietitian in particular who has played an important supportive role. Insurance coverage for medical foods was a common concern. Most participants identified concerns about transitioning from pediatric to adult medical services. We identified four specific strategies for future evaluation that may improve dietary adherence and health outcomes for women and their potential offspring: symptom-based dietary monitoring for some, educating school officials about medical diets, expanding the role of registered dietitians; and assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care providers.",

Information on these patients is limited. We present clinical, biochemical and molecular information on patients with variant forms of MSUD not detected by the California Newborn Screening Program. Between July 2005 and July 2009, 2200,000 newborns were screened in California by MS/MS. Seventeen cases of MSUD were detected and three (two siblings) were missed. Additionally, the NBS cards of two siblings with late onset MSUD, who were born pre-expanded NBS, were retrospectively analyzed. None of the five patients met criteria to be considered presumptive positive for MSUD (leucine>200micromol/L and a ratio of leucine/alanine>or=1.5). Alloisoleucine (allo-ile) was subsequently analyzed in the NBS cards of all five patients, two of whom were found to have elevated levels. The proband in each family was diagnosed following symptoms triggered by an intercurrent illness or increased protein intake. At diagnosis, leucine levels ranged between 561 and >4528micromol/L, and allo-ile ranged from 137 to 239micromol/L. Two affected siblings had normal plasma amino acids when asymptomatic; however, their biochemical profiles were diagnostic of MSUD during intercurrent illnesses. The median age at diagnosis of all patients was one year (range 0.8-6.7). Heterozygous BCKDHB (E1beta) mutations (c.832G>A/c.970C>T) were identified in one family and a homozygous DBT (E2) sequence variant (c.1430 T>G) in another. The third family had one identifiable DBT mutation (c.827T>G), however, a second mutation was not detected. This report provides further evidence that NBS by MS/MS is unable to detect all cases of MSUD. Second-tier testing with allo-ile may improve sensitivity; however, some children with variant forms will invariably be missed.",

We aimed to identify the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases that may arise from nutritional therapies and suggests approaches that may prevent the development of the noncommunicable diseases. METHODS: The present study evaluates 112 patients, on long-term nutritional therapy for at least the last 2 years with a diagnosis of an inborn error of the amino acid metabolism, and their 28 healthy siblings. The participants are assessed for the development of overweight and metabolic syndrome based on an analysis of anthropometric parameters, body composition and the results of biochemical tests. RESULTS: Anthropometric measurements including BMI, weight Z-score, waist circumference and fat mass were not significantly different between patients and controls. Height Z-scores were similar in phenylketonuria patients compared to controls, but lower in urea cycle disorders, organic acidemia and maple syrup urine disease groups. No increased risk of development of overweight or metabolic syndrome was detected in the patient group, while there were findings suggesting malnutrition in patients diagnosed with urea cycle disorders. There was a correlation between patients' BMI and C3-carnitine levels in organic acidemia patients and leucine levels in maple syrup urine disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: All forms of malnutrition can be prevented in patient groups receiving limited nutrients under a dietary management protocol, based on the findings of anthropometric and biochemical evaluations and analyses of body composition.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Patients with MSUD are at risk of life-threatening metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy. These episodes are often triggered by physiological stress. Only few cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers have been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the favorable outcome of a pregnancy in a woman with classical MSUD. She presented in the metabolic outpatient clinic in week 7 of gestation. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations were measured at least weekly to adjust dietary leucine intake. Despite excellent compliance, leucine concentrations frequently exceeded the target value of < 300 mumol/L during the first trimester. From the second trimester until delivery, protein and leucine intake increased continuously to about threefold compared to pre-pregnancy values. To maximize patient safety during delivery and the postpartum period, a detailed plan including peripartal infusion therapy, dietary recommendations and monitoring parameters was developed. Primary Caesarean section was performed in week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a dysfunctional mitochondrial enzyme complex, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which catabolizes branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Without functional BCKDH, BCAAs and their neurotoxic alpha-keto intermediates can accumulate in the blood and tissues. MSUD is currently incurable and treatment is limited to dietary restriction or liver transplantation, meaning there is a great need to develop new treatments for MSUD. We evaluated potential gene therapy applications for MSUD in the intermediate MSUD (iMSUD) mouse model, which harbors a mutation in the dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 (DBT) subunit of BCKDH. Systemic delivery of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing DBT under control of the liver-specific TBG promoter to the liver did not sufficiently ameliorate all aspects of the disease phenotype. These findings necessitated an alternative therapeutic strategy. Muscle makes a larger contribution to BCAA metabolism than liver in humans, but a muscle-specific approach involving a muscle-specific promoter for DBT expression delivered via intramuscular (IM) administration only partially rescued the MSUD phenotype in mice. Combining the muscle-tropic AAV9 capsid with the ubiquitous CB7 promoter via IM or IV injection, however, substantially increased survival across all assessed doses. Additionally, near-normal serum BCAA levels were achieved and maintained in the mid- and high-dose cohorts throughout the study; this approach also protected these mice from a lethal high-protein diet challenge. Therefore, administration of a gene therapy vector that expresses in both muscle and liver may represent a viable approach to treating patients with MSUD.",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare hereditary metabolic condition where the body is unable to breakdown amino acids causing toxic buildup. Acute and long-term management of MSUD involves a restricted diet and regular monitoring of amino acid levels; however, more recently liver transplants have been shown to be successful in treating this condition. Even with successful management of MSUD there is evidence from pediatric cases that shows a distinct pattern of neurocognitive deficits associated with this condition, including impaired nonverbal skills and psychomotor functioning with relatively intact verbal abilities. In the present paper, we report an adult case of MSUD with associated neurocognitive deficits and functional limitations following liver transplantation. Neuroimaging revealed no structural abnormalities, while the results from the neuropsychological evaluation showed impairment in visual-spatial processing, attention, executive functioning, and psychomotor abilities, with relative strengths in verbal skills. The patient also showed reduced adaptive functioning and mild anxiety. This case demonstrates neurocognitive deficiencies within the context of normal magnetic resonance imaging. The possible underlying mechanism of this neuropsychological profile is discussed in relation to other neurodevelopmental models. ",

Rapid elimination of these metabolites by peritoneal or extracorporeal dialysis is crucial to prevent neuronal damage or death. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the outcomes of nine neonates with metabolic crisis treated with peritoneal dialysis. METHOD: Six neonates with hyperammonemic coma (four with organic acidemias, two with urea cycle disorders) and three with leucine accumulation due to maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) were managed with peritoneal dialysis in conjunction with dietary and pharmacological therapy. RESULTS: Three patients with organic acidemia survived. One of the patients was normal; others had moderate and severe neurological impairments. One neonate with organic acidemia and both neonates with urea cycle disorders died. Two of the three patients with MSUD survived without neurological impairment; the other had severe neurological damage and died at 9 months of age due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Theoretically, extracorporeal dialysis should be the first dialysis treatment of choice; however, this report demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis has a chance to prevent neurological damage in some patients. Therefore, in developing countries without extracorporeal dialysis opportunities, it can be still a life-saving procedure, if it is applied with skilled staff and standard procedures.",

However, in our study, the domino liver was obtained from a pediatric patient. METHODS: A patient with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) underwent a living donor liver transplant, and the explanted liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes and transplanted to 2 separate patients. Demographic data, surgical techniques, postoperative period, and patient follow-ups were evaluated. RESULTS: The father's left lobe liver graft was transplanted into a 12-year-old boy with MSUD. The removed liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes. The left lobe was transplanted to a 14-year-old male patient, whereas the right lobe was transplanted to a 67-year-old male patient. The donor and the first recipient were discharged on postoperative days 5 and 22. The second pediatric patient who underwent domino split-left lobe transplantation was discharged on postoperative day 23. The adult patient who underwent domino split-right lobe transplantation died on postoperative day 12 owing to massive esophageal variceal bleeding. CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent liver transplantation due to MSUD are among the best donor choices for domino liver transplantation. If the extracted liver has a sufficient volume and anatomic features for a split, it can be used in \"selected cases.\"",

In a domino liver transplant, the domino recipient receives the explanted liver from the recipient of a traditional liver transplant. The domino donor typically requires liver transplant to correct a metabolic disorder; the explanted liver thus has a single gene defect but otherwise normal structure and function. METHODS: In this review, we detail the history of domino liver transplantation, appropriate domino donor indications, the technical advances to the surgical approach, current outcomes, and future opportunities. RESULTS: Development of de novo disease in the domino recipient has relegated adult domino liver transplant to be considered a source of marginal donor livers. However, pediatric domino liver transplant has leveraged certain metabolic disorders, especially maple syrup urine disease, in which the liver enzyme deficiency can be compensated by the systemic presence of sufficient enzyme. Advances in the surgical aspects of assuring adequate length of vasculature have improved the safety of the procedure in both domino donors and recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric domino liver transplant utilizing domino donors with specific metabolic liver diseases should be considered a viable live donor option for children awaiting liver transplant.",

Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is the most common indication for DLT. When FAP patients are involved in DLT, the indications and outcomes are clear and good, although de novo FAP development within various periods of time has been described in DLT recipients of FAP livers. With the increasing need for organs, livers explanted from patients with rare metabolic diseases, such as primary hyperoxaluria (PH), acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HFHC), are being used for DLT. However, insufficient data about the use of livers from patients with these rare metabolic diseases are available. In this review, we focus on the latter disorders. PH is not a good indication for DLT because recipients of PH livers develop hyperoxaluria and early acute renal failure. AIP also seems to be a debatable indication for DLT because of the rapid development of neurotoxicity in AIP liver recipients. However, the outcomes of DLT with HFHC and MSUD liver grafts (which include the risk of the de novo development of these genetic diseases) are promising. For rare metabolic liver diseases to be established as indications for DLT, more reports and studies are needed.",

Short- and long-term course and outcome of these patients can impact the decision to offer this procedure to patients, especially those with diseases that can potentially be cured with liver transplant. We reviewed the outcomes of DLT from maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients in our large academic pediatric and adult transplant program. METHODS: All patients receiving DLT were analyzed retrospectively with a minimum of one-year follow-up period for patient and donor characteristics, early and late postoperative complications and patient and graft survival with their MSUD donors in terms of age, weight, MELD/PELD scores, cold ischemia time, postoperative leucine levels, and peak ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels during the first 48 postoperative hours. RESULTS: Between 2006 and May 2019, 21 patients underwent domino liver transplantation with live donor allografts from MSUD patients. Four patients transplanted for different metabolic diseases are focus of a separate report. Seventeen patients with minimum one-year follow-up period are reported herein. The indications were primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC, n = 4), congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF, n = 2), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A-1 ATD, n = 2), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC, n = 2), cystic fibrosis (n = 1), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n = 1), neonatal hepatitis (n = 1), embryonal sarcoma (n = 1), Caroli disease (n = 1), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 1), and chronic rejection after liver transplantations for PSC (n = 1). All patients and grafts survived at median follow-up of 6.4 years (range 1.2-12.9 years). Median domino recipient age was 16.2 years (range 0.6-64.6 years) and median MSUD recipient age was 17.6 years (range 4.8-32.1 years). There were no vascular complications during the early postoperative period, one patient had portal vein thrombosis 3 years after DLT and a meso-Rex bypass was successfully performed. Small for size syndrome (SFSS) occurred in reduced left lobe DLT recipient and was managed successfully with conservative management. Biliary stricture developed in 2 patients and was resolved by stenting. Comparison between DLT and MSUD recipients' peak postoperative ALT results and PELD/MELD scores showed lower levels in DLT group (P-value <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient and graft survival in DLT from MSUD donors was excellent at short- and long-term follow-up. Metabolic functions have been normal in all recipients on a normal unrestricted protein diet. Ischemia preservation injury based on peak ALT was significantly decreased in DLT recipients. Domino transplantation from pediatric and adult recipients with selected metabolic diseases should be increasingly considered as an excellent option and alternative to deceased donor transplantation, thereby expanding the living donor pool. This, to date, is the largest world experience in DLT utilizing livers from patients with MSUD.",

Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is the most common indication for DLT. When FAP patients are involved in DLT, the indications and outcomes are clear and good, although de novo FAP development within various periods of time has been described in DLT recipients of FAP livers. With the increasing need for organs, livers explanted from patients with rare metabolic diseases, such as primary hyperoxaluria (PH), acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HFHC), are being used for DLT. However, insufficient data about the use of livers from patients with these rare metabolic diseases are available. In this review, we focus on the latter disorders. PH is not a good indication for DLT because recipients of PH livers develop hyperoxaluria and early acute renal failure. AIP also seems to be a debatable indication for DLT because of the rapid development of neurotoxicity in AIP liver recipients. However, the outcomes of DLT with HFHC and MSUD liver grafts (which include the risk of the de novo development of these genetic diseases) are promising. For rare metabolic liver diseases to be established as indications for DLT, more reports and studies are needed.",

Recent reports of successful DLT in children with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) show promising long-term outcomes. METHODS: It was a retrospective study. All children with MSUD were paired with either recipients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or non-MSUD metabolic disease. Each pair underwent simultaneous liver transplant (LT), where the MSUD recipient received the graft from a living-related donor and the liver explanted from the MSUD donor was transplanted to the respective paired domino recipient. We report our experience regarding the techniques and outcomes of DLT at our center. RESULTS: Eleven children with MSUD and 12 respective DLT recipients were enrolled, one of which was domino split-liver transplantation. DLT recipients included seven ESLD, two propionic acidemia (PA), one glycogen storage disease(GSD) type-1, one GSD type-3, and one Citrullinemia. Post-LT ICU and hospital stays were comparable (p > .05). Patient and graft survival was 100% and 66.6% in the MSUD group and DLT recipients at a mean follow-up of 13.5 and 15 months. There was no death in the MSUD group as compared to four in the DLT group. The amino acid levels rapidly normalized after the LT in the children with MSUD and they tolerated the normal unrestricted diet. No vascular, biliary, or graft-related complications were seen in the post-transplant period. No occurrence of MSUD was noted in DLT recipients. CONCLUSION: DLTs have excellent post-surgical outcomes. DLT should be strongly considered and adopted by transplant programs worldwide to circumvent organ shortage.",

METHODS: The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was queried for all liver transplants (LT) between 1996 and 2020. Outcomes of interest were long-term graft and patient survival. RESULTS: Of 181,976 LTs performed nationally during the study period, 185 (0.1%) were DLTs. Amyloidosis and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) accounted for 83% of dominoed allografts. Out of 210 explants with amyloidosis, 103 (49%) were dominoed into secondary recipients. Only 50 (22%) of all MSUD explants (n = 227) were dominoed. Graft survival was 79%, 73% and 53% at 3-, 5- and 10-years, respectively, for DLT recipients. Overall patient survival was 83%, 76% and 57% at 3-, 5- and 10-years.

Children with MSUD can present severe neurological damage, but liver transplantation (LT) allows the patient to resume a normal diet and avoid further neurological damage. The use of living related donors has been controversial because parents are obligatory heterozygotes. We report a case of a 2-year-old child with MSUD who underwent a living donor LT. The donor was the patient's mother, and his liver was then used as a domino graft. The postoperative course was uneventful in all three subjects. DNA analysis performed after the transplantation (sequencing of the coding regions of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes) showed that the MSUD patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation in the BCKDHB gene. This mutation was not found in his mother, who is an obligatory carrier for MSUD according to the family history and, as expected, presented both normal clinical phenotype and levels of branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion, our data suggest that the use of a related donor in LT for MSUD was effective, and the liver of the MSUD patient was successfully used in domino transplantation. Routine donor genotyping may not be feasible, because the test is not widely available, and, most importantly, the disease is associated with both the presence of allelic and locus heterogeneity. Further studies with this population of patients are required to expand the use of related donors in MSUD. ",

We performed a retrospective data collection of all LTs for MSUD carried out at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (2016-2018). Moreover, data from all consecutive domino LTs of the MSUD grafts either transplanted at our institution or allocated to other transplant centers were analyzed. During the study period, 15 LTs in MSUD patients were performed (12 children, 3 adults; median age, 10.9 years; range, 0.3-26.1 years). Biliary complications occurred in 20%, and 13.3% suffered from bleeding complications. No further surgical problems occurred. At present, all MSUD patients are alive with a well-functioning liver graft and on an unrestricted diet. In total, 14 consecutive domino LTs were performed. No surgical complications requiring intervention occurred. One patient died because of HCC relapse, and all other patients are alive with good liver graft function.

Short- and long-term course and outcome of these patients can impact the decision to offer this procedure to patients, especially those with diseases that can potentially be cured with liver transplant. We reviewed the outcomes of DLT from maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients in our large academic pediatric and adult transplant program. METHODS: All patients receiving DLT were analyzed retrospectively with a minimum of one-year follow-up period for patient and donor characteristics, early and late postoperative complications and patient and graft survival with their MSUD donors in terms of age, weight, MELD/PELD scores, cold ischemia time, postoperative leucine levels, and peak ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels during the first 48 postoperative hours. RESULTS: Between 2006 and May 2019, 21 patients underwent domino liver transplantation with live donor allografts from MSUD patients. Four patients transplanted for different metabolic diseases are focus of a separate report. Seventeen patients with minimum one-year follow-up period are reported herein. The indications were primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC, n = 4), congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF, n = 2), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A-1 ATD, n = 2), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC, n = 2), cystic fibrosis (n = 1), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n = 1), neonatal hepatitis (n = 1), embryonal sarcoma (n = 1), Caroli disease (n = 1), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 1), and chronic rejection after liver transplantations for PSC (n = 1). All patients and grafts survived at median follow-up of 6.4 years (range 1.2-12.9 years). Median domino recipient age was 16.2 years (range 0.6-64.6 years) and median MSUD recipient age was 17.6 years (range 4.8-32.1 years). There were no vascular complications during the early postoperative period, one patient had portal vein thrombosis 3 years after DLT and a meso-Rex bypass was successfully performed. Small for size syndrome (SFSS) occurred in reduced left lobe DLT recipient and was managed successfully with conservative management. Biliary stricture developed in 2 patients and was resolved by stenting. Comparison between DLT and MSUD recipients' peak postoperative ALT results and PELD/MELD scores showed lower levels in DLT group (P-value <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient and graft survival in DLT from MSUD donors was excellent at short- and long-term follow-up. Metabolic functions have been normal in all recipients on a normal unrestricted protein diet. Ischemia preservation injury based on peak ALT was significantly decreased in DLT recipients. Domino transplantation from pediatric and adult recipients with selected metabolic diseases should be increasingly considered as an excellent option and alternative to deceased donor transplantation, thereby expanding the living donor pool. This, to date, is the largest world experience in DLT utilizing livers from patients with MSUD.",

The procedure is not widely employed and remains restricted to a small number of centers. The purpose of this study was to assess the national profile of DLT in the United States (US) and evaluate current survival outcomes. METHODS: The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was queried for all liver transplants (LT) between 1996 and 2020. Outcomes of interest were long-term graft and patient survival. RESULTS: Of 181,976 LTs performed nationally during the study period, 185 (0.1%) were DLTs. Amyloidosis and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) accounted for 83% of dominoed allografts. Out of 210 explants with amyloidosis, 103 (49%) were dominoed into secondary recipients. Only 50 (22%) of all MSUD explants (n = 227) were dominoed. Graft survival was 79%, 73% and 53% at 3-, 5- and 10-years, respectively, for DLT recipients. Overall patient survival was 83%, 76% and 57% at 3-, 5- and 10-years. CONCLUSION: Despite excellent long-term survival outcomes, DLT allografts comprise a very small percentage of the liver donor pool. A large proportion of potential DLTs may be unconscionably excluded despite shortages in deceased donor organs.",

However, in our study, the domino liver was obtained from a pediatric patient. METHODS: A patient with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) underwent a living donor liver transplant, and the explanted liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes and transplanted to 2 separate patients. Demographic data, surgical techniques, postoperative period, and patient follow-ups were evaluated. RESULTS: The father's left lobe liver graft was transplanted into a 12-year-old boy with MSUD. The removed liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes. The left lobe was transplanted to a 14-year-old male patient, whereas the right lobe was transplanted to a 67-year-old male patient. The donor and the first recipient were discharged on postoperative days 5 and 22. The second pediatric patient who underwent domino split-left lobe transplantation was discharged on postoperative day 23. The adult patient who underwent domino split-right lobe transplantation died on postoperative day 12 owing to massive esophageal variceal bleeding. CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent liver transplantation due to MSUD are among the best donor choices for domino liver transplantation. If the extracted liver has a sufficient volume and anatomic features for a split, it can be used in \"selected cases.\"",

Transplantation of liver from an unrelated deceased donor restores 9-13% whole-body BCKA oxidation capacity and stabilizes MSUD. Recent reports document encouraging short-term outcomes for MSUD patients who received a liver segment from mutation heterozygous living related donors (LRDT). To investigate effects of living related versus deceased unrelated grafts, we studied four Brazilian MSUD patients treated with LRDT who were followed for a mean 19 +- 12 postoperative months, and compared metabolic and clinical outcomes to 37 classical MSUD patients treated with deceased donor transplant. Patient and graft survival for LRDT were 100%. Three of 4 MSUD livers were successfully domino transplanted into non-MSUD subjects. Following LRDT, all subjects resumed a protein-unrestricted diet as mean plasma leucine decreased from 224 +- 306 muM to 143 +- 44 muM and allo-isoleucine decreased 91%. We observed no episodes of hyperleucinemia during 80 aggregate postoperative patient-months. Mean plasma leucine:isoleucine:valine concentration ratios were ~2:1:4 after deceased donor transplant compared to ~1:1:1.5 following LRDT, resulting in differences of predicted cerebral amino acid uptake. Mutant heterozygous liver segments effectively maintain steady-state BCAA and BCKA homeostasis on an unrestricted diet and during most catabolic states, but might have different metabolic effects than grafts from unrelated deceased donors. Neither living related nor deceased donor transplant affords complete protection from metabolic intoxication, but both strategies represent viable alternatives to nutritional management.",

The domino graft donor was a 21-year-old female (58 kg) suffering from MSUD with recurrent metabolic decompensation despite strict diet. The organ was allocated to a 14-year-old girl (55 kg) with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Due to excellent organ quality and suitable anatomy, a backward split for a girl of 3 months (5 kg) with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to biliary atresia was performed. The postoperative course was without relevant complications, and the three recipients were discharged on postoperative days 28, 29, and 45, respectively, with good organ function. BCAAs in plasma were normal in the two domino graft recipients, and the MSUD patient showed mildly elevated but stable BCAA concentrations despite an unrestricted diet. Split-domino LTX enabled successful transplantation of three patients of the waiting list with only one deceased donor graft.",

METHODS: During the period of study, 724 (81% eligible cases) dried blood filter-paper samples were collected from a NICU. The samples were analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. The diagnosis was further confirmed through clinical symptoms and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were also confirmed by clinical follow-up of all positive patients in an overall interval of 1 year. The mean observation period was 11 months per neonate. RESULTS: In total, 22 cases were screen positive and 8 cases of inborn errors of metabolism were detected. The incidence of IEM in the population of patients admitted to the authors' NICU was 1.1%. The most common inborn error found was methylmalonic acidemia (3 cases, 37.5%), and all of the cases needed aggressive treatment and invasive mechanical ventilation. There were two cases of Tyrosinemia type 1, one case each of Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Propionic Acidemia, and Multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Five of the eight patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median length of NICU stay was 3 days (1~7 days) and early therapeutic intervention was effective for four of them and other four patients (50%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IEM in NICU was 1.1%, indicating an underestimation of the incidence of metabolic disorders prior to implementing screening. Most patients with IEM in the NICU required invasive mechanical ventilation and the mortality was increased due to underlying IEM.",

We analyzed the results of four focus groups including a total of 19 women between the ages of 12 and 52 years with phenylketonuria, methylmalonic acidemia, or maple syrup urine disease attending an educational summer camp in 2008. Themes were identified after independent analysis of transcripts. Most participants were highly knowledgeable about their dietary requirements and some could describe their own specific negative experiences of nonadherence. Many reported specific challenges, such as feelings of being different, that they experienced in elementary and middle school. Friends and family play an important role in maintaining dietary adherence. Participants identified one registered dietitian in particular who has played an important supportive role. Insurance coverage for medical foods was a common concern. Most participants identified concerns about transitioning from pediatric to adult medical services. We identified four specific strategies for future evaluation that may improve dietary adherence and health outcomes for women and their potential offspring: symptom-based dietary monitoring for some, educating school officials about medical diets, expanding the role of registered dietitians; and assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care providers.",

Patients were stratified into three clusters according to clinical outcome at the time of data collection, including developmental, clinical, and IQ data. A fourth cluster comprised of two early childhood deaths; a third patient died as an adult. We present neuroimaging and electroencephalography together with clinical and biochemical data. Incidence of MSUD (1972-2018) was 1 in 147 975. Overall good clinical outcomes were achieved with 15/18 patients alive and with essentially normal functioning (with only the lowest performing cluster lying beyond a single SD on their full scale intelligence quotient). Molecular genetic analysis revealed genotypes hitherto not reported, including a possible digenic inheritance state for the BCKDHA and DBT genes in one family. Treatment has been based on early implementation of emergency treatment, diet, close monitoring, and even dialysis in the setting of acute metabolic decompensation. A plasma leucine >=400 mumol/L (outside therapeutic range) was more frequently observed in infancy or during adolescence, possibly due to infections, hormonal changes, or noncompliance. Children require careful management during metabolic decompensations in early childhood, and this represented a key risk period in our cohort. A high level of metabolic control can be achieved through diet with early implementation of a \"sick day\" regime and, in some cases, dialysis as a rescue therapy.

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study at the Metabolic Rare Disease Unit, Fondazione IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza, Italy. Patients with MSUD who were over 3 years old, not treated with liver transplantation, and who provided written consent, were included. The study aimed to describe the dietary treatment of patients with MSUD, evaluate growth data, and analyze the effect of a low-protein and semi-synthetic diet on body composition. Data on height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, food intake, physical activity, and DEXA scans were collected. Thirteen subjects (11 classic MSUD, 2 intermediate MSUD) were included, of which 5 < 18 years old. Results indicated that patients with MSUD follow a balanced diet and have body compositions like healthy subjects in terms of fat and lean mass. A high incidence of osteopenia was observed from a young age, with a positive correlation between protein intake and lean mass and a negative correlation between BCAA-free mixture consumption and bone mineral density z-score. The study highlights the positive effects and potential consequences of the semi-synthetic diet on the body composition of patients with MSUD. A similar study involving all Italian metabolic centers treating MSUD is recommended.",

However, its administration is ineffective in cases of gastric intolerance and some adult patients refuse enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube. We developed a new parenteral amino-acid mixture for patients with MSUD. METHODS: Seventeen decompensation episodes in four adult patients with MSUD treated with a parenteral amino-acid mixture (group P) were compared to 18 previous episodes in the same patients treated by enteral feeding (group E). RESULTS: The mean Leu concentration at presentation was similar in the groups P and E (1196.9 mumol/L and 1212.2 mumol/L, respectively). The mean decrease in the Leu concentration during the first 3 days of hospitalisation was significantly higher in group P than group E (p = 0.0026); there were no side effects. The mean duration of hospitalisation was similar (4 vs. 4.5 days, p = NS). No patient in group P deteriorated whereas one patient in group E required dialysis. CONCLUSION: This new parenteral amino-acid mixture is safe and allows efficient Leu concentration decrease during acute MSUD decompensation episodes in adults. Its use avoids the need for nasogastric tube insertion.",

Because of sufficient enzyme activity in extrahepatic tissues in healthy people, the MSUD liver graft is a suitable domino organ. We present the first case of a technical challenging ex situ split of a MSUD domino organ transplanted into two pediatric recipients. The domino graft donor was a 21-year-old female (58 kg) suffering from MSUD with recurrent metabolic decompensation despite strict diet. The organ was allocated to a 14-year-old girl (55 kg) with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Due to excellent organ quality and suitable anatomy, a backward split for a girl of 3 months (5 kg) with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to biliary atresia was performed. The postoperative course was without relevant complications, and the three recipients were discharged on postoperative days 28, 29, and 45, respectively, with good organ function. BCAAs in plasma were normal in the two domino graft recipients, and the MSUD patient showed mildly elevated but stable BCAA concentrations despite an unrestricted diet. Split-domino LTX enabled successful transplantation of three patients of the waiting list with only one deceased donor graft.",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by an inborn error in metabolism resulting from a deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex activity. This blockage leads to accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine and valine, as well as their corresponding alpha-keto acids and alpha-hydroxy acids. High levels of BCAAs are associated with neurological dysfunction and the role of pro- and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the neurological dysfunction of MSUD is still unclear. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effect of an acute BCAA pool administration on BDNF levels and on the pro-BDNF cleavage-related proteins S100A10 and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in rat brains. Our results demonstrated that acute Hyper-BCAA (H-BCAA) exposure during the early postnatal period increases pro-BDNF and total-BDNF levels in the hippocampus and striatum. Moreover, tPA levels were significantly decreased, without modifications in the tPA transcript levels in the hippocampus and striatum. On the other hand, the S100A10 mRNA and S100A10 protein levels were not changed in the hippocampus and striatum. In the 30-day-old rats, we observed increased pro-BDNF, total-BDNF and tPA levels only in the striatum, whereas the tPA and S100A10 mRNA expression and the immunocontent of S100A10 were not altered. In conclusion, we demonstrated that acute H-BCAA administration increases the pro-BDNF/total-BDNF ratio and decreases the tPA levels in animals, suggesting that the BCAA effect may depend, at least in part, on changes in BDNF post-translational processing.

The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes about diet, barriers to and facilitators of dietary adherence, and experiences with the health care system in promoting dietary adherence among adolescent and adult women with inborn errors of metabolism to identify policy-level interventions to improve adherence. We analyzed the results of four focus groups including a total of 19 women between the ages of 12 and 52 years with phenylketonuria, methylmalonic acidemia, or maple syrup urine disease attending an educational summer camp in 2008. Themes were identified after independent analysis of transcripts. Most participants were highly knowledgeable about their dietary requirements and some could describe their own specific negative experiences of nonadherence. Many reported specific challenges, such as feelings of being different, that they experienced in elementary and middle school. Friends and family play an important role in maintaining dietary adherence. Participants identified one registered dietitian in particular who has played an important supportive role. Insurance coverage for medical foods was a common concern. Most participants identified concerns about transitioning from pediatric to adult medical services. We identified four specific strategies for future evaluation that may improve dietary adherence and health outcomes for women and their potential offspring: symptom-based dietary monitoring for some, educating school officials about medical diets, expanding the role of registered dietitians; and assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care providers.",

The accumulation of toxic metabolites may cause acute metabolic crisis with long-term neurological dysfunction and death. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities allow the efficient removal of toxic metabolites. In this study, we reviewed our experience with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) as RRT for newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with an inborn metabolic disease and who received CVVHDF treatment at our neonatal intensive care unit between January 2014 and December 2017 were included in this study. Their demographic and clinical data were collected, and the efficacy and safety of CVVHDF was evaluated. Results: A total of nine continuous RRT (CRRT) sessions as CVVHDF were performed in eight newborns with a diagnosis of urea cycle defect (n = 5), maple syrup urine disease (n = 2), or methylmalonic acidemia (n = 1). The mean age at admission was 10 +- 8.6 days (range: 3-28 days). The mean plasma levels of ammonium were 1120 +- 512.6 mg/dL and 227.5 +- 141.6 mg/dL before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. Plasma levels of leucine were 2053.5 +- 1282 mumol/L and 473.5 +- 7.8 mumol/L before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. The CVVHDF duration was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (median: 37 h; range: 16-44 h), and the mean length of hospitalization was 14.6 +- 12.9 days. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (range: 16-44 h). Circuit clotting was the most common observed complication (37.5%) and the survival rate was 50%. Among surviving patients, two developed severe and two developed mild mental and motor retardation. Conclusion: CVVHDF is a CRRT modality that can be used to treat newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Early diagnosis, commencement of specific medical therapy, diet, and extracorporeal support, if needed, are likely to result in improved short and long- term outcomes.",

In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing.

                    "abstract": "Classic maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) results from biallelic mutations in genes that encode the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase E1alpha (BCKDHA), E1beta (BCKDHB), or dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase (DBT) subunits, which interact to form the mitochondrial BCKDH complex that decarboxylates ketoacid derivatives of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. MSUD is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by recurrent life-threatening neurologic crises and progressive brain injury that can only be managed with an exacting prescription diet or allogeneic liver transplant. To develop a gene replacement therapy for MSUD, we designed a dual-function recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) vector to deliver codon-optimized BCKDHA and BCKDHB (rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB) to the liver, muscle, heart, and brain. rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB restored coexpression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB as well as BCKDH holoenzyme activity in BCKDHA-/- HEK293T cells and did not perturb physiologic branched-chain amino acid homeostasis in wild-type mice at a systemic dose of 2.7 x 1014 vector genomes per kilogram. In two models of severe MSUD (Bckdha-/- and Bckdhb-/- mice) and a newborn calf homozygous for BCKDHA c.248C>T, one postnatal injection prevented perinatal death, normalized growth, restored coordinated expression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB in the skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and brain, and stabilized MSUD biomarkers in the face of high protein ingestion. In summary, we developed a one-time BCKDHA-BCKDHB systemic dual-gene replacement strategy that holds promise as a therapeutic alternative to prescription diet and liver transplant for treatment of MSUD types 1A and 1B, the two most common forms of MSUD in humans.",

                    "abstract": "Classic maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) results from biallelic mutations in genes that encode the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase E1alpha (BCKDHA), E1beta (BCKDHB), or dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase (DBT) subunits, which interact to form the mitochondrial BCKDH complex that decarboxylates ketoacid derivatives of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. MSUD is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by recurrent life-threatening neurologic crises and progressive brain injury that can only be managed with an exacting prescription diet or allogeneic liver transplant. To develop a gene replacement therapy for MSUD, we designed a dual-function recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) vector to deliver codon-optimized BCKDHA and BCKDHB (rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB) to the liver, muscle, heart, and brain. rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB restored coexpression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB as well as BCKDH holoenzyme activity in BCKDHA-/- HEK293T cells and did not perturb physiologic branched-chain amino acid homeostasis in wild-type mice at a systemic dose of 2.7 x 1014 vector genomes per kilogram. In two models of severe MSUD (Bckdha-/- and Bckdhb-/- mice) and a newborn calf homozygous for BCKDHA c.248C>T, one postnatal injection prevented perinatal death, normalized growth, restored coordinated expression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB in the skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and brain, and stabilized MSUD biomarkers in the face of high protein ingestion. In summary, we developed a one-time BCKDHA-BCKDHB systemic dual-gene replacement strategy that holds promise as a therapeutic alternative to prescription diet and liver transplant for treatment of MSUD types 1A and 1B, the two most common forms of MSUD in humans.",

Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases.",

Without functional BCKDH, BCAAs and their neurotoxic alpha-keto intermediates can accumulate in the blood and tissues. MSUD is currently incurable and treatment is limited to dietary restriction or liver transplantation, meaning there is a great need to develop new treatments for MSUD. We evaluated potential gene therapy applications for MSUD in the intermediate MSUD (iMSUD) mouse model, which harbors a mutation in the dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 (DBT) subunit of BCKDH. Systemic delivery of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing DBT under control of the liver-specific TBG promoter to the liver did not sufficiently ameliorate all aspects of the disease phenotype. These findings necessitated an alternative therapeutic strategy. Muscle makes a larger contribution to BCAA metabolism than liver in humans, but a muscle-specific approach involving a muscle-specific promoter for DBT expression delivered via intramuscular (IM) administration only partially rescued the MSUD phenotype in mice. Combining the muscle-tropic AAV9 capsid with the ubiquitous CB7 promoter via IM or IV injection, however, substantially increased survival across all assessed doses. Additionally, near-normal serum BCAA levels were achieved and maintained in the mid- and high-dose cohorts throughout the study; this approach also protected these mice from a lethal high-protein diet challenge. Therefore, administration of a gene therapy vector that expresses in both muscle and liver may represent a viable approach to treating patients with MSUD.",

MSUD varies in severity and its clinical spectrum is quite broad, ranging from mild to severe phenotypes. Thirty-three MSUD patients were recruited into this study for molecular genetic variant profiling and genotype-phenotype correlation. Except for one patient, all other patients presented with the classic neonatal form of the disease. Seventeen different variants were detected where nine were novel. The detected variants spanned across the entire BCKDHA, BCKDHB and DBT genes. All variants were in homozygous forms. The commonest alterations were nonsense and frameshift variants, followed by missense variants. For the prediction of variant's pathogenicity, we used molecular modeling and several in silico tools including SIFT, Polyphen2, Condel, and Provean. In addition, six other tools were used for the prediction of the conservation of the variants' sites including Eigen-PC, GERP++, SiPhy, PhastCons vertebrates and primates, and PhyloP100 rank scores. Herein, we presented a comprehensive characterization of a large cohort of patients with MSUD. The clinical severity of the variants' phenotypes was well correlated with the genotypes.

Although accumulation of toxic metabolites is associated with neurotoxicity, mechanisms underlying brain damage remain unclear. Aim of this study is to evaluate thiol/disulphide homeostasis as a novel indicator of oxidative stress in MSUD patients under treatment. Twenty patients with MSUD and 20 healthy individuals were included in study. All patients were under regular follow-up and had a good metabolic control. Serum native thiol (-SH), total thiol (-SH + -S-S-), disulphide (-S-S) levels were measured in all subjects. Disulphide/native thiol, disulphide/total thiol and native thiol/total thiol ratios were calculated from these values. Simultaneous blood sampling for plasma quantitative amino acid analysis was performed in both groups. Any significant difference was not observed in -SH, -SH + -S-S-, -S-S levels between two groups. In addition no increase of disulphide/native thiol and disulphide/total thiol ratios was detected in patient group. This study is the first study that evaluates dynamic thiol/disulphide homeostasis as an indicator of oxidative stress in MSUD patients. Among previous studies that were made to determine oxidative stress in treated MSUD patients, this study had the largest sample size also. In recent studies, it was claimed that oxidative stress could be responsible from neurotoxicity even in treated patients. Here, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis status showed that providing good metabolic control in MSUD patients prevent oxidative stress. Under regular follow-up and good compliance with diet, additional antioxidant therapies would possibly not be necessary.",

                    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: There is improved survival and partial metabolic correction of a mouse intermediate maple syrup urine disease (iMSUD) model after allogenic hepatocyte transplantation, confirming that a small number of enzyme-proficient liver-engrafted cells can improve phenotype. However, clinical shortages of suitable livers for hepatocyte isolation indicate a need for alternative cell sources. Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) share stem cell characteristics without the latter's safety and ethical concerns and differentiate to hepatocyte-like cells. Eight direct hepatic hAEC transplantations were performed in iMSUD mice over the first 35 days beginning at birth; animals were provided a normal protein diet and sacrificed at 35 and 100 days. Treatment at the neonatal stage is clinically relevant for MSUD and may offer a donor cell engraftment advantage. Survival was significantly extended and body weight was normalized in iMSUD mice receiving hAEC transplantations compared with untreated iMSUD mice, which were severely cachectic and died <=28 days after birth. Branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme activity was significantly increased in transplanted livers. The branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, valine, and alloisoleucine were significantly improved in serum and brain, as were other large neutral amino acids. CONCLUSION: Placental-derived stem cell transplantation lengthened survival and corrected many amino acid imbalances in a mouse model of iMSUD. This highlights the potential for their use as a viable alternative clinical therapy for MSUD and other liver-based metabolic diseases.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data describing the technical aspects of living donor (LD) domino liver transplantation (DLT) in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) are limited. The largest published series includes only 3 cases. One great challenge of this procedure is to ensure adequate vascular stumps for the LD, the MSUD patient, and the recipient of the domino graft. Here, we describe our experience in 11 cases of LD-DLT in MSUD, highlighting the technical aspects of LD-DLT. METHODS: From September 2012 to September 2017, 11 patients with MSUD underwent LD liver transplantation at our institution, and MSUD livers were used as domino grafts in 11 children. RESULTS: (1) MSUD patients: 10 patients received a left lateral segment. The donor's left hepatic vein (HV) was anastomosed to the confluence of the recipient's 3 HVs. No vascular grafts (VG) were required for portal vein (PV) anastomosis. Single arterial anastomosis was performed with microsurgery in 10 of 11 patients. (2) MSUD graft recipients: In 8 cases, HV reconstruction was performed between the graft's HV confluence and the recipient's HV confluence, and in 3 cases, a vena cava triangulation was necessary; 6 MSUD grafts required HV venoplasty. No VG were needed for HV reconstruction. VG were used for PV reconstruction in 3 cases due to sclerotic PV. In 2 cases, double arterial anastomoses were performed in the MSUD liver. All patients remain alive and well. CONCLUSIONS: Living donor liver transplantation followed by DLT for MSUD is a complex procedure and demands technical refinement. Special attention must be paid to vascular reconstruction.",

Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 107-110. Continious renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a well recognizied treatment of choice in acute renal failure, however CRRT became a preferred treatment of metabolic emergencies with high leucine and ammonia levels like Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). MSUD is a rare metabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the activity of the branched-chain a-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The toxic accumulation of branched chain amino acids during acute metabolic decompensation is associated with the appearance of permanent neurological symptoms. Four patients were admitted to our pediatric intensive care department with complains of poor feeding, vomitting, irratibility and coma. Physical examination of the neonates were similar having stupor, hypotonia and depressed newborn reflexes. The leucine levels were between 930-4400 mumol/L. The diagnosis of MSUD was confirmed in all four. They were treated successfully with high flow CRRT having the rates were between 4120 ml/h/1.73m2 and 9830 ml/h/1.73m2. Early treatment is essential to prevent neurotoxicity and death. CRRT is a choice of treatment in metabolic crisis of MSUD. Herein, we report the successful treatment of acute metabolic decompensation of MSUD with CRRT in 4 neonates.",

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study at the Metabolic Rare Disease Unit, Fondazione IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza, Italy. Patients with MSUD who were over 3 years old, not treated with liver transplantation, and who provided written consent, were included. The study aimed to describe the dietary treatment of patients with MSUD, evaluate growth data, and analyze the effect of a low-protein and semi-synthetic diet on body composition. Data on height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, food intake, physical activity, and DEXA scans were collected. Thirteen subjects (11 classic MSUD, 2 intermediate MSUD) were included, of which 5 < 18 years old. Results indicated that patients with MSUD follow a balanced diet and have body compositions like healthy subjects in terms of fat and lean mass. A high incidence of osteopenia was observed from a young age, with a positive correlation between protein intake and lean mass and a negative correlation between BCAA-free mixture consumption and bone mineral density z-score. The study highlights the positive effects and potential consequences of the semi-synthetic diet on the body composition of patients with MSUD. A similar study involving all Italian metabolic centers treating MSUD is recommended.",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

STUDY DESIGN: A single center, retrospective review collected clinical data including branched-chain amino acid (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) levels following liver transplant and determined achievement of an ideal long-term outcome profile of a first allograft stable on immunosuppression monotherapy, normal growth, and absence of common transplant-related sequelae. RESULTS: Of 77 patients meeting inclusion criteria identified, 23 were long-term (>=10-year) survivors and were additionally assessed for ideal outcome attainment. Patient and graft survival were 100% and 99%, respectively, and all patients were on an unrestricted protein intake diet. Although significant variation was noted in mean isoleucine (P < .01) and leucine (P < .05) levels postliver transplantation, no difference was seen in valine (P = .29) and overall clinical impact was likely negligible as metabolic stability was achieved and sustained beyond 3 years postliver transplantation and no metabolic crises were identified. Of 23 long-term survivors with available data, 9 (39%) achieved all composite metrics determined to define \"ideal\" outcomes in pediatric postliver transplantation populations. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplant enables long-term metabolic stability for patients with maple syrup urine disease. A combination of experience and improvement in both pre- and postliver transplantation care has enabled excellent survival and minimal comorbidities following transplant.",

Patients with MSUD are at risk of life-threatening metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy. These episodes are often triggered by physiological stress. Only few cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers have been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the favorable outcome of a pregnancy in a woman with classical MSUD. She presented in the metabolic outpatient clinic in week 7 of gestation. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations were measured at least weekly to adjust dietary leucine intake. Despite excellent compliance, leucine concentrations frequently exceeded the target value of < 300 mumol/L during the first trimester. From the second trimester until delivery, protein and leucine intake increased continuously to about threefold compared to pre-pregnancy values. To maximize patient safety during delivery and the postpartum period, a detailed plan including peripartal infusion therapy, dietary recommendations and monitoring parameters was developed. Primary Caesarean section was performed in week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.",

MSUD varies in severity and its clinical spectrum is quite broad, ranging from mild to severe phenotypes. Thirty-three MSUD patients were recruited into this study for molecular genetic variant profiling and genotype-phenotype correlation. Except for one patient, all other patients presented with the classic neonatal form of the disease. Seventeen different variants were detected where nine were novel. The detected variants spanned across the entire BCKDHA, BCKDHB and DBT genes. All variants were in homozygous forms. The commonest alterations were nonsense and frameshift variants, followed by missense variants. For the prediction of variant's pathogenicity, we used molecular modeling and several in silico tools including SIFT, Polyphen2, Condel, and Provean. In addition, six other tools were used for the prediction of the conservation of the variants' sites including Eigen-PC, GERP++, SiPhy, PhastCons vertebrates and primates, and PhyloP100 rank scores. Herein, we presented a comprehensive characterization of a large cohort of patients with MSUD. The clinical severity of the variants' phenotypes was well correlated with the genotypes.

In 2014, the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) implemented a dried blood spot (DBS) home monitoring system, allowing patients to track BCAA concentrations without the inconvenience of having to travel to the hospital. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review study (n = 15) to assess the impacts of DBS monitoring implementation on biochemical control. Furthermore, we explored relationships among various MSUD patient parameters, including monitoring frequency, age, biochemical control, and hospitalizations. RESULTS: There was a 35% increase in the proportion of LEU concentrations that met recommended targets post-DBS monitoring implementation. Monitoring frequency was positively associated with better biochemical control in the newborn period (r = 0.68, p = 0.046). Frequency of hospital visits decreased steadily throughout life. CONCLUSION: DBS monitoring has resulted in a sharp increase in monitoring frequency, which is further correlated with biochemical control. Younger patients are more likely to visit the hospital and respond better to increased monitoring efforts. We recommend that DBS monitoring be adopted by other centers more broadly to improve metabolic control in MSUD patients.",

Primary Caesarean section was performed in week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.",

                    "abstract": "Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

We here analyze the ethical problems surrounding informed consent for the implant and explant procedures in transplant candidates who will serve as domino donors, using the case of a child with maple syrup urine disease. We discuss the need for 2 distinct consent processes separated in time to ensure that potential domino donors (or their surrogates) give a truly voluntary consent. We propose a Domino Donor Advocate-based on the concept of the independent living donor advocate to help the patient and/or his or her surrogates consider the risks, benefits and alternatives. Finally, we evaluate the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policy regarding \"therapeutic organ donation\" and propose several modifications to ensure that the decision by the potential domino donor (and/or his or her surrogate) is voluntary and informed.",

Despite its profound metabolic implications, the molecular alterations underlying this metabolic impairment had not yet been completely elucidated. We performed a comprehensive multi-omics integration analysis, including genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from fibroblasts derived from a cohort of MSUD patients and unaffected controls to genetically characterize an MSUD case and to unravel the MSUD pathophysiology. MSUD patients exhibit a defined episignature that reshapes the global DNA methylation landscape, resulting in the stimulation of HOX cluster genes and the restriction of cell cycle gene-related signatures. Subsequent data integration revealed the impact of AP1-related and CEBPB transcription factors on the observed molecular reorganization, with MEIS1 emerging as a potential downstream candidate affected by robust epigenetic repression in MSUD patients. Furthermore, the integration of multi-omics layers facilitated the identification of a strong epigenetic repression in the DBT promoter in a patient wherein no BCKDH pathogenic variants had been detected. A Circular Chromatin Conformation Capture assay indicated a disturbance of the interactions of DBT promoter, thereby unveiling alternative modes of disease inheritance. Integration of multi-omics data unveiled underlying molecular networks rewired in MSUD patients and represents a powerful approach with diagnostic potential for rare genetic disorders with unknown genetic bases.",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by severe deficiency of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex activity, resulting in tissue accumulation of branched-chain alpha-keto acids and amino acids, particularly alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) and leucine. Affected patients regularly manifest with acute episodes of encephalopathy including seizures, coma, and potentially fatal brain edema during the newborn period. The present work investigated the ex vivo effects of a single intracerebroventricular injection of KIC to neonate rats on redox homeostasis and neurochemical markers of neuronal viability (neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN)), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)), and myelination (myelin basic protein (MBP) and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)) in the cerebral cortex and striatum. KIC significantly disturbed redox homeostasis in these brain structures 6 h after injection, as observed by increased 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein oxidation (reactive oxygen species generation), malondialdehyde levels (lipid oxidative damage), and carbonyl formation (protein oxidative damage), besides impairing the antioxidant defenses (diminished levels of reduced glutathione and altered glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase activities) in both cerebral structures. Noteworthy, the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and melatonin attenuated or normalized most of the KIC-induced effects on redox homeostasis. Furthermore, a reduction of NeuN, MBP, and CNPase, and an increase of GFAP levels were observed at postnatal day 15, suggesting neuronal loss, myelination injury, and astrocyte reactivity, respectively.

Affected patients regularly manifest with acute episodes of encephalopathy including seizures, coma, and potentially fatal brain edema during the newborn period. The present work investigated the ex vivo effects of a single intracerebroventricular injection of KIC to neonate rats on redox homeostasis and neurochemical markers of neuronal viability (neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN)), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)), and myelination (myelin basic protein (MBP) and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)) in the cerebral cortex and striatum. KIC significantly disturbed redox homeostasis in these brain structures 6 h after injection, as observed by increased 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein oxidation (reactive oxygen species generation), malondialdehyde levels (lipid oxidative damage), and carbonyl formation (protein oxidative damage), besides impairing the antioxidant defenses (diminished levels of reduced glutathione and altered glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase activities) in both cerebral structures. Noteworthy, the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and melatonin attenuated or normalized most of the KIC-induced effects on redox homeostasis. Furthermore, a reduction of NeuN, MBP, and CNPase, and an increase of GFAP levels were observed at postnatal day 15, suggesting neuronal loss, myelination injury, and astrocyte reactivity, respectively.

Treatment for MSUD represents an unmet need because the current treatment with life-long low-protein diet is challenging to maintain, and despite treatment the risk of acute decompensations and neuropsychiatric symptoms remains. Here, based on significant liver contribution to the catabolism of the branched chain amino acid leucine, we develop a liver-directed adeno-associated virus (AAV8) gene therapy for MSUD. We establish and characterize the Bckdha (branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase a)-/- mouse that exhibits a lethal neonatal phenotype mimicking human MSUD. Animals were treated at P0 with intravenous human BCKDHA AAV8 vectors under the control of either a ubiquitous or a liver-specific promoter. BCKDHA gene transfer rescued the lethal phenotype. While the use of a ubiquitous promoter fully and sustainably rescued the disease (long-term survival, normal phenotype and correction of biochemical abnormalities), liver-specific expression of BCKDHA led to partial, though sustained rescue. Here we show efficacy of gene therapy for MSUD demonstrating its potential for clinical translation.",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare recessively inherited metabolic disorder causing accumulation of branched chain amino acids leading to neonatal death, if untreated. Treatment for MSUD represents an unmet need because the current treatment with life-long low-protein diet is challenging to maintain, and despite treatment the risk of acute decompensations and neuropsychiatric symptoms remains. Here, based on significant liver contribution to the catabolism of the branched chain amino acid leucine, we develop a liver-directed adeno-associated virus (AAV8) gene therapy for MSUD. We establish and characterize the Bckdha (branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase a)-/- mouse that exhibits a lethal neonatal phenotype mimicking human MSUD. Animals were treated at P0 with intravenous human BCKDHA AAV8 vectors under the control of either a ubiquitous or a liver-specific promoter. BCKDHA gene transfer rescued the lethal phenotype. While the use of a ubiquitous promoter fully and sustainably rescued the disease (long-term survival, normal phenotype and correction of biochemical abnormalities), liver-specific expression of BCKDHA led to partial, though sustained rescue. Here we show efficacy of gene therapy for MSUD demonstrating its potential for clinical translation.",

METHODS: All the neonates, infants and children who have had life threatening conditions due to MSUD and were treated with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent 15 sessions of CVVHDF (age range 15 days to 87 months, mean 40.8 +- 31.4 months). One patient required additional CVVHDF 1 week after cessation of CVVHDF. Twenty seven percent (n = 4) of the patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Twelve patients responded to treatment and dramatic neurological improvement was observed within 24 h. Two of the 14 patients required 36 h of CVVHDF for neurological improvement. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 20.2 +- 8.6 (9-36) h. The mean leucine level was 1,648 +- 623.8 (714-2,768) mumol/l before and was 256.5 +- 150.6 (117-646) mumol/l at the end of treatment. No mortality was observed.

METHODS: During the period of study, 724 (81% eligible cases) dried blood filter-paper samples were collected from a NICU. The samples were analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. The diagnosis was further confirmed through clinical symptoms and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were also confirmed by clinical follow-up of all positive patients in an overall interval of 1 year. The mean observation period was 11 months per neonate. RESULTS: In total, 22 cases were screen positive and 8 cases of inborn errors of metabolism were detected. The incidence of IEM in the population of patients admitted to the authors' NICU was 1.1%. The most common inborn error found was methylmalonic acidemia (3 cases, 37.5%), and all of the cases needed aggressive treatment and invasive mechanical ventilation. There were two cases of Tyrosinemia type 1, one case each of Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Propionic Acidemia, and Multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Five of the eight patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median length of NICU stay was 3 days (1~7 days) and early therapeutic intervention was effective for four of them and other four patients (50%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IEM in NICU was 1.1%, indicating an underestimation of the incidence of metabolic disorders prior to implementing screening. Most patients with IEM in the NICU required invasive mechanical ventilation and the mortality was increased due to underlying IEM.",

This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION: The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.",

We collected data about treatment, survival, hospitalization, metabolic control, and liver transplantation from patients with classic (i.e., severe; n = 176), intermediate (n = 6) and intermittent (n = 2) forms of MSUD. A total of 13,589 amino acid profiles were used to analyze leucine tolerance, amino acid homeostasis, estimated cerebral amino acid uptake, quantitative responses to anabolic therapy, and metabolic control after liver transplantation. Standard instruments were used to measure neuropsychiatric outcomes. Despite advances in clinical care, classic MSUD remains a morbid and potentially fatal disorder. Stringent dietary therapy maintains metabolic variables within acceptable limits but is challenging to implement, fails to restore appropriate concentration relationships among circulating amino acids, and does not fully prevent cognitive and psychiatric disabilities. Liver transplantation eliminates the need for a prescription diet and safeguards patients from life-threatening metabolic crises, but is associated with predictable morbidities and does not reverse pre-existing neurological sequelae. There is a critical unmet need for safe and effective disease-modifying therapies for MSUD which can be implemented early in life. The biochemistry and physiology of MSUD and its response to liver transplantation afford key insights into the design of new therapies based on gene replacement or editing.",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive disease associated with high levels of branched-chain amino acids. Children with MSUD can present severe neurological damage, but liver transplantation (LT) allows the patient to resume a normal diet and avoid further neurological damage. The use of living related donors has been controversial because parents are obligatory heterozygotes. We report a case of a 2-year-old child with MSUD who underwent a living donor LT. The donor was the patient's mother, and his liver was then used as a domino graft. The postoperative course was uneventful in all three subjects. DNA analysis performed after the transplantation (sequencing of the coding regions of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes) showed that the MSUD patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation in the BCKDHB gene. This mutation was not found in his mother, who is an obligatory carrier for MSUD according to the family history and, as expected, presented both normal clinical phenotype and levels of branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion, our data suggest that the use of a related donor in LT for MSUD was effective, and the liver of the MSUD patient was successfully used in domino transplantation. Routine donor genotyping may not be feasible, because the test is not widely available, and, most importantly, the disease is associated with both the presence of allelic and locus heterogeneity. Further studies with this population of patients are required to expand the use of related donors in MSUD. ",

Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases.",

PC deficiency causes abnormal blood clotting that is difficult to regulate by anticoagulative treatments. Four reports of PC deficiency treated with LTx have been published; however, no report of DLT as a therapy for PC deficiency is available. We describe a case of a 23-month-old girl who received DLT for compound heterozygous PC deficiency. Her PC activity was below 5%. She developed intracranial lesion and frequent refractory purpura fulminans. Both her parents had heterozygous mutations of PC genes and were excluded as living donors. Furthermore, she was a low priority on the waiting list of deceased-donor transplantation. We performed living DLT using the liver from a patient with MSUD. Activated PC concentrate safely supported the perioperative period. After DLT, she maintained normal PC activities and BCAA levels. This is the first case of PC deficiency successfully treated by living DLT with MSUD. We propose that DLT using liver from patients with MSUD is a treatment option for PC deficiency. ",

This study aimed to demonstrate the optimal operational procedures and the long-term outcomes of 2nd recipients. METHODS: Six 2nd recipients of living donor domino liver transplantation (LD-DLT) (age: 42.5 [22-169] months at DLT) received a native liver as a graft from an MSUD patient at our hospital between June 2014 and April 2020. We reviewed the operational procedures and outcomes of 2nd recipients after LD-DLT. RESULTS: The 2nd recipients' original diseases included biliary atresia, congenital hepatic fibrosis, congenital protein C deficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia, hepatoblastoma, and mitochondrial hepatopathy. Five of the six recipients had a whole liver and one had a right lobe graft. The site at which the vessels of the MSUD liver were dissected prioritized the safety of the 1st recipient. At the end of follow-up, all recipients were doing well without surgical complications. The mean serum amino acid values of the 2nd recipients did not exceed the upper limit of the reference values during the long-term observation period. All patients showed normal growth while maintaining the same z-score of height and weight after LD-DLT as the preoperative level. CONCLUSION: The liver of patients with MSUD can be used safely without concern regarding long-term complications or de novo MSUD development. LD-DLT using the MSUD liver can expand the donor pool as an alternative graft in pediatric LT.",

The most technically challenging part of LD-Domino LT is the reconstruction of the vessels. For the reconstruction of HVs, the native HVs were exteriorized as far as possible using a CUSA because longer extensive HVs are essential for facilitating the reconstruction. At the back table, the HVs of the domino graft were sutured together, and the single cuff of the HVs was anastomosed to the IVC by joining the orifices. The HAs, the presence of insufficient length, and multiple vessels in the whole liver rendered the reconstruction more difficult. We determined the dividing sites of the vessels according to the preoperative 3D-CT findings obtained in two institutions. This is the first case series using grafts in DLT obtained from LDLT for patients with MSUD between two institutions. In conclusion, LD-Domino LT is a safe and feasible therapeutic option to expand the donor pool by technical refinement in the reconstruction of the second recipient. Further studies with a greater accumulation of patients and a longer follow-up will be necessary to establish LD-Domino LT using an MSUD donor.",

This enzyme is essential for the second step in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Patients with MSUD are subject to severe, irreversible neurologic injury unless closely managed with a specialized metabolic formula and a diet restricted in leucine throughout their lifetime. During times of illness, patients with MSUD can suffer from severe metabolic derangement, acute cerebral edema, and untimely death. Deceased donor liver transplant restores the ability to metabolize branched-chain amino acids, even on an unrestricted diet, and prevents metabolic derangements during times of illness. We report a successful case of living donor (parental) transplant for a child with MSUD. The donor was the child's father. This approach has been controversial as parents of children with MSUD are obligate heterozygotes for the condition and have diminished levels of BCKDH activity. If effective, living-related donor transplant provides a promising alternative for deceased donor liver transplant, which often requires a prolonged waiting period and may not be feasible in areas with limited medical resources.

However, in our study, the domino liver was obtained from a pediatric patient. METHODS: A patient with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) underwent a living donor liver transplant, and the explanted liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes and transplanted to 2 separate patients. Demographic data, surgical techniques, postoperative period, and patient follow-ups were evaluated. RESULTS: The father's left lobe liver graft was transplanted into a 12-year-old boy with MSUD. The removed liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes. The left lobe was transplanted to a 14-year-old male patient, whereas the right lobe was transplanted to a 67-year-old male patient. The donor and the first recipient were discharged on postoperative days 5 and 22. The second pediatric patient who underwent domino split-left lobe transplantation was discharged on postoperative day 23. The adult patient who underwent domino split-right lobe transplantation died on postoperative day 12 owing to massive esophageal variceal bleeding. CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent liver transplantation due to MSUD are among the best donor choices for domino liver transplantation. If the extracted liver has a sufficient volume and anatomic features for a split, it can be used in \"selected cases.\"",

                    "abstract": "MSUD is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that results from a defect in the BCKDH enzyme. This enzyme is essential for the second step in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Patients with MSUD are subject to severe, irreversible neurologic injury unless closely managed with a specialized metabolic formula and a diet restricted in leucine throughout their lifetime. During times of illness, patients with MSUD can suffer from severe metabolic derangement, acute cerebral edema, and untimely death. Deceased donor liver transplant restores the ability to metabolize branched-chain amino acids, even on an unrestricted diet, and prevents metabolic derangements during times of illness. We report a successful case of living donor (parental) transplant for a child with MSUD. The donor was the child's father. This approach has been controversial as parents of children with MSUD are obligate heterozygotes for the condition and have diminished levels of BCKDH activity. If effective, living-related donor transplant provides a promising alternative for deceased donor liver transplant, which often requires a prolonged waiting period and may not be feasible in areas with limited medical resources.

                    "abstract": "Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

Patients with MSUD are at risk of life-threatening metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy. These episodes are often triggered by physiological stress. Only few cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers have been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the favorable outcome of a pregnancy in a woman with classical MSUD. She presented in the metabolic outpatient clinic in week 7 of gestation. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations were measured at least weekly to adjust dietary leucine intake. Despite excellent compliance, leucine concentrations frequently exceeded the target value of < 300 mumol/L during the first trimester. From the second trimester until delivery, protein and leucine intake increased continuously to about threefold compared to pre-pregnancy values. To maximize patient safety during delivery and the postpartum period, a detailed plan including peripartal infusion therapy, dietary recommendations and monitoring parameters was developed. Primary Caesarean section was performed in week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.",

                    "abstract": "Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inborn error of branched-chain amino acid metabolism affecting several thousand individuals worldwide. MSUD patients have elevated levels of plasma leucine and its metabolic product alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), which can lead to severe neurotoxicity, coma, and death. Patients must maintain a strict diet of protein restriction and medical formula, and periods of non-compliance or illness can lead to acute metabolic decompensation or cumulative neurological impairment. Given the lack of therapeutic options for MSUD patients, we sought to develop an oral enzyme therapy that can degrade leucine within the gastrointestinal tract prior to its systemic absorption and thus enable patients to maintain acceptable plasma leucine levels while broadening their access to natural protein. We identified a highly active leucine decarboxylase enzyme from Planctomycetaceae bacterium and used directed evolution to engineer the enzyme for stability to gastric and intestinal conditions. Following high-throughput screening of over 12 000 enzyme variants over 9 iterative rounds of evolution, we identified a lead variant, LDCv10, which retains activity following simulated gastric or intestinal conditions in vitro. In intermediate MSUD mice or healthy non-human primates given a whey protein meal, oral treatment with LDCv10 suppressed the spike in plasma leucine and KIC and reduced the leucine AUC in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction in plasma leucine correlated with decreased brain leucine levels following oral LDCv10 treatment. Collectively, these data support further development of LDCv10 as a potential new therapy for MSUD patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Information on these patients is limited. We present clinical, biochemical and molecular information on patients with variant forms of MSUD not detected by the California Newborn Screening Program. Between July 2005 and July 2009, 2200,000 newborns were screened in California by MS/MS. Seventeen cases of MSUD were detected and three (two siblings) were missed. Additionally, the NBS cards of two siblings with late onset MSUD, who were born pre-expanded NBS, were retrospectively analyzed. None of the five patients met criteria to be considered presumptive positive for MSUD (leucine>200micromol/L and a ratio of leucine/alanine>or=1.5). Alloisoleucine (allo-ile) was subsequently analyzed in the NBS cards of all five patients, two of whom were found to have elevated levels. The proband in each family was diagnosed following symptoms triggered by an intercurrent illness or increased protein intake. At diagnosis, leucine levels ranged between 561 and >4528micromol/L, and allo-ile ranged from 137 to 239micromol/L. Two affected siblings had normal plasma amino acids when asymptomatic; however, their biochemical profiles were diagnostic of MSUD during intercurrent illnesses. The median age at diagnosis of all patients was one year (range 0.8-6.7). Heterozygous BCKDHB (E1beta) mutations (c.832G>A/c.970C>T) were identified in one family and a homozygous DBT (E2) sequence variant (c.1430 T>G) in another. The third family had one identifiable DBT mutation (c.827T>G), however, a second mutation was not detected. This report provides further evidence that NBS by MS/MS is unable to detect all cases of MSUD. Second-tier testing with allo-ile may improve sensitivity; however, some children with variant forms will invariably be missed.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. Despite the advances in medical nutrition therapies, classical phenotype causes severe neurological disorders and sudden death. It is known that MSUD patients do not experience metabolic attacks despite their free diet after liver transplantation (LT). This study aims to reveal the long-term results, development, mental, motor, intellectual and nutritional status of MSUD patients who underwent LT. METHODS: The data of 12 patients who underwent deceased donor (5 recipients) and living donor liver transplantation (7 recipients) were retrospectively analyzed. The age, genotype, psychometric and mental status, development, BCAA values, type of LT, donor-recipient proximity, complications, and survival were assessed. RESULTS: There were 4 (33%) girls and 8 (67%) boys. The mean current age was 9.33 +- 4.58 years. The mean follow-up time was 3 +- 2.5 years. The repeated measures of leucine and isoleucine values revealed that there were no significant differences from the pre-LT to post-LT 1-year. The protein-restricted nutrition was switched to a free diet when oral intake was opened after LT. None of the recipients experienced metabolic attacks after the living donor or deceased donor LT. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate of the patients is 83.3%. There was no significant difference in survival between living and deceased donor liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is a treatment option for MSUD in proper conditions to save the patient life, increase the quality of life, and provide essential amino acids with free diet intake for growth and development.",

Short- and long-term course and outcome of these patients can impact the decision to offer this procedure to patients, especially those with diseases that can potentially be cured with liver transplant. We reviewed the outcomes of DLT from maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients in our large academic pediatric and adult transplant program. METHODS: All patients receiving DLT were analyzed retrospectively with a minimum of one-year follow-up period for patient and donor characteristics, early and late postoperative complications and patient and graft survival with their MSUD donors in terms of age, weight, MELD/PELD scores, cold ischemia time, postoperative leucine levels, and peak ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels during the first 48 postoperative hours. RESULTS: Between 2006 and May 2019, 21 patients underwent domino liver transplantation with live donor allografts from MSUD patients. Four patients transplanted for different metabolic diseases are focus of a separate report. Seventeen patients with minimum one-year follow-up period are reported herein. The indications were primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC, n = 4), congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF, n = 2), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A-1 ATD, n = 2), progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC, n = 2), cystic fibrosis (n = 1), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, n = 1), neonatal hepatitis (n = 1), embryonal sarcoma (n = 1), Caroli disease (n = 1), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 1), and chronic rejection after liver transplantations for PSC (n = 1). All patients and grafts survived at median follow-up of 6.4 years (range 1.2-12.9 years). Median domino recipient age was 16.2 years (range 0.6-64.6 years) and median MSUD recipient age was 17.6 years (range 4.8-32.1 years). There were no vascular complications during the early postoperative period, one patient had portal vein thrombosis 3 years after DLT and a meso-Rex bypass was successfully performed. Small for size syndrome (SFSS) occurred in reduced left lobe DLT recipient and was managed successfully with conservative management. Biliary stricture developed in 2 patients and was resolved by stenting. Comparison between DLT and MSUD recipients' peak postoperative ALT results and PELD/MELD scores showed lower levels in DLT group (P-value <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient and graft survival in DLT from MSUD donors was excellent at short- and long-term follow-up. Metabolic functions have been normal in all recipients on a normal unrestricted protein diet. Ischemia preservation injury based on peak ALT was significantly decreased in DLT recipients. Domino transplantation from pediatric and adult recipients with selected metabolic diseases should be increasingly considered as an excellent option and alternative to deceased donor transplantation, thereby expanding the living donor pool. This, to date, is the largest world experience in DLT utilizing livers from patients with MSUD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data describing the technical aspects of living donor (LD) domino liver transplantation (DLT) in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) are limited. The largest published series includes only 3 cases. One great challenge of this procedure is to ensure adequate vascular stumps for the LD, the MSUD patient, and the recipient of the domino graft. Here, we describe our experience in 11 cases of LD-DLT in MSUD, highlighting the technical aspects of LD-DLT. METHODS: From September 2012 to September 2017, 11 patients with MSUD underwent LD liver transplantation at our institution, and MSUD livers were used as domino grafts in 11 children. RESULTS: (1) MSUD patients: 10 patients received a left lateral segment. The donor's left hepatic vein (HV) was anastomosed to the confluence of the recipient's 3 HVs. No vascular grafts (VG) were required for portal vein (PV) anastomosis. Single arterial anastomosis was performed with microsurgery in 10 of 11 patients. (2) MSUD graft recipients: In 8 cases, HV reconstruction was performed between the graft's HV confluence and the recipient's HV confluence, and in 3 cases, a vena cava triangulation was necessary; 6 MSUD grafts required HV venoplasty. No VG were needed for HV reconstruction. VG were used for PV reconstruction in 3 cases due to sclerotic PV. In 2 cases, double arterial anastomoses were performed in the MSUD liver. All patients remain alive and well. CONCLUSIONS: Living donor liver transplantation followed by DLT for MSUD is a complex procedure and demands technical refinement. Special attention must be paid to vascular reconstruction.",

In 2014, the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) implemented a dried blood spot (DBS) home monitoring system, allowing patients to track BCAA concentrations without the inconvenience of having to travel to the hospital. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review study (n = 15) to assess the impacts of DBS monitoring implementation on biochemical control. Furthermore, we explored relationships among various MSUD patient parameters, including monitoring frequency, age, biochemical control, and hospitalizations. RESULTS: There was a 35% increase in the proportion of LEU concentrations that met recommended targets post-DBS monitoring implementation. Monitoring frequency was positively associated with better biochemical control in the newborn period (r = 0.68, p = 0.046). Frequency of hospital visits decreased steadily throughout life. CONCLUSION: DBS monitoring has resulted in a sharp increase in monitoring frequency, which is further correlated with biochemical control. Younger patients are more likely to visit the hospital and respond better to increased monitoring efforts. We recommend that DBS monitoring be adopted by other centers more broadly to improve metabolic control in MSUD patients.",

To our knowledge, ours is only the second successful case to date of a patient with MSUD receiving an allograft from an RLD who is a heterozygous carrier for the disease. In view of the worldwide shortage of available organs for transplantation, heterozygote to homozygote transplantation in the setting of MSUD may provide a viable alternative for those awaiting transplantation. We report on the case of a two-yr-old infant with MSUD, who received a left lateral segment (segments II and III) liver transplant from his mother, a heterozygote carrier of one of the three abnormal genes implicated in MSUD. Post-operative BCAA levels normalized in our patient and remained so on an unrestricted protein diet and during times of physiological stress. To date, this is only the second case of a successful RLD liver transplant in a child with MSUD. Preliminary results indicate that RLD liver transplants are at least equivalent to deceased donor liver transplants in the treatment of MSUD, although longer term follow-up is required. Heterozygote to homozygote RLD transplant in patients with MSUD presents a new pool of potential liver donors. ",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

Patients with MSUD are at risk of life-threatening metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy. These episodes are often triggered by physiological stress. Only few cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers have been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the favorable outcome of a pregnancy in a woman with classical MSUD. She presented in the metabolic outpatient clinic in week 7 of gestation. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations were measured at least weekly to adjust dietary leucine intake. Despite excellent compliance, leucine concentrations frequently exceeded the target value of < 300 mumol/L during the first trimester. From the second trimester until delivery, protein and leucine intake increased continuously to about threefold compared to pre-pregnancy values. To maximize patient safety during delivery and the postpartum period, a detailed plan including peripartal infusion therapy, dietary recommendations and monitoring parameters was developed. Primary Caesarean section was performed in week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.",

METHODS: Descriptive study of liver transplantation for MSUD between 1991 and 2012. Eight patients were transplanted. RESULTS: Indications for transplant were poor metabolic control expressed as significant psychomotor disabilities (4 had psychomotor delays, 5 had spasticity, and 5 had epilepsy) and poor quality of life (mean number of acute metabolic decompensations and mean number of total hospitalizations before transplantation 5 and 12, respectively). Four required nasogastric tube, with a maximum 4 g/day protein-restricted diet in all of them. Seven sustained significant alterations in brain magnetic resonance imaging. Mean leucine and alloisoleucine levels were 608 (standard deviation [SD] 516) and 218 mumol/L (SD 216), respectively. All of the patients received transplants with deceased-donor livers, with ages between 1.5 and 2.5 years (mean 1.78 years). Mean posttransplantation follow-up period was 12.2 years (range 5-21 years). Final patient and graft survival was 87.5% and 75%, respectively. Following transplantation, none required hospitalization in the last 3 years nor did any have new acute metabolic decompensations following a normal diet. Five followed normal schooling, 2 had motor disabilities, and 2 had convulsive crises. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was taken in 4 patients, showing neuroimage improvement in 3 of them. Mean leucine levels were <350 mumol/L from the immediate posttransplantation period (mean 225 mumol/L, SD 78), with a maximum alloisoleucine level of 20 mumol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for classical MSUD that arrests brain damage, although it does not reverse the process.",

Information on these patients is limited. We present clinical, biochemical and molecular information on patients with variant forms of MSUD not detected by the California Newborn Screening Program. Between July 2005 and July 2009, 2200,000 newborns were screened in California by MS/MS. Seventeen cases of MSUD were detected and three (two siblings) were missed. Additionally, the NBS cards of two siblings with late onset MSUD, who were born pre-expanded NBS, were retrospectively analyzed. None of the five patients met criteria to be considered presumptive positive for MSUD (leucine>200micromol/L and a ratio of leucine/alanine>or=1.5). Alloisoleucine (allo-ile) was subsequently analyzed in the NBS cards of all five patients, two of whom were found to have elevated levels. The proband in each family was diagnosed following symptoms triggered by an intercurrent illness or increased protein intake. At diagnosis, leucine levels ranged between 561 and >4528micromol/L, and allo-ile ranged from 137 to 239micromol/L. Two affected siblings had normal plasma amino acids when asymptomatic; however, their biochemical profiles were diagnostic of MSUD during intercurrent illnesses. The median age at diagnosis of all patients was one year (range 0.8-6.7). Heterozygous BCKDHB (E1beta) mutations (c.832G>A/c.970C>T) were identified in one family and a homozygous DBT (E2) sequence variant (c.1430 T>G) in another. The third family had one identifiable DBT mutation (c.827T>G), however, a second mutation was not detected. This report provides further evidence that NBS by MS/MS is unable to detect all cases of MSUD. Second-tier testing with allo-ile may improve sensitivity; however, some children with variant forms will invariably be missed.",

In the present study, we assess the clinical features and outcome of 14 MSUD Spanish patients with similar treatment protocol diagnosed either by NBS or by clinical symptoms. Eight patients were detected by NBS, four classic and four moderate MSUD. The average age at detection was 4.6 days, the mean plasmatic concentration of leucine at diagnosis was 1807 muM; the average number of days with leucine >1000 muM was 0.7 (0-4) and the mean number of total hospitalizations was 1.6 (0-5). Mean follow-up time was 70 months. They had good evolution: all remain asymptomatic, but 2 patients have attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Six patients with late diagnosis of classic MSUD were followed during 41 months. All presented with acute encephalopathy during the first month of life, mean leucine levels of 2355 muM, mean number of days with leucine >1000 muM of 6.6 (1-13) and mean number of total hospitalizations of 5.3 (4-7). Only two patients have a psychomotor development index in the lower limit (80 and 83). For all patients a good genotype-phenotype correlation was found and four novel mutations were identified: p.A311H, p.T84S, p.T397L, pL398P. Our study support that NBS improves prognosis of MSUD patients. But early diagnosis and an aggressive treatment together with a close monitoring of leucine levels improve neurological evolution in MSUD patients, even for those not detected by NBS. ",

However, the efficacy and safety of IHD in infants and young children with inborn errors of metabolism are still not clear. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and methylmalonic acidemia who received IHD or non-IHD RRT at our hospital between 2001 and 2012 to remove ammonia, leucine, or methylmalonic acid. Both the efficacy and safety of the RRT were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-five courses of RRT, including 25 courses of IHD and ten courses of non-IHD RRT, for 15 patients were included in the analysis. Before 2006, non-IHD RRT procedures, including peritoneal dialysis (PD) and continuous venous-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), were the most often used; from 2006 onwards IHD was used. There was one procedure-unrelated death. Catheter penetration occurred in one course of IHD. The efficacy data revealed that both the median duration of dialysis and the median 50 % toxin reduction time were shorter in IHD than in non-IHD RRT. CONCLUSIONS: In infants and young children with inborn errors of metabolism, IHD is safe and more efficient than non-IHD RRT at removing toxins.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) experiencing metabolic decompensations have traditionally been treated with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-free mixture via oral or nasogastric administration routes. In some patients, enteral administration is not possible, either because the patient presents with vomiting, coma, or refuses nasogastric administration, thus intravenous (IV) BCAA-free solution is an appropriate intervention for these challenging cases. AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of managing metabolic decompensations by administering an IV BCAA-free solution. METHODS: This is an observational prospective study of data from MSUD patients hospitalised for decompensation episodes between 2010 and 2016 at 6 centres for rare metabolic diseases in France. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients (16 males; 8 females) experiencing 126 MSUD metabolic decompensation episodes (39 in children; 87 in adults) were admitted to hospital. At presentation, mean leucine plasma concentration was >= 381 micromol/L in 113/126 (89.7%) episodes. Children were treated with continuous IV BCAA-free solution at doses of 0.8 to 2.0 g/kg/day, for 4.8 days and adults for 3.8 days at doses of 0.5 to 2.6 g/kg/day. In the efficacy set of 102 analysable episodes leucine concentrations were normalised (to below 381 micromol/L) in 82% (n = 18/22) of episodes in children and in 84% (n = 67/80) of episodes in adults. Mean time to leucine normalisation was 3.0 days. This was significantly (p < 0.001) shorter than the algorithmically predicted time to leucine normalisation with traditional BCAA-free mixture. Duration of hospitalisation was significantly longer for children than for adults (7.1 days in children vs 5.2 days in adults, p = 0.012). No treatment-related adverse events were reported in any patients on IV BCAA-free solution. CONCLUSION: The IV BCAA-free solution is safe and effective in normalising leucine concentrations during MSUD decompensation episodes in both children and adults, offering a practical treatment alternative for those patients who cannot receive BCAA-free mixture via oral or nasogastric routes.",

                    "abstract": "Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

We aimed to identify the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases that may arise from nutritional therapies and suggests approaches that may prevent the development of the noncommunicable diseases. METHODS: The present study evaluates 112 patients, on long-term nutritional therapy for at least the last 2 years with a diagnosis of an inborn error of the amino acid metabolism, and their 28 healthy siblings. The participants are assessed for the development of overweight and metabolic syndrome based on an analysis of anthropometric parameters, body composition and the results of biochemical tests. RESULTS: Anthropometric measurements including BMI, weight Z-score, waist circumference and fat mass were not significantly different between patients and controls. Height Z-scores were similar in phenylketonuria patients compared to controls, but lower in urea cycle disorders, organic acidemia and maple syrup urine disease groups. No increased risk of development of overweight or metabolic syndrome was detected in the patient group, while there were findings suggesting malnutrition in patients diagnosed with urea cycle disorders. There was a correlation between patients' BMI and C3-carnitine levels in organic acidemia patients and leucine levels in maple syrup urine disease patients. CONCLUSIONS: All forms of malnutrition can be prevented in patient groups receiving limited nutrients under a dietary management protocol, based on the findings of anthropometric and biochemical evaluations and analyses of body composition.",

                    "abstract": "Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

Several hereditary metabolic diseases (such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy, maple syrup urine disease, and familial hypercholesterolemia) are caused by aberrant or deficient protein production in the liver, and these conditions can be cured with an orthotopic liver transplant. Although their native livers eventually caused severe systemic disease in these patients, these livers are otherwise structurally and functionally normal, and they have been used successfully in domino liver transplants for the past 15 years.

However, its administration is ineffective in cases of gastric intolerance and some adult patients refuse enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube. We developed a new parenteral amino-acid mixture for patients with MSUD. METHODS: Seventeen decompensation episodes in four adult patients with MSUD treated with a parenteral amino-acid mixture (group P) were compared to 18 previous episodes in the same patients treated by enteral feeding (group E). RESULTS: The mean Leu concentration at presentation was similar in the groups P and E (1196.9 mumol/L and 1212.2 mumol/L, respectively). The mean decrease in the Leu concentration during the first 3 days of hospitalisation was significantly higher in group P than group E (p = 0.0026); there were no side effects. The mean duration of hospitalisation was similar (4 vs. 4.5 days, p = NS). No patient in group P deteriorated whereas one patient in group E required dialysis. CONCLUSION: This new parenteral amino-acid mixture is safe and allows efficient Leu concentration decrease during acute MSUD decompensation episodes in adults.

Despite the perioperative prophylactic administration of 12.5% hypertonic dextrose solution with insulin and a 20% intralipid emulsion, the blood levels of the branched-chain amino acids increased dramatically during surgery, consistent with an acute intraoperative metabolic decompensation.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Patients with MSUD are at risk of life-threatening metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy. These episodes are often triggered by physiological stress. Only few cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers have been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the favorable outcome of a pregnancy in a woman with classical MSUD. She presented in the metabolic outpatient clinic in week 7 of gestation. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations were measured at least weekly to adjust dietary leucine intake. Despite excellent compliance, leucine concentrations frequently exceeded the target value of < 300 mumol/L during the first trimester. From the second trimester until delivery, protein and leucine intake increased continuously to about threefold compared to pre-pregnancy values. To maximize patient safety during delivery and the postpartum period, a detailed plan including peripartal infusion therapy, dietary recommendations and monitoring parameters was developed. Primary Caesarean section was performed in week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.",

METHODS: The patients underwent continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) as renal replacement therapy. RESULTS: Eleven (68.75%) patients underwent CVVHDF and five (31.25%) underwent peritoneal dialysis. The median leucine reduction rate per hour was 2.56% (1.75-7.6) in the CVVHDF group, 0.78% (0.54-1.83) in the PD group, and was significantly higher in the CVVHDF group (p = 0.001). Posttreatment plasma leucine levels were found to be 198 (20-721) mumol/L in the CVVHDF group and 600 (250-967) mumol/L in the PD group, and CVVHDF was found to be significantly lower (p = 0.08). Complications such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and filter obstruction occurred in the CVVHDF group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that CVVHDF is more effective than PD for rapidly eliminating elevated leucine levels caused by MSUD in the newborn and it is not associated with increased complication rates.",

Rapid elimination of these metabolites by peritoneal or extracorporeal dialysis is crucial to prevent neuronal damage or death. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the outcomes of nine neonates with metabolic crisis treated with peritoneal dialysis. METHOD: Six neonates with hyperammonemic coma (four with organic acidemias, two with urea cycle disorders) and three with leucine accumulation due to maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) were managed with peritoneal dialysis in conjunction with dietary and pharmacological therapy. RESULTS: Three patients with organic acidemia survived. One of the patients was normal; others had moderate and severe neurological impairments. One neonate with organic acidemia and both neonates with urea cycle disorders died. Two of the three patients with MSUD survived without neurological impairment; the other had severe neurological damage and died at 9 months of age due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Theoretically, extracorporeal dialysis should be the first dialysis treatment of choice; however, this report demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis has a chance to prevent neurological damage in some patients. Therefore, in developing countries without extracorporeal dialysis opportunities, it can be still a life-saving procedure, if it is applied with skilled staff and standard procedures.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Some inborn errors of metabolism induce metabolic encephalopathy through accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites. Rapid elimination of these metabolites by peritoneal or extracorporeal dialysis is crucial to prevent neuronal damage or death. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the outcomes of nine neonates with metabolic crisis treated with peritoneal dialysis. METHOD: Six neonates with hyperammonemic coma (four with organic acidemias, two with urea cycle disorders) and three with leucine accumulation due to maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) were managed with peritoneal dialysis in conjunction with dietary and pharmacological therapy. RESULTS: Three patients with organic acidemia survived. One of the patients was normal; others had moderate and severe neurological impairments. One neonate with organic acidemia and both neonates with urea cycle disorders died. Two of the three patients with MSUD survived without neurological impairment; the other had severe neurological damage and died at 9 months of age due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Theoretically, extracorporeal dialysis should be the first dialysis treatment of choice; however, this report demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis has a chance to prevent neurological damage in some patients. Therefore, in developing countries without extracorporeal dialysis opportunities, it can be still a life-saving procedure, if it is applied with skilled staff and standard procedures.",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

We here analyze the ethical problems surrounding informed consent for the implant and explant procedures in transplant candidates who will serve as domino donors, using the case of a child with maple syrup urine disease. We discuss the need for 2 distinct consent processes separated in time to ensure that potential domino donors (or their surrogates) give a truly voluntary consent. We propose a Domino Donor Advocate-based on the concept of the independent living donor advocate to help the patient and/or his or her surrogates consider the risks, benefits and alternatives. Finally, we evaluate the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policy regarding \"therapeutic organ donation\" and propose several modifications to ensure that the decision by the potential domino donor (and/or his or her surrogate) is voluntary and informed.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data describing the technical aspects of living donor (LD) domino liver transplantation (DLT) in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) are limited. The largest published series includes only 3 cases. One great challenge of this procedure is to ensure adequate vascular stumps for the LD, the MSUD patient, and the recipient of the domino graft. Here, we describe our experience in 11 cases of LD-DLT in MSUD, highlighting the technical aspects of LD-DLT. METHODS: From September 2012 to September 2017, 11 patients with MSUD underwent LD liver transplantation at our institution, and MSUD livers were used as domino grafts in 11 children. RESULTS: (1) MSUD patients: 10 patients received a left lateral segment. The donor's left hepatic vein (HV) was anastomosed to the confluence of the recipient's 3 HVs. No vascular grafts (VG) were required for portal vein (PV) anastomosis. Single arterial anastomosis was performed with microsurgery in 10 of 11 patients. (2) MSUD graft recipients: In 8 cases, HV reconstruction was performed between the graft's HV confluence and the recipient's HV confluence, and in 3 cases, a vena cava triangulation was necessary; 6 MSUD grafts required HV venoplasty. No VG were needed for HV reconstruction. VG were used for PV reconstruction in 3 cases due to sclerotic PV. In 2 cases, double arterial anastomoses were performed in the MSUD liver. All patients remain alive and well. CONCLUSIONS: Living donor liver transplantation followed by DLT for MSUD is a complex procedure and demands technical refinement. Special attention must be paid to vascular reconstruction.",

However, in our study, the domino liver was obtained from a pediatric patient. METHODS: A patient with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) underwent a living donor liver transplant, and the explanted liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes and transplanted to 2 separate patients. Demographic data, surgical techniques, postoperative period, and patient follow-ups were evaluated. RESULTS: The father's left lobe liver graft was transplanted into a 12-year-old boy with MSUD. The removed liver was divided in situ into right and left lobes. The left lobe was transplanted to a 14-year-old male patient, whereas the right lobe was transplanted to a 67-year-old male patient. The donor and the first recipient were discharged on postoperative days 5 and 22. The second pediatric patient who underwent domino split-left lobe transplantation was discharged on postoperative day 23. The adult patient who underwent domino split-right lobe transplantation died on postoperative day 12 owing to massive esophageal variceal bleeding. CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent liver transplantation due to MSUD are among the best donor choices for domino liver transplantation. If the extracted liver has a sufficient volume and anatomic features for a split, it can be used in \"selected cases.\"",

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: In vitro fertilization unit. PATIENT(S): Couples presenting for PGT-SR (n = 15) and PGT-M (n = 2). INTERVENTION(S): Blastocyst biopsy with molecular testing for translocation breakpoints or mutations (targets). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Detailed, parental-phased, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles around targets for selection of informative polymorphic markers to simplify and facilitate clinical preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) designs that enable discrimination between carrier and noncarrier embryos. RESULT(S): High definition of chromosome breakpoints together with closely phased polymorphic markers was achieved for all 15 couples presenting for PGT-SR. Similarly, for the two couples presenting for PGT-M, tightly linked informative markers around the mutations were also simply identified. Three couples with translocations t(1;17)(q21;p13), t(3;13)(p25;q21.2), and t(12;13)(q23;q22) proceeded with PGT-SR, requesting preferential identification of noncarrier embryos for transfer. Following selection of a set of informative SNPs linked to breakpoints, we successfully performed PGT-SR tests, resulting in ongoing pregnancies with a noncarrier fetus for all couples. Similarly, with the use of tests based on informative SNPs linked to the parental mutations, one couple proceeded with PGT-M for maple syrup urine disease, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy with a disease-free fetus. CONCLUSION(S): For couples contemplating clinical PGT, variant haplophasing around the target reduces the workup process by enabling rapid selection of closely linked informative markers for patient-specific test design.",

                    "abstract": "Classic maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) results from biallelic mutations in genes that encode the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase E1alpha (BCKDHA), E1beta (BCKDHB), or dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase (DBT) subunits, which interact to form the mitochondrial BCKDH complex that decarboxylates ketoacid derivatives of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. MSUD is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by recurrent life-threatening neurologic crises and progressive brain injury that can only be managed with an exacting prescription diet or allogeneic liver transplant. To develop a gene replacement therapy for MSUD, we designed a dual-function recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) vector to deliver codon-optimized BCKDHA and BCKDHB (rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB) to the liver, muscle, heart, and brain. rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB restored coexpression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB as well as BCKDH holoenzyme activity in BCKDHA-/- HEK293T cells and did not perturb physiologic branched-chain amino acid homeostasis in wild-type mice at a systemic dose of 2.7 x 1014 vector genomes per kilogram. In two models of severe MSUD (Bckdha-/- and Bckdhb-/- mice) and a newborn calf homozygous for BCKDHA c.248C>T, one postnatal injection prevented perinatal death, normalized growth, restored coordinated expression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB in the skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and brain, and stabilized MSUD biomarkers in the face of high protein ingestion. In summary, we developed a one-time BCKDHA-BCKDHB systemic dual-gene replacement strategy that holds promise as a therapeutic alternative to prescription diet and liver transplant for treatment of MSUD types 1A and 1B, the two most common forms of MSUD in humans.",

                    "abstract": "Classic maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) results from biallelic mutations in genes that encode the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase E1alpha (BCKDHA), E1beta (BCKDHB), or dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase (DBT) subunits, which interact to form the mitochondrial BCKDH complex that decarboxylates ketoacid derivatives of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. MSUD is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by recurrent life-threatening neurologic crises and progressive brain injury that can only be managed with an exacting prescription diet or allogeneic liver transplant. To develop a gene replacement therapy for MSUD, we designed a dual-function recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) vector to deliver codon-optimized BCKDHA and BCKDHB (rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB) to the liver, muscle, heart, and brain. rAAV9.hA-BiP-hB restored coexpression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB as well as BCKDH holoenzyme activity in BCKDHA-/- HEK293T cells and did not perturb physiologic branched-chain amino acid homeostasis in wild-type mice at a systemic dose of 2.7 x 1014 vector genomes per kilogram. In two models of severe MSUD (Bckdha-/- and Bckdhb-/- mice) and a newborn calf homozygous for BCKDHA c.248C>T, one postnatal injection prevented perinatal death, normalized growth, restored coordinated expression of BCKDHA and BCKDHB in the skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and brain, and stabilized MSUD biomarkers in the face of high protein ingestion. In summary, we developed a one-time BCKDHA-BCKDHB systemic dual-gene replacement strategy that holds promise as a therapeutic alternative to prescription diet and liver transplant for treatment of MSUD types 1A and 1B, the two most common forms of MSUD in humans.",

We discuss the need for 2 distinct consent processes separated in time to ensure that potential domino donors (or their surrogates) give a truly voluntary consent. We propose a Domino Donor Advocate-based on the concept of the independent living donor advocate to help the patient and/or his or her surrogates consider the risks, benefits and alternatives.

Patients with MSUD are at risk of life-threatening metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis and encephalopathy. These episodes are often triggered by physiological stress. Only few cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers have been reported so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the favorable outcome of a pregnancy in a woman with classical MSUD. She presented in the metabolic outpatient clinic in week 7 of gestation. Branched-chain amino acid concentrations were measured at least weekly to adjust dietary leucine intake. Despite excellent compliance, leucine concentrations frequently exceeded the target value of < 300 mumol/L during the first trimester. From the second trimester until delivery, protein and leucine intake increased continuously to about threefold compared to pre-pregnancy values. To maximize patient safety during delivery and the postpartum period, a detailed plan including peripartal infusion therapy, dietary recommendations and monitoring parameters was developed. Primary Caesarean section was performed in week 38 of gestation, and the patient gave birth to a healthy girl. Lactation was successfully implemented. Leucine levels were maintained within the target range throughout the complete postpartum period. In addition to our case, we give an overview about all cases of pregnancies in MSUD mothers published so far. CONCLUSIONS: Management of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period and lactation may be challenging in patients with MSUD. Careful monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to minimize the risk of metabolic crisis, especially after delivery.",

                    "abstract": "Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inborn error of branched-chain amino acid metabolism affecting several thousand individuals worldwide. MSUD patients have elevated levels of plasma leucine and its metabolic product alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), which can lead to severe neurotoxicity, coma, and death. Patients must maintain a strict diet of protein restriction and medical formula, and periods of non-compliance or illness can lead to acute metabolic decompensation or cumulative neurological impairment. Given the lack of therapeutic options for MSUD patients, we sought to develop an oral enzyme therapy that can degrade leucine within the gastrointestinal tract prior to its systemic absorption and thus enable patients to maintain acceptable plasma leucine levels while broadening their access to natural protein. We identified a highly active leucine decarboxylase enzyme from Planctomycetaceae bacterium and used directed evolution to engineer the enzyme for stability to gastric and intestinal conditions. Following high-throughput screening of over 12 000 enzyme variants over 9 iterative rounds of evolution, we identified a lead variant, LDCv10, which retains activity following simulated gastric or intestinal conditions in vitro. In intermediate MSUD mice or healthy non-human primates given a whey protein meal, oral treatment with LDCv10 suppressed the spike in plasma leucine and KIC and reduced the leucine AUC in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction in plasma leucine correlated with decreased brain leucine levels following oral LDCv10 treatment. Collectively, these data support further development of LDCv10 as a potential new therapy for MSUD patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

METHODS: Descriptive study of liver transplantation for MSUD between 1991 and 2012. Eight patients were transplanted. RESULTS: Indications for transplant were poor metabolic control expressed as significant psychomotor disabilities (4 had psychomotor delays, 5 had spasticity, and 5 had epilepsy) and poor quality of life (mean number of acute metabolic decompensations and mean number of total hospitalizations before transplantation 5 and 12, respectively). Four required nasogastric tube, with a maximum 4 g/day protein-restricted diet in all of them. Seven sustained significant alterations in brain magnetic resonance imaging. Mean leucine and alloisoleucine levels were 608 (standard deviation [SD] 516) and 218 mumol/L (SD 216), respectively. All of the patients received transplants with deceased-donor livers, with ages between 1.5 and 2.5 years (mean 1.78 years). Mean posttransplantation follow-up period was 12.2 years (range 5-21 years). Final patient and graft survival was 87.5% and 75%, respectively. Following transplantation, none required hospitalization in the last 3 years nor did any have new acute metabolic decompensations following a normal diet. Five followed normal schooling, 2 had motor disabilities, and 2 had convulsive crises. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was taken in 4 patients, showing neuroimage improvement in 3 of them. Mean leucine levels were <350 mumol/L from the immediate posttransplantation period (mean 225 mumol/L, SD 78), with a maximum alloisoleucine level of 20 mumol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for classical MSUD that arrests brain damage, although it does not reverse the process.",

Little is known, however, about the psychosocial outcome of MSUD patients. This study investigates the relationship between metabolic and clinical parameters and psychosocial outcomes in a cohort of patients with neonatal-onset MSUD. METHODS: Data on academic achievement, psychological care, family involvement, and biochemical parameters were collected from the medical records of neonatal MSUD patients treated at Necker Hospital (Paris) between 1964 and 2013. RESULTS: Thirty-five MSUD patients with a mean age of 16.3 (2.1-49.0) years participated. Metabolic decompensations (plasma leucine >380 mumol/L) were more frequent during the first year of life and after 15 years, mainly due to infection and dietary noncompliance, respectively. Leucine levels increased significantly in adulthood: 61.5% of adults were independent and achieved adequate social and professional integration; 56% needed occasional or sustained psychological or psychiatric care (8/19, with externalizing, mood, emotional, and anxiety disorders being the most common). Patients needing psychiatric care were significantly older [mean and standard deviation (SD) 22.6 (7.7) years] than patients needing only psychological follow-up [mean (SD) 14.3 (8.9) years]. Patients with psychological follow-up experienced the highest lifetime number of decompensations; 45% of families had difficulty coping with the chronic disease. Parental involvement was negatively associated with the number of lifetime decompensations. CONCLUSION: Adults had increased levels of plasma leucine, consistent with greater chronic toxicity. Psychological care was associated with age and number of decompensations. In addition, parental involvement appeared to be crucial in the management of MSUD patients.",

METHODS: We report on the transplantation of a deceased donor liver into a patient with MSUD, and the sequential transplantation of the explanted liver into a patient with hemophilia A, HIV, hepatitis C, and a low priority on the transplant waiting list. RESULTS: At 30 months, the MSUD recipient has had significant correction of BCAA metabolism on a protein-unrestricted diet and no progression of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The DLT recipient has been cured of hemophilia and has normal BCAA homeostasis. This case provides further evidence that elective orthotopic liver transplantation for MSUD attenuates the disease with restoration of BCAA metabolism, and that DLT in this setting can achieve excellent results in ESLD patients. CONCLUSION: It is possible that domino grafts from patients with MSUD could be used in more conventional recipients, but additional studies and longer-term outcomes are needed to determine the validity of DLT in MSUD.",

This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION: The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.",

The most technically challenging part of LD-Domino LT is the reconstruction of the vessels. For the reconstruction of HVs, the native HVs were exteriorized as far as possible using a CUSA because longer extensive HVs are essential for facilitating the reconstruction. At the back table, the HVs of the domino graft were sutured together, and the single cuff of the HVs was anastomosed to the IVC by joining the orifices. The HAs, the presence of insufficient length, and multiple vessels in the whole liver rendered the reconstruction more difficult. We determined the dividing sites of the vessels according to the preoperative 3D-CT findings obtained in two institutions. This is the first case series using grafts in DLT obtained from LDLT for patients with MSUD between two institutions. In conclusion, LD-Domino LT is a safe and feasible therapeutic option to expand the donor pool by technical refinement in the reconstruction of the second recipient. Further studies with a greater accumulation of patients and a longer follow-up will be necessary to establish LD-Domino LT using an MSUD donor.",

In this observational retrospective study, we assessed transfusion practices in pediatric patients undergoing liver transplantation at a single institution over the course of 9 years. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from patient medical records at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. All patients who underwent liver transplantation from January 2008 to June 2017 were included. Primary and secondary outcomes were volume of red blood cells (RBCs) transfused and mortality, respectively. RESULTS: From January 2008 to June 2017, there were 278 liver transplants in 271 patients. The number of primary transplants were 259, second retransplants 15, and third retransplants 4. Average age at transplantation was 6.9 years. Biliary atresia, maple syrup urine disease, urea cycle defect, and liver tumor were the leading indications accounting for 66 (23.7%), 45 (16.2%), 24 (8.6%), and 23 (8.3%) of transplants, respectively. Seventy-six cases (27.3%) did not require RBC transfusions. Among those transfused, 181 (89.6%) of the cases required <1 blood volume (BV). The median BV transfused among all cases was 0.21 (range, 0-9; Q1, 0; Q3, 0.45). There is a trend toward higher volume transfusions among infants (median, 0.46 BV) compared to children >12 months of age (0.12 BV). By diagnosis, the group requiring the highest median volume transfusion was patients with total parenteral nutrition-related liver failure (3.41 BV) followed by patients undergoing repeat transplants (0.6 BV). Comparison of primary versus repeat transplants shows a trend toward higher volume transfusions in third transplants (median, 2.71 BV), compared to second transplants (0.43 BV) and primary transplants (0.18 BV). Four of 271 patients (1.5%) died during admission involving liver transplantation. Nine of 271 patients (3.3%) died subsequently. Total mortality was 4.8%. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to historically reported trends, evaluation of current transfusion practices reveals that most patients undergoing liver transplantation receive <1 BV of packed RBCs. More than 1 in 4 transplantations require no transfusion at all. Risk factors for greater transfusion need include younger age, total parenteral nutrition-related liver failure, and repeat transplantation.",

Although accumulation of toxic metabolites is associated with neurotoxicity, mechanisms underlying brain damage remain unclear. Aim of this study is to evaluate thiol/disulphide homeostasis as a novel indicator of oxidative stress in MSUD patients under treatment. Twenty patients with MSUD and 20 healthy individuals were included in study. All patients were under regular follow-up and had a good metabolic control. Serum native thiol (-SH), total thiol (-SH + -S-S-), disulphide (-S-S) levels were measured in all subjects. Disulphide/native thiol, disulphide/total thiol and native thiol/total thiol ratios were calculated from these values. Simultaneous blood sampling for plasma quantitative amino acid analysis was performed in both groups. Any significant difference was not observed in -SH, -SH + -S-S-, -S-S levels between two groups. In addition no increase of disulphide/native thiol and disulphide/total thiol ratios was detected in patient group. This study is the first study that evaluates dynamic thiol/disulphide homeostasis as an indicator of oxidative stress in MSUD patients. Among previous studies that were made to determine oxidative stress in treated MSUD patients, this study had the largest sample size also. In recent studies, it was claimed that oxidative stress could be responsible from neurotoxicity even in treated patients. Here, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis status showed that providing good metabolic control in MSUD patients prevent oxidative stress. Under regular follow-up and good compliance with diet, additional antioxidant therapies would possibly not be necessary.",

Acute and long-term management of MSUD involves a restricted diet and regular monitoring of amino acid levels; however, more recently liver transplants have been shown to be successful in treating this condition. Even with successful management of MSUD there is evidence from pediatric cases that shows a distinct pattern of neurocognitive deficits associated with this condition, including impaired nonverbal skills and psychomotor functioning with relatively intact verbal abilities. In the present paper, we report an adult case of MSUD with associated neurocognitive deficits and functional limitations following liver transplantation. Neuroimaging revealed no structural abnormalities, while the results from the neuropsychological evaluation showed impairment in visual-spatial processing, attention, executive functioning, and psychomotor abilities, with relative strengths in verbal skills. The patient also showed reduced adaptive functioning and mild anxiety. This case demonstrates neurocognitive deficiencies within the context of normal magnetic resonance imaging. The possible underlying mechanism of this neuropsychological profile is discussed in relation to other neurodevelopmental models. ",

BCKDH catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). BCAAs and their neurotoxic alpha-keto intermediates can accumulate in the blood and tissues in the absence of functional BCKDH. We evaluated a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based treatment approach to address all possible genetic mutations that can cause MSUD (BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT). In the intermediate MSUD mouse model, which harbors a mutation in the dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 (DBT) subunit of BCKDH, repeated administration of LNP-encapsulated mRNA therapy significantly extended survival and reduced serum leucine levels. We also evaluated our LNP approach in several models of classic MSUD, namely DBT knockout (KO) mice and the new BCKDHA KO and BCKDHB KO mice. The latter two were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and contain the highly prevalent classic MSUD-causing mutations seen in the Mennonite and Costa Rican populations. Intravenous LNP-encapsulated mRNA administration extended survival and increased body weight in the DBT KO and BCKDHA KO models of classic MSUD but was not effective in BCKDHB KO mice. Our data provide a promising proof-of-concept that a universal, mutation-independent approach to treating MSUD is possible and viable.",

METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients were identified through a national reference laboratory for the diagnosis of MSUD and through contact with other medical genetics services across Brazil. Data were collected by means of a chart review. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients from 75 families were enrolled in the study (median age, 3 years; interquartile range [IQR], 0.57-7). Median age at onset of symptoms was 10 days (IQR 5-30), whereas median age at diagnosis was 60 days (IQR 29-240, p=0.001). Only three (3.6%) patients were diagnosed before the onset of clinical manifestations. A comparison between patients with (n=12) and without (n=71) an early diagnosis shows that early diagnosis is associated with the presence of positive family history and decreased prevalence of clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, but not with a better outcome. Overall, 98.8% of patients have some psychomotor or neurodevelopmental delay. CONCLUSION: In Brazil, patients with MSUD are usually diagnosed late and exhibit neurological involvement and poor survival even with early diagnosis. We suggest that specific public policies for diagnosis and treatment of MSUD should be developed and implemented in the country.",

Routine screening of newborn with tandem mass spectroscopy on the third day of life may detect elevated branched-chain amino acids in blood before the appearance of encephalopathic symptoms in MSUD cases. If undiagnosed by such a routine screening test, patients often present with encephalopathy and seizures. Clinical neurologic examination is supplemented by electroencephalography and imaging. Here, we report abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalography, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy findings in a neurologically asymptomatic male newborn who was diagnosed with MSUD at the third week of life. These neurologic disturbances disappeared at the fourth month of life with appropriate special diet. Therefore, even in already asymptomatic cases, early neurologic deterioration of brain metabolism and structure can be detected with these early laboratory findings, indicating the importance of early diagnosis and management.

Routine screening of newborn with tandem mass spectroscopy on the third day of life may detect elevated branched-chain amino acids in blood before the appearance of encephalopathic symptoms in MSUD cases. If undiagnosed by such a routine screening test, patients often present with encephalopathy and seizures. Clinical neurologic examination is supplemented by electroencephalography and imaging. Here, we report abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalography, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy findings in a neurologically asymptomatic male newborn who was diagnosed with MSUD at the third week of life. These neurologic disturbances disappeared at the fourth month of life with appropriate special diet. Therefore, even in already asymptomatic cases, early neurologic deterioration of brain metabolism and structure can be detected with these early laboratory findings, indicating the importance of early diagnosis and management. Patients may also benefit from these investigations during the follow-up period. ",

METHODS: During the period of study, 724 (81% eligible cases) dried blood filter-paper samples were collected from a NICU. The samples were analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. The diagnosis was further confirmed through clinical symptoms and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were also confirmed by clinical follow-up of all positive patients in an overall interval of 1 year. The mean observation period was 11 months per neonate. RESULTS: In total, 22 cases were screen positive and 8 cases of inborn errors of metabolism were detected. The incidence of IEM in the population of patients admitted to the authors' NICU was 1.1%. The most common inborn error found was methylmalonic acidemia (3 cases, 37.5%), and all of the cases needed aggressive treatment and invasive mechanical ventilation. There were two cases of Tyrosinemia type 1, one case each of Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Propionic Acidemia, and Multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Five of the eight patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median length of NICU stay was 3 days (1~7 days) and early therapeutic intervention was effective for four of them and other four patients (50%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IEM in NICU was 1.1%, indicating an underestimation of the incidence of metabolic disorders prior to implementing screening. Most patients with IEM in the NICU required invasive mechanical ventilation and the mortality was increased due to underlying IEM.",

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: In vitro fertilization unit. PATIENT(S): Couples presenting for PGT-SR (n = 15) and PGT-M (n = 2). INTERVENTION(S): Blastocyst biopsy with molecular testing for translocation breakpoints or mutations (targets). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Detailed, parental-phased, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles around targets for selection of informative polymorphic markers to simplify and facilitate clinical preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) designs that enable discrimination between carrier and noncarrier embryos. RESULT(S): High definition of chromosome breakpoints together with closely phased polymorphic markers was achieved for all 15 couples presenting for PGT-SR. Similarly, for the two couples presenting for PGT-M, tightly linked informative markers around the mutations were also simply identified. Three couples with translocations t(1;17)(q21;p13), t(3;13)(p25;q21.2), and t(12;13)(q23;q22) proceeded with PGT-SR, requesting preferential identification of noncarrier embryos for transfer. Following selection of a set of informative SNPs linked to breakpoints, we successfully performed PGT-SR tests, resulting in ongoing pregnancies with a noncarrier fetus for all couples. Similarly, with the use of tests based on informative SNPs linked to the parental mutations, one couple proceeded with PGT-M for maple syrup urine disease, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy with a disease-free fetus. CONCLUSION(S): For couples contemplating clinical PGT, variant haplophasing around the target reduces the workup process by enabling rapid selection of closely linked informative markers for patient-specific test design.",

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study at the Metabolic Rare Disease Unit, Fondazione IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza, Italy. Patients with MSUD who were over 3 years old, not treated with liver transplantation, and who provided written consent, were included. The study aimed to describe the dietary treatment of patients with MSUD, evaluate growth data, and analyze the effect of a low-protein and semi-synthetic diet on body composition. Data on height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, food intake, physical activity, and DEXA scans were collected. Thirteen subjects (11 classic MSUD, 2 intermediate MSUD) were included, of which 5 < 18 years old. Results indicated that patients with MSUD follow a balanced diet and have body compositions like healthy subjects in terms of fat and lean mass. A high incidence of osteopenia was observed from a young age, with a positive correlation between protein intake and lean mass and a negative correlation between BCAA-free mixture consumption and bone mineral density z-score. The study highlights the positive effects and potential consequences of the semi-synthetic diet on the body composition of patients with MSUD.

Children with MSUD can present severe neurological damage, but liver transplantation (LT) allows the patient to resume a normal diet and avoid further neurological damage. The use of living related donors has been controversial because parents are obligatory heterozygotes. We report a case of a 2-year-old child with MSUD who underwent a living donor LT. The donor was the patient's mother, and his liver was then used as a domino graft. The postoperative course was uneventful in all three subjects. DNA analysis performed after the transplantation (sequencing of the coding regions of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes) showed that the MSUD patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation in the BCKDHB gene. This mutation was not found in his mother, who is an obligatory carrier for MSUD according to the family history and, as expected, presented both normal clinical phenotype and levels of branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion, our data suggest that the use of a related donor in LT for MSUD was effective, and the liver of the MSUD patient was successfully used in domino transplantation. Routine donor genotyping may not be feasible, because the test is not widely available, and, most importantly, the disease is associated with both the presence of allelic and locus heterogeneity. Further studies with this population of patients are required to expand the use of related donors in MSUD. ",

Recent reports of successful DLT in children with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) show promising long-term outcomes. METHODS: It was a retrospective study. All children with MSUD were paired with either recipients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or non-MSUD metabolic disease. Each pair underwent simultaneous liver transplant (LT), where the MSUD recipient received the graft from a living-related donor and the liver explanted from the MSUD donor was transplanted to the respective paired domino recipient. We report our experience regarding the techniques and outcomes of DLT at our center. RESULTS: Eleven children with MSUD and 12 respective DLT recipients were enrolled, one of which was domino split-liver transplantation. DLT recipients included seven ESLD, two propionic acidemia (PA), one glycogen storage disease(GSD) type-1, one GSD type-3, and one Citrullinemia. Post-LT ICU and hospital stays were comparable (p > .05). Patient and graft survival was 100% and 66.6% in the MSUD group and DLT recipients at a mean follow-up of 13.5 and 15 months. There was no death in the MSUD group as compared to four in the DLT group. The amino acid levels rapidly normalized after the LT in the children with MSUD and they tolerated the normal unrestricted diet. No vascular, biliary, or graft-related complications were seen in the post-transplant period. No occurrence of MSUD was noted in DLT recipients. CONCLUSION: DLTs have excellent post-surgical outcomes. DLT should be strongly considered and adopted by transplant programs worldwide to circumvent organ shortage.",

If undiagnosed by such a routine screening test, patients often present with encephalopathy and seizures. Clinical neurologic examination is supplemented by electroencephalography and imaging. Here, we report abnormal amplitude-integrated electroencephalography, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy findings in a neurologically asymptomatic male newborn who was diagnosed with MSUD at the third week of life. These neurologic disturbances disappeared at the fourth month of life with appropriate special diet. Therefore, even in already asymptomatic cases, early neurologic deterioration of brain metabolism and structure can be detected with these early laboratory findings, indicating the importance of early diagnosis and management.

The patient requires special protein-restricted diet to survive. As this enzyme is expressed in liver, liver transplantation has been successfully performed as a cure. We report two patients of MSUD who underwent LDLT while their livers were used as a domino graft for other biliary cirrhotic patients. A 22-month-old male child diagnosed as a case of classic MSUD underwent LDLT from an altruistic aunt as donor following which his serum leucine levels normalized on an unrestricted protein diet. His liver was used as a domino graft. A 38-month-old female child with diagnosed MSUD underwent LDLT from a swap donor, and her liver was used as a domino graft. Her DQ improved post-transplant. LDLT from non-heterozygous donors is a cure for classical MSUD. Their livers can be used as domino grafts for non-MSUD cases. ",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by a deficiency in the activity of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex, promoting the accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine, and valine, as well as their respective alpha-keto acids. MSUD is an autosomal recessive hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by ketoacidosis, ataxia, coma, and mental and psychomotor retardation. The mechanisms involved in the brain damage caused by MSUD are not fully understood. Early diagnosis and treatment, as well as proper control of metabolic decompensation crises, are crucial for patients' survival and for a better prognosis. The recommended treatment consists of a high-calorie diet with restricted protein intake and specific formulas containing essential amino acids, except those accumulated in MSUD. This treatment will be maintained throughout life, being adjusted according to the patients' nutritional needs and BCAA concentration. Because dietary treatment may not be sufficient to prevent neurological damage in MSUD patients, other therapeutic strategies have been studied, including liver transplantation. With transplantation, it is possible to obtain an increase of about 10% of the normal BCKD in the body, an amount sufficient to maintain amino acid homeostasis and reduce metabolic decompensation crises. However, the experience related to this practice is very limited when considering the shortage of liver for transplantation and the risks related to the surgical procedure and immunosuppression. Thus, the purpose of this review is to survey the benefits, risks, and challenges of liver transplantation in the treatment of MSUD.",

The accumulation of toxic metabolites may cause acute metabolic crisis with long-term neurological dysfunction and death. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities allow the efficient removal of toxic metabolites. In this study, we reviewed our experience with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) as RRT for newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with an inborn metabolic disease and who received CVVHDF treatment at our neonatal intensive care unit between January 2014 and December 2017 were included in this study. Their demographic and clinical data were collected, and the efficacy and safety of CVVHDF was evaluated. Results: A total of nine continuous RRT (CRRT) sessions as CVVHDF were performed in eight newborns with a diagnosis of urea cycle defect (n = 5), maple syrup urine disease (n = 2), or methylmalonic acidemia (n = 1). The mean age at admission was 10 +- 8.6 days (range: 3-28 days). The mean plasma levels of ammonium were 1120 +- 512.6 mg/dL and 227.5 +- 141.6 mg/dL before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. Plasma levels of leucine were 2053.5 +- 1282 mumol/L and 473.5 +- 7.8 mumol/L before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. The CVVHDF duration was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (median: 37 h; range: 16-44 h), and the mean length of hospitalization was 14.6 +- 12.9 days. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (range: 16-44 h). Circuit clotting was the most common observed complication (37.5%) and the survival rate was 50%. Among surviving patients, two developed severe and two developed mild mental and motor retardation. Conclusion: CVVHDF is a CRRT modality that can be used to treat newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Early diagnosis, commencement of specific medical therapy, diet, and extracorporeal support, if needed, are likely to result in improved short and long- term outcomes.",

Because either of parents who are heterozygote of this disease usually applies to be a candidate of donor in LDLT, the impairment of BCKADC activity of graft liver should be concerned. We performed LDLT for 10 month-old girl with a left lateral segment graft from her father. BCKADC activities of the patient and her parents were measured using lysates of lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood specimen before the transplant. As a consequence, the activity of BCKADC of father was not inferior to a normal range. The patient tolerated the operation well. Postoperative course was uneventful and mixed milk was started at 8th POD. The serum BCAAs levels have remained within normal range.

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

In a domino liver transplant, the domino recipient receives the explanted liver from the recipient of a traditional liver transplant. The domino donor typically requires liver transplant to correct a metabolic disorder; the explanted liver thus has a single gene defect but otherwise normal structure and function. METHODS: In this review, we detail the history of domino liver transplantation, appropriate domino donor indications, the technical advances to the surgical approach, current outcomes, and future opportunities. RESULTS: Development of de novo disease in the domino recipient has relegated adult domino liver transplant to be considered a source of marginal donor livers. However, pediatric domino liver transplant has leveraged certain metabolic disorders, especially maple syrup urine disease, in which the liver enzyme deficiency can be compensated by the systemic presence of sufficient enzyme. Advances in the surgical aspects of assuring adequate length of vasculature have improved the safety of the procedure in both domino donors and recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric domino liver transplant utilizing domino donors with specific metabolic liver diseases should be considered a viable live donor option for children awaiting liver transplant.",

This study aimed to demonstrate the optimal operational procedures and the long-term outcomes of 2nd recipients. METHODS: Six 2nd recipients of living donor domino liver transplantation (LD-DLT) (age: 42.5 [22-169] months at DLT) received a native liver as a graft from an MSUD patient at our hospital between June 2014 and April 2020. We reviewed the operational procedures and outcomes of 2nd recipients after LD-DLT. RESULTS: The 2nd recipients' original diseases included biliary atresia, congenital hepatic fibrosis, congenital protein C deficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia, hepatoblastoma, and mitochondrial hepatopathy. Five of the six recipients had a whole liver and one had a right lobe graft. The site at which the vessels of the MSUD liver were dissected prioritized the safety of the 1st recipient. At the end of follow-up, all recipients were doing well without surgical complications. The mean serum amino acid values of the 2nd recipients did not exceed the upper limit of the reference values during the long-term observation period. All patients showed normal growth while maintaining the same z-score of height and weight after LD-DLT as the preoperative level. CONCLUSION: The liver of patients with MSUD can be used safely without concern regarding long-term complications or de novo MSUD development. LD-DLT using the MSUD liver can expand the donor pool as an alternative graft in pediatric LT.",

The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes about diet, barriers to and facilitators of dietary adherence, and experiences with the health care system in promoting dietary adherence among adolescent and adult women with inborn errors of metabolism to identify policy-level interventions to improve adherence. We analyzed the results of four focus groups including a total of 19 women between the ages of 12 and 52 years with phenylketonuria, methylmalonic acidemia, or maple syrup urine disease attending an educational summer camp in 2008. Themes were identified after independent analysis of transcripts. Most participants were highly knowledgeable about their dietary requirements and some could describe their own specific negative experiences of nonadherence. Many reported specific challenges, such as feelings of being different, that they experienced in elementary and middle school. Friends and family play an important role in maintaining dietary adherence. Participants identified one registered dietitian in particular who has played an important supportive role. Insurance coverage for medical foods was a common concern. Most participants identified concerns about transitioning from pediatric to adult medical services. We identified four specific strategies for future evaluation that may improve dietary adherence and health outcomes for women and their potential offspring: symptom-based dietary monitoring for some, educating school officials about medical diets, expanding the role of registered dietitians; and assisting with the transition from pediatric to adult health care providers.",

Although deficiency of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDC) and associated elevations in the BCAAs and their ketoacids have been recognized as the cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) for decades, treatment options for this disorder have been limited to dietary interventions. In recent years, the discovery of improved leucine tolerance after liver transplantation has resulted in a new therapeutic strategy for this disorder. Likewise, targeting the regulation of the BCKDC activity may be an alternative potential treatment strategy for MSUD. The regulation of the BCKDC by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase has also been implicated in a new inborn error of metabolism characterized by autism, intellectual disability and seizures. Finally, there is a growing body of literature implicating BCAA metabolism in more common disorders such as the metabolic syndrome, cancer and hepatic disease. This review surveys the knowledge acquired on the topic over the past 50 years and focuses on recent developments in the field of BCAA metabolism. ",

However, clinical shortages of suitable livers for hepatocyte isolation indicate a need for alternative cell sources. Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) share stem cell characteristics without the latter's safety and ethical concerns and differentiate to hepatocyte-like cells. Eight direct hepatic hAEC transplantations were performed in iMSUD mice over the first 35 days beginning at birth; animals were provided a normal protein diet and sacrificed at 35 and 100 days. Treatment at the neonatal stage is clinically relevant for MSUD and may offer a donor cell engraftment advantage. Survival was significantly extended and body weight was normalized in iMSUD mice receiving hAEC transplantations compared with untreated iMSUD mice, which were severely cachectic and died <=28 days after birth. Branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme activity was significantly increased in transplanted livers. The branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, valine, and alloisoleucine were significantly improved in serum and brain, as were other large neutral amino acids. CONCLUSION: Placental-derived stem cell transplantation lengthened survival and corrected many amino acid imbalances in a mouse model of iMSUD. This highlights the potential for their use as a viable alternative clinical therapy for MSUD and other liver-based metabolic diseases.",

                    "abstract": "Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency results in complex and volatile metabolic derangements that threaten brain development. Treatment for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) should address this underlying physiology while also protecting children from nutrient deficiencies. Based on a 20-year experience managing 79 patients, we designed a study formula to (1) optimize transport of seven amino acids (Tyr, Trp, His, Met, Thr, Gln, Phe) that compete with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) for entry into the brain via a common transporter (LAT1), (2) compensate for episodic depletions of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine caused by reverse transamination, and (3) correct deficiencies of omega-3 essential fatty acids, zinc, and selenium widespread among MSUD patients. The formula was enriched with LAT1 amino acid substrates, glutamine, alanine, zinc, selenium, and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Fifteen Old Order Mennonite children were started on study formula between birth and 34 months of age and seen at least monthly in the office. Amino acid levels were checked once weekly and more often during illnesses. All children grew and developed normally over a period of 14-33 months. Energy demand, leucine tolerance, and protein accretion were tightly linked during periods of normal growth. Rapid shifts to net protein degradation occurred during illnesses. At baseline, most LAT1 substrates varied inversely with plasma leucine, and their calculated rates of brain uptake were 20-68% below normal. Treatment with study formula increased plasma concentrations of LAT1 substrates and normalized their calculated uptakes into the nervous system. Red cell membrane omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and serum zinc and selenium levels increased on study formula. However, selenium and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) levels remained below normal. During the study period, hospitalizations decreased from 0.35 to 0.14 per patient per year. There were 28 hospitalizations managed with MSUD hyperalimentation solution; 86% were precipitated by common infections, especially vomiting and gastroenteritis. The large majority of catabolic illnesses were managed successfully at home using 'sick-day' formula and frequent amino acid monitoring. We conclude that the study formula is safe and effective for the treatment of classical MSUD. In principle, dietary enrichment protects the brain against deficiency of amino acids used for protein accretion, neurotransmitter synthesis, and methyl group transfer. Although the pathophysiology of MSUD can be addressed through rational formula design, this does not replace the need for vigilant clinical monitoring, frequent measurement of the complete amino acid profile, and ongoing dietary adjustments that match nutritional intake to the metabolic demands of growth and illness.",

METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients were identified through a national reference laboratory for the diagnosis of MSUD and through contact with other medical genetics services across Brazil. Data were collected by means of a chart review. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients from 75 families were enrolled in the study (median age, 3 years; interquartile range [IQR], 0.57-7). Median age at onset of symptoms was 10 days (IQR 5-30), whereas median age at diagnosis was 60 days (IQR 29-240, p=0.001). Only three (3.6%) patients were diagnosed before the onset of clinical manifestations. A comparison between patients with (n=12) and without (n=71) an early diagnosis shows that early diagnosis is associated with the presence of positive family history and decreased prevalence of clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, but not with a better outcome. Overall, 98.8% of patients have some psychomotor or neurodevelopmental delay. CONCLUSION: In Brazil, patients with MSUD are usually diagnosed late and exhibit neurological involvement and poor survival even with early diagnosis. We suggest that specific public policies for diagnosis and treatment of MSUD should be developed and implemented in the country.",

To our knowledge, ours is only the second successful case to date of a patient with MSUD receiving an allograft from an RLD who is a heterozygous carrier for the disease. In view of the worldwide shortage of available organs for transplantation, heterozygote to homozygote transplantation in the setting of MSUD may provide a viable alternative for those awaiting transplantation. We report on the case of a two-yr-old infant with MSUD, who received a left lateral segment (segments II and III) liver transplant from his mother, a heterozygote carrier of one of the three abnormal genes implicated in MSUD. Post-operative BCAA levels normalized in our patient and remained so on an unrestricted protein diet and during times of physiological stress. To date, this is only the second case of a successful RLD liver transplant in a child with MSUD. Preliminary results indicate that RLD liver transplants are at least equivalent to deceased donor liver transplants in the treatment of MSUD, although longer term follow-up is required. Heterozygote to homozygote RLD transplant in patients with MSUD presents a new pool of potential liver donors. ",

STUDY DESIGN: A single center, retrospective review collected clinical data including branched-chain amino acid (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) levels following liver transplant and determined achievement of an ideal long-term outcome profile of a first allograft stable on immunosuppression monotherapy, normal growth, and absence of common transplant-related sequelae. RESULTS: Of 77 patients meeting inclusion criteria identified, 23 were long-term (>=10-year) survivors and were additionally assessed for ideal outcome attainment. Patient and graft survival were 100% and 99%, respectively, and all patients were on an unrestricted protein intake diet. Although significant variation was noted in mean isoleucine (P < .01) and leucine (P < .05) levels postliver transplantation, no difference was seen in valine (P = .29) and overall clinical impact was likely negligible as metabolic stability was achieved and sustained beyond 3 years postliver transplantation and no metabolic crises were identified. Of 23 long-term survivors with available data, 9 (39%) achieved all composite metrics determined to define \"ideal\" outcomes in pediatric postliver transplantation populations. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplant enables long-term metabolic stability for patients with maple syrup urine disease. A combination of experience and improvement in both pre- and postliver transplantation care has enabled excellent survival and minimal comorbidities following transplant.",

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: In vitro fertilization unit. PATIENT(S): Couples presenting for PGT-SR (n = 15) and PGT-M (n = 2). INTERVENTION(S): Blastocyst biopsy with molecular testing for translocation breakpoints or mutations (targets). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Detailed, parental-phased, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles around targets for selection of informative polymorphic markers to simplify and facilitate clinical preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) designs that enable discrimination between carrier and noncarrier embryos. RESULT(S): High definition of chromosome breakpoints together with closely phased polymorphic markers was achieved for all 15 couples presenting for PGT-SR. Similarly, for the two couples presenting for PGT-M, tightly linked informative markers around the mutations were also simply identified. Three couples with translocations t(1;17)(q21;p13), t(3;13)(p25;q21.2), and t(12;13)(q23;q22) proceeded with PGT-SR, requesting preferential identification of noncarrier embryos for transfer. Following selection of a set of informative SNPs linked to breakpoints, we successfully performed PGT-SR tests, resulting in ongoing pregnancies with a noncarrier fetus for all couples. Similarly, with the use of tests based on informative SNPs linked to the parental mutations, one couple proceeded with PGT-M for maple syrup urine disease, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy with a disease-free fetus. CONCLUSION(S): For couples contemplating clinical PGT, variant haplophasing around the target reduces the workup process by enabling rapid selection of closely linked informative markers for patient-specific test design.",

                    "abstract": "Background/aim: Most inborn metabolic diseases are diagnosed during the neonatal period. The accumulation of toxic metabolites may cause acute metabolic crisis with long-term neurological dysfunction and death. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities allow the efficient removal of toxic metabolites. In this study, we reviewed our experience with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) as RRT for newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with an inborn metabolic disease and who received CVVHDF treatment at our neonatal intensive care unit between January 2014 and December 2017 were included in this study. Their demographic and clinical data were collected, and the efficacy and safety of CVVHDF was evaluated. Results: A total of nine continuous RRT (CRRT) sessions as CVVHDF were performed in eight newborns with a diagnosis of urea cycle defect (n = 5), maple syrup urine disease (n = 2), or methylmalonic acidemia (n = 1). The mean age at admission was 10 +- 8.6 days (range: 3-28 days). The mean plasma levels of ammonium were 1120 +- 512.6 mg/dL and 227.5 +- 141.6 mg/dL before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. Plasma levels of leucine were 2053.5 +- 1282 mumol/L and 473.5 +- 7.8 mumol/L before and at the end of the treatment, respectively. The CVVHDF duration was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (median: 37 h; range: 16-44 h), and the mean length of hospitalization was 14.6 +- 12.9 days. The mean duration of CVVHDF was 32.3 +- 11.1 h (range: 16-44 h). Circuit clotting was the most common observed complication (37.5%) and the survival rate was 50%. Among surviving patients, two developed severe and two developed mild mental and motor retardation. Conclusion: CVVHDF is a CRRT modality that can be used to treat newborns with an inborn metabolic disease. Early diagnosis, commencement of specific medical therapy, diet, and extracorporeal support, if needed, are likely to result in improved short and long- term outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "Since 1972, 18 patients (10 females/8 males) have been detected by newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) with neonatal-onset maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) in Ireland. Patients were stratified into three clusters according to clinical outcome at the time of data collection, including developmental, clinical, and IQ data. A fourth cluster comprised of two early childhood deaths; a third patient died as an adult. We present neuroimaging and electroencephalography together with clinical and biochemical data. Incidence of MSUD (1972-2018) was 1 in 147 975. Overall good clinical outcomes were achieved with 15/18 patients alive and with essentially normal functioning (with only the lowest performing cluster lying beyond a single SD on their full scale intelligence quotient). Molecular genetic analysis revealed genotypes hitherto not reported, including a possible digenic inheritance state for the BCKDHA and DBT genes in one family. Treatment has been based on early implementation of emergency treatment, diet, close monitoring, and even dialysis in the setting of acute metabolic decompensation. A plasma leucine >=400 mumol/L (outside therapeutic range) was more frequently observed in infancy or during adolescence, possibly due to infections, hormonal changes, or noncompliance. Children require careful management during metabolic decompensations in early childhood, and this represented a key risk period in our cohort. A high level of metabolic control can be achieved through diet with early implementation of a \"sick day\" regime and, in some cases, dialysis as a rescue therapy. The Irish cohort, despite largely classical phenotypes, achieved good outcomes in the NBS era, underlining the importance of early diagnosis and skilled multidisciplinary team management.",

Although deficiency of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDC) and associated elevations in the BCAAs and their ketoacids have been recognized as the cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) for decades, treatment options for this disorder have been limited to dietary interventions. In recent years, the discovery of improved leucine tolerance after liver transplantation has resulted in a new therapeutic strategy for this disorder. Likewise, targeting the regulation of the BCKDC activity may be an alternative potential treatment strategy for MSUD. The regulation of the BCKDC by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase has also been implicated in a new inborn error of metabolism characterized by autism, intellectual disability and seizures. Finally, there is a growing body of literature implicating BCAA metabolism in more common disorders such as the metabolic syndrome, cancer and hepatic disease. This review surveys the knowledge acquired on the topic over the past 50 years and focuses on recent developments in the field of BCAA metabolism. ",

However, its administration is ineffective in cases of gastric intolerance and some adult patients refuse enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube. We developed a new parenteral amino-acid mixture for patients with MSUD. METHODS: Seventeen decompensation episodes in four adult patients with MSUD treated with a parenteral amino-acid mixture (group P) were compared to 18 previous episodes in the same patients treated by enteral feeding (group E). RESULTS: The mean Leu concentration at presentation was similar in the groups P and E (1196.9 mumol/L and 1212.2 mumol/L, respectively). The mean decrease in the Leu concentration during the first 3 days of hospitalisation was significantly higher in group P than group E (p = 0.0026); there were no side effects. The mean duration of hospitalisation was similar (4 vs. 4.5 days, p = NS). No patient in group P deteriorated whereas one patient in group E required dialysis. CONCLUSION: This new parenteral amino-acid mixture is safe and allows efficient Leu concentration decrease during acute MSUD decompensation episodes in adults. Its use avoids the need for nasogastric tube insertion.",

                    "abstract": "Since 1972, 18 patients (10 females/8 males) have been detected by newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) with neonatal-onset maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) in Ireland. Patients were stratified into three clusters according to clinical outcome at the time of data collection, including developmental, clinical, and IQ data. A fourth cluster comprised of two early childhood deaths; a third patient died as an adult. We present neuroimaging and electroencephalography together with clinical and biochemical data. Incidence of MSUD (1972-2018) was 1 in 147 975. Overall good clinical outcomes were achieved with 15/18 patients alive and with essentially normal functioning (with only the lowest performing cluster lying beyond a single SD on their full scale intelligence quotient). Molecular genetic analysis revealed genotypes hitherto not reported, including a possible digenic inheritance state for the BCKDHA and DBT genes in one family. Treatment has been based on early implementation of emergency treatment, diet, close monitoring, and even dialysis in the setting of acute metabolic decompensation. A plasma leucine >=400 mumol/L (outside therapeutic range) was more frequently observed in infancy or during adolescence, possibly due to infections, hormonal changes, or noncompliance. Children require careful management during metabolic decompensations in early childhood, and this represented a key risk period in our cohort. A high level of metabolic control can be achieved through diet with early implementation of a \"sick day\" regime and, in some cases, dialysis as a rescue therapy. The Irish cohort, despite largely classical phenotypes, achieved good outcomes in the NBS era, underlining the importance of early diagnosis and skilled multidisciplinary team management.",

METHODS: We retrospectively summarize our experience with HD in 20 neonates with IEM-induced metabolic intoxication (seven with maple syrup urine disease, 13 with primary hyperammonia), over a 16-year period, between 2004 and 2020. All patients presented with IEM-induced neurologic deterioration at 48 h to 14 days post-delivery, and were managed with HD in a pediatric intensive care setting. HD was performed through an internal jugular acute double-lumen catheter (6.5-7.0 French), using an AK-200S (Gambro, Sweden) dialysis machine and tubing, with F3 or FXpaed (Fresenius, Germany) dialyzers. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) age and weight at presentation were 5 (3-8) days and 2830 (2725-3115) g, respectively. Two consecutive HD sessions decreased the mean leucine levels from 2281 +- 631 to 179 +- 91 mumol/L (92.1% reduction) in MSUD patients, and the mean ammonia levels from 955 +- 444 to 129 +- 55 mumol/L (86.5% reduction), in patients with hyperammonemia. HD was uneventful in all patients, and led to marked clinical improvement in 17 patients (85%). Three patients (15%) died during the neonatal period, and four died during long-term follow-up.

                    "abstract": "Several recent studies have reported that toxic metabolites accumulated in the body as a product of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are eliminated more rapidly with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) than with peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, there is still uncertainty about the impacts of dialysis modalities on the short-term outcome. Here, it was aimed to investigate the effects of dialysis modalities on the short-term outcome. This retrospective study included 40 newborn infants who underwent PD (29 patients) or CVVHDF (11 patients) due to inborn errors of metabolism at a tertiary centre, between June 2013 and March 2018. The outcomes and the potential effects of the dialysis modality were evaluated. Of 40 patients, 21 were urea cycle defect, 14 were organic academia, and 5 were maple syrup urine disease. The median 50% reduction time of toxic metabolites were shorter in patients treated with CVVHDF (p < 0.05). Catheter blockage was the most common complication observed in PD group (24.1%), whereas in CVVHDF group hypotension and filter blockage were more common. There was no significant difference in mortality between dialysis groups (38% vs. 45.4%, p > 0.05). In patients with hyperammonaemia, duration of plasma ammonia > 200 mug/dL was the most important factor influencing mortality (OR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, p = 0.007).Conclusion: This study showed that CVVHDF is more efficient than PD to rapidly eliminate toxic metabolites caused by IEM in newborn infants, but not in improving survival. What is Known:  Toxic metabolites are eliminated more rapidly with CVVHDF than with PD.  Higher complication rates were reported with rigid peritoneal catheters in PD and catheter blockage in CVVHDF. What is New:  Prolonged duration of plasma ammonia levels above a safe limit (200 mug/dL) was associated with increased mortality.  Lower catheter-related complication rates may have been associated with the use of Tenckhoff catheters in PD and the use of right internal jugular vein in CVVHDF.",

However, the efficacy and safety of IHD in infants and young children with inborn errors of metabolism are still not clear. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with urea cycle disorders, maple syrup urine disease, and methylmalonic acidemia who received IHD or non-IHD RRT at our hospital between 2001 and 2012 to remove ammonia, leucine, or methylmalonic acid. Both the efficacy and safety of the RRT were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-five courses of RRT, including 25 courses of IHD and ten courses of non-IHD RRT, for 15 patients were included in the analysis. Before 2006, non-IHD RRT procedures, including peritoneal dialysis (PD) and continuous venous-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), were the most often used; from 2006 onwards IHD was used. There was one procedure-unrelated death. Catheter penetration occurred in one course of IHD. The efficacy data revealed that both the median duration of dialysis and the median 50 % toxin reduction time were shorter in IHD than in non-IHD RRT. CONCLUSIONS: In infants and young children with inborn errors of metabolism, IHD is safe and more efficient than non-IHD RRT at removing toxins.",

METHODS: Neonates treated with PD in our neonatal intensive care unit during 2007-2010 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Among 4036 hospitalized neonates; 20 neonates (0.5%) who underwent 21 cycles of PD [7 preterm, 13 term; 13 female, 7 male] were included. The mean birth weight was 2930.2 +- 720.6 g (1120-4570), mean gestational age was 37.5 +- 3.5 weeks (27-41). The etiologic disorders included inborn errors of metabolism (propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, citrullinemia, glutaric aciduria type 2, maple syrup urine disease, 10), or acute renal failure secondary to perinatal asphyxia (4), sepsis (2), prematurity (2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (1), kernicterus (1). The complications included peritonitis (2), early leakage (4), hemorrhage (1), catheter removal (3) and occlusion (2). The mortality rate was 50%. The gestational ages and birth weights of surviving neonates were higher (p < 0.05). Among surviving neonates, chronic renal failure (1), severe (4) and moderate neuromotor impairment (2) developed within 4-43 months. CONCLUSION: PD, although invasive, is an effective therapy in neonates. The complexity and invasiveness of the procedure is probably responsible for high rate of complications and mortality. If appropriate catheter selection and technique in the placement should be done, PD might improve outcome.",

Liver-directed gene therapy has recently become an option for treatment of haemophilias and is likely to become one of the favoured therapeutic strategies for inherited metabolic liver diseases in the near future. In this review, we present the different gene therapy vectors and strategies for liver-targeting, including gene editing. We highlight the current development of viral and nonviral gene therapy for a number of inherited metabolic liver diseases including urea cycle defects, organic acidaemias, Crigler-Najjar disease, Wilson disease, glycogen storage disease Type Ia, phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease. We describe the main limitations and open questions for further gene therapy development: immunogenicity, inflammatory response, genotoxicity, gene therapy administration in a fibrotic liver. The follow-up of a constantly growing number of gene therapy treated patients allows better understanding of its benefits and limitations and provides strategies to design safer and more efficacious treatments. Undoubtedly, liver-targeting gene therapy offers a promising avenue for innovative therapies with an unprecedented potential to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from inherited metabolic diseases.",

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 35 patients with classical MSUD (age 9.9 +- 7.9 years) underwent liver transplantation between 2004 and 2009. Six patients donated their liver to recipients without MSUD (\"domino\" transplant). We analyzed clinical outcomes for our cohort and 17 additional cases from the national United Network for Organ Sharing registry; 33 patients completed IQ and adaptive testing before transplantation, and 14 completed testing 1 year later. RESULTS: Patient and graft survival were 100% at 4.5 +- 2.2 years of follow-up. Liver function was normal in all patients. Branched-chain amino acid levels were corrected within hours after surgery and remained stable, with leucine tolerance increasing more than 10-fold. All domino transplant recipients were alive and well with normal branched-chain amino acid homeostasis at the time of this report. Patient and graft survival for all 54 patients with MSUD undergoing liver transplantation in the United States during this period were 98% and 96%, respectively. One-third of our patients were mentally impaired (IQ <= 70) before transplantation, with no statistically significant change 1 year later. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation is an effective long-term treatment for classical MSUD and may arrest brain damage, but will not reverse it.",

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a dysfunctional mitochondrial enzyme complex, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which catabolizes branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Without functional BCKDH, BCAAs and their neurotoxic alpha-keto intermediates can accumulate in the blood and tissues. MSUD is currently incurable and treatment is limited to dietary restriction or liver transplantation, meaning there is a great need to develop new treatments for MSUD. We evaluated potential gene therapy applications for MSUD in the intermediate MSUD (iMSUD) mouse model, which harbors a mutation in the dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 (DBT) subunit of BCKDH. Systemic delivery of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing DBT under control of the liver-specific TBG promoter to the liver did not sufficiently ameliorate all aspects of the disease phenotype. These findings necessitated an alternative therapeutic strategy. Muscle makes a larger contribution to BCAA metabolism than liver in humans, but a muscle-specific approach involving a muscle-specific promoter for DBT expression delivered via intramuscular (IM) administration only partially rescued the MSUD phenotype in mice. Combining the muscle-tropic AAV9 capsid with the ubiquitous CB7 promoter via IM or IV injection, however, substantially increased survival across all assessed doses. Additionally, near-normal serum BCAA levels were achieved and maintained in the mid- and high-dose cohorts throughout the study; this approach also protected these mice from a lethal high-protein diet challenge. Therefore, administration of a gene therapy vector that expresses in both muscle and liver may represent a viable approach to treating patients with MSUD.",

Dietary management enables survival and reduces risk of acute crises. Liver transplantation has emerged as an effective way to eliminate acute decompensation risk. Psychiatric illness is a reported MSUD complication, but has not been well characterized and remains poorly understood. We report the prevalence and characteristics of neuropsychiatric problems among 37 classical MSUD patients (ages 5-35 years, 26 on dietary therapy, 11 after liver transplantation) and explore their underlying mechanisms. Compared with 26 age-matched controls, MSUD patients were at higher risk for disorders of cognition, attention, and mood. Using quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found lower brain glutamate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and creatine concentrations in MSUD patients, which correlated with specific neuropsychiatric outcomes. Asymptomatic neonatal course and stringent longitudinal biochemical control proved fundamental to optimizing long-term mental health. Neuropsychiatric morbidity and neurochemistry were similar among transplanted and nontransplanted MSUD patients. In conclusion, amino acid dysregulation results in aberrant neural networks with neurochemical deficiencies that persist after transplant and correlate with neuropsychiatric morbidities. These findings may provide insight into general mechanisms of psychiatric illness.",

Children with MSUD can present severe neurological damage, but liver transplantation (LT) allows the patient to resume a normal diet and avoid further neurological damage. The use of living related donors has been controversial because parents are obligatory heterozygotes. We report a case of a 2-year-old child with MSUD who underwent a living donor LT. The donor was the patient's mother, and his liver was then used as a domino graft. The postoperative course was uneventful in all three subjects. DNA analysis performed after the transplantation (sequencing of the coding regions of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT genes) showed that the MSUD patient was heterozygous for a pathogenic mutation in the BCKDHB gene. This mutation was not found in his mother, who is an obligatory carrier for MSUD according to the family history and, as expected, presented both normal clinical phenotype and levels of branched-chain amino acids. In conclusion, our data suggest that the use of a related donor in LT for MSUD was effective, and the liver of the MSUD patient was successfully used in domino transplantation. Routine donor genotyping may not be feasible, because the test is not widely available, and, most importantly, the disease is associated with both the presence of allelic and locus heterogeneity. Further studies with this population of patients are required to expand the use of related donors in MSUD. ",

RESULTS: Indications for transplant were poor metabolic control expressed as significant psychomotor disabilities (4 had psychomotor delays, 5 had spasticity, and 5 had epilepsy) and poor quality of life (mean number of acute metabolic decompensations and mean number of total hospitalizations before transplantation 5 and 12, respectively). Four required nasogastric tube, with a maximum 4 g/day protein-restricted diet in all of them. Seven sustained significant alterations in brain magnetic resonance imaging. Mean leucine and alloisoleucine levels were 608 (standard deviation [SD] 516) and 218 mumol/L (SD 216), respectively. All of the patients received transplants with deceased-donor livers, with ages between 1.5 and 2.5 years (mean 1.78 years). Mean posttransplantation follow-up period was 12.2 years (range 5-21 years). Final patient and graft survival was 87.5% and 75%, respectively. Following transplantation, none required hospitalization in the last 3 years nor did any have new acute metabolic decompensations following a normal diet. Five followed normal schooling, 2 had motor disabilities, and 2 had convulsive crises. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was taken in 4 patients, showing neuroimage improvement in 3 of them. Mean leucine levels were <350 mumol/L from the immediate posttransplantation period (mean 225 mumol/L, SD 78), with a maximum alloisoleucine level of 20 mumol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for classical MSUD that arrests brain damage, although it does not reverse the process.",

Despite the advances in medical nutrition therapies, classical phenotype causes severe neurological disorders and sudden death. It is known that MSUD patients do not experience metabolic attacks despite their free diet after liver transplantation (LT). This study aims to reveal the long-term results, development, mental, motor, intellectual and nutritional status of MSUD patients who underwent LT. METHODS: The data of 12 patients who underwent deceased donor (5 recipients) and living donor liver transplantation (7 recipients) were retrospectively analyzed. The age, genotype, psychometric and mental status, development, BCAA values, type of LT, donor-recipient proximity, complications, and survival were assessed. RESULTS: There were 4 (33%) girls and 8 (67%) boys. The mean current age was 9.33 +- 4.58 years. The mean follow-up time was 3 +- 2.5 years. The repeated measures of leucine and isoleucine values revealed that there were no significant differences from the pre-LT to post-LT 1-year. The protein-restricted nutrition was switched to a free diet when oral intake was opened after LT. None of the recipients experienced metabolic attacks after the living donor or deceased donor LT. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate of the patients is 83.3%. There was no significant difference in survival between living and deceased donor liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is a treatment option for MSUD in proper conditions to save the patient life, increase the quality of life, and provide essential amino acids with free diet intake for growth and development.",

Here we present one institution's 27 years of experience with LT in IEMs. Our objective is to assess the outcomes of IEM patients who have undergone LT, which we hypothesize to be generally successful for prevention of metabolic decompensation. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, and amino acidopathies who underwent LT at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-five patients with the following conditions have undergone LT: tyrosinemia (8), methylmalonic acidemia (7), maple syrup urine disease (6), citrullinemia (6), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (4), propionic acidemia (2), and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (2). Average age at transplantation was 3.6 years. Three patients are now deceased. One patient suffered a metabolic stroke posttransplant. No episodes of metabolic decompensation have been noted. Thirty-five patients received LT with generally favorable outcome. None sustained metabolic decompensation posttransplant. As has been reported previously, LT does not ameliorate pre-existing developmental differences or risk to other organ systems. Further research is needed to aid in standardization of care and follow-up, as most patients no longer follow with a geneticist.",

STUDY DESIGN: A single center, retrospective review collected clinical data including branched-chain amino acid (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) levels following liver transplant and determined achievement of an ideal long-term outcome profile of a first allograft stable on immunosuppression monotherapy, normal growth, and absence of common transplant-related sequelae. RESULTS: Of 77 patients meeting inclusion criteria identified, 23 were long-term (>=10-year) survivors and were additionally assessed for ideal outcome attainment. Patient and graft survival were 100% and 99%, respectively, and all patients were on an unrestricted protein intake diet. Although significant variation was noted in mean isoleucine (P < .01) and leucine (P < .05) levels postliver transplantation, no difference was seen in valine (P = .29) and overall clinical impact was likely negligible as metabolic stability was achieved and sustained beyond 3 years postliver transplantation and no metabolic crises were identified. Of 23 long-term survivors with available data, 9 (39%) achieved all composite metrics determined to define \"ideal\" outcomes in pediatric postliver transplantation populations. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplant enables long-term metabolic stability for patients with maple syrup urine disease. A combination of experience and improvement in both pre- and postliver transplantation care has enabled excellent survival and minimal comorbidities following transplant.",

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 35 patients with classical MSUD (age 9.9 +- 7.9 years) underwent liver transplantation between 2004 and 2009. Six patients donated their liver to recipients without MSUD (\"domino\" transplant). We analyzed clinical outcomes for our cohort and 17 additional cases from the national United Network for Organ Sharing registry; 33 patients completed IQ and adaptive testing before transplantation, and 14 completed testing 1 year later. RESULTS: Patient and graft survival were 100% at 4.5 +- 2.2 years of follow-up. Liver function was normal in all patients. Branched-chain amino acid levels were corrected within hours after surgery and remained stable, with leucine tolerance increasing more than 10-fold. All domino transplant recipients were alive and well with normal branched-chain amino acid homeostasis at the time of this report. Patient and graft survival for all 54 patients with MSUD undergoing liver transplantation in the United States during this period were 98% and 96%, respectively. One-third of our patients were mentally impaired (IQ <= 70) before transplantation, with no statistically significant change 1 year later. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation is an effective long-term treatment for classical MSUD and may arrest brain damage, but will not reverse it.",

We present the first case of a technical challenging ex situ split of a MSUD domino organ transplanted into two pediatric recipients. The domino graft donor was a 21-year-old female (58 kg) suffering from MSUD with recurrent metabolic decompensation despite strict diet. The organ was allocated to a 14-year-old girl (55 kg) with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Due to excellent organ quality and suitable anatomy, a backward split for a girl of 3 months (5 kg) with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to biliary atresia was performed. The postoperative course was without relevant complications, and the three recipients were discharged on postoperative days 28, 29, and 45, respectively, with good organ function. BCAAs in plasma were normal in the two domino graft recipients, and the MSUD patient showed mildly elevated but stable BCAA concentrations despite an unrestricted diet. Split-domino LTX enabled successful transplantation of three patients of the waiting list with only one deceased donor graft.",

METHODS: Descriptive study of liver transplantation for MSUD between 1991 and 2012. Eight patients were transplanted. RESULTS: Indications for transplant were poor metabolic control expressed as significant psychomotor disabilities (4 had psychomotor delays, 5 had spasticity, and 5 had epilepsy) and poor quality of life (mean number of acute metabolic decompensations and mean number of total hospitalizations before transplantation 5 and 12, respectively). Four required nasogastric tube, with a maximum 4 g/day protein-restricted diet in all of them. Seven sustained significant alterations in brain magnetic resonance imaging. Mean leucine and alloisoleucine levels were 608 (standard deviation [SD] 516) and 218 mumol/L (SD 216), respectively. All of the patients received transplants with deceased-donor livers, with ages between 1.5 and 2.5 years (mean 1.78 years). Mean posttransplantation follow-up period was 12.2 years (range 5-21 years). Final patient and graft survival was 87.5% and 75%, respectively. Following transplantation, none required hospitalization in the last 3 years nor did any have new acute metabolic decompensations following a normal diet. Five followed normal schooling, 2 had motor disabilities, and 2 had convulsive crises. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was taken in 4 patients, showing neuroimage improvement in 3 of them. Mean leucine levels were <350 mumol/L from the immediate posttransplantation period (mean 225 mumol/L, SD 78), with a maximum alloisoleucine level of 20 mumol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for classical MSUD that arrests brain damage, although it does not reverse the process.",

Liver transplantation (LT) can be curative or partially effective for these diseases. LT for IEMs has increased, making IEMs the second most common reason for pediatric LT after biliary atresia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2001 and 2023, 50 pediatric patients with IEMs underwent LT at Baskent University, Ankara Hospital. Data collected retrospectively included diagnosis, gender, age of diagnosis, age of LT, LT indication, donor data, graft type, rejection episodes, post-transplant complications, and clinical findings of the IEMs before and after LT. Treatment methods, follow-up duration, and survival time were also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 332 pediatric LT patients, 50 (15.1%) had IEMs, with three requiring re-transplantations. Diagnoses included glycogen storage diseases (n = 11), tyrosinemia type 1 (n = 10), primary hyperoxaluria (n = 6), urea cycle disorders (n = 6), homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 4), propionic acidemia (n = 4), deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency (n = 3), maple syrup urine disease (n = 2), methylmalonic acidemia (n = 1), Niemann-Pick disease type B (n = 1), alkaptonuria with unknown neonatal cholestasis (n = 1), and bile acid synthesis disorder (n = 1). The parental consanguinity rate was 74%. Living-related donors provided organs for 48 (90.5%) patients. The mean age at LT was 75.3 +- 8.2 months (range: 5-218), with a follow-up period of 82.1 +- 10.2 months (range:1 day-229 months). Survival rates at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 83.7%, 81%, 81%, and 70.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: LT is an effective solution for children with IEM causing chronic organ failure and difficult to manage with medical treatment, showing a good long-term prognosis.",

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 35 patients with classical MSUD (age 9.9 +- 7.9 years) underwent liver transplantation between 2004 and 2009. Six patients donated their liver to recipients without MSUD (\"domino\" transplant). We analyzed clinical outcomes for our cohort and 17 additional cases from the national United Network for Organ Sharing registry; 33 patients completed IQ and adaptive testing before transplantation, and 14 completed testing 1 year later. RESULTS: Patient and graft survival were 100% at 4.5 +- 2.2 years of follow-up. Liver function was normal in all patients. Branched-chain amino acid levels were corrected within hours after surgery and remained stable, with leucine tolerance increasing more than 10-fold. All domino transplant recipients were alive and well with normal branched-chain amino acid homeostasis at the time of this report. Patient and graft survival for all 54 patients with MSUD undergoing liver transplantation in the United States during this period were 98% and 96%, respectively. One-third of our patients were mentally impaired (IQ <= 70) before transplantation, with no statistically significant change 1 year later. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation is an effective long-term treatment for classical MSUD and may arrest brain damage, but will not reverse it.",

To our knowledge, ours is only the second successful case to date of a patient with MSUD receiving an allograft from an RLD who is a heterozygous carrier for the disease. In view of the worldwide shortage of available organs for transplantation, heterozygote to homozygote transplantation in the setting of MSUD may provide a viable alternative for those awaiting transplantation. We report on the case of a two-yr-old infant with MSUD, who received a left lateral segment (segments II and III) liver transplant from his mother, a heterozygote carrier of one of the three abnormal genes implicated in MSUD. Post-operative BCAA levels normalized in our patient and remained so on an unrestricted protein diet and during times of physiological stress. To date, this is only the second case of a successful RLD liver transplant in a child with MSUD. Preliminary results indicate that RLD liver transplants are at least equivalent to deceased donor liver transplants in the treatment of MSUD, although longer term follow-up is required. Heterozygote to homozygote RLD transplant in patients with MSUD presents a new pool of potential liver donors. ",

Dietary management enables survival and reduces risk of acute crises. Liver transplantation has emerged as an effective way to eliminate acute decompensation risk. Psychiatric illness is a reported MSUD complication, but has not been well characterized and remains poorly understood. We report the prevalence and characteristics of neuropsychiatric problems among 37 classical MSUD patients (ages 5-35 years, 26 on dietary therapy, 11 after liver transplantation) and explore their underlying mechanisms. Compared with 26 age-matched controls, MSUD patients were at higher risk for disorders of cognition, attention, and mood. Using quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found lower brain glutamate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and creatine concentrations in MSUD patients, which correlated with specific neuropsychiatric outcomes. Asymptomatic neonatal course and stringent longitudinal biochemical control proved fundamental to optimizing long-term mental health. Neuropsychiatric morbidity and neurochemistry were similar among transplanted and nontransplanted MSUD patients. In conclusion, amino acid dysregulation results in aberrant neural networks with neurochemical deficiencies that persist after transplant and correlate with neuropsychiatric morbidities. These findings may provide insight into general mechanisms of psychiatric illness.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Organic acidurias (OAs), urea-cycle disorders (UCDs), and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) belong to the category of intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism (IT-IEM). Liver transplantation (LTx) is increasingly utilized in IT-IEM. However, its impact has been mainly focused on clinical outcome measures and rarely on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Aim of the study was to investigate the impact of LTx on HrQoL in IT-IEMs. STUDY DESIGN: This single center prospective study involved 32 patients (15 OA, 11 UCD, 6 MSUD; median age at LTx 3.0 years, range 0.8-26.0). HRQoL was assessed pre/post transplantation by PedsQL-General Module 4.0 and by MetabQoL 1.0, a specifically designed tool for IT-IEM. RESULTS: PedsQL highlighted significant post-LTx improvements in total and physical functioning in both patients' and parents' scores. According to age at transplantation (<=3 vs. >3 years), younger patients showed higher post-LTx scores on Physical (p=0.03), Social (p<0.001) and Total (p=0.007) functioning. MetabQoL confirmed significant post-LTx changes in Total and Physical functioning in both patients and parents scores (p<=0.009). Differently from PedsQL, MetabQoL Mental (patients p=0.013, parents p=0.03) and Social scores (patients p=0.02, parents p=0.012) were significantly higher post-LTx. Significant improvements (p=0.001-0.04) were also detected both in self- and proxy-reports for almost all MetabQoL subscales. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of assessing the impact of transplantation on HrQoL, a meaningful outcome reflecting patients' wellbeing. LTx is associated with significant improvements of HrQol in both self- and parent-reports. The comparison between PedsQL-GM and MetabQoL highlighted that MetabQoL demonstrated higher sensitivity in the assessment of disease-specific domains than the generic PedsQL tool.

                    "abstract": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by a deficiency in the activity of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex, promoting the accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine, and valine, as well as their respective alpha-keto acids. MSUD is an autosomal recessive hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by ketoacidosis, ataxia, coma, and mental and psychomotor retardation. The mechanisms involved in the brain damage caused by MSUD are not fully understood. Early diagnosis and treatment, as well as proper control of metabolic decompensation crises, are crucial for patients' survival and for a better prognosis. The recommended treatment consists of a high-calorie diet with restricted protein intake and specific formulas containing essential amino acids, except those accumulated in MSUD. This treatment will be maintained throughout life, being adjusted according to the patients' nutritional needs and BCAA concentration. Because dietary treatment may not be sufficient to prevent neurological damage in MSUD patients, other therapeutic strategies have been studied, including liver transplantation. With transplantation, it is possible to obtain an increase of about 10% of the normal BCKD in the body, an amount sufficient to maintain amino acid homeostasis and reduce metabolic decompensation crises. However, the experience related to this practice is very limited when considering the shortage of liver for transplantation and the risks related to the surgical procedure and immunosuppression. Thus, the purpose of this review is to survey the benefits, risks, and challenges of liver transplantation in the treatment of MSUD.",

Although deficiency of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDC) and associated elevations in the BCAAs and their ketoacids have been recognized as the cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) for decades, treatment options for this disorder have been limited to dietary interventions. In recent years, the discovery of improved leucine tolerance after liver transplantation has resulted in a new therapeutic strategy for this disorder. Likewise, targeting the regulation of the BCKDC activity may be an alternative potential treatment strategy for MSUD. The regulation of the BCKDC by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase has also been implicated in a new inborn error of metabolism characterized by autism, intellectual disability and seizures. Finally, there is a growing body of literature implicating BCAA metabolism in more common disorders such as the metabolic syndrome, cancer and hepatic disease. This review surveys the knowledge acquired on the topic over the past 50 years and focuses on recent developments in the field of BCAA metabolism. ",

Greater variability was observed in adaptive functioning scores, but the majority of patients evidenced no significant change (n=8) in adaptive scores.

This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION: The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.",

Domino liver transplantation (DLT) has been one strategy to augment the supply of donor organs in cases of inborn errors of metabolism. One such disease is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), an inherited disorder of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. METHODS: We report on the transplantation of a deceased donor liver into a patient with MSUD, and the sequential transplantation of the explanted liver into a patient with hemophilia A, HIV, hepatitis C, and a low priority on the transplant waiting list. RESULTS: At 30 months, the MSUD recipient has had significant correction of BCAA metabolism on a protein-unrestricted diet and no progression of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The DLT recipient has been cured of hemophilia and has normal BCAA homeostasis. This case provides further evidence that elective orthotopic liver transplantation for MSUD attenuates the disease with restoration of BCAA metabolism, and that DLT in this setting can achieve excellent results in ESLD patients. CONCLUSION: It is possible that domino grafts from patients with MSUD could be used in more conventional recipients, but additional studies and longer-term outcomes are needed to determine the validity of DLT in MSUD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study provides a general overview on liver and/or kidney transplantation in patients with an amino and organic acid-related disorder (AOA) with the aim to investigate patient characteristics and global outcome in Europe. This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION: The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.",

Despite the advances in medical nutrition therapies, classical phenotype causes severe neurological disorders and sudden death. It is known that MSUD patients do not experience metabolic attacks despite their free diet after liver transplantation (LT). This study aims to reveal the long-term results, development, mental, motor, intellectual and nutritional status of MSUD patients who underwent LT. METHODS: The data of 12 patients who underwent deceased donor (5 recipients) and living donor liver transplantation (7 recipients) were retrospectively analyzed. The age, genotype, psychometric and mental status, development, BCAA values, type of LT, donor-recipient proximity, complications, and survival were assessed. RESULTS: There were 4 (33%) girls and 8 (67%) boys. The mean current age was 9.33 +- 4.58 years. The mean follow-up time was 3 +- 2.5 years. The repeated measures of leucine and isoleucine values revealed that there were no significant differences from the pre-LT to post-LT 1-year. The protein-restricted nutrition was switched to a free diet when oral intake was opened after LT. None of the recipients experienced metabolic attacks after the living donor or deceased donor LT. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate of the patients is 83.3%. There was no significant difference in survival between living and deceased donor liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is a treatment option for MSUD in proper conditions to save the patient life, increase the quality of life, and provide essential amino acids with free diet intake for growth and development.",

Acute and long-term management of MSUD involves a restricted diet and regular monitoring of amino acid levels; however, more recently liver transplants have been shown to be successful in treating this condition. Even with successful management of MSUD there is evidence from pediatric cases that shows a distinct pattern of neurocognitive deficits associated with this condition, including impaired nonverbal skills and psychomotor functioning with relatively intact verbal abilities. In the present paper, we report an adult case of MSUD with associated neurocognitive deficits and functional limitations following liver transplantation. Neuroimaging revealed no structural abnormalities, while the results from the neuropsychological evaluation showed impairment in visual-spatial processing, attention, executive functioning, and psychomotor abilities, with relative strengths in verbal skills. The patient also showed reduced adaptive functioning and mild anxiety. This case demonstrates neurocognitive deficiencies within the context of normal magnetic resonance imaging. The possible underlying mechanism of this neuropsychological profile is discussed in relation to other neurodevelopmental models. ",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. Despite the advances in medical nutrition therapies, classical phenotype causes severe neurological disorders and sudden death. It is known that MSUD patients do not experience metabolic attacks despite their free diet after liver transplantation (LT). This study aims to reveal the long-term results, development, mental, motor, intellectual and nutritional status of MSUD patients who underwent LT. METHODS: The data of 12 patients who underwent deceased donor (5 recipients) and living donor liver transplantation (7 recipients) were retrospectively analyzed. The age, genotype, psychometric and mental status, development, BCAA values, type of LT, donor-recipient proximity, complications, and survival were assessed. RESULTS: There were 4 (33%) girls and 8 (67%) boys. The mean current age was 9.33 +- 4.58 years. The mean follow-up time was 3 +- 2.5 years. The repeated measures of leucine and isoleucine values revealed that there were no significant differences from the pre-LT to post-LT 1-year. The protein-restricted nutrition was switched to a free diet when oral intake was opened after LT. None of the recipients experienced metabolic attacks after the living donor or deceased donor LT. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate of the patients is 83.3%. There was no significant difference in survival between living and deceased donor liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is a treatment option for MSUD in proper conditions to save the patient life, increase the quality of life, and provide essential amino acids with free diet intake for growth and development.",

However, its administration is ineffective in cases of gastric intolerance and some adult patients refuse enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube. We developed a new parenteral amino-acid mixture for patients with MSUD. METHODS: Seventeen decompensation episodes in four adult patients with MSUD treated with a parenteral amino-acid mixture (group P) were compared to 18 previous episodes in the same patients treated by enteral feeding (group E). RESULTS: The mean Leu concentration at presentation was similar in the groups P and E (1196.9 mumol/L and 1212.2 mumol/L, respectively). The mean decrease in the Leu concentration during the first 3 days of hospitalisation was significantly higher in group P than group E (p = 0.0026); there were no side effects. The mean duration of hospitalisation was similar (4 vs. 4.5 days, p = NS). No patient in group P deteriorated whereas one patient in group E required dialysis. CONCLUSION: This new parenteral amino-acid mixture is safe and allows efficient Leu concentration decrease during acute MSUD decompensation episodes in adults. Its use avoids the need for nasogastric tube insertion.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) experiencing metabolic decompensations have traditionally been treated with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-free mixture via oral or nasogastric administration routes. In some patients, enteral administration is not possible, either because the patient presents with vomiting, coma, or refuses nasogastric administration, thus intravenous (IV) BCAA-free solution is an appropriate intervention for these challenging cases. AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of managing metabolic decompensations by administering an IV BCAA-free solution. METHODS: This is an observational prospective study of data from MSUD patients hospitalised for decompensation episodes between 2010 and 2016 at 6 centres for rare metabolic diseases in France. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients (16 males; 8 females) experiencing 126 MSUD metabolic decompensation episodes (39 in children; 87 in adults) were admitted to hospital. At presentation, mean leucine plasma concentration was >= 381 micromol/L in 113/126 (89.7%) episodes. Children were treated with continuous IV BCAA-free solution at doses of 0.8 to 2.0 g/kg/day, for 4.8 days and adults for 3.8 days at doses of 0.5 to 2.6 g/kg/day. In the efficacy set of 102 analysable episodes leucine concentrations were normalised (to below 381 micromol/L) in 82% (n = 18/22) of episodes in children and in 84% (n = 67/80) of episodes in adults. Mean time to leucine normalisation was 3.0 days. This was significantly (p < 0.001) shorter than the algorithmically predicted time to leucine normalisation with traditional BCAA-free mixture. Duration of hospitalisation was significantly longer for children than for adults (7.1 days in children vs 5.2 days in adults, p = 0.012). No treatment-related adverse events were reported in any patients on IV BCAA-free solution. CONCLUSION: The IV BCAA-free solution is safe and effective in normalising leucine concentrations during MSUD decompensation episodes in both children and adults, offering a practical treatment alternative for those patients who cannot receive BCAA-free mixture via oral or nasogastric routes.",

BCKDH catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). BCAAs and their neurotoxic alpha-keto intermediates can accumulate in the blood and tissues in the absence of functional BCKDH. We evaluated a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based treatment approach to address all possible genetic mutations that can cause MSUD (BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT). In the intermediate MSUD mouse model, which harbors a mutation in the dihydrolipoamide branched-chain transacylase E2 (DBT) subunit of BCKDH, repeated administration of LNP-encapsulated mRNA therapy significantly extended survival and reduced serum leucine levels. We also evaluated our LNP approach in several models of classic MSUD, namely DBT knockout (KO) mice and the new BCKDHA KO and BCKDHB KO mice. The latter two were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and contain the highly prevalent classic MSUD-causing mutations seen in the Mennonite and Costa Rican populations. Intravenous LNP-encapsulated mRNA administration extended survival and increased body weight in the DBT KO and BCKDHA KO models of classic MSUD but was not effective in BCKDHB KO mice. Our data provide a promising proof-of-concept that a universal, mutation-independent approach to treating MSUD is possible and viable.",
