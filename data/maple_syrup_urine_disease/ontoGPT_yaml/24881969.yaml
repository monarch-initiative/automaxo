input_text: 'Nutrition management guideline for maple syrup urine disease: an evidence-
  and consensus-based approach. In an effort to increase harmonization of care and
  enable outcome studies, the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (GMDI) and
  the Southeast Regional Newborn Screening and Genetics Collaborative (SERC) are partnering
  to develop nutrition management guidelines for inherited metabolic disorders (IMD)
  using a model combining both evidence- and consensus-based methodology. The first
  guideline to be completed is for maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). This report describes
  the methodology used in its development: formulation of five research questions;
  review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished
  practice literature; and expert input through Delphi surveys and a nominal group
  process. This report includes the summary statements for each research question
  and the nutrition management recommendations they generated. Each recommendation
  is followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence and consensus
  used. The application of technology to build the infrastructure for this project
  allowed transparency during development of this guideline and will be a foundation
  for future guidelines. Online open access of the full, published guideline allows
  utilization by health care providers, researchers, and collaborators who advise,
  advocate and care for individuals with MSUD and their families. There will be future
  updates as warranted by developments in research and clinical practice. '
