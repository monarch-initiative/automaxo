input_text: Twin Premature Infants With Riboflavin and Biotin Deficiency Presenting
  With Refractory Lactic Acidosis, Rash, and Multiorgan Failure During Prolonged Parenteral
  Nutrition. We are reporting monochorionic, diamniotic twin premature infants born
  at 25 weeks and 6 days gestation with riboflavin (vitamin B2) and biotin (vitamin
  B7) deficiency, while on prolonged total parenteral nutrition (TPN) during vitamin
  shortage. They presented initially with skin rash, lactic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia.
  Both twins progressed to severe respiratory failure, severe lactic acidosis, with
  refractory vasodilatory shock, pancytopenia, ischemic bowel injury, acute kidney
  injury, liver injury, and capillary leak syndrome leading to death of twin A. The
  surviving twin B was diagnosed with riboflavin and biotin deficiency that presented
  with abnormal metabolic work up suggestive of maple syrup urine disease, glutaric
  acidemia type 2, and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Twin B was started on riboflavin
  and biotin supplementation at 41 days of life, with rapid improvement in clinical
  findings and laboratory abnormalities within days of starting biotin and riboflavin
  supplementation. He was discharged home in stable condition at 49 weeks of postmenstrual
  age.
