input_text: "Impact of inborn errors of metabolism on admission in a neonatal intensive
  care unit--a prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of Inborn
  errors of metobolism (IEM) in Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using tandem mass
  spectrometry and to determine the impact that these disorders have on NICU resources.
  METHODS: During the period of study, 724 (81% eligible cases) dried blood filter-paper
  samples were collected from a NICU. The samples were analysed using tandem mass
  spectrometry. The diagnosis was further confirmed through clinical symptoms and
  by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were also confirmed by clinical
  follow-up of all positive patients in an overall interval of 1 year. The mean observation
  period was 11 months per neonate. RESULTS: In total, 22 cases were screen positive
  and 8 cases of inborn errors of metabolism were detected. The incidence of IEM in
  the population of patients admitted to the authors' NICU was 1.1%. The most common
  inborn error found was methylmalonic acidemia (3 cases, 37.5%), and all of the cases
  needed aggressive treatment and invasive mechanical ventilation. There were two
  cases of Tyrosinemia type 1, one case each of Maple Syrup Urine Disease, Propionic
  Acidemia, and Multiple Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Five of the eight
  patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median length of NICU stay
  was 3 days (1~7 days) and early therapeutic intervention was effective for four
  of them and other four patients (50%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of IEM in
  NICU was 1.1%, indicating an underestimation of the incidence of metabolic disorders
  prior to implementing screening. Most patients with IEM in the NICU required invasive
  mechanical ventilation and the mortality was increased due to underlying IEM."
