input_text: Oral enzyme therapy for maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) suppresses plasma
  leucine levels in intermediate MSUD mice and healthy non-human primates. Maple Syrup
  Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inborn error of branched-chain amino acid metabolism
  affecting several thousand individuals worldwide. MSUD patients have elevated levels
  of plasma leucine and its metabolic product alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), which can
  lead to severe neurotoxicity, coma, and death. Patients must maintain a strict diet
  of protein restriction and medical formula, and periods of non-compliance or illness
  can lead to acute metabolic decompensation or cumulative neurological impairment.
  Given the lack of therapeutic options for MSUD patients, we sought to develop an
  oral enzyme therapy that can degrade leucine within the gastrointestinal tract prior
  to its systemic absorption and thus enable patients to maintain acceptable plasma
  leucine levels while broadening their access to natural protein. We identified a
  highly active leucine decarboxylase enzyme from Planctomycetaceae bacterium and
  used directed evolution to engineer the enzyme for stability to gastric and intestinal
  conditions. Following high-throughput screening of over 12 000 enzyme variants over
  9 iterative rounds of evolution, we identified a lead variant, LDCv10, which retains
  activity following simulated gastric or intestinal conditions in vitro. In intermediate
  MSUD mice or healthy non-human primates given a whey protein meal, oral treatment
  with LDCv10 suppressed the spike in plasma leucine and KIC and reduced the leucine
  AUC in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction in plasma leucine correlated with decreased
  brain leucine levels following oral LDCv10 treatment. Collectively, these data support
  further development of LDCv10 as a potential new therapy for MSUD patients. This
