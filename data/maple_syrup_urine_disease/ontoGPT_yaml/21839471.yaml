input_text: 'Liver transplantation for classical maple syrup urine disease: long-term
  follow-up in 37 patients and comparative United Network for Organ Sharing experience.
  OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical and neurocognitive function in children who have undergone
  liver transplantation for classical maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). STUDY DESIGN:
  A total of 35 patients with classical MSUD (age 9.9 +- 7.9 years) underwent liver
  transplantation between 2004 and 2009. Six patients donated their liver to recipients
  without MSUD ("domino" transplant). We analyzed clinical outcomes for our cohort
  and 17 additional cases from the national United Network for Organ Sharing registry;
  33 patients completed IQ and adaptive testing before transplantation, and 14 completed
  testing 1 year later. RESULTS: Patient and graft survival were 100% at 4.5 +- 2.2
  years of follow-up. Liver function was normal in all patients. Branched-chain amino
  acid levels were corrected within hours after surgery and remained stable, with
  leucine tolerance increasing more than 10-fold. All domino transplant recipients
  were alive and well with normal branched-chain amino acid homeostasis at the time
  of this report. Patient and graft survival for all 54 patients with MSUD undergoing
  liver transplantation in the United States during this period were 98% and 96%,
  respectively. One-third of our patients were mentally impaired (IQ <= 70) before
  transplantation, with no statistically significant change 1 year later. CONCLUSION:
  Liver transplantation is an effective long-term treatment for classical MSUD and
  may arrest brain damage, but will not reverse it.'
