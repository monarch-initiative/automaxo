input_text: "International classification of functioning, disability and health framework
  (ICF) based adaptive functioning outcomes of children with organic acidemias from
  a middle-income country. OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization International
  Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Framework (ICF) states that
  a child's health conditions, functions, activities, participation in life and contextual
  factors shape disability. Research on the development of children with organic acidemias
  (OA) mostly focused on cognitive and medical outcomes. This study aimed to examine
  adaptive functioning of children with OAs based on ICF. METHODS: In this cross-sectional
  study, children with propionic academia, methylmalonic acidemia and maple syrup
  urine disease receiving care at Ankara University School of Medicine, Department
  of Pediatrics, Pediatric Metabolism Division were recruited. Comprehensive developmental
  assessments included ICF-based methods. Adaptive functioning was measured with Vineland
  Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition. RESULTS: The sample comprised 22 children
  with a median age of 47.5 months (IQR: 35-73.5). Most mothers (64%) had less than
  5 years of education, half had depression. Two children (9%) were attending to school,
  14 (64%) were not regularly playing with friends. Fourteen children (64%) had significant
  communication delays, 12 (55%) had significant problems in daily living skills,
  and 12 (55%) in social skills. Mean adaptive behavior composite score was 65.5 +-
  16.8 (low), children with feeding disorders had significantly more low adaptive
  behavior composite scores than children with no feeding disorder diagnosis (p =
  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that children with OAs from Turkey, a middle-income
  country had major difficulties in functioning, activities, participation and contextual
  factors. Feeding problems appeared as a risk factor for lower adaptive functioning.
  ICF-based assessments and interventions are urgently needed in the management of
  children with OAs."
