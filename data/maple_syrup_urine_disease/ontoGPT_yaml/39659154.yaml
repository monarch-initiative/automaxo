input_text: Integration of multi-omics layers empowers precision diagnosis through
  unveiling pathogenic mechanisms on maple syrup urine disease. Maple syrup urine
  disease (MSUD) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by deficient
  activity of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex, required
  to metabolize the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Despite its profound
  metabolic implications, the molecular alterations underlying this metabolic impairment
  had not yet been completely elucidated. We performed a comprehensive multi-omics
  integration analysis, including genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from
  fibroblasts derived from a cohort of MSUD patients and unaffected controls to genetically
  characterize an MSUD case and to unravel the MSUD pathophysiology. MSUD patients
  exhibit a defined episignature that reshapes the global DNA methylation landscape,
  resulting in the stimulation of HOX cluster genes and the restriction of cell cycle
  gene-related signatures. Subsequent data integration revealed the impact of AP1-related
  and CEBPB transcription factors on the observed molecular reorganization, with MEIS1
  emerging as a potential downstream candidate affected by robust epigenetic repression
  in MSUD patients. Furthermore, the integration of multi-omics layers facilitated
  the identification of a strong epigenetic repression in the DBT promoter in a patient
  wherein no BCKDH pathogenic variants had been detected. A Circular Chromatin Conformation
  Capture assay indicated a disturbance of the interactions of DBT promoter, thereby
  unveiling alternative modes of disease inheritance. Integration of multi-omics data
  unveiled underlying molecular networks rewired in MSUD patients and represents a
  powerful approach with diagnostic potential for rare genetic disorders with unknown
  genetic bases.
