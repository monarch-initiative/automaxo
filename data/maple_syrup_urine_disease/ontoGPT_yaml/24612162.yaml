input_text: 'Utility of peritoneal dialysis in neonates affected by inborn errors
  of metabolism. AIM: Some inborn errors of metabolism induce metabolic encephalopathy
  through accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites. Rapid elimination of these metabolites
  by peritoneal or extracorporeal dialysis is crucial to prevent neuronal damage or
  death. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the outcomes of nine neonates with
  metabolic crisis treated with peritoneal dialysis. METHOD: Six neonates with hyperammonemic
  coma (four with organic acidemias, two with urea cycle disorders) and three with
  leucine accumulation due to maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) were managed with peritoneal
  dialysis in conjunction with dietary and pharmacological therapy. RESULTS: Three
  patients with organic acidemia survived. One of the patients was normal; others
  had moderate and severe neurological impairments. One neonate with organic acidemia
  and both neonates with urea cycle disorders died. Two of the three patients with
  MSUD survived without neurological impairment; the other had severe neurological
  damage and died at 9 months of age due to sepsis. CONCLUSION: Theoretically, extracorporeal
  dialysis should be the first dialysis treatment of choice; however, this report
  demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis has a chance to prevent neurological damage
  in some patients. Therefore, in developing countries without extracorporeal dialysis
  opportunities, it can be still a life-saving procedure, if it is applied with skilled
  staff and standard procedures.'
