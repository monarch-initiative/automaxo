input_text: 'Long-term results of liver transplantation for maple syrup urine disease:
  A single-center experience in Turkey. OBJECTIVES: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)
  is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. Despite the advances in medical nutrition
  therapies, classical phenotype causes severe neurological disorders and sudden death.
  It is known that MSUD patients do not experience metabolic attacks despite their
  free diet after liver transplantation (LT). This study aims to reveal the long-term
  results, development, mental, motor, intellectual and nutritional status of MSUD
  patients who underwent LT. METHODS: The data of 12 patients who underwent deceased
  donor (5 recipients) and living donor liver transplantation (7 recipients) were
  retrospectively analyzed. The age, genotype, psychometric and mental status, development,
  BCAA values, type of LT, donor-recipient proximity, complications, and survival
  were assessed. RESULTS: There were 4 (33%) girls and 8 (67%) boys. The mean current
  age was 9.33 +- 4.58 years. The mean follow-up time was 3 +- 2.5 years. The repeated
  measures of leucine and isoleucine values revealed that there were no significant
  differences from the pre-LT to post-LT 1-year. The protein-restricted nutrition
  was switched to a free diet when oral intake was opened after LT. None of the recipients
  experienced metabolic attacks after the living donor or deceased donor LT. The 1-,
  3-, and 5-year survival rate of the patients is 83.3%. There was no significant
  difference in survival between living and deceased donor liver transplantation.
  CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is a treatment option for MSUD in proper conditions
  to save the patient life, increase the quality of life, and provide essential amino
  acids with free diet intake for growth and development.'
