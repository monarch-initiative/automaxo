input_text: 'Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration in neonates with maple syrup
  urine disease. INTRODUCTION: Herein, we aimed to discuss our experience in 16 newborn
  patients with Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) who were treated with urgent renal
  replacement therapy (RRT). METHODS: The patients underwent continuous veno-venous
  hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) as renal replacement therapy.
  RESULTS: Eleven (68.75%) patients underwent CVVHDF and five (31.25%) underwent peritoneal
  dialysis. The median leucine reduction rate per hour was 2.56% (1.75-7.6) in the
  CVVHDF group, 0.78% (0.54-1.83) in the PD group, and was significantly higher in
  the CVVHDF group (p = 0.001). Posttreatment plasma leucine levels were found to
  be 198 (20-721) mumol/L in the CVVHDF group and 600 (250-967) mumol/L in the PD
  group, and CVVHDF was found to be significantly lower (p = 0.08). Complications
  such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and filter obstruction occurred in the
  CVVHDF group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that CVVHDF is more effective than PD
  for rapidly eliminating elevated leucine levels caused by MSUD in the newborn and
  it is not associated with increased complication rates.'
