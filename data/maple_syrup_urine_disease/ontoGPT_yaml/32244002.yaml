input_text: Current update in domino liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation
  is an established treatment for end stage liver diseases as well as for some severe
  metabolic disorders. With increasing number of patients on the waiting list and
  the ongoing shortage of livers available, domino liver transplantation (DLT) became
  an option to further expand the organ donor pool. DLT utilizes the explanted liver
  of one liver transplant recipient as a donor graft in another patient. Despite being
  a surgically, and logistically demanding procedure, excellent results could be achieved
  in experienced high-volume transplant centers. In this review we present the current
  world status of DLT.
