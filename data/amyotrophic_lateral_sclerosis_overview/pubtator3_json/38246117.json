METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase and Web of Science was conducted to find peer-reviewed journal articles. All papers published after 2010 were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with CLAIM (checklist for artificial intelligence in medical imaging). RESULTS: 51 studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 61% used open-source EMGlab data set to develop models to classify nEMG signal in healthy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myopathy (25 subjects). Only two articles developed models to classify signals recorded at rest. Most articles reported high performance accuracies, but many were subject to bias and overtraining. CONCLUSIONS: Current AI-models of nEMG signals are not sufficient for clinical implementation. Suggestions for future research include emphasizing the need for an optimal training and validation approach using large datasets of clinical nEMG data from a diverse patient population. SIGNIFICANCE: The outcomes of this study and the suggestions made aim to contribute to developing AI-models that can effectively handle signal quality variability and are suitable for daily clinical practice in interpreting nEMG signals.",
