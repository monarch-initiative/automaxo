In 2016, we presented the world-first fully implantable BCI system that uses subdural electrocorticography electrodes to record brain signals and a subcutaneous amplifier to transmit the signals to the outside world, and that enabled an individual with LIS to communicate via a tablet computer by selecting icons in spelling software. For future clinical implementation of implantable communication-BCIs, however, much work is still needed, for example, to validate these systems in daily life settings with more participants, and to improve the speed of communication. We believe the design and execution of future studies on these and other topics may benefit from the experience we have gained. Therefore, based on relevant literature and our own experiences, we here provide an overview of procedures, as well as recommendations, for recruitment, screening, inclusion, imaging, hospital admission, implantation, training, and support of participants with LIS, for studies on daily life implementation of implantable communication-BCIs. With this article, we not only aim to inform the BCI community about important topics of concern, but also hope to contribute to improved methodological standardization of implantable BCI research.",
