35563214	Advanced Gene-Targeting Therapies for Motor Neuron Diseases and Muscular Dystrophies. Gene therapy is a revolutionary, cutting-edge approach to permanently ameliorate or amend many neuromuscular diseases by targeting their genetic origins. Motor neuron diseases and muscular dystrophies, whose genetic causes are well known, are the frontiers of this research revolution. Several genetic treatments, with diverse mechanisms of action and delivery methods, have been approved during the past decade and have demonstrated remarkable results. However, despite the high number of genetic treatments studied preclinically, those that have been advanced to clinical trials are significantly fewer. The most clinically advanced treatments include adeno-associated virus gene replacement therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, and RNA interference. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the advanced gene therapies for motor neuron diseases (i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) and muscular dystrophies (i.e., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy) tested in clinical trials. Emphasis has been placed on those methods that are a few steps away from their authoritative approval.
37827930	Management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in clinical practice: Results of the expert consensus using the Delphi methodology. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons leading to death. In France, limited data exist describing the criteria used in clinical practice for diagnosis and follow-up, and how novel therapies may fit in. The objective of this Delphi panel was to obtain an overview of current French practices in ALS diagnosis, management, and follow-up by determining the scales and criteria used in clinical practice outside of clinical trials, as well as the place of a future treatment like AMX0035, acting on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, in the current therapeutic strategies. A questionnaire was administered to 24 ALS healthcare providers practicing in ALS centers in France. Two rounds of remote voting were organized, before proposition of final consensus statements. Consensus was considered reached when at least 66% of the voters agreed. Consensus were obtained to define the new Gold Coast criteria as the ones used in clinical practice to establish the diagnosis of ALS, thus replacing the revised El Escorial criteria, considered too complex and now mainly used to characterize the patient populations to be included in clinical trials. The clinical factors considered to establish ALS diagnosis are mainly the demonstration of progression of the motor deficit and elimination of differential diagnoses. The ALSFRS-R scale is used in daily clinical practice to assess patient's functional impairment in terms of number of points lost, with the bulbar, respiratory, and fine motor subscores being the most important to evaluate independently. A critical medical need was identified regarding the provision of new therapeutic alternatives in ALS. The panel members would support the earliest management of patients. In this landscape, based on data from a very encouraging phase II (Centaur trial), AMX0035 represents a new tool of choice in current treatment strategies for all patients for whom experts are confident in the diagnosis of ALS, in combination with riluzole. These results will need to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III trial (Phoenix trial).
37562878	Advances in the neuroimaging of motor disorders. Neuroimaging is a valuable adjunct to the history and examination in the evaluation of motor system disorders. Conventional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging depicts important anatomic information and helps to identify imaging patterns which may support diagnosis of a specific motor disorder. Advanced imaging techniques can provide further detail regarding volume, functional, or metabolic changes occurring in nervous system pathology. This chapter is an overview of the advances in neuroimaging with particular emphasis on both standard and less well-known advanced imaging techniques and findings, such as diffusion tensor imaging or volumetric studies, and their application to specific motor disorders. In addition, it provides reference to emerging imaging biomarkers in motor system disorders such as Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington disease, and briefly reviews the neuroimaging findings in different causes of myelopathy and peripheral nerve disorders.
36732801	Leveraging process mining for modeling progression trajectories in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease whose spreading and progression mechanisms are still unclear. The ability to predict ALS prognosis would improve the patients' quality of life and support clinicians in planning treatments. In this paper, we investigate ALS evolution trajectories using Process Mining (PM) techniques enriched to both easily mine processes and automatically reveal how the pathways differentiate according to patients' characteristics. METHODS: We consider data collected in two distinct data sources, namely the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) dataset and a real-world clinical register (ALS-BS) including data of patients followed up in two tertiary clinical centers of Brescia (Italy). With a focus on the functional abilities progressively impaired as the disease progresses, we use two Process Discovery methods, namely the Directly-Follows Graph and the CareFlow Miner, to mine the population disease trajectories on the PRO-ACT dataset. We characterize the impairment trajectories in terms of patterns, timing, and probabilities, and investigate the effect of some patients' characteristics at onset on the followed paths. Finally, we perform a comparative study of the impairment trajectories mined in PRO-ACT versus ALS-BS. RESULTS: We delineate the progression pathways on PRO-ACT, identifying the predominant disabilities at different stages of the disease: for instance, 85% of patients enter the trials without disabilities, and 48% of them experience the impairment of Walking/Self-care abilities first. We then test how a spinal onset increases the risk of experiencing the loss of Walking/Self-care ability as first impairment (52% vs. 27% of patients develop it as the first impairment in the spinal vs. the bulbar cohorts, respectively), as well as how an older age at onset corresponds to a more rapid progression to death. When compared, the PRO-ACT and the ALS-BS patient populations present some similarities in terms of natural progression of the disease, as well as some differences in terms of observed trajectories plausibly due to the trial scheduling and recruitment criteria. CONCLUSIONS: We exploited PM to provide an overview of the evolution scenarios of an ALS trial population and to preliminary compare it to the progression observed in a clinical cohort. Future work will focus on further improving the understanding of the disease progression mechanisms, by including additional real-world subjects as well as by extending the set of events considered in the impairment trajectories.
35805149	Gene Therapy in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Since the discovery of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene mutation, in 1993, as the first genetic abnormality in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), over 50 genes have been identified as either cause or modifier in ALS and ALS/frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disease. Mutations in C9orf72, SOD1, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TARDBP), and fused in sarcoma (FUS) genes are the four most common ones. During the last three decades, tremendous effort has been made worldwide to reveal biological pathways underlying the pathogenesis of these gene mutations in ALS/FTD. Accordingly, targeting etiologic genes (i.e., gene therapies) to suppress their toxic effects have been investigated widely. It includes four major strategies: (i) removal or inhibition of abnormal transcribed RNA using microRNA or antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), (ii) degradation of abnormal mRNA using RNA interference (RNAi), (iii) decrease or inhibition of mutant proteins (e.g., using antibodies against misfolded proteins), and (iv) DNA genome editing with methods such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas). The promising results of these studies have led to the application of some of these strategies into ALS clinical trials, especially for C9orf72 and SOD1. In this paper, we will overview advances in gene therapy in ALS/FTD, focusing on C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS genes.
38364912	Unveiling the future: Advancements in MRI imaging for neurodegenerative disorders.

34666575	Barriers leading to increased disability in neurologically challenged populations during COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review. PURPOSE: The objective of this scoping review was to get an overview of barriers emerging across the globe from the pandemic that are likely to increase the level of pre-existing disability status of neurologically challenged populations. METHODS: Database searches (PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science) updated to December 2020 were conducted. Articles that identified challenges or barriers to neuro-rehabilitation, impact on disability status and health care services were included. Full-text articles limited to the English language with no restrictions on study design were included. Data was synthesized based on recurrent themes that were identified. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were included in this review. Neurological populations considered: stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, parkinson's disease, autism, developmental disabilities, and those who required neurosurgical care. Barriers were grouped into categories as increased disease risk and complications, delayed or restricted access to neuro-rehabilitation, limited hospital access, telerehabilitation limitations, and shutdown of special centers of aid. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to barriers that affect almost every aspect of healthcare and rehabilitation in neurologically challenged populations prompting an increase in their disability level. This can assist policymakers in designing mitigation strategies to minimize the detrimental effects on this vulnerable population.Implications for rehabilitationPandemic has led to the worsening of existing motor and non-motor symptoms, which need to be monitored, assessed and managed medically, and through rehabilitation in neurologically challenged populations.Notable decline of cognition and physical activity in neurologically challenged populations needs to be assessed and efforts to reverse these outcomes should be attempted.Rehabilitation services, hospital care and centers of aid need to be made more accessible for neurologically challenged populations with COVID-19 precautionary measures.Telemedicine and telerehabilitation need to be upgraded to enhance further face to face like interactions and for tracking of progressive disease.
33586315	Magnetic Resonance Iron Imaging in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) results in progressive impairment of upper and lower motor neurons. Increasing evidence from both in vivo and ex vivo studies suggest that iron accumulation in the motor cortex is a neuropathological hallmark in ALS. An in vivo neuroimaging marker of iron dysregulation in ALS would be useful in disease diagnosis and prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its unique capability to generate a variety of soft tissue contrasts, provides opportunities to image iron distribution in the human brain with millimeter to sub-millimeter anatomical resolution. Conventionally, MRI T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2*-weighted images have been used to investigate iron dysregulation in the brain in vivo. Susceptibility weighted imaging has enhanced contrast for para-magnetic materials that provides superior sensitivity to iron in vivo. Recently, the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has realized the possibility of using quantitative assessments of magnetic susceptibility measures in brain tissues as a surrogate measurement of in vivo brain iron. In this review, we provide an overview of MRI techniques that have been used to investigate iron dysregulation in ALS in vivo. The potential uses, strengths, and limitations of these techniques in clinical trials, disease diagnosis, and prognosis are presented and discussed. We recommend further longitudinal studies with appropriate cohort characterization to validate the efficacy of these techniques. We conclude that quantitative iron assessment using recent advances in MRI including QSM holds great potential to be a sensitive diagnostic and prognostic marker in ALS. The use of multimodal neuroimaging markers in combination with iron imaging may also offer improved sensitivity in ALS diagnosis and prognosis that could make a major contribution to clinical care and treatment trials. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 3.
33854883	Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Neurological Disorders. Neurological disorders are becoming a growing burden as society ages, and there is a compelling need to address this spiraling problem. Stem cell-based regenerative medicine is becoming an increasingly attractive approach to designing therapies for such disorders. The unique characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make them among the most sought after cell sources. Researchers have extensively studied the modulatory properties of MSCs and their engineering, labeling, and delivery methods to the brain. The first part of this review provides an overview of studies on the application of MSCs to various neurological diseases, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other less frequently studied clinical entities. In the second part, stem cell delivery to the brain is focused. This fundamental but still understudied problem needs to be overcome to apply stem cells to brain diseases successfully. Here the value of cell engineering is also emphasized to facilitate MSC diapedesis, migration, and homing to brain areas affected by the disease to implement precision medicine paradigms into stem cell-based therapies.
33074186	Beyond the Traditional Clinical Trials for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and The Future Impact of Gene Therapy. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and incurable motor neuron (MN) disorder affecting both upper and lower MNs. Despite impressive advances in the understanding of the disease's pathological mechanism, classical pharmacological clinical trials failed to provide an efficient cure for ALS over the past twenty years. Two different gene therapy approaches were recently approved for the monogenic disease Spinal muscular atrophy, characterized by degeneration of lower MNs. This milestone suggests that gene therapy-based therapeutic solutions could be effective for the treatment of ALS. This review summarizes the possible reasons for the failure of traditional clinical trials for ALS. It provides then a focus on the advent of gene therapy approaches for hereditary forms of ALS. Specifically, it describes clinical use of antisense oligonucleotides in three familial forms of ALS, caused by mutations in SOD1, C9orf72 and FUS genes, respectively.. Clinical and pre-clinical studies based on AAV-mediated gene therapy approaches for both familial and sporadic ALS cases are presented as well. Overall, this overview highlights the potential of gene therapy as a transforming technology that will have a huge impact on treatment perspective for ALS patients and on the design of future clinical trials.
33632084	Overview of stem cells therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of upper and lower motor neurons with high burden on society. Despite tremendous efforts over the last several decades, there is still no definite cure for ALS. Up to now, only two disease-modifying agents, riluzole and edaravone, are approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ALS treatment, which only modestly improves survival and disease progression. Major challenging issues to find an effective therapy are heterogeneity in the pathogenesis and genetic variability of ALS. As such, stem cell therapy has been recently a focus of both preclinical and clinical investigations of ALS. This is because stem cells have multifaceted features that can potentially target multiple pathogenic mechanisms in ALS even though its underlying mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Methods & Results: Here, we will have an overview of stem cell therapy in ALS, including their therapeutic mechanisms, the results of recent clinical trials as well as ongoing clinical trials. In addition, we will further discuss complications and limitations of stem cell therapy in ALS. Conclusion: The determination of whether stem cells offer a viable treatment strategy for ALS rests on well-designed and appropriately powered future clinical trials. Randomized, double-blinded, and sham-controlled studies would be valuable.
33058114	Gastrostomy and mechanical ventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: how best to support the decision-making process? The unfavourable outcome of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) confronts patients with challenging decisions regarding life-sustaining measures. The decision-making process is usually triggered by medical consultations and patient-dependent factors. This may largely depend on the physician's depth of knowledge and professional experience. This paper presents an overview of the life-sustaining methods used in ALS and their effects on disease progression, survival and quality of life of patients and their caregivers. It is intended to aid physicians in their discussions with patients. We interrogate all the positive and negative facets of life-sustaining measures that may allow for optimisation of the decision-making process and care provision.
38246117	Artificial intelligence for automatic classification of needle EMG signals: A scoping review. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine and deep learning techniques, in the interpretation of clinical needle electromyography (nEMG) signals. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase and Web of Science was conducted to find peer-reviewed journal articles. All papers published after 2010 were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with CLAIM (checklist for artificial intelligence in medical imaging). RESULTS: 51 studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 61% used open-source EMGlab data set to develop models to classify nEMG signal in healthy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myopathy (25 subjects). Only two articles developed models to classify signals recorded at rest. Most articles reported high performance accuracies, but many were subject to bias and overtraining. CONCLUSIONS: Current AI-models of nEMG signals are not sufficient for clinical implementation. Suggestions for future research include emphasizing the need for an optimal training and validation approach using large datasets of clinical nEMG data from a diverse patient population. SIGNIFICANCE: The outcomes of this study and the suggestions made aim to contribute to developing AI-models that can effectively handle signal quality variability and are suitable for daily clinical practice in interpreting nEMG signals.
35525633	How can we define the presymptomatic C9orf72 disease in 2022? An overview on the current definitions of preclinical and prodromal phases. Repeat expansions in C9orf72 gene are the main genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and related phenotypes. With the advent of disease-modifying treatments, the presymptomatic disease phase is getting increasing interest as an ideal time window in which innovant therapeutic approaches could be administered. Recommendations issued from international study groups distinguish between a preclinical disease stage, during which lesions accumulate in absence of any symptoms or signs, and a prodromal stage, marked by the appearance the first subtle cognitive, behavioral, psychiatric and motor signs, before the full-blown disease. This paper summarizes the current definitions and criteria for these stages, in particular focusing on how fluid-based, neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers can be useful to monitor disease trajectory across the presymptomatic phase, as well as to detect the earliest signs of clinical conversion. Continuous advances in the knowledge of C9orf72 pathophysiology, and the integration of biomarkers in the clinical evaluation of mutation carriers will allow a better diagnostic definition of C9orf72 disease spectrum from the earliest stages, with relevant impact on the possibility of disease prevention.
33671500	Regenerative Stem Cell Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Overview. Neurodegenerative diseases resulting from the progressive loss of structure and/or function of neurons contribute to different paralysis degrees and loss of cognition and sensation. The lack of successful curative therapies for neurodegenerative disorders leads to a considerable burden on society and a high economic impact. Over the past 20 years, regenerative cell therapy, also known as stem cell therapy, has provided an excellent opportunity to investigate potentially powerful innovative strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases. This is due to stem cells' capability to repair injured neuronal tissue by replacing the damaged or lost cells with differentiated cells, providing a conducive environment that is in favor of regeneration, or protecting the existing healthy neurons and glial cells from further damage. Thus, in this review, the various types of stem cells, the current knowledge of stem-cell-based therapies in neurodegenerative diseases, and the recent advances in this field are summarized. Indeed, a better understanding and further studies of stem cell technologies cause progress into realistic and efficacious treatments of neurodegenerative disorders.
33804658	A State of the Art of Antioxidant Properties of Curcuminoids in Neurodegenerative Diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases represent a set of pathologies characterized by an irreversible and progressive, and a loss of neuronal cells in specific areas of the brain. Oxidative phosphorylation is a source of energy production by which many cells, such as the neuronal cells, meet their energy needs. Dysregulations of oxidative phosphorylation induce oxidative stress, which plays a key role in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To date, for most neurodegenerative diseases, there are no resolute treatments, but only interventions capable of alleviating the symptoms or slowing the course of the disease. Therefore, effective neuroprotection strategies are needed. In recent years, natural products, such as curcuminoids, have been intensively explored and studied for their therapeutic potentials in several neurodegenerative diseases. Curcuminoids are, nutraceutical compouns, that owen several therapeutic properties such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. In this context, the aim of this review was to provide an overview of preclinical and clinical evidence aimed to illustrate the antioxidant effects of curcuminoids in neurodegenerative diseases. Promising results from preclinical studies encourage the use of curcuminoids for neurodegeneration prevention and treatment.
36762798	Emerging clinical investigational drugs for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by motoneuron death with a median survival time of 3-5 years since disease onset. There are no effective treatments to date. However, a variety of innovative investigational drugs and biological-based therapies are under clinical development. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the clinical investigational small molecules as well as a brief summary of the biological-based therapies that are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of ALS. All the data were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov (registered through November 1). EXPERT OPINION: Drug discovery for ALS is an active and evolving field, where many investigational clinical drugs are in different trials. There are several mechanisms of action supporting all these new therapies, although proteostasis is gaining stage. Probably, small orally bioavailable molecules able to recover functional TDP-43 homeostasis may have solid chances to modify ALS progression.
35955847	Applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease represent some of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders afflicting millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, there is a lack of efficacious treatments to cure or stop the progression of these disorders. While the causes of such a lack of therapies can be attributed to various reasons, the disappointing results of recent clinical trials suggest the need for novel and innovative approaches. Since its discovery, there has been a growing excitement around the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing to identify novel mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis and to mediate accurate gene therapy. To this end, the literature is rich with experiments aimed at generating novel models of these disorders and offering proof-of-concept studies in preclinical animal models validating the great potential and versatility of this gene-editing system. In this review, we provide an overview of how the CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been used in these neurodegenerative disorders.
38164895	A report of resources used by clinicians in the UK to support motor neuron disease genomic testing. Genetic testing is a key decision-making point for people with motor neuron disease (MND); to establish eligibility for clinical trials, better understand the cause of their condition, and confirm the potential risk to relatives, who may be able to access predictive testing. Given the wide-reaching implications of MND genetic and predictive testing, it is essential that families are given adequate information, and that staff are provided with appropriate training. In this report we overview the information resources available to people with MND and family members around genetic testing, and the educational and training resources available to staff, based on information obtained through a freedom of information request to UK-based NHS Trusts. MND Association resources were most commonly used in information sharing, though we highlight distinctions between neurology and genetics centers. No respondents identified comprehensive training around MND genetic testing. We conclude with practice implications and priorities for the development of resources and training.
33544228	The links between diabetes mellitus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS etiology and prognostic factors are mostly unknown. Metabolic diseases and especially diabetes mellitus (DM) have been variously related to ALS. However, pieces of evidence have been variegated and often conflicting so far. This review aims to give an overview of recent contributions focusing on the relationship between DM and ALS. DM seems to reduce the risk of developing ALS if diagnosed at a younger age; conversely, when diagnosed at an older age, DM seems protective against ALS. Such a relationship was not confirmed in Asian countries where DM increases the risk of ALS independently of the age of onset. Interestingly, DM does not affect ALS prognosis, possibly weakening the potential causal relationship between the two diseases. However, since most studies are observational, it is difficult to state the exact nature of such a relationship and several hypotheses have been made. A recent study using Mendelian randomization suggested that DM is indeed protective against ALS in the European population. However, these analyses are not without limits and further evidence is needed. DM is usually the core of a larger metabolic syndrome. Thus, other metabolic changes such as dyslipidemia, body mass index, and cardiovascular diseases should be collectively considered. Finally, hypermetabolism usually found in ALS patients should be considered too since all these metabolic changes could be compensation (or the cause) of the higher energy expenditure.
34208136	NOX2 Activation in COVID-19: Possible Implications for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading contagious infectious disease caused by the pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that primarily affects the respiratory tract as well as the central nervous system (CNS). SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the interaction of the viral protein Spike with the angiotensin II receptor (ACE 2), leading to an increase of angiotensin II and activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase2 (NOX2), resulting in the release of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory molecules. The purpose of the review is to explain that SARS-CoV-2 infection can determine neuroinflammation that induces NOX2 activation in microglia. To better understand the role of NOX2 in inflammation, an overview of its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is provided. To write this manuscript, we performed a PubMed search to evaluate the possible relationship of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NOX2 activation in microglia, as well as the role of NOX2 in NDs. Several studies highlighted that NOX2 activation in microglia amplifies neuroinflammation. To date, there is no clinical treatment capable of counteracting its activation, however, NOX2 could be a promising pharmaceutical target useful for both the treatment and prevention of NDs and COVID-19 treatment.
34069159	Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Diseases. There has been an increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases with the rapid increase in aging societies worldwide. Biomarkers that can be used to detect pathological changes before the development of severe neuronal loss and consequently facilitate early intervention with disease-modifying therapeutic modalities are therefore urgently needed. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising tool that can be used to infer microstructural characteristics of the brain, such as microstructural integrity and complexity, as well as axonal density, order, and myelination, through the utilization of water molecules that are diffused within the tissue, with displacement at the micron scale. Diffusion tensor imaging is the most commonly used diffusion MRI technique to assess the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. However, diffusion tensor imaging has several limitations, and new technologies, including neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging, and free-water imaging, have been recently developed as approaches to overcome these constraints. This review provides an overview of these technologies and their potential as biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease progression of major neurodegenerative diseases.
36822211	[Gene Therapies in Motor Neuron Diseases ALS and SMA]. In the past, the diagnosis of motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) meant powerlessness in the face of seemingly untreatable diseases with severe motor-functional limitations and sometimes fatal courses. Recent advances in an understanding of the genetic causalities of these diseases, combined with success in the development of targeted gene therapy strategies, spell hope for effective, innovative therapeutic approaches, pioneering the ability to treat neurodegenerative diseases. While gene therapies have been approved for SMA since a few years, gene therapy research in ALS is still in clinical trials with encouraging results. This article provides an overview of the genetic background of ALS and SMA known to date and gene therapy approaches to them with a focus on therapy candidates that are in clinical trials or have already gained market approval.
37508574	Liquid Biopsy in Neurological Diseases. The most recent and non-invasive approach for studying early-stage biomarkers is liquid biopsy. This implies the extraction and analysis of non-solid biological tissues (serum, plasma, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid) without undergoing invasive procedures to determine disease prognosis. Liquid biopsy can be used for the screening of several components, such as extracellular vesicles, microRNAs, cell-free DNA, cell-free mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, transfer RNA, and circular DNA or RNA derived from body fluids. Its application includes early disease diagnosis, the surveillance of disease activity, and treatment response monitoring, with growing evidence for validating this methodology in cancer, liver disease, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This review will provide an overview of mentioned liquid biopsy components, which could serve as valuable biomarkers for the evaluation of complex neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, CNS tumours, and neuroinfectious diseases. Furthermore, this review highlights the future directions and potential limitations associated with liquid biopsy.
33655876	Directions for Enhancement of the Therapeutic Efficacy of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Different Neurodegenerative and Cardiovascular Diseases: Current Status and Future Perspectives. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising therapeutic effects in a wide variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Although preliminary research has emphasized the ability of MSCs to engraft at sites of injury, several studies have revealed that MSCs mediate their effects through the release of various paracrine factors and through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. The clinical implications of MSCs application are limited due to their low survival rate in conditions of inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutrient restriction in damaged areas. Furthermore, the function of isolated MSCs is usually affected by the patient's health. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new methods to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs under pathophysiological conditions. This review provides an overview of the general properties of MSCs, their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, as well as cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy, and their related mechanisms. In addition, this review also discusses potential problems and side effects, as well as current and future directions for improvement of MSCs therapy and their implications and applications.
33025162	[Robotic assistance in activities of daily living exemplified by food intake]. Carrying out activities of daily living (ADL, also called basic activities) is limited or even no longer possible due to functional limitations and functional losses associated with aging, (chronic) illness and disabilities. Nowadays, there are a variety of assistive technologies/devices and even robotic products. The aim of this article is to give an exemplary overview of the existing products for the basic activity of food intake for people with tetraplegia caused by accidents or neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The dissemination and implementation of these products seems to be relatively low in Germany. Inhibiting and promoting factors for the dissemination and utilization are discussed.
33061334	Activities of Daily Living and Associated Costs in the Most Widespread Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review. Nowadays, the population is rapidly ageing because of increasing life expectancy and decreasing birth rates. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review is to prepare a comprehensive overview which identifies the activities of daily living (ADLs) that are gradually reduced among patients with dementia, as well as explore the therapies applied in relation to dementia and how they effectively improve the quality of life (QoL) of patients and caregivers. Furthermore, we aim to summarise the ADL activities influenced by therapies and examine the treatment costs and care for patients so that recommendations for research and development (R&D) can be made to improve both the QoL of people with dementia and cost-saving measures. The research focuses on four selected neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer, Parkinson, vascular dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, the peer-reviewed English written articles from 2014 to 2019 were searched between September 1 and December 13, 2019. Twenty-seven papers were included in the analysis. The results show that essential assistance occurs in connection with activities: eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, personal hygiene, use of the toilet, and transport. By contrast, shopping or cleaning is not addressed as much. A lower ability to take care of oneself is connected with poor patient health and higher social care costs because the patient requires care from external sources, such as home aid or nurse visits. The challenge that remains is to shift new knowledge from scientific disciplines and connect it with the needs of patients to remove legitimate barriers and increase the acceptance of new solutions by popularisation. Additionally, regarding the burden on caregivers, it would be appropriate to promote this area of education and employment so that family members can use formal caregivers, ensuring them free time and much-needed rest.
36124975	Methodological Recommendations for Studies on the Daily Life Implementation of Implantable Communication-Brain-Computer Interfaces for Individuals With Locked-in Syndrome. Implantable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to be a viable means to restore communication in individuals with locked-in syndrome (LIS). In 2016, we presented the world-first fully implantable BCI system that uses subdural electrocorticography electrodes to record brain signals and a subcutaneous amplifier to transmit the signals to the outside world, and that enabled an individual with LIS to communicate via a tablet computer by selecting icons in spelling software. For future clinical implementation of implantable communication-BCIs, however, much work is still needed, for example, to validate these systems in daily life settings with more participants, and to improve the speed of communication. We believe the design and execution of future studies on these and other topics may benefit from the experience we have gained. Therefore, based on relevant literature and our own experiences, we here provide an overview of procedures, as well as recommendations, for recruitment, screening, inclusion, imaging, hospital admission, implantation, training, and support of participants with LIS, for studies on daily life implementation of implantable communication-BCIs. With this article, we not only aim to inform the BCI community about important topics of concern, but also hope to contribute to improved methodological standardization of implantable BCI research.
32911810	Small Molecules and Peptides Targeting Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors for the Treatment of Neurodegeneration. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) are able to promote the survival of multiple neuronal populations in the body and, therefore, hold considerable promise for disease-modifying treatments of diseases and conditions caused by neurodegeneration. Available data reveal the potential of GFLs for the therapy of Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain and diseases caused by retinal degeneration but, also, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and, possibly, Alzheimer's disease. Despite promising data collected in preclinical models, clinical translation of GFLs is yet to be conducted. The main reasons for the limited success of GFLs clinical development are the poor pharmacological characteristics of GFL proteins, such as the inability of GFLs to cross tissue barriers, poor diffusion in tissues, biphasic dose-response and activation of several receptors in the organism in different cell types, along with ethical limitations on patients' selection in clinical trials. The development of small molecules selectively targeting particular GFL receptors with improved pharmacokinetic properties can overcome many of the difficulties and limitations associated with the clinical use of GFL proteins. The current review lists several strategies to target the GFL receptor complex with drug-like molecules, discusses their advantages, provides an overview of available chemical scaffolds and peptides able to activate GFL receptors and describes the effects of these molecules in cultured cells and animal models.
