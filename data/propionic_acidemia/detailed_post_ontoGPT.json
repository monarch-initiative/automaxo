Here we report the rationale and design of a phase IIIb trial that is aimed at determining the long-term efficacy and safety of carglumic acid in the management of PA and MMA. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group phase IIIb study will be conducted in Saudi Arabia.

Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All children less than 16 years of age admitted between December 2015 and October 2018 with hyperammonemia and received Ammonul infusion for treatment were recruited. Results: Twenty-one patients received the Ammonul infusion. They were admitted 58 times with acute hyperammonemia during the study period, with an average of 2.8 admissions per patient. The mean age of the included patients was 49.5 months. The most frequent underlying diagnoses were propionic acidemia (n=9), urea cycle disorders (n=5), and intrinsic liver disease (n=3). All participants received Ammonul through peripheral lines except 3 who received it through central lines. No extravasation, burns, or other local side effects were observed in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This data indicate that the use of Ammonul through a peripheral venous route appears to be safe and not associated with infusion-related local adverse effects.",

Former reports also detected pancytopenias accompanying febrile infections in PA patients. In the current study, we analyzed vaccine-specific IgG concentrations and avidity maturation after MMR and DiphtTe vaccinations in 10 patients with PA. Compared to gender and age matched controls, all 10 had protective IgG concentrations for at least one tested antigen, and in 6 out of 10 patients high relative avidity indices for measles and rubella were detected. In summary, the present study revealed a sufficient immune response and outcome, indicating an acceptable humoral memory in patients with PA after booster vaccinations.",

In the current study, we analyzed vaccine-specific IgG concentrations and avidity maturation after MMR and DiphtTe vaccinations in 10 patients with PA.

There are different methods to quantify Gcf-DNA, such as the classical Y-chromosome method and the latest digital droplet polymerase chain reaction method. In this study, we reported 2 patients genetically diagnosed with propionic acidemia (PA) went through living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), and monitoring the change of Gcf-DNA examined by the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Two patients went through the operation successfully, and a 5 mL whole blood specimen was collected at 6 specific time points (day 0, day 1, day 7, day 14, day 30, day 60). The comparison of Gcf-DNA and the routine liver function showed that they have similar change-tendency curves, with the curves reaching the top at day 1 because of ischemia-reperfusion injury and generally declining from day 7-day 60 along with recovery of the patient. Applying the ARMS-PCR method to detect Gcf-DNA can be done without knowing the donor information and is not limited by donor-recipient-sex-mismatch condition. In conclusion, Gcf-DNA is a promising biomarker that can monitor graft function in LDLT, and we will apply it in more samples and observe it long term to validate its efficiency in the future.",

We aim to report our experience with liver transplantation (LT) in the management of PA patients. Six patients with PA received a LT at a mean age of 5.2 years (1.3-7.5 years). The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in the first 4 patients and preventative in the last 2 patients. Two patients presented hepatic artery thromboses that were solved through an interventional radiologist approach. These patients showed a very high procoagulant state that was observed by thromboelastography. Arterial vasospasm without thrombus was observed in 2 patients during the LT surgery. In order to avoid hepatic artery thrombosis, an arterial conduit from the recipient aorta to the hepatic artery of the donor was used in the fifth patient. After LT, patients presented improvement in propionyl byproducts without complete normalization, but no decompensations have been observed. In conclusion, LT could be a good therapeutic option to improve the metabolic control and the quality of life of PA patients. Improved surgical strategies along with new techniques of interventional radiology allow us to perform the LT minimizing the complications derived from the higher risk of hepatic artery thrombosis.",

After the clearance of the infection, he underwent ABO-incompatible LDLT 36 days after the administration of rituximab. The CD19+ lymphocyte count just prior to LDLT was 1.2%. He developed AMR five days after LDLT, and the antidonor-type IgM and IgG antibody titers increased to 1:1024 and 1:1024, respectively. He was treated by plasma exchange, IVIG, steroid pulse therapy, and rituximab re-administration; however, his liver dysfunction continued. Despite intensive treatment, he died due to complicated abdominal hernia, acute renal failure, and ARDS. This case suggests that a streptococcal infection may induce the activation of innate immune responses; thus, additional desensitization therapy should be considered prior to ABO-incompatible LDLT if B cell reactivation is suspected.

Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a bulk enzyme-replacement strategy to stabilize metabolically fragile patients, it is not a metabolic cure because patients remain at risk for disease-related complications. We retrospectively studied LT and/or liver-kidney transplant in 9 patients with PA or MMA with additional focus on the optimization of metabolic control and management in the perioperative period. Metabolic crises were common before transplant. By implementing a strategy of carbohydrate minimization with gradual but early lipid and protein introduction, lactate levels significantly improved over the perioperative period (P < 0.001). Posttransplant metabolic improvement is demonstrated by improvements in serum glycine levels (for PA; P < 0.001 x 10-14 ), methylmalonic acid levels (for MMA; P < 0.001), and ammonia levels (for PA and MMA; P < 0.001). Dietary restriction remained after transplant. However, no further metabolic crises have occurred. Other disease-specific comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy stabilized and improved. In conclusion, transplant can provide a strategy for altering the natural history of PA and MMA providing stability to a rare but metabolically brittle population. Nutritional management is critical to optimize patient outcomes.",

METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ.

In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver-kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver-kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported.

CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver-kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.",

Eleven patients with MMA and four patients with PA were treated and/or followed up in Kumamoto University Hospital between January 2009 and December 2018. Three patients with MMA and one patient with PA developed rhabdomyolysis at 1-2 weeks after onset of metabolic crisis. Cases 1 and 4 initially developed rhabdomyolysis after withdrawal from continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), and cases 2 and 3 developed rhabdomyolysis at the time of onset and had recurrent rhabdomyolysis during the recovery phase after withdrawal from CHDF. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis in patients with MMA and PA may have been attributed to a defect in energy production because of a secondary mitochondrial disorder. Therefore, physicians should closely follow patients with MMA and PA, especially after withdrawal of hemodialysis therapy, and provide supportive care for their mitochondrial function.",

N-carbamylglutamate ameliorates hyperammonemia in decompensated propionic acidemia. The effects of long-term continuous N-acetylglutamate administration in such patients are unknown. We report our clinical experience with continuous administration of N-acetylglutamate for 6 years in a patient with propionic acidemia frequently presenting with hyperammonemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A male Caucasian patient with frequently decompensated propionic acidemia and hyperammonemia was admitted 78 times for acute attacks during the first 9 years of his life. Continuous daily treatment with oral N-carbamylglutamate 100 mg/kg (50 mg/kg after 6 months) was initiated. During 6 years of treatment, he had a significant decrease in his mean plasma ammonia levels (75.7 mumol/L vs. 140.3 mumol/L before N-carbamylglutamate therapy, p < 0.005 [normal range 50-80 mumol/L]) and fewer acute episodes (two in 6 years). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a benefit of N-acetylglutamate administration outside the emergency setting. If this observation is confirmed, future studies should aim to optimize the dosage and explore effects of the dosage requirements on other drugs and on protein tolerance.",

An orphan drug benefiting pediatric patients can qualify as a drug for a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) as well. The ODD and RPDD programs provide financial incentives for development of diagnostic drugs, preventive measures, and treatment of diseases affecting small patient populations (adult and pediatric) for which commercial development would otherwise be very challenging. In 2019, a multidisciplinary group of collaborators at National Institutes of Health (NIH) embarked upon a gene therapy platform program called Platform Vector Gene Therapy (PaVe-GT) intended to develop gene therapies for four such rare disorders. An important part of PaVe-GT is to publicly share scientific and regulatory experience gained at different stages during the implementation of the PaVe-GT platform utilizing illustrative examples. The PaVe-GT team recently obtained ODD and RPDD for an adeno-associated virus gene therapy to treat propionic acidemia. Given an increasing interest in obtaining ODD for gene therapy, especially by small companies, research investigators, and patient groups, we overview the submission process and subsequently provide examples of our ODD and RPDD applications. Our ODD and RPDD applications and templates can also be found on the PaVe-GT website. Shared reference documents will have great utility to assist parties who may have limited experience with the preparation of similar applications for their orphan product.",

Because of the poor outcomes reported in those with OA, especially methylmalonic and propionic acidemia, multiple gene therapy approaches have been explored in relevant animal models.

RECENT FINDINGS: Leu is a key metabolic regulator with a multitude of effects on different organ systems. Recent observational studies have demonstrated that these effects can have unintended consequences in patients with MMA as a result of liberal use of medical foods. The combination of protein restriction and medical food use in MMA and propionic acidemia results in an imbalanced branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) dietary content with a high Leu-to-Val and/or Ile ratio. This leads to decreased plasma levels of Val and Ile and predicts impaired brain uptake of multiple essential amino acids. Decreased transport of methionine (Met) across the blood-brain barrier due to high circulating Leu levels is of particular concern in cblC deficiency in which endogenous Met synthesis is impaired. SUMMARY: Investigations into the optimal composition of medical foods for MMA and propionic acidemia, and potential scenarios in which Leu supplementation may be beneficial are needed. Until then, MMA/propionic acidemia medical foods should be used judiciously in the dietary management of these patients and avoided altogether in cblC deficiency.",

Unfortunately, these disorders continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality due to acute and chronic systemic and end-organ injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary management with medical foods has been a mainstay of therapy for decades, yet well controlled patients can manifest growth, development, cardiac, ophthalmological, renal, and neurological complications. Patients with organic acidopathies suffer metabolic brain injury that targets specific regions of the basal ganglia in a distinctive pattern, and these injuries may occur even with optimal management during metabolic stress. Liver transplantation has improved quality of life and metabolic stability, yet transplantation in this population does not entirely prevent brain injury or the development of optic neuropathy and cardiac disease. SUMMARY: Management guidelines should identify necessary screening for patients with methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia, and improve anticipatory management of progressive end-organ disease. Liver transplantation improves overall metabolic control, but injury to nonregenerative tissues may not be mitigated. Continued use of medical foods in these patients requires prospective studies to demonstrate evidence of benefit in a controlled manner.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Novel messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapies, currently in development, are emerging as a promising potential treatment modality for a broad range of life-threatening and life-limiting inherited liver diseases, including methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA). However, owing in part to their complexity, they are likely to come at considerable financial cost to healthcare systems. The objective of this research was to synthesize available evidence on the costs and clinical consequences associated with MMA and PA for the purpose of exploratory economic evaluation of novel mRNA-based therapies using an early cost-utility model from the United Kingdom payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the costs and outcomes associated with novel mRNA therapies, compared with a combination of dietary management and organ transplantation (standard of care) among hypothetical cohorts of new-born patients with MMA and PA. Key model drivers were identified, and a price threshold analysis was performed to estimate value-based price ranges for future mRNA therapies given willingness-to-pay thresholds for orphan diseases. RESULTS: mRNA therapy was associated with an additional 5.7 and 1.3 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient lifetime among patients with MMA and PA, respectively. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were relative improvement in utility among patients who receive mRNA-based therapy and transplantation, and the cost of mRNA therapy. Assuming a willingness to pay range of $100,000-$300,000 per QALY gained, the model demonstrated mRNA therapy to be cost-effective in MMA and PA at an annual treatment cost of $70,452-$94,575 and $31,313-$36,695, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of a strong evidence base in MMA and PA, this model provides a useful tool to estimate the cost-effectiveness, and inform value-based pricing, of new mRNA-based therapies. Our analyses also identified areas for research that will have the greatest value in reducing uncertainty in future health economic evaluations of such treatments.",

Recent reports of successful DLT in children with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) show promising long-term outcomes. METHODS: It was a retrospective study. All children with MSUD were paired with either recipients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or non-MSUD metabolic disease. Each pair underwent simultaneous liver transplant (LT), where the MSUD recipient received the graft from a living-related donor and the liver explanted from the MSUD donor was transplanted to the respective paired domino recipient. We report our experience regarding the techniques and outcomes of DLT at our center. RESULTS: Eleven children with MSUD and 12 respective DLT recipients were enrolled, one of which was domino split-liver transplantation. DLT recipients included seven ESLD, two propionic acidemia (PA), one glycogen storage disease(GSD) type-1, one GSD type-3, and one Citrullinemia. Post-LT ICU and hospital stays were comparable (p > .05). Patient and graft survival was 100% and 66.6% in the MSUD group and DLT recipients at a mean follow-up of 13.5 and 15 months. There was no death in the MSUD group as compared to four in the DLT group. The amino acid levels rapidly normalized after the LT in the children with MSUD and they tolerated the normal unrestricted diet. No vascular, biliary, or graft-related complications were seen in the post-transplant period. No occurrence of MSUD was noted in DLT recipients. CONCLUSION: DLTs have excellent post-surgical outcomes. DLT should be strongly considered and adopted by transplant programs worldwide to circumvent organ shortage.",

Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a bulk enzyme-replacement strategy to stabilize metabolically fragile patients, it is not a metabolic cure because patients remain at risk for disease-related complications. We retrospectively studied LT and/or liver-kidney transplant in 9 patients with PA or MMA with additional focus on the optimization of metabolic control and management in the perioperative period. Metabolic crises were common before transplant. By implementing a strategy of carbohydrate minimization with gradual but early lipid and protein introduction, lactate levels significantly improved over the perioperative period (P < 0.001). Posttransplant metabolic improvement is demonstrated by improvements in serum glycine levels (for PA; P < 0.001 x 10-14 ), methylmalonic acid levels (for MMA; P < 0.001), and ammonia levels (for PA and MMA; P < 0.001). Dietary restriction remained after transplant. However, no further metabolic crises have occurred. Other disease-specific comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy stabilized and improved. In conclusion, transplant can provide a strategy for altering the natural history of PA and MMA providing stability to a rare but metabolically brittle population. Nutritional management is critical to optimize patient outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current world experience regarding living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in the treatment of propionic acidemia (PA) is limited, especially in terms of using obligate heterozygous carriers as donors. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of LDLT in children with PA. METHODS: From November 2017 to January 2020, 7 of the 192 children who underwent LDLT at our institution had been diagnosed with PA (median age, 2.1 years; range, 1.1-5.8 years). The primary indication for transplantation was frequent metabolic decompensations in 6 patients and preventative treatment in 1 patient. Of the seven parental living donors, six were genetically proven obligate heterozygous carriers. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.9 months (range, 13.9-40.2 months), all patients were alive with 100% allograft survival, and no severe transplant-related complications occurred. In the case of liberalized protein intake, they did not suffer metabolic decompensation or disease-related complications and made progress in neurodevelopmental delay and body growth, as well as blood and urinary metabolite levels. In one patient with pre-existing mild dilated cardiomyopathy, her echocardiogram results completely normalized 13.8 months post-transplant. All living donors recovered well after surgery, with no metabolic decompensations or procedure-related complications. Western blotting revealed that the hepatic expressions of PCCA and PCCB in one of the heterozygous donors were comparable to those of the normal healthy control at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: LDLT using partial liver grafts from asymptomatic obligate heterozygous carrier donors is a viable therapeutic option for selected PA patients, with no negative impact on donors' and recipients' clinical courses.",

Despite optimal dietary and cofactor therapy, OA patients still suffer from potentially lethal metabolic instability and experience long-term multisystemic complications. Severely affected patients can benefit from elective liver transplantation, which restores hepatic enzymatic activity, improves metabolic stability, and provides the theoretical basis for the pursuit of gene therapy as a new treatment for patients. Because of the poor outcomes reported in those with OA, especially methylmalonic and propionic acidemia, multiple gene therapy approaches have been explored in relevant animal models. Here we review the results of gene therapy experiments performed using MMA and PA mouse models to illustrate experimental paradigms that could be applicable for all forms of OA.

Eleven patients with MMA and four patients with PA were treated and/or followed up in Kumamoto University Hospital between January 2009 and December 2018. Three patients with MMA and one patient with PA developed rhabdomyolysis at 1-2 weeks after onset of metabolic crisis. Cases 1 and 4 initially developed rhabdomyolysis after withdrawal from continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), and cases 2 and 3 developed rhabdomyolysis at the time of onset and had recurrent rhabdomyolysis during the recovery phase after withdrawal from CHDF. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis in patients with MMA and PA may have been attributed to a defect in energy production because of a secondary mitochondrial disorder. Therefore, physicians should closely follow patients with MMA and PA, especially after withdrawal of hemodialysis therapy, and provide supportive care for their mitochondrial function.",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

We aim to report our experience with liver transplantation (LT) in the management of PA patients. Six patients with PA received a LT at a mean age of 5.2 years (1.3-7.5 years). The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in the first 4 patients and preventative in the last 2 patients. Two patients presented hepatic artery thromboses that were solved through an interventional radiologist approach. These patients showed a very high procoagulant state that was observed by thromboelastography. Arterial vasospasm without thrombus was observed in 2 patients during the LT surgery. In order to avoid hepatic artery thrombosis, an arterial conduit from the recipient aorta to the hepatic artery of the donor was used in the fifth patient. After LT, patients presented improvement in propionyl byproducts without complete normalization, but no decompensations have been observed. In conclusion, LT could be a good therapeutic option to improve the metabolic control and the quality of life of PA patients. Improved surgical strategies along with new techniques of interventional radiology allow us to perform the LT minimizing the complications derived from the higher risk of hepatic artery thrombosis.",

Although the CD19+ lymphocyte count decreased to 0.1% nine days after the administration of rituximab, he developed a high fever which was accompanied by arthralgia due to a streptococcal infection 13 days after rituximab prophylaxis. After the clearance of the infection, he underwent ABO-incompatible LDLT 36 days after the administration of rituximab. The CD19+ lymphocyte count just prior to LDLT was 1.2%. He developed AMR five days after LDLT, and the antidonor-type IgM and IgG antibody titers increased to 1:1024 and 1:1024, respectively. He was treated by plasma exchange, IVIG, steroid pulse therapy, and rituximab re-administration; however, his liver dysfunction continued. Despite intensive treatment, he died due to complicated abdominal hernia, acute renal failure, and ARDS. This case suggests that a streptococcal infection may induce the activation of innate immune responses; thus, additional desensitization therapy should be considered prior to ABO-incompatible LDLT if B cell reactivation is suspected.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Organic acidemias, especially propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), may manifest clinically within the first few hours to days of life. The classic presentation in the newborn period includes metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia that is precipitated by unrestricted protein intake. Implementation of newborn screening to diagnose and initiate early treatment has facilitated a reduction in neonatal mortality and improved survival. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate management, these individuals are prone to have recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a treatment modality to reduce metabolic decompensations which are not controlled by medical management. Published reports on the outcome of LT show heterogeneous results regarding clinical and biochemical features in the post transplantation period. As a result, we evaluated the outcomes of LT in our institution and compared it to the previously published data. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of nine individuals with PA or MMA who underwent LT and two individuals with MMA who underwent LT and kidney transplantation (KT). Data including number of hospitalizations, laboratory measures, cardiac and neurological outcomes, dietary protein intake, and growth parameters were collected. RESULTS: The median age of transplantation for subjects with MMA was 7.2 years with a median follow up of 4.3 years. The median age of transplantation for subjects with PA was 1.9 years with a median follow up of 5.4 years. The survival rate at 1 year and 5 years post-LT was 100%. Most of our subjects did not have any episodes of hyperammonemia or pancreatitis post-LT. There was significant reduction in plasma glycine post-LT. One subject developed mild elevation in ammonia post-LT on an unrestricted protein diet, suggesting that protein restriction may be indicated even after LT. CONCLUSION: In a large single center study of LT in MMA and PA, we show that LT may reduce the incidence of metabolic decompensation. Moreover, our data suggest that LT may be associated with reduced number of hospitalizations and improved linear growth in individuals with PA and MMA.",

METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ.

Liver transplantation (LT) was thus proposed in PA to increase enzyme activity. We studied retrospectively LT in PA in two European centers. Twelve patients underwent 17 LTs between 1991 and 2013. They developed severe, unusual and unexpected complications, with high mortality (58%). When present, the cardiomyopathy resolved and no acute metabolic decompensation occurred allowing dietary relaxation. Renal failure was present in half of the patients before LT and worsened in all of them. We suggest that cardiac and renal functions should be assessed before LT and monitored closely afterward. A renal sparing immunosuppression should be used. We speculate that some complications may be related to accumulated toxicity of the disease and that earlier LT could prevent some of these consequences. As kidney transplantation has been performed successfully in methylmalonic acidemia, a metabolic disease in the same biochemical pathway, the choice of the organ to transplant could be further discussed.",

Liver transplantation (LT) is required in PA patients when medical treatment fails and may prevent or slow down the cardiomyopathy progression. However, severe heart disease may be a serious contraindication to LT. We present a complicated case of a PA patient, supported with a Left Ventricular Assist Device, who underwent a heart and Liver transplant. PA patients are at increased risk for metabolic acidosis during surgery, with increased anion gap and hyperammonemia. A strict multi-disciplinary approach is needed to prevent and treat metabolic decompensation.

RECENT FINDINGS: Leu is a key metabolic regulator with a multitude of effects on different organ systems. Recent observational studies have demonstrated that these effects can have unintended consequences in patients with MMA as a result of liberal use of medical foods. The combination of protein restriction and medical food use in MMA and propionic acidemia results in an imbalanced branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) dietary content with a high Leu-to-Val and/or Ile ratio. This leads to decreased plasma levels of Val and Ile and predicts impaired brain uptake of multiple essential amino acids. Decreased transport of methionine (Met) across the blood-brain barrier due to high circulating Leu levels is of particular concern in cblC deficiency in which endogenous Met synthesis is impaired. SUMMARY: Investigations into the optimal composition of medical foods for MMA and propionic acidemia, and potential scenarios in which Leu supplementation may be beneficial are needed. Until then, MMA/propionic acidemia medical foods should be used judiciously in the dietary management of these patients and avoided altogether in cblC deficiency.",

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of LDLT in children with PA. METHODS: From November 2017 to January 2020, 7 of the 192 children who underwent LDLT at our institution had been diagnosed with PA (median age, 2.1 years; range, 1.1-5.8 years). The primary indication for transplantation was frequent metabolic decompensations in 6 patients and preventative treatment in 1 patient. Of the seven parental living donors, six were genetically proven obligate heterozygous carriers. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.9 months (range, 13.9-40.2 months), all patients were alive with 100% allograft survival, and no severe transplant-related complications occurred. In the case of liberalized protein intake, they did not suffer metabolic decompensation or disease-related complications and made progress in neurodevelopmental delay and body growth, as well as blood and urinary metabolite levels. In one patient with pre-existing mild dilated cardiomyopathy, her echocardiogram results completely normalized 13.8 months post-transplant. All living donors recovered well after surgery, with no metabolic decompensations or procedure-related complications. Western blotting revealed that the hepatic expressions of PCCA and PCCB in one of the heterozygous donors were comparable to those of the normal healthy control at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: LDLT using partial liver grafts from asymptomatic obligate heterozygous carrier donors is a viable therapeutic option for selected PA patients, with no negative impact on donors' and recipients' clinical courses.",

The mainstay of disease management is lifelong protein restriction. As an alternative, liver transplantation (LT) may improve survival, quality of life, and prevent further neurological deterioration. The aim of our study was to estimate the incremental costs and outcomes of LT versus nutritional support in patients with early-onset MMA or PA. We constructed a Markov model to simulate and compare life expectancies, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime direct and indirect costs for a cohort of newborns with MMA or PA who could either receive LT or be maintained on conventional nutritional support. We conducted a series of 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base case, LT on average resulted in 1.5 more life years lived, 7.9 more QALYs, and a savings of $582,369 for lifetime societal cost per individual compared to nutritional support. LT remained more effective and less costly in all 1-way sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, LT was cost-effective at the $100,000/QALY threshold in more than 90% of the simulations and cost-saving in over half of the simulations. LT is likely a dominant treatment strategy compared to nutritional support in newborns with classical MMA or PA.",

METHODS: Data from a clinically diverse PA patient population ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02890342 ) were used to train and test machine learning models, identify PA-relevant biomarkers, and perform validation analysis using data from liver-transplanted participants. k-Means clustering was used to test for the existence of PA subtypes. Expert knowledge was used to define PA subtypes (mild and severe). Given expert classification, supervised machine learning (support vector machine with a polynomial kernel, svmPoly) performed dimensional reduction to define relevant features of each PA subtype. RESULTS: Forty participants enrolled in the study; five underwent liver transplant. Analysis with k-means clustering indicated that several PA subtypes may exist on the biochemical continuum. The conventional PA biomarkers, plasma total 2-methylctirate and propionylcarnitine, were not statistically significantly different between nontransplanted and transplanted participants motivating us to search for other biomarkers. Unbiased dimensional reduction using svmPoly revealed that plasma transthyretin, alanine:serine ratio, GDF15, FGF21, and in vivo 1-13C-propionate oxidation, play roles in defining PA subtypes. CONCLUSION: Support vector machine prioritized biomarkers that helped classify propionic acidemia patients according to severity subtypes, with important ramifications for future clinical trials and management of PA.",

RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.9 months (range, 13.9-40.2 months), all patients were alive with 100% allograft survival, and no severe transplant-related complications occurred. In the case of liberalized protein intake, they did not suffer metabolic decompensation or disease-related complications and made progress in neurodevelopmental delay and body growth, as well as blood and urinary metabolite levels. In one patient with pre-existing mild dilated cardiomyopathy, her echocardiogram results completely normalized 13.8 months post-transplant. All living donors recovered well after surgery, with no metabolic decompensations or procedure-related complications. Western blotting revealed that the hepatic expressions of PCCA and PCCB in one of the heterozygous donors were comparable to those of the normal healthy control at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: LDLT using partial liver grafts from asymptomatic obligate heterozygous carrier donors is a viable therapeutic option for selected PA patients, with no negative impact on donors' and recipients' clinical courses.",

There are different methods to quantify Gcf-DNA, such as the classical Y-chromosome method and the latest digital droplet polymerase chain reaction method. In this study, we reported 2 patients genetically diagnosed with propionic acidemia (PA) went through living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), and monitoring the change of Gcf-DNA examined by the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Two patients went through the operation successfully, and a 5 mL whole blood specimen was collected at 6 specific time points (day 0, day 1, day 7, day 14, day 30, day 60). The comparison of Gcf-DNA and the routine liver function showed that they have similar change-tendency curves, with the curves reaching the top at day 1 because of ischemia-reperfusion injury and generally declining from day 7-day 60 along with recovery of the patient. Applying the ARMS-PCR method to detect Gcf-DNA can be done without knowing the donor information and is not limited by donor-recipient-sex-mismatch condition. In conclusion, Gcf-DNA is a promising biomarker that can monitor graft function in LDLT, and we will apply it in more samples and observe it long term to validate its efficiency in the future.",

We aim to report our experience with liver transplantation (LT) in the management of PA patients. Six patients with PA received a LT at a mean age of 5.2 years (1.3-7.5 years). The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in the first 4 patients and preventative in the last 2 patients. Two patients presented hepatic artery thromboses that were solved through an interventional radiologist approach. These patients showed a very high procoagulant state that was observed by thromboelastography. Arterial vasospasm without thrombus was observed in 2 patients during the LT surgery. In order to avoid hepatic artery thrombosis, an arterial conduit from the recipient aorta to the hepatic artery of the donor was used in the fifth patient. After LT, patients presented improvement in propionyl byproducts without complete normalization, but no decompensations have been observed. In conclusion, LT could be a good therapeutic option to improve the metabolic control and the quality of life of PA patients. Improved surgical strategies along with new techniques of interventional radiology allow us to perform the LT minimizing the complications derived from the higher risk of hepatic artery thrombosis.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Organic acidemias, especially propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), may manifest clinically within the first few hours to days of life. The classic presentation in the newborn period includes metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia that is precipitated by unrestricted protein intake. Implementation of newborn screening to diagnose and initiate early treatment has facilitated a reduction in neonatal mortality and improved survival. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate management, these individuals are prone to have recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a treatment modality to reduce metabolic decompensations which are not controlled by medical management. Published reports on the outcome of LT show heterogeneous results regarding clinical and biochemical features in the post transplantation period. As a result, we evaluated the outcomes of LT in our institution and compared it to the previously published data. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of nine individuals with PA or MMA who underwent LT and two individuals with MMA who underwent LT and kidney transplantation (KT). Data including number of hospitalizations, laboratory measures, cardiac and neurological outcomes, dietary protein intake, and growth parameters were collected. RESULTS: The median age of transplantation for subjects with MMA was 7.2 years with a median follow up of 4.3 years. The median age of transplantation for subjects with PA was 1.9 years with a median follow up of 5.4 years. The survival rate at 1 year and 5 years post-LT was 100%. Most of our subjects did not have any episodes of hyperammonemia or pancreatitis post-LT. There was significant reduction in plasma glycine post-LT.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Organic acidemias, especially propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), may manifest clinically within the first few hours to days of life. The classic presentation in the newborn period includes metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia that is precipitated by unrestricted protein intake. Implementation of newborn screening to diagnose and initiate early treatment has facilitated a reduction in neonatal mortality and improved survival. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate management, these individuals are prone to have recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a treatment modality to reduce metabolic decompensations which are not controlled by medical management. Published reports on the outcome of LT show heterogeneous results regarding clinical and biochemical features in the post transplantation period. As a result, we evaluated the outcomes of LT in our institution and compared it to the previously published data. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of nine individuals with PA or MMA who underwent LT and two individuals with MMA who underwent LT and kidney transplantation (KT). Data including number of hospitalizations, laboratory measures, cardiac and neurological outcomes, dietary protein intake, and growth parameters were collected. RESULTS: The median age of transplantation for subjects with MMA was 7.2 years with a median follow up of 4.3 years. The median age of transplantation for subjects with PA was 1.9 years with a median follow up of 5.4 years. The survival rate at 1 year and 5 years post-LT was 100%. Most of our subjects did not have any episodes of hyperammonemia or pancreatitis post-LT. There was significant reduction in plasma glycine post-LT. One subject developed mild elevation in ammonia post-LT on an unrestricted protein diet, suggesting that protein restriction may be indicated even after LT. CONCLUSION: In a large single center study of LT in MMA and PA, we show that LT may reduce the incidence of metabolic decompensation. Moreover, our data suggest that LT may be associated with reduced number of hospitalizations and improved linear growth in individuals with PA and MMA.",

There are different methods to quantify Gcf-DNA, such as the classical Y-chromosome method and the latest digital droplet polymerase chain reaction method. In this study, we reported 2 patients genetically diagnosed with propionic acidemia (PA) went through living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), and monitoring the change of Gcf-DNA examined by the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Two patients went through the operation successfully, and a 5 mL whole blood specimen was collected at 6 specific time points (day 0, day 1, day 7, day 14, day 30, day 60). The comparison of Gcf-DNA and the routine liver function showed that they have similar change-tendency curves, with the curves reaching the top at day 1 because of ischemia-reperfusion injury and generally declining from day 7-day 60 along with recovery of the patient. Applying the ARMS-PCR method to detect Gcf-DNA can be done without knowing the donor information and is not limited by donor-recipient-sex-mismatch condition. In conclusion, Gcf-DNA is a promising biomarker that can monitor graft function in LDLT, and we will apply it in more samples and observe it long term to validate its efficiency in the future.",

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of LDLT in children with PA. METHODS: From November 2017 to January 2020, 7 of the 192 children who underwent LDLT at our institution had been diagnosed with PA (median age, 2.1 years; range, 1.1-5.8 years). The primary indication for transplantation was frequent metabolic decompensations in 6 patients and preventative treatment in 1 patient. Of the seven parental living donors, six were genetically proven obligate heterozygous carriers. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.9 months (range, 13.9-40.2 months), all patients were alive with 100% allograft survival, and no severe transplant-related complications occurred. In the case of liberalized protein intake, they did not suffer metabolic decompensation or disease-related complications and made progress in neurodevelopmental delay and body growth, as well as blood and urinary metabolite levels. In one patient with pre-existing mild dilated cardiomyopathy, her echocardiogram results completely normalized 13.8 months post-transplant. All living donors recovered well after surgery, with no metabolic decompensations or procedure-related complications. Western blotting revealed that the hepatic expressions of PCCA and PCCB in one of the heterozygous donors were comparable to those of the normal healthy control at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: LDLT using partial liver grafts from asymptomatic obligate heterozygous carrier donors is a viable therapeutic option for selected PA patients, with no negative impact on donors' and recipients' clinical courses.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Novel messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapies, currently in development, are emerging as a promising potential treatment modality for a broad range of life-threatening and life-limiting inherited liver diseases, including methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA). However, owing in part to their complexity, they are likely to come at considerable financial cost to healthcare systems. The objective of this research was to synthesize available evidence on the costs and clinical consequences associated with MMA and PA for the purpose of exploratory economic evaluation of novel mRNA-based therapies using an early cost-utility model from the United Kingdom payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the costs and outcomes associated with novel mRNA therapies, compared with a combination of dietary management and organ transplantation (standard of care) among hypothetical cohorts of new-born patients with MMA and PA. Key model drivers were identified, and a price threshold analysis was performed to estimate value-based price ranges for future mRNA therapies given willingness-to-pay thresholds for orphan diseases. RESULTS: mRNA therapy was associated with an additional 5.7 and 1.3 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient lifetime among patients with MMA and PA, respectively. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were relative improvement in utility among patients who receive mRNA-based therapy and transplantation, and the cost of mRNA therapy. Assuming a willingness to pay range of $100,000-$300,000 per QALY gained, the model demonstrated mRNA therapy to be cost-effective in MMA and PA at an annual treatment cost of $70,452-$94,575 and $31,313-$36,695, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of a strong evidence base in MMA and PA, this model provides a useful tool to estimate the cost-effectiveness, and inform value-based pricing, of new mRNA-based therapies. Our analyses also identified areas for research that will have the greatest value in reducing uncertainty in future health economic evaluations of such treatments.",

                    "abstract": "Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare inherited metabolic disease due to inborn errors of metabolism. PA results in the accumulation of abnormal organic acid metabolites in multiple systems, mainly the central nervous system and the heart. Cardiac complications include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and carry a 40-50% increased mortality risk. Liver transplantation (LT) is required in PA patients when medical treatment fails and may prevent or slow down the cardiomyopathy progression. However, severe heart disease may be a serious contraindication to LT. We present a complicated case of a PA patient, supported with a Left Ventricular Assist Device, who underwent a heart and Liver transplant. PA patients are at increased risk for metabolic acidosis during surgery, with increased anion gap and hyperammonemia. A strict multi-disciplinary approach is needed to prevent and treat metabolic decompensation. The patient had a successful heart and liver transplant after a strict treatment protocol in the pre, intra, and post-operative periods. His case highlights the complexity of PA patients and the increased risk for metabolic decompensation during surgery and provides an insight into how to manage such complicated patients.",

The nationwide newborn screening for MMA/PA has been in place in Taiwan from January, 2000 and data was collected until December, 2016. RESULTS: During the study period, 3,155,263 newborns were screened. The overall incidence of MMA mutase type cases was 1/121,356 (n = 26), 1 cobalamin B was detected and that for PA cases (n = 4) was 1/788,816. The time of referral is 8.8 days for MMA patients, and 7.5 days for PA patients. The MMA mutase type patients have higher AST, ALT, and NH3 values as well as a lower pH value (p < 0.05). The mean age for liver transplantation (LT) is 402 days (range from 0.6-6.7 yr) with 16 out of 20 cases (80.0%) using living donors. The mean admission length shortened from 90.6 days/year (pre-LT) to 5.3 days/year (at 3rd year post-LT) (p < 0.0005). Similarly, the tube feeding ratio decreased from 67.8 to 0.50% (p < 0.00005). The anxiety level of the caregiver was reduced from 33.4 to 27.2 after LT (p = 0.001) and the DQ/IQ performance of the patients was improved after LT from 50 to 60.1 (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: MMA/PA patients with LT do survive and have reduced admission time, reduced tube feeding and the caregiver is less anxious.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Organic acidemias, especially propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), may manifest clinically within the first few hours to days of life. The classic presentation in the newborn period includes metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia that is precipitated by unrestricted protein intake. Implementation of newborn screening to diagnose and initiate early treatment has facilitated a reduction in neonatal mortality and improved survival. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate management, these individuals are prone to have recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a treatment modality to reduce metabolic decompensations which are not controlled by medical management. Published reports on the outcome of LT show heterogeneous results regarding clinical and biochemical features in the post transplantation period. As a result, we evaluated the outcomes of LT in our institution and compared it to the previously published data. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of nine individuals with PA or MMA who underwent LT and two individuals with MMA who underwent LT and kidney transplantation (KT). Data including number of hospitalizations, laboratory measures, cardiac and neurological outcomes, dietary protein intake, and growth parameters were collected. RESULTS: The median age of transplantation for subjects with MMA was 7.2 years with a median follow up of 4.3 years. The median age of transplantation for subjects with PA was 1.9 years with a median follow up of 5.4 years. The survival rate at 1 year and 5 years post-LT was 100%. Most of our subjects did not have any episodes of hyperammonemia or pancreatitis post-LT. There was significant reduction in plasma glycine post-LT. One subject developed mild elevation in ammonia post-LT on an unrestricted protein diet, suggesting that protein restriction may be indicated even after LT. CONCLUSION: In a large single center study of LT in MMA and PA, we show that LT may reduce the incidence of metabolic decompensation. Moreover, our data suggest that LT may be associated with reduced number of hospitalizations and improved linear growth in individuals with PA and MMA.",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

The mainstay of disease management is lifelong protein restriction. As an alternative, liver transplantation (LT) may improve survival, quality of life, and prevent further neurological deterioration. The aim of our study was to estimate the incremental costs and outcomes of LT versus nutritional support in patients with early-onset MMA or PA. We constructed a Markov model to simulate and compare life expectancies, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime direct and indirect costs for a cohort of newborns with MMA or PA who could either receive LT or be maintained on conventional nutritional support. We conducted a series of 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base case, LT on average resulted in 1.5 more life years lived, 7.9 more QALYs, and a savings of $582,369 for lifetime societal cost per individual compared to nutritional support. LT remained more effective and less costly in all 1-way sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, LT was cost-effective at the $100,000/QALY threshold in more than 90% of the simulations and cost-saving in over half of the simulations. LT is likely a dominant treatment strategy compared to nutritional support in newborns with classical MMA or PA.",

Despite optimal medical management, PA often leads to acute and progressive neurological injury. Reports on liver transplantation (LT) as a cellular therapy are limited and varied. The objective of this study was to examine the largest collection of patients who underwent LT for PA. METHODS: Examining the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Pediatric Health Information System administrative billing databases, we performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of LT over a 16-year period. During this period, 4849 pediatric LT were performed out of which 23 were done for PA at 10 different centers. RESULTS: The majority of recipients were 5 years of age or younger and had status 1b exception points at the time of transplant. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival for PA LT recipients was 84.6% and the 1-, 3, and 5-year patient survival was 89.5%. There was no significant difference in graft or patient survival between PA and non-PA LT recipients. Despite historical data to the contrary, we did not find an increased incidence of hepatic arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing LT for PA. Patients in the PA LT group, however, had a significantly higher postoperative rate of readmission compared with the non-PA LT group (90.5% vs 72.8%, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: LT for children with PA is a viable treatment option with acceptable outcomes.",

N-carbamylglutamate ameliorates hyperammonemia in decompensated propionic acidemia. The effects of long-term continuous N-acetylglutamate administration in such patients are unknown. We report our clinical experience with continuous administration of N-acetylglutamate for 6 years in a patient with propionic acidemia frequently presenting with hyperammonemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A male Caucasian patient with frequently decompensated propionic acidemia and hyperammonemia was admitted 78 times for acute attacks during the first 9 years of his life. Continuous daily treatment with oral N-carbamylglutamate 100 mg/kg (50 mg/kg after 6 months) was initiated. During 6 years of treatment, he had a significant decrease in his mean plasma ammonia levels (75.7 mumol/L vs. 140.3 mumol/L before N-carbamylglutamate therapy, p < 0.005 [normal range 50-80 mumol/L]) and fewer acute episodes (two in 6 years). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a benefit of N-acetylglutamate administration outside the emergency setting. If this observation is confirmed, future studies should aim to optimize the dosage and explore effects of the dosage requirements on other drugs and on protein tolerance.",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

Although the CD19+ lymphocyte count decreased to 0.1% nine days after the administration of rituximab, he developed a high fever which was accompanied by arthralgia due to a streptococcal infection 13 days after rituximab prophylaxis. After the clearance of the infection, he underwent ABO-incompatible LDLT 36 days after the administration of rituximab. The CD19+ lymphocyte count just prior to LDLT was 1.2%. He developed AMR five days after LDLT, and the antidonor-type IgM and IgG antibody titers increased to 1:1024 and 1:1024, respectively. He was treated by plasma exchange, IVIG, steroid pulse therapy, and rituximab re-administration; however, his liver dysfunction continued. Despite intensive treatment, he died due to complicated abdominal hernia, acute renal failure, and ARDS. This case suggests that a streptococcal infection may induce the activation of innate immune responses; thus, additional desensitization therapy should be considered prior to ABO-incompatible LDLT if B cell reactivation is suspected.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of posttransplant clinical outcomes in PA patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies focusing on PA patients who underwent LT. The pooled estimate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 70 individuals were included. The pooled estimate rates were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for patient survival and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for allograft survival. The pooled estimate rates were 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.39) for rejection, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.00-0.21) for hepatic artery thrombosis, 0.14 (95% CI, 0.00-0.37) for cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection, and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.15) for biliary complications. The pooled estimate rates were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for metabolic stability, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) for reversal of preexisting cardiomyopathy, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for improvement of neurodevelopmental delay. A large proportion of patients achieved liberalization of protein intake posttransplant (pooled estimate rate 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of transplant-related complications, LT is a viable therapeutic option in PA patients with satisfactory survival rates and clinical outcomes. Given the diversity in neurological assessment methods and the inconsistency in the achievement of dietary protein liberalization across different studies, consensus on neurological evaluation methods and posttransplant protein intake is necessary. Longer-term clinical outcomes of LT for PA warrants further investigation.",

RECENT FINDINGS: Leu is a key metabolic regulator with a multitude of effects on different organ systems. Recent observational studies have demonstrated that these effects can have unintended consequences in patients with MMA as a result of liberal use of medical foods. The combination of protein restriction and medical food use in MMA and propionic acidemia results in an imbalanced branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) dietary content with a high Leu-to-Val and/or Ile ratio. This leads to decreased plasma levels of Val and Ile and predicts impaired brain uptake of multiple essential amino acids. Decreased transport of methionine (Met) across the blood-brain barrier due to high circulating Leu levels is of particular concern in cblC deficiency in which endogenous Met synthesis is impaired. SUMMARY: Investigations into the optimal composition of medical foods for MMA and propionic acidemia, and potential scenarios in which Leu supplementation may be beneficial are needed. Until then, MMA/propionic acidemia medical foods should be used judiciously in the dietary management of these patients and avoided altogether in cblC deficiency.",

                    "abstract": "Liver transplantation (LT) for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) is an emerging therapeutic option. We present a retrospective review of patients with PA who underwent LT at a tertiary liver center between 1995 and 2015. A total of 14 children were identified (8 males) with median age at initial presentation of 3 days (range, 0-77 days). Pretransplant median protein restriction was 1 g/kg/day (range, 0.63-1.75 g/kg/day), 71% required supportive feeding, and 86% had developmental delay. Frequent metabolic decompensations (MDs) were the main indication for LT with a median age at transplantation of 2.4 years (range, 0.8-7.1 years). Only 1 graft was from a living donor, and 13 were from deceased donors (4 auxiliary). The 2-year patient survival was 86%, and overall study and graft survival was 79% and 69%, respectively. Three patients died after LT: at 43 days (biliary peritonitis), 225 days (acute-on-chronic rejection with multiorgan failure), and 13.5 years (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease). Plasma glycine and propionylcarnitine remained elevated but reduced after transplant. Of 11 survivors, 5 had at least 1 episode of acute cellular rejection, 2 sustained a metabolic stroke (with full recovery), and 3 developed mild cardiomyopathy after LT. All have liberalized protein intake, and 9 had no further MDs: median episodes before transplant, 4 (range, 1-30); and median episodes after transplant, 0 (range, 0-5). All survivors made some developmental progress after LT, and none worsened at a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 2-23 years). LT in PA significantly reduces the frequency of MDs, can liberalize protein intake and improve quality of life, and should continue to be considered in selected cases.",

Carglumic acid (Carbaglu ; Orphan Europe Ltd.) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for the treatment of hyperammonemia due hepatic NAGS deficiency. Here we report the rationale and design of a phase IIIb trial that is aimed at determining the long-term efficacy and safety of carglumic acid in the management of PA and MMA. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group phase IIIb study will be conducted in Saudi Arabia. Patients with PA or MMA (<=15 years of age) will be randomized 1:1 to receive twice daily carglumic acid (50 mg/kg/day) plus standard therapy (protein-restricted diet, L-carnitine, and metronidazole) or standard therapy alone for a 2-year treatment period. The primary efficacy outcome is the number of emergency room visits due to hyperammonemia. Safety will be assessed throughout the study and during the 1 month follow-up period after the study. DISCUSSION: Current guidelines recommend conservative medical treatment as the main strategy for the management of PA and MMA. Although retrospective studies have suggested that long-term carglumic acid may be beneficial in the management of PA and MMA, current literature lacks evidence for this indication. This clinical trial will determine the long-term safety and efficacy of carglumic acid in the management of PA and MMA.

This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION: The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.",

There are different methods to quantify Gcf-DNA, such as the classical Y-chromosome method and the latest digital droplet polymerase chain reaction method. In this study, we reported 2 patients genetically diagnosed with propionic acidemia (PA) went through living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), and monitoring the change of Gcf-DNA examined by the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Two patients went through the operation successfully, and a 5 mL whole blood specimen was collected at 6 specific time points (day 0, day 1, day 7, day 14, day 30, day 60). The comparison of Gcf-DNA and the routine liver function showed that they have similar change-tendency curves, with the curves reaching the top at day 1 because of ischemia-reperfusion injury and generally declining from day 7-day 60 along with recovery of the patient. Applying the ARMS-PCR method to detect Gcf-DNA can be done without knowing the donor information and is not limited by donor-recipient-sex-mismatch condition. In conclusion, Gcf-DNA is a promising biomarker that can monitor graft function in LDLT, and we will apply it in more samples and observe it long term to validate its efficiency in the future.",

METHODS: Data from a clinically diverse PA patient population ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02890342 ) were used to train and test machine learning models, identify PA-relevant biomarkers, and perform validation analysis using data from liver-transplanted participants. k-Means clustering was used to test for the existence of PA subtypes. Expert knowledge was used to define PA subtypes (mild and severe). Given expert classification, supervised machine learning (support vector machine with a polynomial kernel, svmPoly) performed dimensional reduction to define relevant features of each PA subtype. RESULTS: Forty participants enrolled in the study; five underwent liver transplant. Analysis with k-means clustering indicated that several PA subtypes may exist on the biochemical continuum. The conventional PA biomarkers, plasma total 2-methylctirate and propionylcarnitine, were not statistically significantly different between nontransplanted and transplanted participants motivating us to search for other biomarkers. Unbiased dimensional reduction using svmPoly revealed that plasma transthyretin, alanine:serine ratio, GDF15, FGF21, and in vivo 1-13C-propionate oxidation, play roles in defining PA subtypes. CONCLUSION: Support vector machine prioritized biomarkers that helped classify propionic acidemia patients according to severity subtypes, with important ramifications for future clinical trials and management of PA.",

The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.",

We present a retrospective review of patients with PA who underwent LT at a tertiary liver center between 1995 and 2015. A total of 14 children were identified (8 males) with median age at initial presentation of 3 days (range, 0-77 days). Pretransplant median protein restriction was 1 g/kg/day (range, 0.63-1.75 g/kg/day), 71% required supportive feeding, and 86% had developmental delay. Frequent metabolic decompensations (MDs) were the main indication for LT with a median age at transplantation of 2.4 years (range, 0.8-7.1 years). Only 1 graft was from a living donor, and 13 were from deceased donors (4 auxiliary). The 2-year patient survival was 86%, and overall study and graft survival was 79% and 69%, respectively. Three patients died after LT: at 43 days (biliary peritonitis), 225 days (acute-on-chronic rejection with multiorgan failure), and 13.5 years (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease). Plasma glycine and propionylcarnitine remained elevated but reduced after transplant. Of 11 survivors, 5 had at least 1 episode of acute cellular rejection, 2 sustained a metabolic stroke (with full recovery), and 3 developed mild cardiomyopathy after LT. All have liberalized protein intake, and 9 had no further MDs: median episodes before transplant, 4 (range, 1-30); and median episodes after transplant, 0 (range, 0-5). All survivors made some developmental progress after LT, and none worsened at a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 2-23 years). LT in PA significantly reduces the frequency of MDs, can liberalize protein intake and improve quality of life, and should continue to be considered in selected cases.",

An orphan drug benefiting pediatric patients can qualify as a drug for a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) as well. The ODD and RPDD programs provide financial incentives for development of diagnostic drugs, preventive measures, and treatment of diseases affecting small patient populations (adult and pediatric) for which commercial development would otherwise be very challenging. In 2019, a multidisciplinary group of collaborators at National Institutes of Health (NIH) embarked upon a gene therapy platform program called Platform Vector Gene Therapy (PaVe-GT) intended to develop gene therapies for four such rare disorders. An important part of PaVe-GT is to publicly share scientific and regulatory experience gained at different stages during the implementation of the PaVe-GT platform utilizing illustrative examples. The PaVe-GT team recently obtained ODD and RPDD for an adeno-associated virus gene therapy to treat propionic acidemia. Given an increasing interest in obtaining ODD for gene therapy, especially by small companies, research investigators, and patient groups, we overview the submission process and subsequently provide examples of our ODD and RPDD applications. Our ODD and RPDD applications and templates can also be found on the PaVe-GT website. Shared reference documents will have great utility to assist parties who may have limited experience with the preparation of similar applications for their orphan product.",

RECENT FINDINGS: Leu is a key metabolic regulator with a multitude of effects on different organ systems. Recent observational studies have demonstrated that these effects can have unintended consequences in patients with MMA as a result of liberal use of medical foods. The combination of protein restriction and medical food use in MMA and propionic acidemia results in an imbalanced branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) dietary content with a high Leu-to-Val and/or Ile ratio. This leads to decreased plasma levels of Val and Ile and predicts impaired brain uptake of multiple essential amino acids. Decreased transport of methionine (Met) across the blood-brain barrier due to high circulating Leu levels is of particular concern in cblC deficiency in which endogenous Met synthesis is impaired. SUMMARY: Investigations into the optimal composition of medical foods for MMA and propionic acidemia, and potential scenarios in which Leu supplementation may be beneficial are needed. Until then, MMA/propionic acidemia medical foods should be used judiciously in the dietary management of these patients and avoided altogether in cblC deficiency.",

Eleven patients with MMA and four patients with PA were treated and/or followed up in Kumamoto University Hospital between January 2009 and December 2018. Three patients with MMA and one patient with PA developed rhabdomyolysis at 1-2 weeks after onset of metabolic crisis. Cases 1 and 4 initially developed rhabdomyolysis after withdrawal from continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), and cases 2 and 3 developed rhabdomyolysis at the time of onset and had recurrent rhabdomyolysis during the recovery phase after withdrawal from CHDF. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis in patients with MMA and PA may have been attributed to a defect in energy production because of a secondary mitochondrial disorder. Therefore, physicians should closely follow patients with MMA and PA, especially after withdrawal of hemodialysis therapy, and provide supportive care for their mitochondrial function.",

An orphan drug benefiting pediatric patients can qualify as a drug for a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) as well. The ODD and RPDD programs provide financial incentives for development of diagnostic drugs, preventive measures, and treatment of diseases affecting small patient populations (adult and pediatric) for which commercial development would otherwise be very challenging. In 2019, a multidisciplinary group of collaborators at National Institutes of Health (NIH) embarked upon a gene therapy platform program called Platform Vector Gene Therapy (PaVe-GT) intended to develop gene therapies for four such rare disorders. An important part of PaVe-GT is to publicly share scientific and regulatory experience gained at different stages during the implementation of the PaVe-GT platform utilizing illustrative examples. The PaVe-GT team recently obtained ODD and RPDD for an adeno-associated virus gene therapy to treat propionic acidemia. Given an increasing interest in obtaining ODD for gene therapy, especially by small companies, research investigators, and patient groups, we overview the submission process and subsequently provide examples of our ODD and RPDD applications. Our ODD and RPDD applications and templates can also be found on the PaVe-GT website. Shared reference documents will have great utility to assist parties who may have limited experience with the preparation of similar applications for their orphan product.",

Liver transplantation (LT) was thus proposed in PA to increase enzyme activity. We studied retrospectively LT in PA in two European centers. Twelve patients underwent 17 LTs between 1991 and 2013. They developed severe, unusual and unexpected complications, with high mortality (58%). When present, the cardiomyopathy resolved and no acute metabolic decompensation occurred allowing dietary relaxation. Renal failure was present in half of the patients before LT and worsened in all of them. We suggest that cardiac and renal functions should be assessed before LT and monitored closely afterward. A renal sparing immunosuppression should be used. We speculate that some complications may be related to accumulated toxicity of the disease and that earlier LT could prevent some of these consequences. As kidney transplantation has been performed successfully in methylmalonic acidemia, a metabolic disease in the same biochemical pathway, the choice of the organ to transplant could be further discussed.",

Liver transplantation (LT) is required in PA patients when medical treatment fails and may prevent or slow down the cardiomyopathy progression. However, severe heart disease may be a serious contraindication to LT. We present a complicated case of a PA patient, supported with a Left Ventricular Assist Device, who underwent a heart and Liver transplant. PA patients are at increased risk for metabolic acidosis during surgery, with increased anion gap and hyperammonemia. A strict multi-disciplinary approach is needed to prevent and treat metabolic decompensation. The patient had a successful heart and liver transplant after a strict treatment protocol in the pre, intra, and post-operative periods.

The nationwide newborn screening for MMA/PA has been in place in Taiwan from January, 2000 and data was collected until December, 2016. RESULTS: During the study period, 3,155,263 newborns were screened. The overall incidence of MMA mutase type cases was 1/121,356 (n = 26), 1 cobalamin B was detected and that for PA cases (n = 4) was 1/788,816. The time of referral is 8.8 days for MMA patients, and 7.5 days for PA patients. The MMA mutase type patients have higher AST, ALT, and NH3 values as well as a lower pH value (p < 0.05). The mean age for liver transplantation (LT) is 402 days (range from 0.6-6.7 yr) with 16 out of 20 cases (80.0%) using living donors. The mean admission length shortened from 90.6 days/year (pre-LT) to 5.3 days/year (at 3rd year post-LT) (p < 0.0005). Similarly, the tube feeding ratio decreased from 67.8 to 0.50% (p < 0.00005). The anxiety level of the caregiver was reduced from 33.4 to 27.2 after LT (p = 0.001) and the DQ/IQ performance of the patients was improved after LT from 50 to 60.1 (p = 0.07).

The mainstay of disease management is lifelong protein restriction. As an alternative, liver transplantation (LT) may improve survival, quality of life, and prevent further neurological deterioration. The aim of our study was to estimate the incremental costs and outcomes of LT versus nutritional support in patients with early-onset MMA or PA. We constructed a Markov model to simulate and compare life expectancies, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime direct and indirect costs for a cohort of newborns with MMA or PA who could either receive LT or be maintained on conventional nutritional support. We conducted a series of 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base case, LT on average resulted in 1.5 more life years lived, 7.9 more QALYs, and a savings of $582,369 for lifetime societal cost per individual compared to nutritional support. LT remained more effective and less costly in all 1-way sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, LT was cost-effective at the $100,000/QALY threshold in more than 90% of the simulations and cost-saving in over half of the simulations. LT is likely a dominant treatment strategy compared to nutritional support in newborns with classical MMA or PA.",

Unfortunately, these disorders continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality due to acute and chronic systemic and end-organ injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary management with medical foods has been a mainstay of therapy for decades, yet well controlled patients can manifest growth, development, cardiac, ophthalmological, renal, and neurological complications. Patients with organic acidopathies suffer metabolic brain injury that targets specific regions of the basal ganglia in a distinctive pattern, and these injuries may occur even with optimal management during metabolic stress. Liver transplantation has improved quality of life and metabolic stability, yet transplantation in this population does not entirely prevent brain injury or the development of optic neuropathy and cardiac disease. SUMMARY: Management guidelines should identify necessary screening for patients with methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia, and improve anticipatory management of progressive end-organ disease. Liver transplantation improves overall metabolic control, but injury to nonregenerative tissues may not be mitigated. Continued use of medical foods in these patients requires prospective studies to demonstrate evidence of benefit in a controlled manner.",

Here we present one institution's 27 years of experience with LT in IEMs. Our objective is to assess the outcomes of IEM patients who have undergone LT, which we hypothesize to be generally successful for prevention of metabolic decompensation. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, and amino acidopathies who underwent LT at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-five patients with the following conditions have undergone LT: tyrosinemia (8), methylmalonic acidemia (7), maple syrup urine disease (6), citrullinemia (6), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (4), propionic acidemia (2), and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (2). Average age at transplantation was 3.6 years. Three patients are now deceased. One patient suffered a metabolic stroke posttransplant. No episodes of metabolic decompensation have been noted. Thirty-five patients received LT with generally favorable outcome. None sustained metabolic decompensation posttransplant. As has been reported previously, LT does not ameliorate pre-existing developmental differences or risk to other organ systems. Further research is needed to aid in standardization of care and follow-up, as most patients no longer follow with a geneticist.",

This review aims to provide a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of posttransplant clinical outcomes in PA patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies focusing on PA patients who underwent LT. The pooled estimate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 70 individuals were included. The pooled estimate rates were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for patient survival and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for allograft survival. The pooled estimate rates were 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.39) for rejection, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.00-0.21) for hepatic artery thrombosis, 0.14 (95% CI, 0.00-0.37) for cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection, and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.15) for biliary complications. The pooled estimate rates were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for metabolic stability, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) for reversal of preexisting cardiomyopathy, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for improvement of neurodevelopmental delay. A large proportion of patients achieved liberalization of protein intake posttransplant (pooled estimate rate 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of transplant-related complications, LT is a viable therapeutic option in PA patients with satisfactory survival rates and clinical outcomes. Given the diversity in neurological assessment methods and the inconsistency in the achievement of dietary protein liberalization across different studies, consensus on neurological evaluation methods and posttransplant protein intake is necessary. Longer-term clinical outcomes of LT for PA warrants further investigation.",

In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver-kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver-kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)].

CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver-kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Organic acidemias, especially propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), may manifest clinically within the first few hours to days of life. The classic presentation in the newborn period includes metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia that is precipitated by unrestricted protein intake. Implementation of newborn screening to diagnose and initiate early treatment has facilitated a reduction in neonatal mortality and improved survival. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate management, these individuals are prone to have recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a treatment modality to reduce metabolic decompensations which are not controlled by medical management. Published reports on the outcome of LT show heterogeneous results regarding clinical and biochemical features in the post transplantation period. As a result, we evaluated the outcomes of LT in our institution and compared it to the previously published data. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of nine individuals with PA or MMA who underwent LT and two individuals with MMA who underwent LT and kidney transplantation (KT). Data including number of hospitalizations, laboratory measures, cardiac and neurological outcomes, dietary protein intake, and growth parameters were collected. RESULTS: The median age of transplantation for subjects with MMA was 7.2 years with a median follow up of 4.3 years. The median age of transplantation for subjects with PA was 1.9 years with a median follow up of 5.4 years. The survival rate at 1 year and 5 years post-LT was 100%. Most of our subjects did not have any episodes of hyperammonemia or pancreatitis post-LT. There was significant reduction in plasma glycine post-LT. One subject developed mild elevation in ammonia post-LT on an unrestricted protein diet, suggesting that protein restriction may be indicated even after LT. CONCLUSION: In a large single center study of LT in MMA and PA, we show that LT may reduce the incidence of metabolic decompensation. Moreover, our data suggest that LT may be associated with reduced number of hospitalizations and improved linear growth in individuals with PA and MMA.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting from deficiency in the enzyme necessary for catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, some odd chain fatty acids and cholesterol. Despite optimal medical management, PA often leads to acute and progressive neurological injury. Reports on liver transplantation (LT) as a cellular therapy are limited and varied. The objective of this study was to examine the largest collection of patients who underwent LT for PA. METHODS: Examining the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Pediatric Health Information System administrative billing databases, we performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of LT over a 16-year period. During this period, 4849 pediatric LT were performed out of which 23 were done for PA at 10 different centers. RESULTS: The majority of recipients were 5 years of age or younger and had status 1b exception points at the time of transplant. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival for PA LT recipients was 84.6% and the 1-, 3, and 5-year patient survival was 89.5%. There was no significant difference in graft or patient survival between PA and non-PA LT recipients. Despite historical data to the contrary, we did not find an increased incidence of hepatic arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing LT for PA. Patients in the PA LT group, however, had a significantly higher postoperative rate of readmission compared with the non-PA LT group (90.5% vs 72.8%, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: LT for children with PA is a viable treatment option with acceptable outcomes.",

The nationwide newborn screening for MMA/PA has been in place in Taiwan from January, 2000 and data was collected until December, 2016. RESULTS: During the study period, 3,155,263 newborns were screened. The overall incidence of MMA mutase type cases was 1/121,356 (n = 26), 1 cobalamin B was detected and that for PA cases (n = 4) was 1/788,816. The time of referral is 8.8 days for MMA patients, and 7.5 days for PA patients. The MMA mutase type patients have higher AST, ALT, and NH3 values as well as a lower pH value (p < 0.05). The mean age for liver transplantation (LT) is 402 days (range from 0.6-6.7 yr) with 16 out of 20 cases (80.0%) using living donors. The mean admission length shortened from 90.6 days/year (pre-LT) to 5.3 days/year (at 3rd year post-LT) (p < 0.0005). Similarly, the tube feeding ratio decreased from 67.8 to 0.50% (p < 0.00005). The anxiety level of the caregiver was reduced from 33.4 to 27.2 after LT (p = 0.001) and the DQ/IQ performance of the patients was improved after LT from 50 to 60.1 (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: MMA/PA patients with LT do survive and have reduced admission time, reduced tube feeding and the caregiver is less anxious.",

Unfortunately, these disorders continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality due to acute and chronic systemic and end-organ injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary management with medical foods has been a mainstay of therapy for decades, yet well controlled patients can manifest growth, development, cardiac, ophthalmological, renal, and neurological complications. Patients with organic acidopathies suffer metabolic brain injury that targets specific regions of the basal ganglia in a distinctive pattern, and these injuries may occur even with optimal management during metabolic stress. Liver transplantation has improved quality of life and metabolic stability, yet transplantation in this population does not entirely prevent brain injury or the development of optic neuropathy and cardiac disease. SUMMARY: Management guidelines should identify necessary screening for patients with methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia, and improve anticipatory management of progressive end-organ disease. Liver transplantation improves overall metabolic control, but injury to nonregenerative tissues may not be mitigated. Continued use of medical foods in these patients requires prospective studies to demonstrate evidence of benefit in a controlled manner.",

We aim to report our experience with liver transplantation (LT) in the management of PA patients. Six patients with PA received a LT at a mean age of 5.2 years (1.3-7.5 years). The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in the first 4 patients and preventative in the last 2 patients. Two patients presented hepatic artery thromboses that were solved through an interventional radiologist approach. These patients showed a very high procoagulant state that was observed by thromboelastography. Arterial vasospasm without thrombus was observed in 2 patients during the LT surgery. In order to avoid hepatic artery thrombosis, an arterial conduit from the recipient aorta to the hepatic artery of the donor was used in the fifth patient. After LT, patients presented improvement in propionyl byproducts without complete normalization, but no decompensations have been observed. In conclusion, LT could be a good therapeutic option to improve the metabolic control and the quality of life of PA patients. Improved surgical strategies along with new techniques of interventional radiology allow us to perform the LT minimizing the complications derived from the higher risk of hepatic artery thrombosis.",

Here we present one institution's 27 years of experience with LT in IEMs. Our objective is to assess the outcomes of IEM patients who have undergone LT, which we hypothesize to be generally successful for prevention of metabolic decompensation. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, and amino acidopathies who underwent LT at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-five patients with the following conditions have undergone LT: tyrosinemia (8), methylmalonic acidemia (7), maple syrup urine disease (6), citrullinemia (6), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (4), propionic acidemia (2), and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (2). Average age at transplantation was 3.6 years. Three patients are now deceased. One patient suffered a metabolic stroke posttransplant. No episodes of metabolic decompensation have been noted. Thirty-five patients received LT with generally favorable outcome. None sustained metabolic decompensation posttransplant. As has been reported previously, LT does not ameliorate pre-existing developmental differences or risk to other organ systems. Further research is needed to aid in standardization of care and follow-up, as most patients no longer follow with a geneticist.",

We present a retrospective review of patients with PA who underwent LT at a tertiary liver center between 1995 and 2015. A total of 14 children were identified (8 males) with median age at initial presentation of 3 days (range, 0-77 days). Pretransplant median protein restriction was 1 g/kg/day (range, 0.63-1.75 g/kg/day), 71% required supportive feeding, and 86% had developmental delay. Frequent metabolic decompensations (MDs) were the main indication for LT with a median age at transplantation of 2.4 years (range, 0.8-7.1 years). Only 1 graft was from a living donor, and 13 were from deceased donors (4 auxiliary). The 2-year patient survival was 86%, and overall study and graft survival was 79% and 69%, respectively. Three patients died after LT: at 43 days (biliary peritonitis), 225 days (acute-on-chronic rejection with multiorgan failure), and 13.5 years (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease). Plasma glycine and propionylcarnitine remained elevated but reduced after transplant. Of 11 survivors, 5 had at least 1 episode of acute cellular rejection, 2 sustained a metabolic stroke (with full recovery), and 3 developed mild cardiomyopathy after LT. All have liberalized protein intake, and 9 had no further MDs: median episodes before transplant, 4 (range, 1-30); and median episodes after transplant, 0 (range, 0-5). All survivors made some developmental progress after LT, and none worsened at a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 2-23 years). LT in PA significantly reduces the frequency of MDs, can liberalize protein intake and improve quality of life, and should continue to be considered in selected cases.",

METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of posttransplant clinical outcomes in PA patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies focusing on PA patients who underwent LT. The pooled estimate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 70 individuals were included. The pooled estimate rates were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for patient survival and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for allograft survival. The pooled estimate rates were 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.39) for rejection, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.00-0.21) for hepatic artery thrombosis, 0.14 (95% CI, 0.00-0.37) for cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection, and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.15) for biliary complications. The pooled estimate rates were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for metabolic stability, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) for reversal of preexisting cardiomyopathy, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for improvement of neurodevelopmental delay. A large proportion of patients achieved liberalization of protein intake posttransplant (pooled estimate rate 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of transplant-related complications, LT is a viable therapeutic option in PA patients with satisfactory survival rates and clinical outcomes. Given the diversity in neurological assessment methods and the inconsistency in the achievement of dietary protein liberalization across different studies, consensus on neurological evaluation methods and posttransplant protein intake is necessary. Longer-term clinical outcomes of LT for PA warrants further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is recognised as a treatment option for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) and those with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) without renal impairment. In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver-kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver-kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver-kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.",

This review aims to provide a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of posttransplant clinical outcomes in PA patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies focusing on PA patients who underwent LT. The pooled estimate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 70 individuals were included. The pooled estimate rates were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for patient survival and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for allograft survival. The pooled estimate rates were 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.39) for rejection, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.00-0.21) for hepatic artery thrombosis, 0.14 (95% CI, 0.00-0.37) for cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection, and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.15) for biliary complications. The pooled estimate rates were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for metabolic stability, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) for reversal of preexisting cardiomyopathy, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for improvement of neurodevelopmental delay. A large proportion of patients achieved liberalization of protein intake posttransplant (pooled estimate rate 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of transplant-related complications, LT is a viable therapeutic option in PA patients with satisfactory survival rates and clinical outcomes. Given the diversity in neurological assessment methods and the inconsistency in the achievement of dietary protein liberalization across different studies, consensus on neurological evaluation methods and posttransplant protein intake is necessary. Longer-term clinical outcomes of LT for PA warrants further investigation.",

Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a bulk enzyme-replacement strategy to stabilize metabolically fragile patients, it is not a metabolic cure because patients remain at risk for disease-related complications. We retrospectively studied LT and/or liver-kidney transplant in 9 patients with PA or MMA with additional focus on the optimization of metabolic control and management in the perioperative period. Metabolic crises were common before transplant. By implementing a strategy of carbohydrate minimization with gradual but early lipid and protein introduction, lactate levels significantly improved over the perioperative period (P < 0.001). Posttransplant metabolic improvement is demonstrated by improvements in serum glycine levels (for PA; P < 0.001 x 10-14 ), methylmalonic acid levels (for MMA; P < 0.001), and ammonia levels (for PA and MMA; P < 0.001). Dietary restriction remained after transplant. However, no further metabolic crises have occurred. Other disease-specific comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy stabilized and improved. In conclusion, transplant can provide a strategy for altering the natural history of PA and MMA providing stability to a rare but metabolically brittle population. Nutritional management is critical to optimize patient outcomes.",

The nationwide newborn screening for MMA/PA has been in place in Taiwan from January, 2000 and data was collected until December, 2016. RESULTS: During the study period, 3,155,263 newborns were screened. The overall incidence of MMA mutase type cases was 1/121,356 (n = 26), 1 cobalamin B was detected and that for PA cases (n = 4) was 1/788,816. The time of referral is 8.8 days for MMA patients, and 7.5 days for PA patients. The MMA mutase type patients have higher AST, ALT, and NH3 values as well as a lower pH value (p < 0.05). The mean age for liver transplantation (LT) is 402 days (range from 0.6-6.7 yr) with 16 out of 20 cases (80.0%) using living donors. The mean admission length shortened from 90.6 days/year (pre-LT) to 5.3 days/year (at 3rd year post-LT) (p < 0.0005). Similarly, the tube feeding ratio decreased from 67.8 to 0.50% (p < 0.00005). The anxiety level of the caregiver was reduced from 33.4 to 27.2 after LT (p = 0.001) and the DQ/IQ performance of the patients was improved after LT from 50 to 60.1 (p = 0.07).

Unfortunately, these disorders continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality due to acute and chronic systemic and end-organ injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary management with medical foods has been a mainstay of therapy for decades, yet well controlled patients can manifest growth, development, cardiac, ophthalmological, renal, and neurological complications. Patients with organic acidopathies suffer metabolic brain injury that targets specific regions of the basal ganglia in a distinctive pattern, and these injuries may occur even with optimal management during metabolic stress. Liver transplantation has improved quality of life and metabolic stability, yet transplantation in this population does not entirely prevent brain injury or the development of optic neuropathy and cardiac disease. SUMMARY: Management guidelines should identify necessary screening for patients with methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia, and improve anticipatory management of progressive end-organ disease. Liver transplantation improves overall metabolic control, but injury to nonregenerative tissues may not be mitigated. Continued use of medical foods in these patients requires prospective studies to demonstrate evidence of benefit in a controlled manner.",

Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a bulk enzyme-replacement strategy to stabilize metabolically fragile patients, it is not a metabolic cure because patients remain at risk for disease-related complications. We retrospectively studied LT and/or liver-kidney transplant in 9 patients with PA or MMA with additional focus on the optimization of metabolic control and management in the perioperative period. Metabolic crises were common before transplant. By implementing a strategy of carbohydrate minimization with gradual but early lipid and protein introduction, lactate levels significantly improved over the perioperative period (P < 0.001). Posttransplant metabolic improvement is demonstrated by improvements in serum glycine levels (for PA; P < 0.001 x 10-14 ), methylmalonic acid levels (for MMA; P < 0.001), and ammonia levels (for PA and MMA; P < 0.001). Dietary restriction remained after transplant. However, no further metabolic crises have occurred. Other disease-specific comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy stabilized and improved. In conclusion, transplant can provide a strategy for altering the natural history of PA and MMA providing stability to a rare but metabolically brittle population. Nutritional management is critical to optimize patient outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The worldwide experience of liver transplantation (LT) in the treatment of propionic acidemia (PA) remains limited and fragmented. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of posttransplant clinical outcomes in PA patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies focusing on PA patients who underwent LT. The pooled estimate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 70 individuals were included. The pooled estimate rates were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for patient survival and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for allograft survival. The pooled estimate rates were 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.39) for rejection, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.00-0.21) for hepatic artery thrombosis, 0.14 (95% CI, 0.00-0.37) for cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection, and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.15) for biliary complications. The pooled estimate rates were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for metabolic stability, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) for reversal of preexisting cardiomyopathy, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for improvement of neurodevelopmental delay. A large proportion of patients achieved liberalization of protein intake posttransplant (pooled estimate rate 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of transplant-related complications, LT is a viable therapeutic option in PA patients with satisfactory survival rates and clinical outcomes. Given the diversity in neurological assessment methods and the inconsistency in the achievement of dietary protein liberalization across different studies, consensus on neurological evaluation methods and posttransplant protein intake is necessary. Longer-term clinical outcomes of LT for PA warrants further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Novel messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapies, currently in development, are emerging as a promising potential treatment modality for a broad range of life-threatening and life-limiting inherited liver diseases, including methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA). However, owing in part to their complexity, they are likely to come at considerable financial cost to healthcare systems. The objective of this research was to synthesize available evidence on the costs and clinical consequences associated with MMA and PA for the purpose of exploratory economic evaluation of novel mRNA-based therapies using an early cost-utility model from the United Kingdom payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the costs and outcomes associated with novel mRNA therapies, compared with a combination of dietary management and organ transplantation (standard of care) among hypothetical cohorts of new-born patients with MMA and PA. Key model drivers were identified, and a price threshold analysis was performed to estimate value-based price ranges for future mRNA therapies given willingness-to-pay thresholds for orphan diseases. RESULTS: mRNA therapy was associated with an additional 5.7 and 1.3 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient lifetime among patients with MMA and PA, respectively. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were relative improvement in utility among patients who receive mRNA-based therapy and transplantation, and the cost of mRNA therapy. Assuming a willingness to pay range of $100,000-$300,000 per QALY gained, the model demonstrated mRNA therapy to be cost-effective in MMA and PA at an annual treatment cost of $70,452-$94,575 and $31,313-$36,695, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of a strong evidence base in MMA and PA, this model provides a useful tool to estimate the cost-effectiveness, and inform value-based pricing, of new mRNA-based therapies. Our analyses also identified areas for research that will have the greatest value in reducing uncertainty in future health economic evaluations of such treatments.",
