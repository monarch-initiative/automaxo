29035969	Effects of medical food leucine content in the management of methylmalonic and propionic acidemias.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review highlights the varied effects of medical foods high in leucine (Leu) and devoid of valine (Val) and isoleucine (Ile) in the management of methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia and cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency, aiming to advance dietary practices. RECENT FINDINGS: Leu is a key metabolic regulator with a multitude of effects on different organ systems. Recent observational studies have demonstrated that these effects can have unintended consequences in patients with MMA as a result of liberal use of medical foods. The combination of protein restriction and medical food use in MMA and propionic acidemia results in an imbalanced branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) dietary content with a high Leu-to-Val and/or Ile ratio. This leads to decreased plasma levels of Val and Ile and predicts impaired brain uptake of multiple essential amino acids. Decreased transport of methionine (Met) across the blood-brain barrier due to high circulating Leu levels is of particular concern in cblC deficiency in which endogenous Met synthesis is impaired. SUMMARY: Investigations into the optimal composition of medical foods for MMA and propionic acidemia, and potential scenarios in which Leu supplementation may be beneficial are needed. Until then, MMA/propionic acidemia medical foods should be used judiciously in the dietary management of these patients and avoided altogether in cblC deficiency.
26358860	Reversal of cardiomyopathy in propionic acidemia after liver transplantation: a 10-year follow-up.	Cardiomyopathy is a frequent complication in propionic acidemia. It is mostly rapidly fatal and independent of the metabolic control or medical intervention. Here, we present the reversal of a severe cardiomyopathy after liver transplantation in a patient with propionic acidemia and the long-term stability after ten years. Liver transplantation in patients with propionic acidemia may be considered a valid and long-lasting treatment when cardiomyopathy is progressive and unresponsive to medical therapy. 
33451859	High protein prescription in methylmalonic and propionic acidemia patients and its negative association with long-term outcome.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) are inborn errors of metabolism. While survival of MMA and PA patients has improved in recent decades, long-term outcome is still unsatisfactory. A protein restricted diet is the mainstay for treatment. Additional amino acid mixtures (AAM) can be prescribed if natural protein is insufficient. It is unknown if dietary treatment can have an impact on outcome. DESIGN: We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study and evaluated both longitudinal dietary treatment and clinical course of Dutch MMA and PA patients. Protein prescription was compared to the recommended daily allowances (RDA); the safe level of protein intake as provided by the World Health Organization. The association of longitudinal dietary treatment with long-term outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: The cohort included 76 patients with a median retrospective follow-up period of 15 years (min-max: 0-48 years) and a total of 1063 patient years on a protein restricted diet. Natural protein prescription exceeded the RDA in 37% (470/1287) of all prescriptions and due to AAM prescription, the total protein prescription exceeded RDA in 84% (1070/1277). Higher protein prescriptions were associated with adverse outcomes in severely affected patients. In PA early onset patients a higher natural protein prescription was associated with more frequent AMD. In MMA vitamin B12 unresponsive patients, both a higher total protein prescription and AAM protein prescription were associated with more mitochondrial complications. A higher AAM protein prescription was associated with an increased frequency of cognitive impairment in the entire. CONCLUSION: Protein intake in excess of recommendations is frequent and is associated with poor outcome.
35068050	Inborn error of metabolism patients after liver transplantation: Outcomes of 35 patients over 27 years in one pediatric quaternary hospital.	Liver transplantation (LT) has been used for many years as a therapeutic option for certain inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Here we present one institution's 27 years of experience with LT in IEMs. Our objective is to assess the outcomes of IEM patients who have undergone LT, which we hypothesize to be generally successful for prevention of metabolic decompensation. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with urea cycle defects, organic acidemias, and amino acidopathies who underwent LT at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Thirty-five patients with the following conditions have undergone LT: tyrosinemia (8), methylmalonic acidemia (7), maple syrup urine disease (6), citrullinemia (6), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (4), propionic acidemia (2), and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (2). Average age at transplantation was 3.6 years. Three patients are now deceased. One patient suffered a metabolic stroke posttransplant. No episodes of metabolic decompensation have been noted. Thirty-five patients received LT with generally favorable outcome. None sustained metabolic decompensation posttransplant. As has been reported previously, LT does not ameliorate pre-existing developmental differences or risk to other organ systems. Further research is needed to aid in standardization of care and follow-up, as most patients no longer follow with a geneticist.
38796677	An Early Cost-Utility Model of mRNA-Based Therapies for the Treatment of Methylmalonic and Propionic Acidemia in the United Kingdom.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Novel messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapies, currently in development, are emerging as a promising potential treatment modality for a broad range of life-threatening and life-limiting inherited liver diseases, including methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA). However, owing in part to their complexity, they are likely to come at considerable financial cost to healthcare systems. The objective of this research was to synthesize available evidence on the costs and clinical consequences associated with MMA and PA for the purpose of exploratory economic evaluation of novel mRNA-based therapies using an early cost-utility model from the United Kingdom payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the costs and outcomes associated with novel mRNA therapies, compared with a combination of dietary management and organ transplantation (standard of care) among hypothetical cohorts of new-born patients with MMA and PA. Key model drivers were identified, and a price threshold analysis was performed to estimate value-based price ranges for future mRNA therapies given willingness-to-pay thresholds for orphan diseases. RESULTS: mRNA therapy was associated with an additional 5.7 and 1.3 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient lifetime among patients with MMA and PA, respectively. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were relative improvement in utility among patients who receive mRNA-based therapy and transplantation, and the cost of mRNA therapy. Assuming a willingness to pay range of $100,000-$300,000 per QALY gained, the model demonstrated mRNA therapy to be cost-effective in MMA and PA at an annual treatment cost of $70,452-$94,575 and $31,313-$36,695, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of a strong evidence base in MMA and PA, this model provides a useful tool to estimate the cost-effectiveness, and inform value-based pricing, of new mRNA-based therapies. Our analyses also identified areas for research that will have the greatest value in reducing uncertainty in future health economic evaluations of such treatments.
31757659	Liver transplantation in propionic and methylmalonic acidemia: A single center study with literature review.	BACKGROUND: Organic acidemias, especially propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), may manifest clinically within the first few hours to days of life. The classic presentation in the newborn period includes metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia that is precipitated by unrestricted protein intake. Implementation of newborn screening to diagnose and initiate early treatment has facilitated a reduction in neonatal mortality and improved survival. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate management, these individuals are prone to have recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia resulting in frequent hospitalizations. Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a treatment modality to reduce metabolic decompensations which are not controlled by medical management. Published reports on the outcome of LT show heterogeneous results regarding clinical and biochemical features in the post transplantation period. As a result, we evaluated the outcomes of LT in our institution and compared it to the previously published data. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of nine individuals with PA or MMA who underwent LT and two individuals with MMA who underwent LT and kidney transplantation (KT). Data including number of hospitalizations, laboratory measures, cardiac and neurological outcomes, dietary protein intake, and growth parameters were collected. RESULTS: The median age of transplantation for subjects with MMA was 7.2 years with a median follow up of 4.3 years. The median age of transplantation for subjects with PA was 1.9 years with a median follow up of 5.4 years. The survival rate at 1 year and 5 years post-LT was 100%. Most of our subjects did not have any episodes of hyperammonemia or pancreatitis post-LT. There was significant reduction in plasma glycine post-LT. One subject developed mild elevation in ammonia post-LT on an unrestricted protein diet, suggesting that protein restriction may be indicated even after LT. CONCLUSION: In a large single center study of LT in MMA and PA, we show that LT may reduce the incidence of metabolic decompensation. Moreover, our data suggest that LT may be associated with reduced number of hospitalizations and improved linear growth in individuals with PA and MMA.
33183246	Propionic acidemia identified in twin siblings conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) with parents who were unknown carriers of a PCCA mutation.	BACKGROUND: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a severe monogenic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) enzyme, which is caused by mutations in the PCCA or PCCB gene. Preconception carrier screening could provide couples with meaningful information for their reproductive options; however, it is not widely performed in China. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes a case of dizygotic twin siblings conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and diagnosed with propionic acidemia (PA). Their parents had no history of PA. Tandem mass spectrometry and urine gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the twin siblings revealed markedly elevated propionyl carnitine (C3), C3/C2, and 3-hydroxypropionate in the plasma and urine. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for the twin siblings. A homozygous missense mutation, c.2002G > A (p.Gly668Arg) in PCCA, was identified in the twin siblings. Sanger sequencing confirmed the homozygous mutation in the twin siblings and identified their parents as heterozygous carriers of the c.2002G > A mutation in PCCA. Both neonates in this case died. This is an emotionally and financially devastating outcome that could have been avoided with genetic carrier screening before conception. If couples are screened before IVF and found to be silent carriers, then reproductive options (such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis) can be offered to achieve a healthy newborn. CONCLUSION: This case is a reminder to infertile couples seeking IVF that it is beneficial to clarify whether they are silent carriers before undergoing IVF.
30037889	Metabolic cardiomyopathy from propionic acidemia precipitating cardiac arrest in a 25-year-old man.	
31715057	Liver Transplantation in Children With Propionic Acidemia: Medium-Term Outcomes.	Liver transplantation (LT) for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) is an emerging therapeutic option. We present a retrospective review of patients with PA who underwent LT at a tertiary liver center between 1995 and 2015. A total of 14 children were identified (8 males) with median age at initial presentation of 3 days (range, 0-77 days). Pretransplant median protein restriction was 1 g/kg/day (range, 0.63-1.75 g/kg/day), 71% required supportive feeding, and 86% had developmental delay. Frequent metabolic decompensations (MDs) were the main indication for LT with a median age at transplantation of 2.4 years (range, 0.8-7.1 years). Only 1 graft was from a living donor, and 13 were from deceased donors (4 auxiliary). The 2-year patient survival was 86%, and overall study and graft survival was 79% and 69%, respectively. Three patients died after LT: at 43 days (biliary peritonitis), 225 days (acute-on-chronic rejection with multiorgan failure), and 13.5 years (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease). Plasma glycine and propionylcarnitine remained elevated but reduced after transplant. Of 11 survivors, 5 had at least 1 episode of acute cellular rejection, 2 sustained a metabolic stroke (with full recovery), and 3 developed mild cardiomyopathy after LT. All have liberalized protein intake, and 9 had no further MDs: median episodes before transplant, 4 (range, 1-30); and median episodes after transplant, 0 (range, 0-5). All survivors made some developmental progress after LT, and none worsened at a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 2-23 years). LT in PA significantly reduces the frequency of MDs, can liberalize protein intake and improve quality of life, and should continue to be considered in selected cases.
27653704	Methylmalonic and propionic acidemias: clinical management update.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent clinical studies and management guidelines for the treatment of the organic acidopathies methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia address the scope of interventions to maximize health and quality of life. Unfortunately, these disorders continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality due to acute and chronic systemic and end-organ injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary management with medical foods has been a mainstay of therapy for decades, yet well controlled patients can manifest growth, development, cardiac, ophthalmological, renal, and neurological complications. Patients with organic acidopathies suffer metabolic brain injury that targets specific regions of the basal ganglia in a distinctive pattern, and these injuries may occur even with optimal management during metabolic stress. Liver transplantation has improved quality of life and metabolic stability, yet transplantation in this population does not entirely prevent brain injury or the development of optic neuropathy and cardiac disease. SUMMARY: Management guidelines should identify necessary screening for patients with methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia, and improve anticipatory management of progressive end-organ disease. Liver transplantation improves overall metabolic control, but injury to nonregenerative tissues may not be mitigated. Continued use of medical foods in these patients requires prospective studies to demonstrate evidence of benefit in a controlled manner.
30375139	The Role of Liver Transplantation in Propionic Acidemia.	
25683683	Early and late complications after liver transplantation for propionic acidemia in children: a two centers study.	Propionic acidemia (PA) is a severe metabolic disorder with cardiac and neurologic complications and a poor quality of life. Liver transplantation (LT) was thus proposed in PA to increase enzyme activity. We studied retrospectively LT in PA in two European centers. Twelve patients underwent 17 LTs between 1991 and 2013. They developed severe, unusual and unexpected complications, with high mortality (58%). When present, the cardiomyopathy resolved and no acute metabolic decompensation occurred allowing dietary relaxation. Renal failure was present in half of the patients before LT and worsened in all of them. We suggest that cardiac and renal functions should be assessed before LT and monitored closely afterward. A renal sparing immunosuppression should be used. We speculate that some complications may be related to accumulated toxicity of the disease and that earlier LT could prevent some of these consequences. As kidney transplantation has been performed successfully in methylmalonic acidemia, a metabolic disease in the same biochemical pathway, the choice of the organ to transplant could be further discussed.
31476111	Rhabdomyolysis in organic acidemia patients manifesting with metabolic decompensation.	Several metabolic disorders are related to rhabdomyolysis, but their association with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) is unclear. Eleven patients with MMA and four patients with PA were treated and/or followed up in Kumamoto University Hospital between January 2009 and December 2018. Three patients with MMA and one patient with PA developed rhabdomyolysis at 1-2 weeks after onset of metabolic crisis. Cases 1 and 4 initially developed rhabdomyolysis after withdrawal from continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), and cases 2 and 3 developed rhabdomyolysis at the time of onset and had recurrent rhabdomyolysis during the recovery phase after withdrawal from CHDF. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis in patients with MMA and PA may have been attributed to a defect in energy production because of a secondary mitochondrial disorder. Therefore, physicians should closely follow patients with MMA and PA, especially after withdrawal of hemodialysis therapy, and provide supportive care for their mitochondrial function.
30940196	Methylmalonic acidemia/propionic acidemia - the biochemical presentation and comparing the outcome between liver transplantation versus non-liver transplantation groups.	BACKGROUND: Most patients with isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) /propionic acidemia (PA) presenting during the neonatal period with acute metabolic distress are at risk for death and significant neurodevelopmental disability. The nationwide newborn screening for MMA/PA has been in place in Taiwan from January, 2000 and data was collected until December, 2016. RESULTS: During the study period, 3,155,263 newborns were screened. The overall incidence of MMA mutase type cases was 1/121,356 (n = 26), 1 cobalamin B was detected and that for PA cases (n = 4) was 1/788,816. The time of referral is 8.8 days for MMA patients, and 7.5 days for PA patients. The MMA mutase type patients have higher AST, ALT, and NH3 values as well as a lower pH value (p < 0.05). The mean age for liver transplantation (LT) is 402 days (range from 0.6-6.7 yr) with 16 out of 20 cases (80.0%) using living donors. The mean admission length shortened from 90.6 days/year (pre-LT) to 5.3 days/year (at 3rd year post-LT) (p < 0.0005). Similarly, the tube feeding ratio decreased from 67.8 to 0.50% (p < 0.00005). The anxiety level of the caregiver was reduced from 33.4 to 27.2 after LT (p = 0.001) and the DQ/IQ performance of the patients was improved after LT from 50 to 60.1 (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: MMA/PA patients with LT do survive and have reduced admission time, reduced tube feeding and the caregiver is less anxious.
28774709	Treatment with antioxidants ameliorates oxidative damage in a mouse model of propionic acidemia.	Oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of propionic acidemia (PA), a life threatening disease caused by the deficiency of propionyl CoA-carboxylase, in the catabolic pathway of branched-chain amino acids, odd-number chain fatty acids and cholesterol. Patients develop multisystemic complications including seizures, extrapyramidal symptoms, basal ganglia deterioration, pancreatitis and cardiomyopathy. The accumulation of toxic metabolites results in mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage, all of which have been documented in patients' samples and in a hypomorphic mouse model. Here we set out to investigate whether treatment with a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, or with the natural polyphenol resveratrol, which is reported to have antioxidant and mitochondrial activation properties, could ameliorate the altered redox status and its functional consequences in the PA mouse model. The results show that oral treatment with MitoQ or resveratrol decreases lipid peroxidation and the expression levels of DNA repair enzyme OGG1 in PA mouse liver, as well as inducing tissue-specific changes in the expression of antioxidant enzymes. Notably, treatment decreased the cardiac hypertrophy marker BNP that is found upregulated in the PA mouse heart. Overall, the results provide in vivo evidence to justify more in depth investigations of antioxidants as adjuvant therapy in PA.
37658594	Domino liver transplantation for maple syrup urine disease in children: A single-center case series.	BACKGROUND: Domino liver transplant (DLT) represents another type of liver donor to expand the donor pool. Recent reports of successful DLT in children with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) show promising long-term outcomes. METHODS: It was a retrospective study. All children with MSUD were paired with either recipients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or non-MSUD metabolic disease. Each pair underwent simultaneous liver transplant (LT), where the MSUD recipient received the graft from a living-related donor and the liver explanted from the MSUD donor was transplanted to the respective paired domino recipient. We report our experience regarding the techniques and outcomes of DLT at our center. RESULTS: Eleven children with MSUD and 12 respective DLT recipients were enrolled, one of which was domino split-liver transplantation. DLT recipients included seven ESLD, two propionic acidemia (PA), one glycogen storage disease(GSD) type-1, one GSD type-3, and one Citrullinemia. Post-LT ICU and hospital stays were comparable (p > .05). Patient and graft survival was 100% and 66.6% in the MSUD group and DLT recipients at a mean follow-up of 13.5 and 15 months. There was no death in the MSUD group as compared to four in the DLT group. The amino acid levels rapidly normalized after the LT in the children with MSUD and they tolerated the normal unrestricted diet. No vascular, biliary, or graft-related complications were seen in the post-transplant period. No occurrence of MSUD was noted in DLT recipients. CONCLUSION: DLTs have excellent post-surgical outcomes. DLT should be strongly considered and adopted by transplant programs worldwide to circumvent organ shortage.
25654275	Long-term sex-biased correction of circulating propionic acidemia disease markers by adeno-associated virus vectors.	Propionic academia (PA) occurs because of mutations in the PCCA or PCCB genes encoding the two subunits of propionyl-CoA carboxylase, a pivotal enzyme in the breakdown of certain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. There is no cure for PA, but dietary protein restriction and liver transplantation can attenuate its symptoms. We show here that a single intravenous injection of adeno-associated virus 2/8 (AAV8) or AAVrh10 expressing PCCA into PA hypomorphic mice decreased systemic propionylcarnitine and methyl citrate for up to 1.5 years. However, long-term phenotypic correction was always better in male mice. AAV-mediated PCCA expression was similar in most tissues in males and females at early time points and differed only in the liver. Over 1.5 years, luciferase and PCCA expression remained elevated in cardiac tissue for both sexes. In contrast, transgene expression in the liver and skeletal muscles of female, but not male, mice waned:suggesting that these tissues were major sinks for systemic phenotypic correction. These data indicate that single systemic intravenous therapy by AAV vectors can mediate long-term phenotype correction for PA. However, tissue-specific loss of expression in females reduces efficacy when compared with males. Whether similar sex-biased AAV effects occur in human gene therapy remains to be determined.
28298669	Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Continuous Renal Replacement in a Neonate with Propionic Acidemia.	The usual indications for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are for respiratory or cardiac failure. Although continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is frequently used when patients are on ECMO, the need for CRRT as the primary indication for ECMO is rare. A case of a neonate placed onto veno-venous ECMO for the use of CRRT to treat hyperammonemia from propionic acidemia is presented.
25046265	Effects of adeno-associated virus serotype and tissue-specific expression on circulating biomarkers of propionic acidemia.	Propionic acidemia (PA) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC). This enzyme is composed of six PCCA and six PCCB subunits and mediates a critical step in catabolism of odd chain fatty acids and certain amino acids. Current treatment options for PA are limited to stringent dietary restriction of protein consumption and some patients undergo elective liver transplantation. We previously generated a hypomorphic model of PA, designated Pcca(-/-)(A138T), with 2% of wild-type enzyme activity that mimics many aspects of the human disease. In this study, we used the differing tissue tropisms of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to probe the ability of liver or muscle-directed gene therapy to treat systemic aspects of this disease that affects many cell types. Systemic therapy with muscle-biased AAV1, liver-biased AAV8, and broadly tropic AAVrh10 mediated significant biochemical corrections in circulating propionylcarnitine (C3) and methyl citrate by all vectors. The innate tissue bias of AAV1 and AAV8 gene expression was made more specific by the use of muscle-specific muscle creatine kinase (specifically MCK6) and hepatocyte-specific transthyretin (TTR) promoters, respectively. Under these targeted conditions, both vectors mediated significant long-term correction of circulating metabolites, demonstrating that correction of muscle and likely other tissue types in addition to liver is necessary to fully correct pathology caused by PA. Liver-specific AAV8-TTR-PCCA mediated better correction than AAV1-MCK-PCCA. These data suggest that targeted gene therapy may be a viable alternative to liver transplantation for PA. They also demonstrate the effects of tissue-specific and broad gene therapy on a cell autonomous systemic genetic disease.
33686767	Management of COVID-19 infection in organic acidemias.	The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health and healthcare of individuals of all ages worldwide. There have been multiple reports and reviews documenting a milder effect and decreased morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population, but there have only been a small number of reports discussing the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of an inborn error of metabolism (IEM). Here, we report two patients with underlying metabolic disorders, propionic acidemia and glutaric aciduria type 1, and discuss their clinical presentation, as well as their infectious and metabolic management. Our report demonstrates that individuals with an underlying IEM are at risk of metabolic decompensation in the setting of a COVID-19 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus does not appear to cause a more severe metabolic deterioration than is typical.
31915802	Peripheral venous route for administration of ammonul infusion for treatment of acute hyperammonemia. An experience from a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the local effects of peripheral Ammonul infusion on the skin and the subcutaneous tissues.  Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All children less than 16 years of age admitted between December 2015 and October 2018 with hyperammonemia and received Ammonul infusion for treatment were recruited. Results: Twenty-one patients received the Ammonul infusion. They were admitted 58 times with acute hyperammonemia during the study period, with an average of 2.8 admissions per patient. The mean age of the included patients was 49.5 months. The most frequent underlying diagnoses were propionic acidemia (n=9), urea cycle disorders (n=5), and intrinsic liver disease (n=3). All participants received Ammonul through peripheral lines except 3 who received it through central lines. No extravasation, burns, or other local side effects were observed in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This data indicate that the use of Ammonul through a peripheral venous route appears to be safe and not associated with infusion-related local adverse effects.
37530705	Gene Therapy for Organic Acidemias: Lessons Learned from Methylmalonic and Propionic Acidemia.	Organic acidemias (OA) are a group of rare autosomal recessive disorders of intermediary metabolism that result in a systemic elevation of organic acid. Despite optimal dietary and cofactor therapy, OA patients still suffer from potentially lethal metabolic instability and experience long-term multisystemic complications. Severely affected patients can benefit from elective liver transplantation, which restores hepatic enzymatic activity, improves metabolic stability, and provides the theoretical basis for the pursuit of gene therapy as a new treatment for patients. Because of the poor outcomes reported in those with OA, especially methylmalonic and propionic acidemia, multiple gene therapy approaches have been explored in relevant animal models. Here we review the results of gene therapy experiments performed using MMA and PA mouse models to illustrate experimental paradigms that could be applicable for all forms of OA.

29378828	Import of TAT-Conjugated Propionyl Coenzyme A Carboxylase Using Models of Propionic Acidemia.	Propionic acidemia is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase (PCC) located in the mitochondrial matrix. Cell-penetrating peptides, including transactivator of transcription (TAT), offer a potential to deliver a cargo into the mitochondrion. Here, we investigated the delivery of an alpha6beta6 PCC enzyme into mitochondria using the HIV TAT peptide at several levels: into isolated mitochondria, in patient fibroblast cells, and in a mouse model. Results from Western blots and enzyme activity assays confirmed the import of TAT-PCC into mitochondria, as well as into patient fibroblasts, where the colocalization of imported TAT-PCC and mitochondria was also confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, a single-dose intraperitoneal injection into PCC-deficient mice decreased the propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) ratio toward the normal level. These results show that a cell-penetrating peptide can deliver active multimeric enzyme into mitochondria in vitro, in situ, and in vivo and push the size limit of intracellular delivery achieved so far. Our results are promising for other mitochondrion-specific deficiencies.
27089410	Propionic acidemia: a Turkish case report of a successful pregnancy, labor and lactation.	Although propionic acidemia (PA) is a devastating inherited metabolic disease, with early diagnosis and advanced treatment strategies prognosis gets better and girls can survive to child-bearing ages. We share the detailed follow-up data of the pregnancy, successful labor with cesarean section and a healthy baby of a Turkish patient with PA.

27436684	Antibody-mediated rejection after ABO-incompatible pediatric living donor liver transplantation for propionic acidemia: A case report.	We herein present the case of a four-yr-old boy with PA who developed AMR after ABO-incompatible LDLT despite undergoing B cell desensitization using rituximab. Although the CD19+ lymphocyte count decreased to 0.1% nine days after the administration of rituximab, he developed a high fever which was accompanied by arthralgia due to a streptococcal infection 13 days after rituximab prophylaxis. After the clearance of the infection, he underwent ABO-incompatible LDLT 36 days after the administration of rituximab. The CD19+ lymphocyte count just prior to LDLT was 1.2%. He developed AMR five days after LDLT, and the antidonor-type IgM and IgG antibody titers increased to 1:1024 and 1:1024, respectively. He was treated by plasma exchange, IVIG, steroid pulse therapy, and rituximab re-administration; however, his liver dysfunction continued. Despite intensive treatment, he died due to complicated abdominal hernia, acute renal failure, and ARDS. This case suggests that a streptococcal infection may induce the activation of innate immune responses; thus, additional desensitization therapy should be considered prior to ABO-incompatible LDLT if B cell reactivation is suspected. 
36710110	Combined heart and liver transplantation in a patient supported by left ventricular assist device (LVAD) with propionic acidemia.	Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare inherited metabolic disease due to inborn errors of metabolism. PA results in the accumulation of abnormal organic acid metabolites in multiple systems, mainly the central nervous system and the heart. Cardiac complications include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and carry a 40-50% increased mortality risk. Liver transplantation (LT) is required in PA patients when medical treatment fails and may prevent or slow down the cardiomyopathy progression. However, severe heart disease may be a serious contraindication to LT. We present a complicated case of a PA patient, supported with a Left Ventricular Assist Device, who underwent a heart and Liver transplant. PA patients are at increased risk for metabolic acidosis during surgery, with increased anion gap and hyperammonemia. A strict multi-disciplinary approach is needed to prevent and treat metabolic decompensation. The patient had a successful heart and liver transplant after a strict treatment protocol in the pre, intra, and post-operative periods. His case highlights the complexity of PA patients and the increased risk for metabolic decompensation during surgery and provides an insight into how to manage such complicated patients.
30080956	Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia and Methylmalonic Acidemia: Perioperative Management and Clinical Outcomes.	Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) comprise the most common organic acidemias and account for profound morbidity in affected individuals. Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as a bulk enzyme-replacement strategy to stabilize metabolically fragile patients, it is not a metabolic cure because patients remain at risk for disease-related complications. We retrospectively studied LT and/or liver-kidney transplant in 9 patients with PA or MMA with additional focus on the optimization of metabolic control and management in the perioperative period. Metabolic crises were common before transplant. By implementing a strategy of carbohydrate minimization with gradual but early lipid and protein introduction, lactate levels significantly improved over the perioperative period (P < 0.001). Posttransplant metabolic improvement is demonstrated by improvements in serum glycine levels (for PA; P < 0.001 x 10-14 ), methylmalonic acid levels (for MMA; P < 0.001), and ammonia levels (for PA and MMA; P < 0.001). Dietary restriction remained after transplant. However, no further metabolic crises have occurred. Other disease-specific comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy stabilized and improved. In conclusion, transplant can provide a strategy for altering the natural history of PA and MMA providing stability to a rare but metabolically brittle population. Nutritional management is critical to optimize patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Current world experience regarding living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in the treatment of propionic acidemia (PA) is limited, especially in terms of using obligate heterozygous carriers as donors. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of LDLT in children with PA. METHODS: From November 2017 to January 2020, 7 of the 192 children who underwent LDLT at our institution had been diagnosed with PA (median age, 2.1 years; range, 1.1-5.8 years). The primary indication for transplantation was frequent metabolic decompensations in 6 patients and preventative treatment in 1 patient. Of the seven parental living donors, six were genetically proven obligate heterozygous carriers. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.9 months (range, 13.9-40.2 months), all patients were alive with 100% allograft survival, and no severe transplant-related complications occurred. In the case of liberalized protein intake, they did not suffer metabolic decompensation or disease-related complications and made progress in neurodevelopmental delay and body growth, as well as blood and urinary metabolite levels. In one patient with pre-existing mild dilated cardiomyopathy, her echocardiogram results completely normalized 13.8 months post-transplant. All living donors recovered well after surgery, with no metabolic decompensations or procedure-related complications. Western blotting revealed that the hepatic expressions of PCCA and PCCB in one of the heterozygous donors were comparable to those of the normal healthy control at the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: LDLT using partial liver grafts from asymptomatic obligate heterozygous carrier donors is a viable therapeutic option for selected PA patients, with no negative impact on donors' and recipients' clinical courses.
28634175	Inter-relations between 3-hydroxypropionate and propionate metabolism in rat liver: relevance to disorders of propionyl-CoA metabolism.	Propionate, 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP), methylcitrate, related compounds, and ammonium accumulate in body fluids of patients with disorders of propionyl-CoA metabolism, such as propionic acidemia. Although liver transplantation alleviates hyperammonemia, high concentrations of propionate, 3HP, and methylcitrate persist in body fluids. We hypothesized that conserved metabolic perturbations occurring in transplanted patients result from the simultaneous presence of propionate and 3HP in body fluids. We investigated the inter-relations of propionate and 3HP metabolism in perfused livers from normal rats using metabolomic and stable isotopic technologies. In the presence of propionate, 3HP, or both, we observed the following metabolic perturbations. First, the citric acid cycle (CAC) is overloaded but does not provide sufficient reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain to maintain the homeostasis of adenine nucleotides. Second, there is major CoA trapping in the propionyl-CoA pathway and a tripling of liver total CoA within 1 h. Third, liver proteolysis is stimulated. Fourth, propionate inhibits the conversion of 3HP to acetyl-CoA and its oxidation in the CAC. Fifth, some propionate and some 3HP are converted to nephrotoxic maleate by different processes. Our data have implications for the clinical management of propionic acidemia. They also emphasize the perturbations of the liver intermediary metabolism induced by supraphysiological, i.e., millimolar, concentrations of labeled propionate used to trace the intermediary metabolism, in particular, inhibition of CAC flux and major decreases in the [ATP]/[ADP] and [ATP]/[AMP] ratios.
33093005	Nutrition management guideline for very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD): An evidence- and consensus-based approach.	The nutrition management guideline for very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD) is the fourth in a series of web-based guidelines focusing on the diet treatment for inherited metabolic disorders and follows previous publication of guidelines for maple syrup urine disease (2014), phenylketonuria (2016) and propionic acidemia (2019). The purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation, monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp) websites.
31842933	Methylmalonic and propionic acidemia among hospitalized pediatric patients: a nationwide report.	BACKGROUND: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) are two kinds of diseases caused by inborn errors of metabolism. So far, the epidemiological data on them are limited in China. The aim of our study is to investigate the proportion and characteristics of hospitalized pediatric patients with MMA and PA in China. METHODS: The data in this study were obtained from the Hospital Quality Monitoring System, a national inpatient database in China, with information on the patients hospitalized during the period from 2013 to 2017. We identified the data related to the patients who were under 18 years old and were diagnosed with MMA/PA, and extracted the information on demographic characteristics, hospital location, total cost and other related clinical presentations from the data. RESULTS: Among all hospitalized pediatric patients with liver diseases, there were increasing trends in the proportion of individuals diagnosed with MMA or PA during the period from 2013 (0.76% for MMA; 0.13% for PA) to 2017 (1.61% for MMA; 0.32% for PA). For both MMA and PA, children under 2-year-old accounted for the highest proportion. The median of total cost per hospitalization was relatively high (RMB 7388.53 for MMA; RMB 4999.66 for PA). Moreover, most patients hospitalized in tertiary class A hospitals (MMA: 80.96%, PA: 76.21%); and a majority of pediatric patients admitted in the hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing are from outside districts. Manifestations of nervous system-related symptoms, and metabolic acidosis or anemia in laboratory findings were more common during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The study is the first nationwide one in providing epidemiological and clinical information on hospitalized pediatric patients with MMA/PA. An increasing hospitalization with various presentations and a heavy financial burden were observed. In addition, geographically, the medical resources in China have been unevenly distributed.
33093405	Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia: Evidence From a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The worldwide experience of liver transplantation (LT) in the treatment of propionic acidemia (PA) remains limited and fragmented. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of posttransplant clinical outcomes in PA patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies focusing on PA patients who underwent LT. The pooled estimate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving 70 individuals were included. The pooled estimate rates were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for patient survival and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for allograft survival. The pooled estimate rates were 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.39) for rejection, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.00-0.21) for hepatic artery thrombosis, 0.14 (95% CI, 0.00-0.37) for cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection, and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.00-0.15) for biliary complications. The pooled estimate rates were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00) for metabolic stability, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) for reversal of preexisting cardiomyopathy, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for improvement of neurodevelopmental delay. A large proportion of patients achieved liberalization of protein intake posttransplant (pooled estimate rate 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of transplant-related complications, LT is a viable therapeutic option in PA patients with satisfactory survival rates and clinical outcomes. Given the diversity in neurological assessment methods and the inconsistency in the achievement of dietary protein liberalization across different studies, consensus on neurological evaluation methods and posttransplant protein intake is necessary. Longer-term clinical outcomes of LT for PA warrants further investigation.
32270363	Post-transplantation Outcomes in Patients with PA or MMA: A Review of the Literature.	INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is recognised as a treatment option for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) and those with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) without renal impairment. In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver-kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver-kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver-kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.
30979470	Detecting Graft-Derived Cell-Free DNA Through Amplification Refractory Mutation System Polymerase Chain Reaction in Living-Donor Liver Transplantation: Report of 2 Cases.	Graft-derived cell-free DNA (Gcf-DNA) is a non-invasive biomarker to monitor graft function. There are different methods to quantify Gcf-DNA, such as the classical Y-chromosome method and the latest digital droplet polymerase chain reaction method. In this study, we reported 2 patients genetically diagnosed with propionic acidemia (PA) went through living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), and monitoring the change of Gcf-DNA examined by the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Two patients went through the operation successfully, and a 5 mL whole blood specimen was collected at 6 specific time points (day 0, day 1, day 7, day 14, day 30, day 60). The comparison of Gcf-DNA and the routine liver function showed that they have similar change-tendency curves, with the curves reaching the top at day 1 because of ischemia-reperfusion injury and generally declining from day 7-day 60 along with recovery of the patient. Applying the ARMS-PCR method to detect Gcf-DNA can be done without knowing the donor information and is not limited by donor-recipient-sex-mismatch condition. In conclusion, Gcf-DNA is a promising biomarker that can monitor graft function in LDLT, and we will apply it in more samples and observe it long term to validate its efficiency in the future.
35401508	Immunological Memory and Affinity Maturation After Vaccination in Patients With Propionic Acidemia.	Earlier studies have recommended routine childhood immunization in patients with propionic acidemia (PA); however, the literature presents insufficient data on the response to vaccines, notably specific IgG concentrations and avidity maturation, after measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and diphtheria/tetanus (DiphtTe) vaccinations in this population. In patients with PA, cellular and humoral changes of the immune system (e.g. a decreased CD4+ T cell count, with a reversal of CD4/CD8 T cell ratio, a deficient gamma-globulin fraction, and in one case a decreased lymphocyte blastogenesis) have been reported. Former reports also detected pancytopenias accompanying febrile infections in PA patients. In the current study, we analyzed vaccine-specific IgG concentrations and avidity maturation after MMR and DiphtTe vaccinations in 10 patients with PA. Compared to gender and age matched controls, all 10 had protective IgG concentrations for at least one tested antigen, and in 6 out of 10 patients high relative avidity indices for measles and rubella were detected. In summary, the present study revealed a sufficient immune response and outcome, indicating an acceptable humoral memory in patients with PA after booster vaccinations.
34007002	Severity modeling of propionic acidemia using clinical and laboratory biomarkers.	PURPOSE: To conduct a proof-of-principle study to identify subtypes of propionic acidemia (PA) and associated biomarkers. METHODS: Data from a clinically diverse PA patient population ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02890342 ) were used to train and test machine learning models, identify PA-relevant biomarkers, and perform validation analysis using data from liver-transplanted participants. k-Means clustering was used to test for the existence of PA subtypes. Expert knowledge was used to define PA subtypes (mild and severe). Given expert classification, supervised machine learning (support vector machine with a polynomial kernel, svmPoly) performed dimensional reduction to define relevant features of each PA subtype. RESULTS: Forty participants enrolled in the study; five underwent liver transplant. Analysis with k-means clustering indicated that several PA subtypes may exist on the biochemical continuum. The conventional PA biomarkers, plasma total 2-methylctirate and propionylcarnitine, were not statistically significantly different between nontransplanted and transplanted participants motivating us to search for other biomarkers. Unbiased dimensional reduction using svmPoly revealed that plasma transthyretin, alanine:serine ratio, GDF15, FGF21, and in vivo 1-13C-propionate oxidation, play roles in defining PA subtypes. CONCLUSION: Support vector machine prioritized biomarkers that helped classify propionic acidemia patients according to severity subtypes, with important ramifications for future clinical trials and management of PA.
29679984	Long-term continuous N-carbamylglutamate treatment in frequently decompensated propionic acidemia: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Propionic acidemia is a rare autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder that can inhibit the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate, the obligatory activator in urea synthesis, leading to hyperammonemia. N-carbamylglutamate ameliorates hyperammonemia in decompensated propionic acidemia. The effects of long-term continuous N-acetylglutamate administration in such patients are unknown. We report our clinical experience with continuous administration of N-acetylglutamate for 6 years in a patient with propionic acidemia frequently presenting with hyperammonemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A male Caucasian patient with frequently decompensated propionic acidemia and hyperammonemia was admitted 78 times for acute attacks during the first 9 years of his life. Continuous daily treatment with oral N-carbamylglutamate 100 mg/kg (50 mg/kg after 6 months) was initiated. During 6 years of treatment, he had a significant decrease in his mean plasma ammonia levels (75.7 mumol/L vs. 140.3 mumol/L before N-carbamylglutamate therapy, p < 0.005 [normal range 50-80 mumol/L]) and fewer acute episodes (two in 6 years). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a benefit of N-acetylglutamate administration outside the emergency setting. If this observation is confirmed, future studies should aim to optimize the dosage and explore effects of the dosage requirements on other drugs and on protein tolerance.
27283461	Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis Via Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Pump for Treatment of Hyperammonemia Secondary to Propionic Acidemia in Monochorionic Diamniotic Twin Boys.	Late-preterm twins with propionic acidemia developed severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy at 5 days of age. Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was performed successfully for both infants via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation pump, and both rapidly improved. They were taken off continuous venovenous hemodialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and discharged with dietary therapy. At 3 years of age, neurodevelopment showed globally delayed milestones.
31978012	Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia: A Multicenter-linked Database Analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting from deficiency in the enzyme necessary for catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, some odd chain fatty acids and cholesterol. Despite optimal medical management, PA often leads to acute and progressive neurological injury. Reports on liver transplantation (LT) as a cellular therapy are limited and varied. The objective of this study was to examine the largest collection of patients who underwent LT for PA. METHODS: Examining the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Pediatric Health Information System administrative billing databases, we performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of LT over a 16-year period. During this period, 4849 pediatric LT were performed out of which 23 were done for PA at 10 different centers. RESULTS: The majority of recipients were 5 years of age or younger and had status 1b exception points at the time of transplant. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival for PA LT recipients was 84.6% and the 1-, 3, and 5-year patient survival was 89.5%. There was no significant difference in graft or patient survival between PA and non-PA LT recipients. Despite historical data to the contrary, we did not find an increased incidence of hepatic arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing LT for PA. Patients in the PA LT group, however, had a significantly higher postoperative rate of readmission compared with the non-PA LT group (90.5% vs 72.8%, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: LT for children with PA is a viable treatment option with acceptable outcomes.

25990417	Cost-effectiveness of liver transplantation in methylmalonic and propionic acidemias.	Propionic acidemia (PA) and classical methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are rare inborn errors of metabolism that can cause early mortality and significant morbidity. The mainstay of disease management is lifelong protein restriction. As an alternative, liver transplantation (LT) may improve survival, quality of life, and prevent further neurological deterioration. The aim of our study was to estimate the incremental costs and outcomes of LT versus nutritional support in patients with early-onset MMA or PA. We constructed a Markov model to simulate and compare life expectancies, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime direct and indirect costs for a cohort of newborns with MMA or PA who could either receive LT or be maintained on conventional nutritional support. We conducted a series of 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base case, LT on average resulted in 1.5 more life years lived, 7.9 more QALYs, and a savings of $582,369 for lifetime societal cost per individual compared to nutritional support. LT remained more effective and less costly in all 1-way sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, LT was cost-effective at the $100,000/QALY threshold in more than 90% of the simulations and cost-saving in over half of the simulations. LT is likely a dominant treatment strategy compared to nutritional support in newborns with classical MMA or PA.
33087718	Dual mRNA therapy restores metabolic function in long-term studies in mice with propionic acidemia.	Propionic acidemia/aciduria (PA) is an ultra-rare, life-threatening, inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme, propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) composed of six alpha (PCCA) and six beta (PCCB) subunits. We herein report an enzyme replacement approach to treat PA using a combination of two messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (dual mRNAs) encoding both human PCCA (hPCCA) and PCCB (hPCCB) encapsulated in biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to produce functional PCC enzyme in liver. In patient fibroblasts, dual mRNAs encoded proteins localize in mitochondria and produce higher PCC enzyme activity vs. single (PCCA or PCCB) mRNA alone. In a hypomorphic murine model of PA, dual mRNAs normalize ammonia similarly to carglumic acid, a drug approved in Europe for the treatment of hyperammonemia due to PA. Dual mRNAs additionally restore functional PCC enzyme in liver and thus reduce primary disease-associated toxins in a dose-dependent manner in long-term 3- and 6-month repeat-dose studies in PA mice. Dual mRNAs are well-tolerated in these studies with no adverse findings. These studies demonstrate the potential of mRNA technology to chronically administer multiple mRNAs to produce large complex enzymes, with applicability to other genetic disorders.
36694456	Successfully Navigating Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations for AAV9-hPCCA Gene Therapy: The National Institutes of Health Platform Vector Gene Therapy Experience.	Orphan drug designation (ODD) is an important program intended to facilitate the development of orphan drugs in the United States. An orphan drug benefiting pediatric patients can qualify as a drug for a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) as well. The ODD and RPDD programs provide financial incentives for development of diagnostic drugs, preventive measures, and treatment of diseases affecting small patient populations (adult and pediatric) for which commercial development would otherwise be very challenging. In 2019, a multidisciplinary group of collaborators at National Institutes of Health (NIH) embarked upon a gene therapy platform program called Platform Vector Gene Therapy (PaVe-GT) intended to develop gene therapies for four such rare disorders. An important part of PaVe-GT is to publicly share scientific and regulatory experience gained at different stages during the implementation of the PaVe-GT platform utilizing illustrative examples. The PaVe-GT team recently obtained ODD and RPDD for an adeno-associated virus gene therapy to treat propionic acidemia. Given an increasing interest in obtaining ODD for gene therapy, especially by small companies, research investigators, and patient groups, we overview the submission process and subsequently provide examples of our ODD and RPDD applications. Our ODD and RPDD applications and templates can also be found on the PaVe-GT website. Shared reference documents will have great utility to assist parties who may have limited experience with the preparation of similar applications for their orphan product.
32996606	Liver and/or kidney transplantation in amino and organic acid-related inborn errors of metabolism: An overview on European data.	BACKGROUND: This study provides a general overview on liver and/or kidney transplantation in patients with an amino and organic acid-related disorder (AOA) with the aim to investigate patient characteristics and global outcome in Europe. This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs). RESULTS: We identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20 MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57 MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8 MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14 days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n = 8). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n = 28), PA (n = 7), and UCD (n = 14) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ. CONCLUSION: The survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.

30242960	The Role of Liver Transplantation in Propionic Acidemia.	Despite optimal medical treatment and strict low-protein diet, the prognosis of propionic acidemia (PA) patients is generally poor. We aim to report our experience with liver transplantation (LT) in the management of PA patients. Six patients with PA received a LT at a mean age of 5.2 years (1.3-7.5 years). The indications for LT were frequent metabolic decompensations in the first 4 patients and preventative in the last 2 patients. Two patients presented hepatic artery thromboses that were solved through an interventional radiologist approach. These patients showed a very high procoagulant state that was observed by thromboelastography. Arterial vasospasm without thrombus was observed in 2 patients during the LT surgery. In order to avoid hepatic artery thrombosis, an arterial conduit from the recipient aorta to the hepatic artery of the donor was used in the fifth patient. After LT, patients presented improvement in propionyl byproducts without complete normalization, but no decompensations have been observed. In conclusion, LT could be a good therapeutic option to improve the metabolic control and the quality of life of PA patients. Improved surgical strategies along with new techniques of interventional radiology allow us to perform the LT minimizing the complications derived from the higher risk of hepatic artery thrombosis.
33978500	Anesthetic Management for Pediatric Liver Transplantation in a Patient With Propionic Acidemia: A Case Report.	Propionic acidemia is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by accumulation of propionic acid due to deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Main stay of treatment focuses on reducing dietary protein. However, orthotropic liver transplantation decreases the frequency of metabolic decompensations and improves life expectancy. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy undergoing orthotropic liver transplantation to treat propionic acidemia. This case highlights the use of intraoperative monitoring of metabolic markers like urine ketones, arterial ammonia, and lactate levels as these patients are at risk for hyperammonemia and metabolic acidosis. Also, the relevance in outcomes when performing early extubation in fast-tracking recovery.
31196016	Evaluation of long-term effectiveness of the use of carglumic acid in patients with propionic acidemia (PA) or methylmalonic acidemia (MMA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	INTRODUCTION: Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are rare autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism characterized by hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) dysfunction. Carglumic acid (Carbaglu ; Orphan Europe Ltd.) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for the treatment of hyperammonemia due hepatic NAGS deficiency. Here we report the rationale and design of a phase IIIb trial that is aimed at determining the long-term efficacy and safety of carglumic acid in the management of PA and MMA. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group phase IIIb study will be conducted in Saudi Arabia. Patients with PA or MMA (<=15 years of age) will be randomized 1:1 to receive twice daily carglumic acid (50 mg/kg/day) plus standard therapy (protein-restricted diet, L-carnitine, and metronidazole) or standard therapy alone for a 2-year treatment period. The primary efficacy outcome is the number of emergency room visits due to hyperammonemia. Safety will be assessed throughout the study and during the 1 month follow-up period after the study. DISCUSSION: Current guidelines recommend conservative medical treatment as the main strategy for the management of PA and MMA. Although retrospective studies have suggested that long-term carglumic acid may be beneficial in the management of PA and MMA, current literature lacks evidence for this indication. This clinical trial will determine the long-term safety and efficacy of carglumic acid in the management of PA and MMA.
