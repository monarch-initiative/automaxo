input_text: 'Nutrition management guideline for very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  deficiency (VLCAD): An evidence- and consensus-based approach. The nutrition management
  guideline for very-long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD) is the fourth
  in a series of web-based guidelines focusing on the diet treatment for inherited
  metabolic disorders and follows previous publication of guidelines for maple syrup
  urine disease (2014), phenylketonuria (2016) and propionic acidemia (2019). The
  purpose of this guideline is to establish harmonization in the treatment and monitoring
  of individuals with VLCAD of all ages in order to improve clinical outcomes. Six
  research questions were identified to support guideline development on: nutrition
  recommendations for the healthy individual, illness management, supplementation,
  monitoring, physical activity and management during pregnancy. This report describes
  the methodology used in its development including review, critical appraisal and
  abstraction of peer-reviewed studies and unpublished practice literature; expert
  input through two Delphi surveys and a nominal group process; and external review
  from metabolic physicians and dietitians. It includes the summary statements of
  the nutrition management recommendations for each research question, followed by
  a standardized rating based on the strength of the evidence. Online, open access
  of the full published guideline allows utilization by health care providers, researchers
  and collaborators who advise, advocate and care for individuals with VLCAD and their
  families and can be accessed from the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International
  (https://GMDI.org) and Southeast Regional Genetics Network (https://southeastgenetics.org/ngp)
  websites.'
