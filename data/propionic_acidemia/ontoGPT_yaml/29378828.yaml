input_text: 'Import of TAT-Conjugated Propionyl Coenzyme A Carboxylase Using Models
  of Propionic Acidemia. Propionic acidemia is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme
  propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase (PCC) located in the mitochondrial matrix. Cell-penetrating
  peptides, including transactivator of transcription (TAT), offer a potential to
  deliver a cargo into the mitochondrion. Here, we investigated the delivery of an
  alpha6beta6 PCC enzyme into mitochondria using the HIV TAT peptide at several levels:
  into isolated mitochondria, in patient fibroblast cells, and in a mouse model. Results
  from Western blots and enzyme activity assays confirmed the import of TAT-PCC into
  mitochondria, as well as into patient fibroblasts, where the colocalization of imported
  TAT-PCC and mitochondria was also confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy.
  Furthermore, a single-dose intraperitoneal injection into PCC-deficient mice decreased
  the propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) ratio toward the normal level. These
  results show that a cell-penetrating peptide can deliver active multimeric enzyme
  into mitochondria in vitro, in situ, and in vivo and push the size limit of intracellular
  delivery achieved so far. Our results are promising for other mitochondrion-specific
  deficiencies.'
