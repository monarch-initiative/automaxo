input_text: 'Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia: Evidence From a Systematic
  Review and Meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: The worldwide experience of liver transplantation
  (LT) in the treatment of propionic acidemia (PA) remains limited and fragmented.
  This review aims to provide a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of posttransplant
  clinical outcomes in PA patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library
  databases were searched for studies focusing on PA patients who underwent LT. The
  pooled estimate rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a
  random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. RESULTS:
  Twenty-one studies involving 70 individuals were included. The pooled estimate rates
  were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for patient survival and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00)
  for allograft survival. The pooled estimate rates were 0.20 (95% CI, 0.05-0.39)
  for rejection, 0.08 (95% CI, 0.00-0.21) for hepatic artery thrombosis, 0.14 (95%
  CI, 0.00-0.37) for cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection, and 0.03 (95% CI,
  0.00-0.15) for biliary complications. The pooled estimate rates were 0.98 (95% CI,
  0.88-1.00) for metabolic stability, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) for reversal of preexisting
  cardiomyopathy, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.78-1.00) for improvement of neurodevelopmental
  delay. A large proportion of patients achieved liberalization of protein intake
  posttransplant (pooled estimate rate 0.66 [95% CI, 0.35-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Despite
  the risk of transplant-related complications, LT is a viable therapeutic option
  in PA patients with satisfactory survival rates and clinical outcomes. Given the
  diversity in neurological assessment methods and the inconsistency in the achievement
  of dietary protein liberalization across different studies, consensus on neurological
  evaluation methods and posttransplant protein intake is necessary. Longer-term clinical
  outcomes of LT for PA warrants further investigation.'
