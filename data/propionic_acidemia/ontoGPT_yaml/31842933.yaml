input_text: 'Methylmalonic and propionic acidemia among hospitalized pediatric patients:
  a nationwide report. BACKGROUND: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia
  (PA) are two kinds of diseases caused by inborn errors of metabolism. So far, the
  epidemiological data on them are limited in China. The aim of our study is to investigate
  the proportion and characteristics of hospitalized pediatric patients with MMA and
  PA in China. METHODS: The data in this study were obtained from the Hospital Quality
  Monitoring System, a national inpatient database in China, with information on the
  patients hospitalized during the period from 2013 to 2017. We identified the data
  related to the patients who were under 18 years old and were diagnosed with MMA/PA,
  and extracted the information on demographic characteristics, hospital location,
  total cost and other related clinical presentations from the data. RESULTS: Among
  all hospitalized pediatric patients with liver diseases, there were increasing trends
  in the proportion of individuals diagnosed with MMA or PA during the period from
  2013 (0.76% for MMA; 0.13% for PA) to 2017 (1.61% for MMA; 0.32% for PA). For both
  MMA and PA, children under 2-year-old accounted for the highest proportion. The
  median of total cost per hospitalization was relatively high (RMB 7388.53 for MMA;
  RMB 4999.66 for PA). Moreover, most patients hospitalized in tertiary class A hospitals
  (MMA: 80.96%, PA: 76.21%); and a majority of pediatric patients admitted in the
  hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing are from outside districts. Manifestations of
  nervous system-related symptoms, and metabolic acidosis or anemia in laboratory
  findings were more common during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The study is the
  first nationwide one in providing epidemiological and clinical information on hospitalized
  pediatric patients with MMA/PA. An increasing hospitalization with various presentations
  and a heavy financial burden were observed. In addition, geographically, the medical
  resources in China have been unevenly distributed.'
