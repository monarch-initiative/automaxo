input_text: Immunological Memory and Affinity Maturation After Vaccination in Patients
  With Propionic Acidemia. Earlier studies have recommended routine childhood immunization
  in patients with propionic acidemia (PA); however, the literature presents insufficient
  data on the response to vaccines, notably specific IgG concentrations and avidity
  maturation, after measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and diphtheria/tetanus (DiphtTe)
  vaccinations in this population. In patients with PA, cellular and humoral changes
  of the immune system (e.g. a decreased CD4+ T cell count, with a reversal of CD4/CD8
  T cell ratio, a deficient gamma-globulin fraction, and in one case a decreased lymphocyte
  blastogenesis) have been reported. Former reports also detected pancytopenias accompanying
  febrile infections in PA patients. In the current study, we analyzed vaccine-specific
  IgG concentrations and avidity maturation after MMR and DiphtTe vaccinations in
  10 patients with PA. Compared to gender and age matched controls, all 10 had protective
  IgG concentrations for at least one tested antigen, and in 6 out of 10 patients
  high relative avidity indices for measles and rubella were detected. In summary,
  the present study revealed a sufficient immune response and outcome, indicating
  an acceptable humoral memory in patients with PA after booster vaccinations.
