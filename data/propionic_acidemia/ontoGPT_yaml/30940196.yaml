input_text: 'Methylmalonic acidemia/propionic acidemia - the biochemical presentation
  and comparing the outcome between liver transplantation versus non-liver transplantation
  groups. BACKGROUND: Most patients with isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) /propionic
  acidemia (PA) presenting during the neonatal period with acute metabolic distress
  are at risk for death and significant neurodevelopmental disability. The nationwide
  newborn screening for MMA/PA has been in place in Taiwan from January, 2000 and
  data was collected until December, 2016. RESULTS: During the study period, 3,155,263
  newborns were screened. The overall incidence of MMA mutase type cases was 1/121,356
  (n = 26), 1 cobalamin B was detected and that for PA cases (n = 4) was 1/788,816.
  The time of referral is 8.8 days for MMA patients, and 7.5 days for PA patients.
  The MMA mutase type patients have higher AST, ALT, and NH3 values as well as a lower
  pH value (p < 0.05). The mean age for liver transplantation (LT) is 402 days (range
  from 0.6-6.7 yr) with 16 out of 20 cases (80.0%) using living donors. The mean admission
  length shortened from 90.6 days/year (pre-LT) to 5.3 days/year (at 3rd year post-LT)
  (p < 0.0005). Similarly, the tube feeding ratio decreased from 67.8 to 0.50% (p
  < 0.00005). The anxiety level of the caregiver was reduced from 33.4 to 27.2 after
  LT (p = 0.001) and the DQ/IQ performance of the patients was improved after LT from
  50 to 60.1 (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: MMA/PA patients with LT do survive and have reduced
  admission time, reduced tube feeding and the caregiver is less anxious.'
