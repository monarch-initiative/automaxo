input_text: 'Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia and Methylmalonic Acidemia:
  Perioperative Management and Clinical Outcomes. Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic
  acidemia (MMA) comprise the most common organic acidemias and account for profound
  morbidity in affected individuals. Although liver transplantation (LT) has emerged
  as a bulk enzyme-replacement strategy to stabilize metabolically fragile patients,
  it is not a metabolic cure because patients remain at risk for disease-related complications.
  We retrospectively studied LT and/or liver-kidney transplant in 9 patients with
  PA or MMA with additional focus on the optimization of metabolic control and management
  in the perioperative period. Metabolic crises were common before transplant. By
  implementing a strategy of carbohydrate minimization with gradual but early lipid
  and protein introduction, lactate levels significantly improved over the perioperative
  period (P < 0.001). Posttransplant metabolic improvement is demonstrated by improvements
  in serum glycine levels (for PA; P < 0.001 x 10-14 ), methylmalonic acid levels
  (for MMA; P < 0.001), and ammonia levels (for PA and MMA; P < 0.001). Dietary restriction
  remained after transplant. However, no further metabolic crises have occurred. Other
  disease-specific comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy stabilized
  and improved. In conclusion, transplant can provide a strategy for altering the
  natural history of PA and MMA providing stability to a rare but metabolically brittle
  population. Nutritional management is critical to optimize patient outcomes.'
