input_text: Long-term sex-biased correction of circulating propionic acidemia disease
  markers by adeno-associated virus vectors. Propionic academia (PA) occurs because
  of mutations in the PCCA or PCCB genes encoding the two subunits of propionyl-CoA
  carboxylase, a pivotal enzyme in the breakdown of certain amino acids and odd-chain
  fatty acids. There is no cure for PA, but dietary protein restriction and liver
  transplantation can attenuate its symptoms. We show here that a single intravenous
  injection of adeno-associated virus 2/8 (AAV8) or AAVrh10 expressing PCCA into PA
  hypomorphic mice decreased systemic propionylcarnitine and methyl citrate for up
  to 1.5 years. However, long-term phenotypic correction was always better in male
  mice. AAV-mediated PCCA expression was similar in most tissues in males and females
  at early time points and differed only in the liver. Over 1.5 years, luciferase
  and PCCA expression remained elevated in cardiac tissue for both sexes. In contrast,
  transgene expression in the liver and skeletal muscles of female, but not male,
  mice waned:suggesting that these tissues were major sinks for systemic phenotypic
  correction. These data indicate that single systemic intravenous therapy by AAV
  vectors can mediate long-term phenotype correction for PA. However, tissue-specific
  loss of expression in females reduces efficacy when compared with males. Whether
  similar sex-biased AAV effects occur in human gene therapy remains to be determined.
