input_text: Management of COVID-19 infection in organic acidemias. The COVID-19 pandemic
  has affected the health and healthcare of individuals of all ages worldwide. There
  have been multiple reports and reviews documenting a milder effect and decreased
  morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population, but there have only been a
  small number of reports discussing the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of an
  inborn error of metabolism (IEM). Here, we report two patients with underlying metabolic
  disorders, propionic acidemia and glutaric aciduria type 1, and discuss their clinical
  presentation, as well as their infectious and metabolic management. Our report demonstrates
  that individuals with an underlying IEM are at risk of metabolic decompensation
  in the setting of a COVID-19 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus does not appear to
  cause a more severe metabolic deterioration than is typical.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
