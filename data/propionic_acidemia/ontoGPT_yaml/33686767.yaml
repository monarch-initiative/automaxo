input_text: Management of COVID-19 infection in organic acidemias. The COVID-19 pandemic
  has affected the health and healthcare of individuals of all ages worldwide. There
  have been multiple reports and reviews documenting a milder effect and decreased
  morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population, but there have only been a
  small number of reports discussing the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of an
  inborn error of metabolism (IEM). Here, we report two patients with underlying metabolic
  disorders, propionic acidemia and glutaric aciduria type 1, and discuss their clinical
  presentation, as well as their infectious and metabolic management. Our report demonstrates
  that individuals with an underlying IEM are at risk of metabolic decompensation
  in the setting of a COVID-19 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus does not appear to
  cause a more severe metabolic deterioration than is typical.
