input_text: 'Successfully Navigating Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug and
  Rare Pediatric Disease Designations for AAV9-hPCCA Gene Therapy: The National Institutes
  of Health Platform Vector Gene Therapy Experience. Orphan drug designation (ODD)
  is an important program intended to facilitate the development of orphan drugs in
  the United States. An orphan drug benefiting pediatric patients can qualify as a
  drug for a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) as well. The ODD and RPDD programs
  provide financial incentives for development of diagnostic drugs, preventive measures,
  and treatment of diseases affecting small patient populations (adult and pediatric)
  for which commercial development would otherwise be very challenging. In 2019, a
  multidisciplinary group of collaborators at National Institutes of Health (NIH)
  embarked upon a gene therapy platform program called Platform Vector Gene Therapy
  (PaVe-GT) intended to develop gene therapies for four such rare disorders. An important
  part of PaVe-GT is to publicly share scientific and regulatory experience gained
  at different stages during the implementation of the PaVe-GT platform utilizing
  illustrative examples. The PaVe-GT team recently obtained ODD and RPDD for an adeno-associated
  virus gene therapy to treat propionic acidemia. Given an increasing interest in
  obtaining ODD for gene therapy, especially by small companies, research investigators,
  and patient groups, we overview the submission process and subsequently provide
  examples of our ODD and RPDD applications. Our ODD and RPDD applications and templates
  can also be found on the PaVe-GT website. Shared reference documents will have great
  utility to assist parties who may have limited experience with the preparation of
  similar applications for their orphan product.'
