input_text: "Therapeutic potential of living donor liver transplantation from heterozygous
  carrier donors in children with propionic acidemia. BACKGROUND: Current world experience
  regarding living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in the treatment of propionic
  acidemia (PA) is limited, especially in terms of using obligate heterozygous carriers
  as donors. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of LDLT in children
  with PA. METHODS: From November 2017 to January 2020, 7 of the 192 children who
  underwent LDLT at our institution had been diagnosed with PA (median age, 2.1 years;
  range, 1.1-5.8 years). The primary indication for transplantation was frequent metabolic
  decompensations in 6 patients and preventative treatment in 1 patient. Of the seven
  parental living donors, six were genetically proven obligate heterozygous carriers.
  RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.9 months (range, 13.9-40.2 months), all
  patients were alive with 100% allograft survival, and no severe transplant-related
  complications occurred. In the case of liberalized protein intake, they did not
  suffer metabolic decompensation or disease-related complications and made progress
  in neurodevelopmental delay and body growth, as well as blood and urinary metabolite
  levels. In one patient with pre-existing mild dilated cardiomyopathy, her echocardiogram
  results completely normalized 13.8 months post-transplant. All living donors recovered
  well after surgery, with no metabolic decompensations or procedure-related complications.
  Western blotting revealed that the hepatic expressions of PCCA and PCCB in one of
  the heterozygous donors were comparable to those of the normal healthy control at
  the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: LDLT using partial liver grafts from asymptomatic
  obligate heterozygous carrier donors is a viable therapeutic option for selected
  PA patients, with no negative impact on donors' and recipients' clinical courses."
