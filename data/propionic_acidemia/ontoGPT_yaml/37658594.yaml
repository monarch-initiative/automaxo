input_text: 'Domino liver transplantation for maple syrup urine disease in children:
  A single-center case series. BACKGROUND: Domino liver transplant (DLT) represents
  another type of liver donor to expand the donor pool. Recent reports of successful
  DLT in children with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) show promising long-term outcomes.
  METHODS: It was a retrospective study. All children with MSUD were paired with either
  recipients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or non-MSUD metabolic disease. Each
  pair underwent simultaneous liver transplant (LT), where the MSUD recipient received
  the graft from a living-related donor and the liver explanted from the MSUD donor
  was transplanted to the respective paired domino recipient. We report our experience
  regarding the techniques and outcomes of DLT at our center. RESULTS: Eleven children
  with MSUD and 12 respective DLT recipients were enrolled, one of which was domino
  split-liver transplantation. DLT recipients included seven ESLD, two propionic acidemia
  (PA), one glycogen storage disease(GSD) type-1, one GSD type-3, and one Citrullinemia.
  Post-LT ICU and hospital stays were comparable (p > .05). Patient and graft survival
  was 100% and 66.6% in the MSUD group and DLT recipients at a mean follow-up of 13.5
  and 15 months. There was no death in the MSUD group as compared to four in the DLT
  group. The amino acid levels rapidly normalized after the LT in the children with
  MSUD and they tolerated the normal unrestricted diet. No vascular, biliary, or graft-related
  complications were seen in the post-transplant period. No occurrence of MSUD was
  noted in DLT recipients. CONCLUSION: DLTs have excellent post-surgical outcomes.
  DLT should be strongly considered and adopted by transplant programs worldwide to
  circumvent organ shortage.'
