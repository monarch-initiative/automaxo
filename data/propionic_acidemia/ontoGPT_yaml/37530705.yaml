input_text: 'Gene Therapy for Organic Acidemias: Lessons Learned from Methylmalonic
  and Propionic Acidemia. Organic acidemias (OA) are a group of rare autosomal recessive
  disorders of intermediary metabolism that result in a systemic elevation of organic
  acid. Despite optimal dietary and cofactor therapy, OA patients still suffer from
  potentially lethal metabolic instability and experience long-term multisystemic
  complications. Severely affected patients can benefit from elective liver transplantation,
  which restores hepatic enzymatic activity, improves metabolic stability, and provides
  the theoretical basis for the pursuit of gene therapy as a new treatment for patients.
  Because of the poor outcomes reported in those with OA, especially methylmalonic
  and propionic acidemia, multiple gene therapy approaches have been explored in relevant
  animal models. Here we review the results of gene therapy experiments performed
  using MMA and PA mouse models to illustrate experimental paradigms that could be
  applicable for all forms of OA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights
