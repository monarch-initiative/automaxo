input_text: 'High protein prescription in methylmalonic and propionic acidemia patients
  and its negative association with long-term outcome. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Methylmalonic
  acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) are inborn errors of metabolism. While
  survival of MMA and PA patients has improved in recent decades, long-term outcome
  is still unsatisfactory. A protein restricted diet is the mainstay for treatment.
  Additional amino acid mixtures (AAM) can be prescribed if natural protein is insufficient.
  It is unknown if dietary treatment can have an impact on outcome. DESIGN: We performed
  a nationwide retrospective cohort study and evaluated both longitudinal dietary
  treatment and clinical course of Dutch MMA and PA patients. Protein prescription
  was compared to the recommended daily allowances (RDA); the safe level of protein
  intake as provided by the World Health Organization. The association of longitudinal
  dietary treatment with long-term outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: The cohort included
  76 patients with a median retrospective follow-up period of 15 years (min-max: 0-48
  years) and a total of 1063 patient years on a protein restricted diet. Natural protein
  prescription exceeded the RDA in 37% (470/1287) of all prescriptions and due to
  AAM prescription, the total protein prescription exceeded RDA in 84% (1070/1277).
  Higher protein prescriptions were associated with adverse outcomes in severely affected
  patients. In PA early onset patients a higher natural protein prescription was associated
  with more frequent AMD. In MMA vitamin B12 unresponsive patients, both a higher
  total protein prescription and AAM protein prescription were associated with more
  mitochondrial complications. A higher AAM protein prescription was associated with
  an increased frequency of cognitive impairment in the entire. CONCLUSION: Protein
  intake in excess of recommendations is frequent and is associated with poor outcome.'
