input_text: 'Liver Transplantation in Children With Propionic Acidemia: Medium-Term
  Outcomes. Liver transplantation (LT) for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) is
  an emerging therapeutic option. We present a retrospective review of patients with
  PA who underwent LT at a tertiary liver center between 1995 and 2015. A total of
  14 children were identified (8 males) with median age at initial presentation of
  3 days (range, 0-77 days). Pretransplant median protein restriction was 1 g/kg/day
  (range, 0.63-1.75 g/kg/day), 71% required supportive feeding, and 86% had developmental
  delay. Frequent metabolic decompensations (MDs) were the main indication for LT
  with a median age at transplantation of 2.4 years (range, 0.8-7.1 years). Only 1
  graft was from a living donor, and 13 were from deceased donors (4 auxiliary). The
  2-year patient survival was 86%, and overall study and graft survival was 79% and
  69%, respectively. Three patients died after LT: at 43 days (biliary peritonitis),
  225 days (acute-on-chronic rejection with multiorgan failure), and 13.5 years (posttransplant
  lymphoproliferative disease). Plasma glycine and propionylcarnitine remained elevated
  but reduced after transplant. Of 11 survivors, 5 had at least 1 episode of acute
  cellular rejection, 2 sustained a metabolic stroke (with full recovery), and 3 developed
  mild cardiomyopathy after LT. All have liberalized protein intake, and 9 had no
  further MDs: median episodes before transplant, 4 (range, 1-30); and median episodes
  after transplant, 0 (range, 0-5). All survivors made some developmental progress
  after LT, and none worsened at a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 2-23 years).
  LT in PA significantly reduces the frequency of MDs, can liberalize protein intake
  and improve quality of life, and should continue to be considered in selected cases.'
