input_text: 'Methylmalonic and propionic acidemias: clinical management update. PURPOSE
  OF REVIEW: Recent clinical studies and management guidelines for the treatment of
  the organic acidopathies methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia address
  the scope of interventions to maximize health and quality of life. Unfortunately,
  these disorders continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality due to acute
  and chronic systemic and end-organ injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary management with
  medical foods has been a mainstay of therapy for decades, yet well controlled patients
  can manifest growth, development, cardiac, ophthalmological, renal, and neurological
  complications. Patients with organic acidopathies suffer metabolic brain injury
  that targets specific regions of the basal ganglia in a distinctive pattern, and
  these injuries may occur even with optimal management during metabolic stress. Liver
  transplantation has improved quality of life and metabolic stability, yet transplantation
  in this population does not entirely prevent brain injury or the development of
  optic neuropathy and cardiac disease. SUMMARY: Management guidelines should identify
  necessary screening for patients with methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia,
  and improve anticipatory management of progressive end-organ disease. Liver transplantation
  improves overall metabolic control, but injury to nonregenerative tissues may not
  be mitigated. Continued use of medical foods in these patients requires prospective
  studies to demonstrate evidence of benefit in a controlled manner.'
