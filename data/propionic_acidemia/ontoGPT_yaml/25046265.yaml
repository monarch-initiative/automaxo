input_text: Effects of adeno-associated virus serotype and tissue-specific expression
  on circulating biomarkers of propionic acidemia. Propionic acidemia (PA) is an autosomal
  recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase
  (PCC). This enzyme is composed of six PCCA and six PCCB subunits and mediates a
  critical step in catabolism of odd chain fatty acids and certain amino acids. Current
  treatment options for PA are limited to stringent dietary restriction of protein
  consumption and some patients undergo elective liver transplantation. We previously
  generated a hypomorphic model of PA, designated Pcca(-/-)(A138T), with 2% of wild-type
  enzyme activity that mimics many aspects of the human disease. In this study, we
  used the differing tissue tropisms of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to probe the
  ability of liver or muscle-directed gene therapy to treat systemic aspects of this
  disease that affects many cell types. Systemic therapy with muscle-biased AAV1,
  liver-biased AAV8, and broadly tropic AAVrh10 mediated significant biochemical corrections
  in circulating propionylcarnitine (C3) and methyl citrate by all vectors. The innate
  tissue bias of AAV1 and AAV8 gene expression was made more specific by the use of
  muscle-specific muscle creatine kinase (specifically MCK6) and hepatocyte-specific
  transthyretin (TTR) promoters, respectively. Under these targeted conditions, both
  vectors mediated significant long-term correction of circulating metabolites, demonstrating
  that correction of muscle and likely other tissue types in addition to liver is
  necessary to fully correct pathology caused by PA. Liver-specific AAV8-TTR-PCCA
  mediated better correction than AAV1-MCK-PCCA. These data suggest that targeted
  gene therapy may be a viable alternative to liver transplantation for PA. They also
  demonstrate the effects of tissue-specific and broad gene therapy on a cell autonomous
  systemic genetic disease.
