input_text: 'Effects of medical food leucine content in the management of methylmalonic
  and propionic acidemias. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review highlights the varied
  effects of medical foods high in leucine (Leu) and devoid of valine (Val) and isoleucine
  (Ile) in the management of methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia and
  cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency, aiming to advance dietary practices. RECENT FINDINGS:
  Leu is a key metabolic regulator with a multitude of effects on different organ
  systems. Recent observational studies have demonstrated that these effects can have
  unintended consequences in patients with MMA as a result of liberal use of medical
  foods. The combination of protein restriction and medical food use in MMA and propionic
  acidemia results in an imbalanced branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) dietary content
  with a high Leu-to-Val and/or Ile ratio. This leads to decreased plasma levels of
  Val and Ile and predicts impaired brain uptake of multiple essential amino acids.
  Decreased transport of methionine (Met) across the blood-brain barrier due to high
  circulating Leu levels is of particular concern in cblC deficiency in which endogenous
  Met synthesis is impaired. SUMMARY: Investigations into the optimal composition
  of medical foods for MMA and propionic acidemia, and potential scenarios in which
  Leu supplementation may be beneficial are needed. Until then, MMA/propionic acidemia
  medical foods should be used judiciously in the dietary management of these patients
  and avoided altogether in cblC deficiency.'
