input_text: 'Severity modeling of propionic acidemia using clinical and laboratory
  biomarkers. PURPOSE: To conduct a proof-of-principle study to identify subtypes
  of propionic acidemia (PA) and associated biomarkers. METHODS: Data from a clinically
  diverse PA patient population ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02890342
  ) were used to train and test machine learning models, identify PA-relevant biomarkers,
  and perform validation analysis using data from liver-transplanted participants.
  k-Means clustering was used to test for the existence of PA subtypes. Expert knowledge
  was used to define PA subtypes (mild and severe). Given expert classification, supervised
  machine learning (support vector machine with a polynomial kernel, svmPoly) performed
  dimensional reduction to define relevant features of each PA subtype. RESULTS: Forty
  participants enrolled in the study; five underwent liver transplant. Analysis with
  k-means clustering indicated that several PA subtypes may exist on the biochemical
  continuum. The conventional PA biomarkers, plasma total 2-methylctirate and propionylcarnitine,
  were not statistically significantly different between nontransplanted and transplanted
  participants motivating us to search for other biomarkers. Unbiased dimensional
  reduction using svmPoly revealed that plasma transthyretin, alanine:serine ratio,
  GDF15, FGF21, and in vivo 1-13C-propionate oxidation, play roles in defining PA
  subtypes. CONCLUSION: Support vector machine prioritized biomarkers that helped
  classify propionic acidemia patients according to severity subtypes, with important
  ramifications for future clinical trials and management of PA.'
