input_text: 'Evaluation of long-term effectiveness of the use of carglumic acid in
  patients with propionic acidemia (PA) or methylmalonic acidemia (MMA): study protocol
  for a randomized controlled trial. INTRODUCTION: Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic
  acidemia (MMA) are rare autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism characterized
  by hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) dysfunction. Carglumic
  acid (Carbaglu ; Orphan Europe Ltd.) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
  (USFDA) for the treatment of hyperammonemia due hepatic NAGS deficiency. Here we
  report the rationale and design of a phase IIIb trial that is aimed at determining
  the long-term efficacy and safety of carglumic acid in the management of PA and
  MMA. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group
  phase IIIb study will be conducted in Saudi Arabia. Patients with PA or MMA (<=15
  years of age) will be randomized 1:1 to receive twice daily carglumic acid (50 mg/kg/day)
  plus standard therapy (protein-restricted diet, L-carnitine, and metronidazole)
  or standard therapy alone for a 2-year treatment period. The primary efficacy outcome
  is the number of emergency room visits due to hyperammonemia. Safety will be assessed
  throughout the study and during the 1 month follow-up period after the study. DISCUSSION:
  Current guidelines recommend conservative medical treatment as the main strategy
  for the management of PA and MMA. Although retrospective studies have suggested
  that long-term carglumic acid may be beneficial in the management of PA and MMA,
  current literature lacks evidence for this indication. This clinical trial will
  determine the long-term safety and efficacy of carglumic acid in the management
  of PA and MMA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: King Abdullah International Medical Research
