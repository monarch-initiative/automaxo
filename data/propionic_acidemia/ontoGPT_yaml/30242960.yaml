input_text: The Role of Liver Transplantation in Propionic Acidemia. Despite optimal
  medical treatment and strict low-protein diet, the prognosis of propionic acidemia
  (PA) patients is generally poor. We aim to report our experience with liver transplantation
  (LT) in the management of PA patients. Six patients with PA received a LT at a mean
  age of 5.2 years (1.3-7.5 years). The indications for LT were frequent metabolic
  decompensations in the first 4 patients and preventative in the last 2 patients.
  Two patients presented hepatic artery thromboses that were solved through an interventional
  radiologist approach. These patients showed a very high procoagulant state that
  was observed by thromboelastography. Arterial vasospasm without thrombus was observed
  in 2 patients during the LT surgery. In order to avoid hepatic artery thrombosis,
  an arterial conduit from the recipient aorta to the hepatic artery of the donor
  was used in the fifth patient. After LT, patients presented improvement in propionyl
  byproducts without complete normalization, but no decompensations have been observed.
  In conclusion, LT could be a good therapeutic option to improve the metabolic control
  and the quality of life of PA patients. Improved surgical strategies along with
  new techniques of interventional radiology allow us to perform the LT minimizing
  the complications derived from the higher risk of hepatic artery thrombosis.
