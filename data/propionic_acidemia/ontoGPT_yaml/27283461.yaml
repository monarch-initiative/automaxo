input_text: Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis Via Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
  Pump for Treatment of Hyperammonemia Secondary to Propionic Acidemia in Monochorionic
  Diamniotic Twin Boys. Late-preterm twins with propionic acidemia developed severe
  hyperammonemic encephalopathy at 5 days of age. Continuous venovenous hemodialysis
  was performed successfully for both infants via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
  pump, and both rapidly improved. They were taken off continuous venovenous hemodialysis
  and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and discharged with dietary therapy. At
  3 years of age, neurodevelopment showed globally delayed milestones.
