input_text: 'Propionic acidemia identified in twin siblings conceived by in vitro
  fertilization (IVF) with parents who were unknown carriers of a PCCA mutation. BACKGROUND:
  Propionic acidemia (PA) is a severe monogenic disorder characterized by a deficiency
  of the mitochondrial protein propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) enzyme, which is caused
  by mutations in the PCCA or PCCB gene. Preconception carrier screening could provide
  couples with meaningful information for their reproductive options; however, it
  is not widely performed in China. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes a case
  of dizygotic twin siblings conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) and diagnosed
  with propionic acidemia (PA). Their parents had no history of PA. Tandem mass spectrometry
  and urine gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the twin siblings revealed
  markedly elevated propionyl carnitine (C3), C3/C2, and 3-hydroxypropionate in the
  plasma and urine. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for the twin siblings. A
  homozygous missense mutation, c.2002G > A (p.Gly668Arg) in PCCA, was identified
  in the twin siblings. Sanger sequencing confirmed the homozygous mutation in the
  twin siblings and identified their parents as heterozygous carriers of the c.2002G
  > A mutation in PCCA. Both neonates in this case died. This is an emotionally and
  financially devastating outcome that could have been avoided with genetic carrier
  screening before conception. If couples are screened before IVF and found to be
  silent carriers, then reproductive options (such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis
  or prenatal diagnosis) can be offered to achieve a healthy newborn. CONCLUSION:
  This case is a reminder to infertile couples seeking IVF that it is beneficial to
  clarify whether they are silent carriers before undergoing IVF.'
