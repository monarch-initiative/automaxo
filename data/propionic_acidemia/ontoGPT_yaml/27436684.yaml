input_text: 'Antibody-mediated rejection after ABO-incompatible pediatric living donor
  liver transplantation for propionic acidemia: A case report. We herein present the
  case of a four-yr-old boy with PA who developed AMR after ABO-incompatible LDLT
  despite undergoing B cell desensitization using rituximab. Although the CD19+ lymphocyte
  count decreased to 0.1% nine days after the administration of rituximab, he developed
  a high fever which was accompanied by arthralgia due to a streptococcal infection
  13 days after rituximab prophylaxis. After the clearance of the infection, he underwent
  ABO-incompatible LDLT 36 days after the administration of rituximab. The CD19+ lymphocyte
  count just prior to LDLT was 1.2%. He developed AMR five days after LDLT, and the
  antidonor-type IgM and IgG antibody titers increased to 1:1024 and 1:1024, respectively.
  He was treated by plasma exchange, IVIG, steroid pulse therapy, and rituximab re-administration;
  however, his liver dysfunction continued. Despite intensive treatment, he died due
  to complicated abdominal hernia, acute renal failure, and ARDS. This case suggests
  that a streptococcal infection may induce the activation of innate immune responses;
  thus, additional desensitization therapy should be considered prior to ABO-incompatible
  LDLT if B cell reactivation is suspected. '
