input_text: 'Early and late complications after liver transplantation for propionic
  acidemia in children: a two centers study. Propionic acidemia (PA) is a severe metabolic
  disorder with cardiac and neurologic complications and a poor quality of life. Liver
  transplantation (LT) was thus proposed in PA to increase enzyme activity. We studied
  retrospectively LT in PA in two European centers. Twelve patients underwent 17 LTs
  between 1991 and 2013. They developed severe, unusual and unexpected complications,
  with high mortality (58%). When present, the cardiomyopathy resolved and no acute
  metabolic decompensation occurred allowing dietary relaxation. Renal failure was
  present in half of the patients before LT and worsened in all of them. We suggest
  that cardiac and renal functions should be assessed before LT and monitored closely
  afterward. A renal sparing immunosuppression should be used. We speculate that some
  complications may be related to accumulated toxicity of the disease and that earlier
  LT could prevent some of these consequences. As kidney transplantation has been
  performed successfully in methylmalonic acidemia, a metabolic disease in the same
  biochemical pathway, the choice of the organ to transplant could be further discussed.'
