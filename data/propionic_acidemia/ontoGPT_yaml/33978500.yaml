input_text: 'Anesthetic Management for Pediatric Liver Transplantation in a Patient
  With Propionic Acidemia: A Case Report. Propionic acidemia is an inborn error of
  metabolism characterized by accumulation of propionic acid due to deficiency of
  propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Main stay of treatment focuses on reducing dietary protein.
  However, orthotropic liver transplantation decreases the frequency of metabolic
  decompensations and improves life expectancy. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy
  undergoing orthotropic liver transplantation to treat propionic acidemia. This case
  highlights the use of intraoperative monitoring of metabolic markers like urine
  ketones, arterial ammonia, and lactate levels as these patients are at risk for
  hyperammonemia and metabolic acidosis. Also, the relevance in outcomes when performing
  early extubation in fast-tracking recovery.'
