input_text: 'Peripheral venous route for administration of ammonul infusion for treatment
  of acute hyperammonemia. An experience from a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES:
  To determine the local effects of peripheral Ammonul infusion on the skin and the
  subcutaneous tissues.  Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at Prince
  Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All children less than 16 years
  of age admitted between December 2015 and October 2018 with hyperammonemia and received
  Ammonul infusion for treatment were recruited. Results: Twenty-one patients received
  the Ammonul infusion. They were admitted 58 times with acute hyperammonemia during
  the study period, with an average of 2.8 admissions per patient. The mean age of
  the included patients was 49.5 months. The most frequent underlying diagnoses were
  propionic acidemia (n=9), urea cycle disorders (n=5), and intrinsic liver disease
  (n=3). All participants received Ammonul through peripheral lines except 3 who received
  it through central lines. No extravasation, burns, or other local side effects were
  observed in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This data indicate that the use of Ammonul
  through a peripheral venous route appears to be safe and not associated with infusion-related
  local adverse effects.'
