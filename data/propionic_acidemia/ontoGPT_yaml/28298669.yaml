input_text: Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Continuous Renal Replacement
  in a Neonate with Propionic Acidemia. The usual indications for extra corporeal
  membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are for respiratory or cardiac failure. Although continuous
  renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is frequently used when patients are on ECMO, the
  need for CRRT as the primary indication for ECMO is rare. A case of a neonate placed
  onto veno-venous ECMO for the use of CRRT to treat hyperammonemia from propionic
  acidemia is presented.
