input_text: 'Liver Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia: A Multicenter-linked Database
  Analysis. OBJECTIVES: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare inborn error of metabolism
  resulting from deficiency in the enzyme necessary for catabolism of branched-chain
  amino acids, some odd chain fatty acids and cholesterol. Despite optimal medical
  management, PA often leads to acute and progressive neurological injury. Reports
  on liver transplantation (LT) as a cellular therapy are limited and varied. The
  objective of this study was to examine the largest collection of patients who underwent
  LT for PA. METHODS: Examining the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and
  the Pediatric Health Information System administrative billing databases, we performed
  a multicenter, retrospective analysis of LT over a 16-year period. During this period,
  4849 pediatric LT were performed out of which 23 were done for PA at 10 different
  centers. RESULTS: The majority of recipients were 5 years of age or younger and
  had status 1b exception points at the time of transplant. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year
  graft survival for PA LT recipients was 84.6% and the 1-, 3, and 5-year patient
  survival was 89.5%. There was no significant difference in graft or patient survival
  between PA and non-PA LT recipients. Despite historical data to the contrary, we
  did not find an increased incidence of hepatic arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing
  LT for PA. Patients in the PA LT group, however, had a significantly higher postoperative
  rate of readmission compared with the non-PA LT group (90.5% vs 72.8%, P = 0.021).
  CONCLUSION: LT for children with PA is a viable treatment option with acceptable
  outcomes.'
