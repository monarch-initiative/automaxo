input_text: Rhabdomyolysis in organic acidemia patients manifesting with metabolic
  decompensation. Several metabolic disorders are related to rhabdomyolysis, but their
  association with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) is unclear.
  Eleven patients with MMA and four patients with PA were treated and/or followed
  up in Kumamoto University Hospital between January 2009 and December 2018. Three
  patients with MMA and one patient with PA developed rhabdomyolysis at 1-2 weeks
  after onset of metabolic crisis. Cases 1 and 4 initially developed rhabdomyolysis
  after withdrawal from continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), and cases 2 and 3 developed
  rhabdomyolysis at the time of onset and had recurrent rhabdomyolysis during the
  recovery phase after withdrawal from CHDF. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated
  with rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis in patients with MMA and PA may have been
  attributed to a defect in energy production because of a secondary mitochondrial
  disorder. Therefore, physicians should closely follow patients with MMA and PA,
  especially after withdrawal of hemodialysis therapy, and provide supportive care
  for their mitochondrial function.
