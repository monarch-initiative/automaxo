input_text: 'Long-term continuous N-carbamylglutamate treatment in frequently decompensated
  propionic acidemia: a case report. BACKGROUND: Propionic acidemia is a rare autosomal
  recessive inherited metabolic disorder that can inhibit the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate,
  the obligatory activator in urea synthesis, leading to hyperammonemia. N-carbamylglutamate
  ameliorates hyperammonemia in decompensated propionic acidemia. The effects of long-term
  continuous N-acetylglutamate administration in such patients are unknown. We report
  our clinical experience with continuous administration of N-acetylglutamate for
  6 years in a patient with propionic acidemia frequently presenting with hyperammonemia.
  CASE PRESENTATION: A male Caucasian patient with frequently decompensated propionic
  acidemia and hyperammonemia was admitted 78 times for acute attacks during the first
  9 years of his life. Continuous daily treatment with oral N-carbamylglutamate 100
  mg/kg (50 mg/kg after 6 months) was initiated. During 6 years of treatment, he had
  a significant decrease in his mean plasma ammonia levels (75.7 mumol/L vs. 140.3
  mumol/L before N-carbamylglutamate therapy, p < 0.005 [normal range 50-80 mumol/L])
  and fewer acute episodes (two in 6 years). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a benefit
  of N-acetylglutamate administration outside the emergency setting. If this observation
  is confirmed, future studies should aim to optimize the dosage and explore effects
  of the dosage requirements on other drugs and on protein tolerance.'
