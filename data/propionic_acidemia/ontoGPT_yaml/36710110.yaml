input_text: Combined heart and liver transplantation in a patient supported by left
  ventricular assist device (LVAD) with propionic acidemia. Propionic acidemia (PA)
  is a rare inherited metabolic disease due to inborn errors of metabolism. PA results
  in the accumulation of abnormal organic acid metabolites in multiple systems, mainly
  the central nervous system and the heart. Cardiac complications include dilated
  cardiomyopathy (DCM) and carry a 40-50% increased mortality risk. Liver transplantation
  (LT) is required in PA patients when medical treatment fails and may prevent or
  slow down the cardiomyopathy progression. However, severe heart disease may be a
  serious contraindication to LT. We present a complicated case of a PA patient, supported
  with a Left Ventricular Assist Device, who underwent a heart and Liver transplant.
  PA patients are at increased risk for metabolic acidosis during surgery, with increased
  anion gap and hyperammonemia. A strict multi-disciplinary approach is needed to
  prevent and treat metabolic decompensation. The patient had a successful heart and
  liver transplant after a strict treatment protocol in the pre, intra, and post-operative
  periods. His case highlights the complexity of PA patients and the increased risk
  for metabolic decompensation during surgery and provides an insight into how to
  manage such complicated patients.
