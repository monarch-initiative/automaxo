input_text: 'Liver transplantation in propionic and methylmalonic acidemia: A single
  center study with literature review. BACKGROUND: Organic acidemias, especially propionic
  acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), may manifest clinically within the
  first few hours to days of life. The classic presentation in the newborn period
  includes metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia that is precipitated
  by unrestricted protein intake. Implementation of newborn screening to diagnose
  and initiate early treatment has facilitated a reduction in neonatal mortality and
  improved survival. Despite early diagnosis and appropriate management, these individuals
  are prone to have recurrent episodes of metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia resulting
  in frequent hospitalizations. Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as a
  treatment modality to reduce metabolic decompensations which are not controlled
  by medical management. Published reports on the outcome of LT show heterogeneous
  results regarding clinical and biochemical features in the post transplantation
  period. As a result, we evaluated the outcomes of LT in our institution and compared
  it to the previously published data. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective
  chart review of nine individuals with PA or MMA who underwent LT and two individuals
  with MMA who underwent LT and kidney transplantation (KT). Data including number
  of hospitalizations, laboratory measures, cardiac and neurological outcomes, dietary
  protein intake, and growth parameters were collected. RESULTS: The median age of
  transplantation for subjects with MMA was 7.2 years with a median follow up of 4.3
  years. The median age of transplantation for subjects with PA was 1.9 years with
  a median follow up of 5.4 years. The survival rate at 1 year and 5 years post-LT
  was 100%. Most of our subjects did not have any episodes of hyperammonemia or pancreatitis
  post-LT. There was significant reduction in plasma glycine post-LT. One subject
  developed mild elevation in ammonia post-LT on an unrestricted protein diet, suggesting
  that protein restriction may be indicated even after LT. CONCLUSION: In a large
  single center study of LT in MMA and PA, we show that LT may reduce the incidence
  of metabolic decompensation. Moreover, our data suggest that LT may be associated
  with reduced number of hospitalizations and improved linear growth in individuals
  with PA and MMA.'
