input_text: 'Detecting Graft-Derived Cell-Free DNA Through Amplification Refractory
  Mutation System Polymerase Chain Reaction in Living-Donor Liver Transplantation:
  Report of 2 Cases. Graft-derived cell-free DNA (Gcf-DNA) is a non-invasive biomarker
  to monitor graft function. There are different methods to quantify Gcf-DNA, such
  as the classical Y-chromosome method and the latest digital droplet polymerase chain
  reaction method. In this study, we reported 2 patients genetically diagnosed with
  propionic acidemia (PA) went through living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT),
  and monitoring the change of Gcf-DNA examined by the amplification refractory mutation
  system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Two patients went through the
  operation successfully, and a 5 mL whole blood specimen was collected at 6 specific
  time points (day 0, day 1, day 7, day 14, day 30, day 60). The comparison of Gcf-DNA
  and the routine liver function showed that they have similar change-tendency curves,
  with the curves reaching the top at day 1 because of ischemia-reperfusion injury
  and generally declining from day 7-day 60 along with recovery of the patient. Applying
  the ARMS-PCR method to detect Gcf-DNA can be done without knowing the donor information
  and is not limited by donor-recipient-sex-mismatch condition. In conclusion, Gcf-DNA
  is a promising biomarker that can monitor graft function in LDLT, and we will apply
  it in more samples and observe it long term to validate its efficiency in the future.'
