input_text: Cost-effectiveness of liver transplantation in methylmalonic and propionic
  acidemias. Propionic acidemia (PA) and classical methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are
  rare inborn errors of metabolism that can cause early mortality and significant
  morbidity. The mainstay of disease management is lifelong protein restriction. As
  an alternative, liver transplantation (LT) may improve survival, quality of life,
  and prevent further neurological deterioration. The aim of our study was to estimate
  the incremental costs and outcomes of LT versus nutritional support in patients
  with early-onset MMA or PA. We constructed a Markov model to simulate and compare
  life expectancies, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime direct and
  indirect costs for a cohort of newborns with MMA or PA who could either receive
  LT or be maintained on conventional nutritional support. We conducted a series of
  1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base case, LT on average resulted
  in 1.5 more life years lived, 7.9 more QALYs, and a savings of $582,369 for lifetime
  societal cost per individual compared to nutritional support. LT remained more effective
  and less costly in all 1-way sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity
  analysis, LT was cost-effective at the $100,000/QALY threshold in more than 90%
  of the simulations and cost-saving in over half of the simulations. LT is likely
  a dominant treatment strategy compared to nutritional support in newborns with classical
  MMA or PA.
