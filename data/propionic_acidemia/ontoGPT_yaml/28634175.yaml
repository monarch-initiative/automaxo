input_text: 'Inter-relations between 3-hydroxypropionate and propionate metabolism
  in rat liver: relevance to disorders of propionyl-CoA metabolism. Propionate, 3-hydroxypropionate
  (3HP), methylcitrate, related compounds, and ammonium accumulate in body fluids
  of patients with disorders of propionyl-CoA metabolism, such as propionic acidemia.
  Although liver transplantation alleviates hyperammonemia, high concentrations of
  propionate, 3HP, and methylcitrate persist in body fluids. We hypothesized that
  conserved metabolic perturbations occurring in transplanted patients result from
  the simultaneous presence of propionate and 3HP in body fluids. We investigated
  the inter-relations of propionate and 3HP metabolism in perfused livers from normal
  rats using metabolomic and stable isotopic technologies. In the presence of propionate,
  3HP, or both, we observed the following metabolic perturbations. First, the citric
  acid cycle (CAC) is overloaded but does not provide sufficient reducing equivalents
  to the respiratory chain to maintain the homeostasis of adenine nucleotides. Second,
  there is major CoA trapping in the propionyl-CoA pathway and a tripling of liver
  total CoA within 1 h. Third, liver proteolysis is stimulated. Fourth, propionate
  inhibits the conversion of 3HP to acetyl-CoA and its oxidation in the CAC. Fifth,
  some propionate and some 3HP are converted to nephrotoxic maleate by different processes.
  Our data have implications for the clinical management of propionic acidemia. They
  also emphasize the perturbations of the liver intermediary metabolism induced by
  supraphysiological, i.e., millimolar, concentrations of labeled propionate used
  to trace the intermediary metabolism, in particular, inhibition of CAC flux and
  major decreases in the [ATP]/[ADP] and [ATP]/[AMP] ratios.'
