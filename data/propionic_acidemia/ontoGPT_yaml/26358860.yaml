input_text: 'Reversal of cardiomyopathy in propionic acidemia after liver transplantation:
  a 10-year follow-up. Cardiomyopathy is a frequent complication in propionic acidemia.
  It is mostly rapidly fatal and independent of the metabolic control or medical intervention.
  Here, we present the reversal of a severe cardiomyopathy after liver transplantation
  in a patient with propionic acidemia and the long-term stability after ten years.
  Liver transplantation in patients with propionic acidemia may be considered a valid
  and long-lasting treatment when cardiomyopathy is progressive and unresponsive to
  medical therapy. '
