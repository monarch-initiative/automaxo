input_text: Treatment with antioxidants ameliorates oxidative damage in a mouse model
  of propionic acidemia. Oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of propionic
  acidemia (PA), a life threatening disease caused by the deficiency of propionyl
  CoA-carboxylase, in the catabolic pathway of branched-chain amino acids, odd-number
  chain fatty acids and cholesterol. Patients develop multisystemic complications
  including seizures, extrapyramidal symptoms, basal ganglia deterioration, pancreatitis
  and cardiomyopathy. The accumulation of toxic metabolites results in mitochondrial
  dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage, all of which
  have been documented in patients' samples and in a hypomorphic mouse model. Here
  we set out to investigate whether treatment with a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant,
  MitoQ, or with the natural polyphenol resveratrol, which is reported to have antioxidant
  and mitochondrial activation properties, could ameliorate the altered redox status
  and its functional consequences in the PA mouse model. The results show that oral
  treatment with MitoQ or resveratrol decreases lipid peroxidation and the expression
  levels of DNA repair enzyme OGG1 in PA mouse liver, as well as inducing tissue-specific
  changes in the expression of antioxidant enzymes. Notably, treatment decreased the
  cardiac hypertrophy marker BNP that is found upregulated in the PA mouse heart.
  Overall, the results provide in vivo evidence to justify more in depth investigations
  of antioxidants as adjuvant therapy in PA.
