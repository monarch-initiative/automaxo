25698650	Clinical features of primary ciliary dyskinesia in Cyprus with emphasis on lobectomized patients.	BACKGROUND: Despite the manifestations of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in early life, the diagnosis is often much delayed. Since 1998 in Cyprus, we have established the only national diagnostic and clinical referral center for PCD. OBJECTIVE: To review the phenotypic features at presentation of PCD patients in Cyprus in relation to age at diagnosis, with emphasis on previously lobectomised patients. METHODS: The medical records of the diagnosed PCD patients were retrospectively reviewed to obtain clinical data on presentation. RESULTS: Thirty patients, aged 13.9 years (range 0.1, 58.4 years), were diagnosed with PCD. Twelve of them presented after the age of 18. The most common manifestations were chronic cough (100%), chronic rhinorrhea (96.7%), sputum production (92.9%), laterality defects (63.3%), a history of pneumonia (53.3%) and neonatal respiratory distress (50%). A history of lobectomy in the past was recorded in 16.7% (5 patients). Patients who presented in adulthood had significantly higher frequency of lobectomy (41.7% vs 0%, p-value = 0.006) and had more frequently low FEV1 (58.3% vs 0%, p-value = 0.015) than those who presented before. Serial measurements of FEV1 and FVC indicated significantly lower intercepts in lobectomised compared to the adult non-lobectomised patients both in terms of FEV1 (-4.90 vs -1.80, p-value = 0.022) and FVC (-5.43 vs -1.91, p-value = 0.029) z-score levels. Change in FEV1 and FVC across time was not statistically significant in either group. CONCLUSIONS: PCD often remains undiagnosed up to adulthood accompanied by appearance of advanced lung disease. Performance of lobectomies seems to be a poor prognostic factor for PCD in adulthood.
20557016	[Primary ciliary dyskinesia in highlights of consensus statement. Presentation of pediatric cases].	UNLABELLED: Cilia are evolutionarily conserved structures that play a role in diverse cell types. Motile cilia are involved in the most prominent ciliopathy called primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which combines oto-sino-pulmonary symptoms (impaired mucociliary clearance that is important innate defense mechanism), male infertility and in nearly 50% cases situs inversus. Disease is usually inherited as autosomal recessive disorder, concerning mainly outer and/or inner dynein arms of cilia. Diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of characteristic clinical phenotype and confirmation the diagnosis by either identification of specific defect in electron microscopy or other evidence of abnormal ciliary function. The diagnosis of PCD may be delayed, missed or made incorrectly. The first ERS consensus statement which formulates recommendations regarding diagnostic as well as therapeutic approaches to children with PCD, is a very helpful tool in the management of this patients. We present our own experience with three children with PCD diagnosed in our Department. CONCLUSION: in children with clinical symptoms suggesting PCD, even with negative screening tests, the estimation of specific cilia defect in electron microscopy is indicated.
25860493	[Orphan disease of the nose and paranasal sinuses].	Rare rhinological diseases are a diagnostic challenge. From the primary manifestation until the final diagnosis it may take several months or even up to years in which the disease progress is uncontrolled and the disease insufficiently treated. This results in (irreversible) damage and possibly life-threatening situations. The unexpected course of a (misdiagnosed) disease should lead to further diagnostic considerations and steps to detect the orphan disease at a stage as early as possible. In the present work granulomatous diseases of the nose and sinuses caused by mycobacteria, treponemes, klebsiella, fungi and protozoa as well as vasculitis, sarcoidosis, rosacea, the cocaine-induced midline destruction, the nasal extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and cholesterol granuloma are discussed. Furthermore diseases with disorders of mucociliary clearance as the primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis are presented taking into account the current literature. 
19794381	Recurrent peptic ulcer disease in a pediatric patient with type 1 neurofibromatosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder with characteristic features of skin and central nervous system involvement. Gastrointestinal complications are rare, especially during childhood. In adults, only two cases of peptic ulcer have been reported in neurofibromatosis, both due to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) may be primary or secondary in nature and it may be life threatening in the acute phase due to the risk of perforation. A case of recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a child with systemic neurofibromatosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is presented. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of multiple gastric ulcers. The ulcers scarred after the long-term administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but recurred after the suspension. Laboratory and imaging studies excluded Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other known causes of PUD, suggesting a potential role of neurofibromatosis itself and primary ciliary dyskinesia in developing of recurrent PUD. As early diagnosis of PUD is vital for patient survival, this case report highlights the possible association of neurofibromatosis and PCD with this condition, responsive to PPI therapy and the potential need of gastric protection before complications arise.

19410202	Management of primary ciliary dyskinesia: the lower airways.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disease associated with defective ciliary structure and function. Chronic oto-sino-pulmonary infection is the most common clinical presentation. Patients should be monitored in centres with expertise in PCD. Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions. Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways. Importantly in PCD, respiratory disease may be controlled with the use of early, adequate and aggressive management.
23871404	[Congenital ciliary dyskinesia. Focus].	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, caused by specific primary structural and/or functional abnormalities of the motile cilia. Prevalence, about 1/15,000 to 1/30,000, is probably underestimated, as diagnosis might not be evocated in absence of Kartagener syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed in presence of abnormal ciliary motility as well as ciliary ultrastructure. Disease-causing mutations in at least 16 genes have already been identified; analysis will be guided by the type of ultrastructural abnormalities. An early and adequate diagnosis and therapy can theoretically improve the prognosis of the disease. 
38568462	Novel SPEF2 variants cause male infertility and likely primary ciliary dyskinesia.	PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify the genetic causes of male infertility and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)/PCD-like phenotypes in three unrelated Han Chinese families. METHODS: We conducted whole-exome sequencing of three patients with male infertility and PCD/PCD-like phenotypes from three unrelated Chinese families. Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patient spermatozoa and respiratory cilia and in vitro analyses were performed to analyze the effects of SPEF2 variants. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was administered to three affected patients. RESULTS: We identified four novel SPEF2 variants, including one novel homozygous splicing site variant [NC_000005.10(NM_024867.4): c.4447 + 1G > A] of the SPEF2 gene in family 1, novel compound heterozygous nonsense variants [NC_000005.10(NM_024867.4): c.1339C > T (p.R447*) and NC_000005.10(NM_024867.4): c.1645G > T (p.E549*)] in family 2, and one novel homozygous missense variant [NC_000005.10(NM_024867.4): c.2524G > A (p.D842N)] in family 3. All the patients presented with male infertility and PCD/likely PCD. All variants were present at very low levels in public databases, predicted to be deleterious in silico prediction tools, and were further confirmed deleterious by in vitro analyses. Ultrastructural analyses of the spermatozoa of the patients revealed the absence of the central pair complex in the sperm flagella. Immunostaining of the spermatozoa and respiratory cilia of the patients validated the pathogenicity of the SPEF2 variants. All patients carrying SPEF2 variants underwent one ICSI cycle and delivered healthy infants. CONCLUSION: Our study reported four novel pathogenic variants of SPEF2 in three male patients with infertility and PCD/PCD-like phenotypes, which not only extend the spectrum of SPEF2 mutations but also provide information for genetic counseling and treatment of such conditions.
32522973	Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia as a Cause of Repeating Atelectasis in the Neonatal Period.	BACKGROUND Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a disease characterized by motor ciliary dysfunction, which leads to the accumulation of secretions in the lower airways and, consequently, to atelectasis and repeated infections. During the neonatal period, diagnosis can be difficult because the symptoms are frequently associated with other respiratory diseases common in neonates. The laterality defects should warn the clinician of the need for further investigation using clinical criteria, but the confirmation depends on a genetic test. CASE REPORT The objective of this report is to present a case of PCD manifesting in the neonatal period that was diagnosed due to respiratory failure associated with recurrent atelectasis and situs inversus totalis. CONCLUSIONS This disease is not well known by neonatologists, but early diagnosis decreases morbidity and improves patient quality of life.
33974255	[Analysis of a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia caused by DNAH5 variants].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). METHODS: High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were carried out to identify pathogenic variant in the patient. Suspected variant was verified by Sanger sequencing among the family members, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was used to achieve the pregnancy. RESULTS: The patient had obstructive azoospermia, measurement of nasal NO exhalation at 84 ppb, and typical symptoms of PCD in nasal sinuses and lungs. DNA sequencing showed that he had carried biallelic variants of the DNAH5 gene, namely c.1489C>T (p.Q497X) in exon 11 and c.6304C>T (p.R2102C) in exon 38. His wife achieved clinical pregnancy with the assistance of ICSI. CONCLUSION: Above finding has enriched the spectrum of DNAH5 gene variants, though the latters did not affect the outcome of pregnancy by ICSI.
36041191	Physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy practices, and nutrition among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland - a cross-sectional survey.	AIMS OF THE STUDY: We know little about the level of physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy practices and nutritional status of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), although these are important aspects of patients with chronic respiratory disease. We assessed physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy practices and nutritional status among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland, investigated how these vary by age and identified factors associated with regular physical activity. METHODS: We sent a postal questionnaire survey to people with primary ciliary dyskinesia enrolled in the Swiss PCD registry (CH-PCD), based on the standardised FOLLOW-PCD patient questionnaire. We collected information about physical activity, physiotherapy, respiratory symptoms and nutritional status. We calculated the metabolic equivalent (MET) to better reflect the intensity of the reported physical activities. To assess nutritional status, we extracted information from CH-PCD and calculated participants' body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Of the 86 questionnaires we sent, 74 (86% response rate) were returned from 24 children and 50 adults. The median age at survey completion was 23 years (IQR [interquartile range] 15-51), and 51% were female. Among all 74 participants, 48 (65%) performed sports regularly. Children were vigorously active (median MET 9.1; IQR 7.9-9.6) and adults were moderately active (median MET 5.5; IQR 4.3-6.9). Fifty-nine participants (80%) reported performing some type of respiratory physiotherapy. However, only 30% of adults saw a professional physiotherapist, compared with 75% of children. Half of the participants had normal BMI; one child (4%) and two adults (4%) were underweight. People who were regularly physically active reported seeing a physiotherapist more often. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to provide patient-reported data about physical activity, respiratory physiotherapy and nutrition among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Our results highlight that professional respiratory physiotherapy, exercise recommendations and nutritional advice are often not implemented in the care of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia in Switzerland. Multidisciplinary care in specialised centres by teams including physiotherapists and nutrition consultants could improve the quality of life of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia.
34941110	CCDC40 mutation as a cause of infertility in a Chinese family with primary ciliary dyskinesia.	TRIAL DESIGN: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetical disease that inherited in an autosomal-recessive way. Its clinical manifestations (such as male infertility) are mainly caused by defects of motion-related cilia that encoded by mutated genes. Although some mutation has been verified, a number of mutations of PCD remain elusive. The main purpose of this study is to identify mutant genes in a Chinese family with PCD, and to verify the safety and effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of infertility caused by PCD. METHODS: Imaging examination was used to exclude pulmonary inflammation and visceral translocation. Semen analysis was used to assess the quality of the proband's sperm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to assess the ultrastructure of flagella and cilia. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing and qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detecting system) were applied to identified mutation of Chinese Family suspected of having PCD. Viable sperm were selected by hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) for ICSI. RESULTS: We report 2 novel mutations in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion) resulted in immobility of sperm and infertility of the proband. These mutations were confirmed in the proband's sister (heterozygous) and his parents (recessive carrier) by Sanger sequencing and qPCR. All the spermatozoa from the proband were immotile. Ultrastructural defects were found in flagella and cilia of proband and his sister. Viable sperms were selected by HOST for ICSI and fertilized 9 of 21 eggs. Two frozen embryos were transplanted and a healthy 3500 g boy was delivered at 40 + 4 weeks' gestation. And then, we summarized the genes related to PCD and the mutant sites of CCDC40 gene. CONCLUSION: We reported 2 novel mutants in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion), which could be candidates for genetic diagnosis in PCD patients. The combination of targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing may be a useful tool to diagnose PCD. ICSI is a considerable method in treatment of infertility caused by PCD.
36919525	Underlying causes and outcomes of recurrent pneumonia in hospitalized children.	OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and underlying causes of recurrent pneumonia (RP) among hospitalized children, and to identify risk factors associated with adverse outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children diagnosed with RP at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 2016 to January 2021 and then described clinical characteristics and underlying causes. The associations between factors and adverse outcomes were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 551 children with RP, 483 (87.7%) manifested underlying causes, with recurrent aspiration (127, 23.0%), primary immunodeficiency (PID) (91, 16.5%), and congenital heart diseases (63, 11.4%) being the most common. Genetic defects were identified in about a quarter (158, 28.7%) of the patients. PID odds ratio (OR, 7.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-22.8), primary ciliary dyskinesia (OR, 12.9; 95% CI, 3.0-54.8), bronchiolitis obliterans (OR, 7.0; 95% CI, 1.7-28.5), and a diagnosis of RP at an age of >3 years (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-9.0) were risk factors for severe outcomes. Aspiration (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and an abnormal family history (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.2) were risk factors for rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The majority (87.7%) of hospitalized children with RP exhibited underlying causes, and genetic defects were common.
24524376	Management of plastic bronchitis with nebulized tissue plasminogen activator: another brick in the wall.	Plastic bronchitis is a rare complication of a variety of respiratory diseases and congenital heart disease surgery, particularly Fontan procedure. Bronchial casts with rubber-like consistency develop acutely and may cause severe life-threatening respiratory distress. The management of plastic bronchitis is yet not well defined. Early intermittent, self-administered nebulization of tissue plasminogen activator was found to be effective in preventing deterioration of acute respiratory symptoms in a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia and recurrent cast formation. Further investigation into new therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease is advocated. 
20884020	Increased postoperative and respiratory complications in patients with congenital heart disease associated with heterotaxy.	OBJECTIVE: Patients with heterotaxy and complex congenital heart disease underwent cardiac surgery with high mortality and morbidity. Recent studies have revealed an association among heterotaxy, congenital heart disease, and primary ciliary dyskinesia. We undertook a retrospective review of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Children's National Medical Center between 2004 and 2008 to explore the hypothesis that there is increased mortality and respiratory complications in heterotaxy patients. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed on postsurgical outcomes of 87 patients with heterotaxy and congenital heart disease exhibiting the full spectrum of situs abnormalities associated with heterotaxy. As controls patients, 634 cardiac surgical patients with congenital heart disease, but without laterality defects, were selected, and surgical complexities were similar with a median Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 score of 3.0 for both groups. RESULTS: We found the mean length of postoperative hospital stay (17 vs 11 days) and mechanical ventilation (11 vs 4 days) were significantly increased in the heterotaxy patients. Also elevated were rates of tracheostomies (6.9% vs 1.6%; odds ratio, 4.6), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (12.6% vs 4.9%: odds ratio, 2.8), prolonged ventilatory courses (23% vs 12.3%; odds ratio, 2.1) and postsurgical deaths (16.1% vs 4.7%; odds ratio, 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show heterotaxy patients had more postsurgical events with increased postsurgical mortality and risk for respiratory complications as compared to control patients with similar Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 surgical complexity scores. We speculate that increased respiratory complications maybe due to ciliary dysfunction. Further studies are needed to explore the basis for the increased surgical risks for heterotaxy patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
31292405	Twenty-year Follow-up of the First Bilateral Living-donor Lobar Lung Transplantation in Japan.	Patients with end-stage lung disease can undergo living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT), with survival rates improving every year. We herein report the 20-year follow-up findings of the first patient who underwent LDLLT in Japan. A 24-year-old woman with primary ciliary dyskinesia became ventilator-dependent after severe respiratory failure and right-sided heart failure following repeated respiratory infections. In 1998, she underwent LDLLT and received her sister's right lower lobe and her mother's left lower lobe. Although the patient required 21 hospitalizations and developed unilateral bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, she is in good physical condition and lives without restriction at 20 years after undergoing LDLLT.
26418604	Diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia: PCD foundation consensus recommendations based on state of the art review.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, rare lung disease resulting in chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease in both children and adults. Many physicians incorrectly diagnose PCD or eliminate PCD from their differential diagnosis due to inexperience with diagnostic testing methods. Thus far, all therapies used for PCD are unproven through large clinical trials. This review article outlines consensus recommendations from PCD physicians in North America who have been engaged in a PCD centered research consortium for the last 10 years. These recommendations have been adopted by the governing board of the PCD Foundation to provide guidance for PCD clinical centers for diagnostic testing, monitoring, and appropriate short and long-term therapeutics in PCD patients.
24156703	Growing up with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia in Bradford, UK: exploring patients experiences as a physiotherapist.	Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a condition which causes impaired mucociliary clearance, resulting in sputum retention and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Physiotherapy, in the form of airway clearance techniques and exercise is recommended to patients with PCD to facilitate sputum clearance. As children diagnosed with PCD develop into adults, understanding their experiences of growing up with this long-term condition and undertaking physiotherapy may help to provide insight to clinicians. No previous research has been published which explores the lived experiences of children and young people with PCD. The prevalence of PCD in Bradford in the North of the UK is unusually high, signifying the importance of understanding the experiences of this patient population. This qualitative study used Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis to allow the researcher, as a physiotherapist, to investigate the lived experiences of five paediatric patients with PCD. While patients' experiences are all unique, three themes emerged across the analysis of the interviews: (1) the experiences of day to day life with the symptoms and treatment burden of PCD; (2) participants' awareness of their own symptoms and knowledge of PCD; and (3) the development of mastery skills and devolution of management from the family to the growing child. The results from this study suggested that facilitation of disease acceptance, strategies to increase patient empowerment, the use of patient-centred communication and understanding the contextualisation of patients' experiences may all help to guide clinical practice.
18855132	Successful twin birth following blastocyst culture of embryos derived from the immotile ejaculated spermatozoa from a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia: a case report.	PURPOSE: To describe the ultrastructure of spermatozoa from a patient with complete asthenozoospermia that resulted in live births following blastocyst culture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analyses of spermatozoa from a 36 year old patient were performed using light and electron microscopy. The hypo-osmotic swelling test was used to select spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Embryos were cultured to the blastocyst stage. RESULTS: 100% of the spermatozoa had dynein arm deficiency with secondary defects varying from 3-17%. Six oocytes were injected; five fertilized normally and one was digynic. All five zygotes formed good quality blastocysts. Three blastocysts were cryopreserved and two blastocysts were transferred. Twin females were born at 37 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The hypo-osmotic swelling test can be used to select viable immotile ejaculated spermatozoa from a patient with dynein arm deficiency and can produce excellent fertilization rates and blastocyst development resulting in live births.
29684285	Imaging Lung Function Abnormalities in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Using Hyperpolarized Gas Ventilation MRI.	
26822945	When to suspect primary ciliary dyskinesia in children.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia [PCD] is an uncommon, autosomal recessively inherited condition that is often overlooked and undertreated in childhood. Amidst the myriad of children with coloured nasal secretions, otitis media and a wet cough, there exists a subset with PCD as the underlying unifying diagnosis. In this paper we have highlighted the varying clinical manifestations of PCD, emphasising different presentations between neonates, toddlers, school aged children and adults. 
33621011	Dysplasia of the fibrous sheath with axonemal and centriolar defects combined with lack of mitochondrial activity as associated factors of ICSI failure in primary ciliary dyskinesia syndrome.	
29316973	Kartagener's syndrome: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Kartagener's syndrome is a subset of primary ciliary dyskinesia, an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by the clinical triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. Abnormal ciliary structure or function leading to impaired ciliary motility is the main pathophysiologic problem in Kartagener's syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man from Gondar town, North-West Ethiopia, presented to University of Gondar Hospital with recurrent episodes of nasal congestion with itching and paranasal discomfort, and productive cough for more than a decade. Clinical and imaging findings revealed chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs inversus. He was treated with orally administered antibiotics, mucolytic, and chest physiotherapy. He was symptomatically better with the above therapy, and started on a long-term low-dose prophylactic antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Kartagener's syndrome exist in Ethiopia as cases of chronic recurrent sinopulmonary infections. As there is no easy, reliable non-invasive diagnostic test for Kartagener's syndrome and the correct diagnosis is often delayed by years, it may cause chronic respiratory problems with reduced quality of life. Genetic counseling and fertility issues should be addressed once Kartagener's syndrome is diagnosed.
39269762	Airway Clearance Techniques in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: A Systematic Review.	OBJECTIVE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a respiratory disorder that impairs mucociliary clearance, leading to decreased lung function. Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCP) is the traditional airway clearance technique (ACT) and is considered a standard treatment for PCD patients. This systematic review investigated whether device supported ACTs are better alternatives for improving lung function and/or quality of life in PCD, compared with CCP. METHODS: The OVID Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to aggregate the data. This systematic review has been registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews website. RESULTS: Of the 389 citations that resulted from our literature search, 2 randomized crossover trials that included a total of 54 patients were analyzed. The certainty of the aggregated study evidence was very low. No difference was identified between device-supported ACTs and CCP in terms of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second in PCD patients aged 6 to 20 years. CONCLUSION: Device-supported ACTs could be considered alternative treatment options to replace CCP. High quality research is required to confirm this result.
37624733	Restoring Ciliary Function: Gene Therapeutics for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disease characterized by defects in motile cilia, that play an important role in several organ systems. Lung disease is a hallmark of PCD, given the essential role of cilia in airway surface defense. Diagnosis of PCD is complicated due to its reliance on complex tests that are not utilized by every clinic and also its phenotypic overlap with several other respiratory diseases. Nonetheless, PCD is increasingly being recognized as more common than once thought. The disease is genetically complex, with several genes reported to be associated with PCD. There is no cure for PCD, but gene therapy remains a promising therapeutic strategy. In this review we provide an overview of the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, genetics, and current treatment regimens for PCD. We also describe PCD model systems and discuss the therapeutic potential of different gene therapeutics for targeting the intended cellular target, the ciliated cells of the airway.
26527516	Recent advances in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disease inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The prevalence of PCD is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 live births. Congenital abnormality of the primary cilia results in situs inversus in 50% of patients. Decreased function of motile cilia causes chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media with effusion, bronchiectasis and infertility. Cases with situs inversus are considered to show ""Kartagener's syndrome"", and diagnosis is not difficult. However, in cases without situs inversus, the diagnosis is much more troublesome. PCD without situs inversus is thus probably underdiagnosed. Prolonged chronic cough represents an important symptom that is seen in most patients. The diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of the characteristic clinical phenotypes and either: (1) specific ciliary ultrastructural defects identified by transmission electron microscopy in biopsy samples of respiratory epithelium; or (2) identification of mutation in one of the genes known to be associated with PCD. Nasal nitric oxide concentration is extremely low in PCD, and this could be useful for screening of the disease. At present, no fundamental therapies are available for PCD. Diagnosis in the early stages is important to prevent progression of bronchiectasis and deterioration of lung function by guidance for daily life, immunization, cessation of smoking and prompt therapy at the time of respiratory tract infection. Since PCD is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner, genetic counseling is necessary after definite diagnosis. "
27514592	Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a recessive genetically heterogeneous disorder of motile cilia with chronic otosinopulmonary disease and organ laterality defects in ~50% of cases. The prevalence of PCD is difficult to determine. Recent diagnostic advances through measurement of nasal nitric oxide and genetic testing has allowed rigorous diagnoses and determination of a robust clinical phenotype, which includes neonatal respiratory distress, daily nasal congestion, and wet cough starting early in life, along with organ laterality defects. There is early onset of lung disease in PCD with abnormal airflow mechanics and radiographic abnormalities detected in infancy and early childhood.
25422025	Primary ciliary dyskinesia and neonatal respiratory distress.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited disease affecting motile cilia lining the respiratory tract. Despite neonatal respiratory distress as an early feature, diagnosis is typically delayed until late childhood. Our objective was to identify characteristics that differentiate PCD from common causes of term neonatal respiratory distress. METHODS: This was a case-control study. Patients with PCD born after 1994 attending a regional PCD clinic who had a history of neonatal respiratory distress (n = 46) were included. Controls (n = 46), term neonates with respiratory distress requiring a chest radiograph, were randomly selected from hospital birth records and matched on gender, birth month/year, and mode of delivery. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between neonatal characteristics and PCD diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of the best predictive variables was estimated by calculating sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: PCD cases required more oxygen therapy (39 cases, 29 controls, P = .01), longer duration of oxygen therapy (PCD mean = 15.2 days, control mean = 0.80 days, P < .01), had later onset of neonatal respiratory distress (PCD median = 12 hours, control median = 1 hour, P < .001), and higher frequency of lobar collapse and situs inversus (PCD = 70% and 48% respectively, control = 0% for both, P < .001). Situs inversus, lobar collapse, or oxygen need for >2 days had 87% (95% confidence interval: 74-94) sensitivity and 96% (95% confidence interval: 85-99) specificity for PCD. CONCLUSIONS: When encountering term neonates with unexplained respiratory distress, clinicians should consider PCD in those with lobar collapse, situs inversus, and/or prolonged oxygen therapy (>2 days).
22833551	Clinical significance of respiratory isolates for Mycobacterium abscessus complex from pediatric patients.	Mycobacterium abscessus complex is the most virulent of rapidly growing mycobacteria causing invasive lung disease. To better delineate clinical pediatric experience and outcomes with M. abscessus complex, we retrospectively gathered 5-year data on M. abscessus complex infection and outcomes in a large, hospital-based pediatric pulmonary center. Patients were selected from the database of the microbiology department at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, CA. Patients had at least one positive pulmonary isolate for M. abscessus complex from February 2006 to May 2011. Treatment modality data were collected and successful therapy of disease was determined as clearance of M. abscessus complex infection after antibiotics proven by culture negative respiratory isolate within at least 12 months of therapy initiation. Two cystic fibrosis patients with M. abscessus complex were identified, one with failed therapy and the other with stable pulmonary status despite persistent isolation. One primary ciliary dyskinesia patient had successful clearance of M. abscessus complex, however is now growing M. avium intracellulare. A patient with no prior medical history was successfully treated with antimycobacterial therapy. Eleven patients with neuromuscular disorders had tracheal aspirates positive for M. abscessus complex. None were treated due to stable lung status and all but two had spontaneous clearance of the mycobacteria. The two remaining persist with sporadic isolation of M. abscessus complex without clinical significance. We concluded that patients with tracheostomy associated M. abscessus complex infections do not appear to require treatment and often have spontaneous resolution. Cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia patients may have clinical disease warranting treatment, but current antimycobacterial therapy has not proven to be completely successful. As M. abscessus complex gains prevalence, standardized guidelines for diagnosis and therapy are needed in the pediatric population. Multicenter cohort analysis is necessary to achieve such guidelines.
18461343	Can pentoxifylline improve the sperm motion and ICSI success in the primary ciliary dyskinesia?	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), previously known as immotile cilia syndrome, can cause respiratory and reproductive problems. Because of the impaired motion of microtubules the patients suffer upper respiratory tract problems. Infertility is an other issue of these patients. Several attempt have been proposed to bring back sperm motion and to improve intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) results. With our case we have described the management of a male infertility that causes from immotile cilia. The role of ICSI with incubated and activated ejaculatory sperm by pentoxifylline in the patient of PCD or as commonly named immotile cilia syndrome.
34529793	Genetic diagnosis, sperm phenotype and ICSI outcome in case of severe asthenozoospermia with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum.	STUDY QUESTION: Are ICSI outcomes impaired in cases of severe asthenozoospermia with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum (MMAF phenotype)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Despite occasional technical difficulties, ICSI outcomes for couples with MMAF do not differ from those of other couples requiring ICSI, irrespective of the genetic defect. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Severe asthenozoospermia, especially when associated with the MMAF phenotype, results in male infertility. Recent findings have confirmed that a genetic aetiology is frequently responsible for this phenotype. In such situations, pregnancies can be achieved using ICSI. However, few studies to date have provided detailed analyses regarding the flagellar ultrastructural defects underlying this phenotype, its genetic aetiologies, and the results of ICSI in such cases of male infertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a retrospective study of 25 infertile men exhibiting severe asthenozoospermia associated with the MMAF phenotype identified through standard semen analysis. They were recruited at an academic centre for assisted reproduction in Paris (France) between 2009 and 2017. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed in order to determine the sperm ultrastructural phenotype and the causal mutations, respectively. Finally 20 couples with MMAF were treated by assisted reproductive technologies based on ICSI. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Patients with MMAF were recruited based on reduced sperm progressive motility and increased frequencies of absent, short, coiled or irregular flagella compared with those in sperm from fertile control men. A quantitative analysis of the several ultrastructural defects was performed for the MMAF patients and for fertile men. The ICSI results obtained for 20 couples with MMAF were compared to those of 378 men with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia but no MMAF as an ICSI control group. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: TEM analysis and categorisation of the flagellar anomalies found in these patients provided important information regarding the structural defects underlying asthenozoospermia and sperm tail abnormalities. In particular, the absence of the central pair of axonemal microtubules was the predominant anomaly observed more frequently than in control sperm (P < 0.01). Exome sequencing, performed for 24 of the 25 patients, identified homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic mutations in CFAP43, CFAP44, CFAP69, DNAH1, DNAH8, AK7, TTC29 and MAATS1 in 13 patients (54.2%) (11 affecting MMAF genes and 2 affecting primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)-associated genes). A total of 40 ICSI cycles were undertaken for 20 MMAF couples, including 13 cycles (for 5 couples) where a hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) test was required due to absolute asthenozoospermia. The fertilisation rate was not statistically different between the MMAF (65.7%) and the non-MMAF (66.0%) couples and it did not differ according to the genotype or the flagellar phenotype of the subjects or use of the HOS test. The clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer did not differ significantly between the MMAF (23.3%) and the non-MMAF (37.1%) groups. To date, 7 of the 20 MMAF couples have achieved a live birth from the ICSI attempts, with 11 babies born without any birth defects. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The ICSI procedure outcomes were assessed retrospectively on a small number of affected subjects and should be confirmed on a larger cohort. Moreover, TEM analysis could not be performed for all patients due to low sperm concentrations, and WES results are not yet available for all of the included men. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: An early and extensive phenotypic and genetic investigation should be considered for all men requiring ICSI for severe asthenozoospermia. Although our study did not reveal any adverse ICSI outcomes associated with MMAF, we cannot rule out that some rare genetic causes could result in low fertilisation or pregnancy rates. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No external funding was used for this study and there are no competing interests. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: N/A.
19840958	Respiratory medicines for children: current evidence, unlicensed use and research priorities.	This European Respiratory Society task force has reviewed the evidence for paediatric medicines in respiratory disease occurring in adults and children. We describe off-licence use, research priorities and ongoing studies. Off-licence and off-label prescribing in children is widespread and potentially harmful. Research areas in asthma include novel formulations and regimens, and individualised prescribing. In cystic fibrosis, future studies will focus on screened infants and robust outcome measures are needed. Other areas include new enzyme and antibiotic formulations and the basic defect. Research into pneumonia should include evaluation of new antibacterials and regimens, rapid diagnostic tests and, in pleural infection, antibiotic penetration, fibrinolytics and surveillance. In uncommon conditions, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, congenital pulmonary abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders, drugs indicated for other conditions (e.g. dornase alfa) are commonly used and trials are needed. In neuromuscular disorders, the beta-agonists may enhance muscle strength and are in need of evaluation. Studies of antibiotic prophylaxis, immunoglobulin and antifungal drugs are needed in immune deficiency. We hope that this summary of the evidence for respiratory medicines in children, highlighting gaps and research priorities, will be useful for the pharmaceutical industry, the paediatric committee of the European Medicines Agency, academic investigators and the lay public.
24092478	Acute hypoxemia in a parturient with primary ciliary dyskinesia following the administration of intravenous oxytocin: a case report.	PURPOSE: We present the case of a parturient diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia with secondary bronchiectasis who developed significant hypoxemia following administration of intravenous oxytocin during Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. This case suggests that oxytocin can affect pulmonary vascular tone and interfere with the protective effects of hypoxic vasoconstriction. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 35-yr-old primigravida at 37 weeks gestation presented for a scheduled Cesarean delivery due to breech positioning and fetal abnormalities. The patient had a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia and had undergone a right middle lobectomy seven years earlier for resultant bronchiectasis. Pulmonary function testing in the month prior to delivery showed a 4% decline in her baseline FEV1 to 1.06 L (32% of predicted value) but she was functionally well. The patient initially had an uneventful spinal anesthetic and maintained an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air in the supine position until delivery of her baby. An intravenous infusion of oxytocin for uterine contraction was started following removal of the placenta. The patient then became acutely hypoxemic with a drop in room air saturation to 84% but with no other accompanying hemodynamic instability. Maternal oxygen saturation did not improve with the addition of supplemental oxygen, and the patient had a significant arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient suggesting an intrapulmonary shunt. No supporting clinical, radiologic, or laboratory evidence of a thrombotic, air, or amniotic fluid embolism or mucous plug was detected. The patient remained hypoxemic during the postoperative period with gradual improvement back to baseline saturation in approximately 48 hr. CONCLUSION: The vasodilatory effects of intravenous oxytocin on the pulmonary vasculature may worsen shunting and interfere with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, producing clinically significant hypoxemia in patients with comorbid lung disease. Oxytocin should be used with caution in patients with compromised lung function.
32124190	Patients with severe asthenoteratospermia carrying SPAG6 or RSPH3 mutations have a positive pregnancy outcome following intracytoplasmic sperm injection.	PURPOSE: To investigate the relation between mutations in ciliopathy-related SPAG6 and RSPH3 and male infertility with severe asthenoteratospermia characterized by multiple flagellar malformations and reveal the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcomes of those primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) patients. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was applied to identify the pathogenic genes for the five PCD patients. The ICSI outcomes of those patients were compared with eight DNAH1-mutated patients and 215 oligo-asthenospermia (OAT) patients. RESULTS: We identified, for the first time, the compound heterozygous SPAG6 mutations (c.143_145del: p.48_49del, c.585delA: p.Lys196Serfs*6) in a sporadic PCD patient. Further, a novel homozygous nonsynonymous RSPH3 mutation (c.C799T: p.Arg267Cys) was identified in another PCD patient with consanguineous parents. The pathogenicity of these mutations in the assembly of sperm flagella was confirmed by flagellar ultrastructure analysis, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR. All five patients underwent six ICSI cycles. The fertilization rate, blastocyst development rate, and clinical pregnancy rate were 69.3%, 50.0%, and 66.7%, respectively. Four of the five couples, including the subjects carrying mutations in SPAG6 or RSPH3, got healthy children born after ICSI. Additionally, the ICSI outcomes of the five PCD couples were statistically comparable with those of the eight DNAH1-mutated couples and the 215 OAT couples. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in ciliopathy-related SPAG6 and RSPH3 cause severe asthenoteratospermia characterized by multiple flagellar malformations, resulting in sterility. ICSI is an optimal management with a positive pregnancy outcome.
24039238	Comparison of conventional pulmonary rehabilitation and high-frequency chest wall oscillation in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	BACKGROUND: Enhancement of mucociliary clearance by pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is advocated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Our primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of postural drainage, percussion and vibration [conventional PR (CPR)], and high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) by studying change in pulmonary function. Our secondary aim was to evaluate patient preferences regarding the two methods. METHODS: This was a controlled randomized crossover study. PCD patients between the ages of 7 and 18 years were assigned to two groups, first group performed airway clearance with CPR at hospital for 5 days and after a 2-day washout period HFCWO was applied to the same group at home. HFCWO was applied first to the other group and then these patients were hospitalized for CPR. The primary outcome measure of the study was pulmonary function test (PFT). The secondary outcomes were pulse arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and the perceived efficiency and comfort level. RESULTS: PFT values of patients increased significantly after both PR methods (before/after): CPR: FVC: 77.0 +- 14.1/81.8 +- 13.0 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 72.9 +- 14.8/78.7 +- 13.5 (P = 0.001); PEF: 73.8 +- 14.5/82.5 +- 14.5 (P = 0.001); FEF25-75 : 68.6 +- 27.6/74.9 +- 29.3 (P = 0.007). HFCWO FVC: 75.1 +- 15.3/80.3 +- 13.9 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 71.4 +- 16/77.4 +- 14.6 (P = 0.001); PEF: 70.9 +- 18.0/78.3 +- 17.7 (P = 0.002); FEF25-75 : 70.5 +- 23.4/76.4 +- 25.6 (P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in % predicted FVC, FEV1 , PEF, and FEF25-75 increased values with CPR and HFCWO. HFCWO was found more comfortable (P = 0.04). Two PR methods were found efficient and no desaturation occurred during PR. CONCLUSIONS: PFTs were significantly increased after both PR methods. There were no differences in PFTs and SpO2 between the CPR and HFCWO groups. Both PR methods were found efficient. HFCWO was found more comfortable. HFCWO may be an option in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and low adherence to PR.
32023425	Severe Ciliary Dyskinesia in Ventilated Patients: A Pilot Study.	
32170493	Novel DNAAF6 variants identified by whole-exome sequencing cause male infertility and primary ciliary dyskinesia.	PURPOSE: To identify the genetic cause of patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and male infertility from two unrelated Han Chinese families. METHODS: We conducted whole-exome sequencing of three individuals with PCD and male infertility from two unrelated Chinese families, and performed a targeted look-up for DNAAF6 variants in our previously reported cohort of 442 individuals (219 with isolated oligoasthenospermia and 223 fertile controls). Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patients' spermatozoa were performed. The pathogenicity of the variants was validated using patient's spermatozoa and HEK293T cells. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment was conducted in two patients. RESULTS: We identified one novel hemizygous frameshift variant (NM_173494, c.319_329del: p.R107fs) of DNAAF6 gene (previously named PIH1D3) in family 1 and one novel hemizygous missense variant (c.290G>T: p.G97V) in family 2. No hemizygous deleterious variants in DNAAF6 were detected in the control cohort of 442 individuals. Ultrastructural and immunostaining analyses of patients' spermatozoa showed the absence of outer and inner dynein arms in sperm flagella. Both variants were proven to lead to DNAAF6 protein degradation in HEK293T cells. Both patients carrying DNAAF6 variants underwent one ICSI cycle and delivered one healthy child each. CONCLUSION: We identified novel DNAAF6 variants causing male infertility and PCD in Han Chinese patients. This finding extended the spectrum of variants in DNAAF6 and revealed new light on the impact of DNAAF6 variants in sperm flagella.
25510893	Presentation of primary ciliary dyskinesia in children: 30 years' experience.	AIM: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare (1:15,000) condition resulting in recurrent suppurative respiratory tract infections, progressive lung damage and hearing impairment. As the diagnosis is often delayed for years, the purpose of this study was to review the presenting features of children with PCD attending Australia's initial diagnostic PCD service over a 30-year period. METHOD: A retrospective review of the symptoms of children diagnosed with PCD at Concord Hospital between 1982 and 2012 was undertaken. RESULTS: One thousand thirty-seven paediatric patients were referred for assessment and underwent nasal ciliary brushing. Eighty-four (8.1%) had PCD based on microscopic analysis of nasal cilia. This included 81 with ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities demonstrated on electron microscopy and 3 with a suggestive phenotype, reduced ciliary beat frequency and a family history of PCD. The median age at diagnosis was 6.4 years (range 0.1 to 18.2 years). Forty-six per cent had situs abnormalities and 31% had a family member with PCD. Recurrent cough (81%), rhinosinusitis (71%), recurrent otitis media (49%) and neonatal respiratory distress (57%) were reported. Bronchiectasis at presentation was documented in 32%. Situs abnormalities and neonatal respiratory distress were present together in 26%. CONCLUSION: PCD remains under-recognised by health-care workers. The combination of neonatal respiratory distress, chronic suppurative cough and rhinosinusitis was the most common documented symptom cluster at presentation in cases of PCD. A heightened awareness of the clinical features of the disease may help to lower the age at diagnosis, facilitate appropriate treatment and improve long-term outcomes.
38380959	The utility of nasal nitric oxide in the diagnostic evaluation of primary ciliary dyskinesia.	BACKGROUND: There is no gold-standard test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), rather American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend starting with nasal nitric oxide (nNO) in children >=5 years old and confirming the diagnosis with genetic testing or ciliary biopsy with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These guidelines have not been studied in a clinical setting. We present a case series describing the PCD diagnostic process at our pediatric PCD center. METHODS: Diagnostic data from 131 patients undergoing PCD consultation were reviewed. RESULTS: In all participants >= 5 years old and who completed nNO using resistor methodology, the first diagnostic test performed was nNO in 77% (73/95), genetic testing in 14% (13/95), and TEM in <1% (9/95). nNO was the only diagnostic test performed in 75% (55/73) of participants who completed nNO first. Seventy-five percent (55/73) had a single above the cutoff nNO value and PCD was determined to be unlikely in 91% (50/55) without performing additional confirmatory testing. Eleven percent (8/73) had multiple below the cutoff nNO values, with 38% (3/8) being diagnosed with PCD by confirmatory testing and 50% (4/8) with negative confirmatory testing, but being managed as PCD. The genetic testing positivity rate was 50% in participants who completed nNO first and 8% when genetic testing was completed first. CONCLUSION: nNO is useful in three situations: an initial above the cutoff nNO value makes PCD unlikely and prevents additional confirmatory testing, repetitively below the cutoff nNO values without positive confirmatory testing suggests a probable PCD diagnosis and the yield of genetic testing is higher when nNO is performed first.
30288904	Never too old for an inherited condition.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia is an uncommon, inherited condition causing progressive suppurative airway lung disease with subsequent bronchiectasis, chronic rhinitis-sinusitis, deafness and reduced fertility. Diagnosis is often delayed by lack of awareness of the condition in the medical community and limited access to the few centres in Australia able to do full diagnostic testing. This report details the late diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia in two adults who have had long-standing interactions with medical services but in whom the diagnosis was never considered or even dismissed. Greater awareness of the condition will reduce time to diagnosis, prevent administration of ineffective therapy and allow earlier institution of targeted therapy.
27564672	Delivery of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin to Airways.	Treatment with exogenous alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a potent serine protease inhibitor, was developed originally for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with AAT deficiency; however, other lung conditions involving neutrophilic inflammation and proteolytic tissue injury related to neutrophil elastase and other serine proteases may also be considered for AAT therapy. These conditions include bronchiectasis caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases associated with an increased free elastase activity in the airways. Inhaled AAT may be a viable option to counteract proteolytic tissue damage. This form of treatment requires efficient drug delivery to the targeted pulmonary compartment. Aerosol technology meeting this requirement is currently available and offers an alternative therapeutic approach to systemic AAT administration. To date, early studies in humans have shown biochemical efficacy and have established the safety of inhaled AAT. However, to bring aerosol AAT therapy to patients, large phase 3 protocols in carefully selected patient populations (i.e., subgroups of patients with AAT deficiency, cystic fibrosis, or other lung diseases with bronchiectasis) will be needed with clinical end points in addition to the measurement of proteolytic activity in the airway. The outcomes likely will have to include lung function, lung structure assessed by computed tomography imaging, disease exacerbations, health status, and mortality.
25715965	Bronchiectasis.	INTRODUCTION: Bronchiectasis is usually a complication of previous lower respiratory infection and/or inflammation. It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.
28745925	Clinical care of children with primary ciliary dyskinesia.	INTRODUCTION: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare heterogeneous disorder, usually inherited as an autosomal recessive condition but X-linked inheritance is also described. Abnormal ciliary function in childhood leads to neonatal respiratory distress in term infants, persistent wet cough, bronchiectasis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and hearing impairment; approximately 50% of patients have situs inversus. There is a paucity of evidence for treating PCD, hence consensus guidelines are predominantly influenced by knowledge from cystic fibrosis (CF). Extrapolation of evidence from other diseases is inappropriate since differences in pathophysiology, morbidity and prognosis risk treatment failure and lack of adherence. Areas covered: Review authors searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for publications relating to management of children with PCD. Because of the paucity of data, we emphasise the need for well-designed clinical trials with PCD patients rather than reliance on evidence from other diseases. Expert commentary: The evidence for treatment of PCD is poor, and management is often extrapolated from studies of patients with CF or chronic rhinosinusitis. However, much work is underway to improve the situation and international consortia and networks are conducting well-designed projects to inform the management of children with PCD.
37646121	The effect of inspiratory muscle training in PCD and CF patients: A pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Effective work of breathing and bronchial hygiene requires synergy of inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is a part of pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is some evidence of its efficacy in cystic fibrosis (CF) and, recently, in long COVID-19. We are not aware of studies on IMT in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Our aim was to assess the effect of IMT on respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function in PCD and CF patients. METHODS: A single center pilot study. Spirometry, lung clearance index (LCI), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were measured at baseline (visit 1), after a month of IMT with  POWERbreathe (visit 2), and at follow-up (visit 3). RESULTS: The cohort included 27 patients (19 PCD, 8 CF); mean age 18.4 +- 9.8 years. After a month of IMT, there was a significant increase in MIP and MIP% (6.19-7.44, p = .015; and 81.85%-100.41%, p = .046, respectively), which was sustained at visit 3. Compliance >=90% led to higher improvement in MIP. In sub-group analysis, improvement in MIP and MIP% remained significant for PCD patients (p = .026 and p = .049, respectively). No significant changes were found in spirometry, MEP or LCI. CONCLUSIONS: IMT was well-tolerated and led to improved inspiratory muscle strength in PCD patients. The clinical implication of improved MIP should be further investigated. Larger, long-term studies are needed to evaluate long-term effects of IMT on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life.
34476482	Bi-allelic mutations in DNAH7 cause asthenozoospermia by impairing the integrality of axoneme structure.	Asthenozoospermia is the most common cause of male infertility. Dynein protein arms play a crucial role in the motility of both the cilia and flagella, and defects in these proteins generally impair the axoneme structure and cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. But relatively little is known about the influence of dynein protein arm defects on sperm flagella function. Here, we recruited 85 infertile patients with idiopathic asthenozoospermia and identified bi-allelic mutations in DNAH7 (NM_018897.3) from three patients using whole-exome sequencing. These variants are rare, highly pathogenic, and very conserved. The spermatozoa from the patients with DNAH7 bi-allelic mutations showed specific losses in the inner dynein arms. The expression of DNAH7 in the spermatozoa from the DNAH7-defective patients was significantly decreased, but these patients were able to have their children via intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. Our study is the first to demonstrate that bi-allelic mutations in DNAH7 may impair the integrality of axoneme structure, affect sperm motility, and cause asthenozoospermia in humans. These findings may extend the spectrum of etiological genes and provide new clues for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with asthenozoospermia.

28866847	Successful conservative management of an anastomotic airway dehiscence at the left main bronchus following bilateral cadaveric lung transplantation.	There is a dearth of data on management of anastomotic airway dehiscence following lung transplantation. Herein we report a case of successful conservative management of an anastomotic airway dehiscence after cadaveric donor lung transplantation. A 41-year-old woman with primary ciliary dyskinesia underwent cadaveric bilateral lung transplantation without cardiopulmonary bypass. On the postoperative day 25, left pneumothorax developed and bronchoscopy demonstrated a localized anastomotic dehiscence at the left main bronchus. The dehiscence was managed with 2 weeks of pleural drainage and was completely covered with regenerated bronchial epithelium at 4 months after transplantation. There is no finding suggestive of significant stenosis at 4 years of follow-up. Our case suggested asymptomatic and localized anastomotic dehiscence does not always require endobronchial stent placement or re-operation. Multiple factors that may contribute to the successful conservative management were discussed in this article.
33547761	A novel heterotaxy gene: Expansion of the phenotype of TTC21B-spectrum disease.	TTC21B encodes the protein IFT139, a critical component of the retrograde transport system within the primary cilium. Biallelic, pathogenic TTC21B variants are associated with classic ciliopathy syndromes, including nephronophthisis, Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, and Joubert Syndrome, with ciliopathy-spectrum traits such as biliary dysgenesis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and situs inversus, and also with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. We report a 9-year-old male with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis requiring kidney transplant, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and biliary dysgenesis, found by research-based exome sequencing to have biallelic pathogenic TTC21B variants. A sibling with isolated heterotaxy was found to harbor the same variants. This case highlights the phenotypic spectrum and unpredictable manifestations of TTC21B-related disease, and also reports the first association between TTC21B and heterotaxy, nominating TTC21B as an important new heterotaxy gene.

32997437	Comparison of conventional chest physiotherapy and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	BACKGROUND: Chest physiotherapy (CP) is a recommended treatment modality in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). OBJECTIVE: Primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of the conventional chest physiotherapy (CCP) and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEPT). Secondary aims were to compare the exacerbation rate, time until the first exacerbation, patient compliance and comfort between the two CP methods. METHODS: This is a 6 month randomized, controlled crossover trial. Patients >6 years of age with PCD were randomized into two groups, first group was assigned to OPEPT (Acapella ) for 3 months while second group was assigned to CCP. Groups were crossed over to the other modality after a 15-day washout period. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and compliance were monitored by monthly clinic visits. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in FEV1 , FEF25-75 , and PEF values (p = .018, p = .020, and p = .016, respectively) in the OPEPT group and in FVC values (p = .007) in CCP group compared to baseline. However PFT increase at 3rd month was not superior to each other with both physiotherapy methods. Median acute pulmonary exacerbation rate and time period until the first exacerbation were similar in both groups (p = .821, p = .092, respectively). Comfort and effectiveness of OPEPT was higher than CCP according to patients (p = .029 and p = .042, respectively). There were no adverse effects with either therapy. CONCLUSIONS: OPEPT was as effective as CCP in PCD patients. OPEPT was more comfortable and effective than CCP according to patients. OPEPT might be an efficient alternative method for airway cleareance in PCD patients.
22616346	A case of primary ciliary dyskinesia with pulmonary arterial hypertension responding to oral sildenafil.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive heterogeneous group of conditions with variable clinical findings like recurrent respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, situs inversus, singly or in various combinations. Development of Pulmonary arterial hypertension can be a late complication of this disease. Here we present a case of PCD with recurrent respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis and severe PAH, who responded to treatment with Oxygen, IV broad spectrum antibiotics and oral sildenafil.
20013568	[Primary ciliary dyskinesia causing neonatal respiratory distress].	BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a hereditary disorder of structure and function of the cilia of respiratory epithelium of the upper and lower airways. Prevalence is estimated with 1:15 000 to 1:30 000 births. We present a newborn infant with respiratory distress caused by PCD. PATIENT: On the first day of life, the male newborn developed dyspnoe and cyanosis, so that CPAP and short term ventilation was necessary. Varying atelectasis impressed on the chest radiographs and the diagnosis of PCD was made by nasal brush biopsies. Causative is a lack of the inner dynein arms of the cilia. The clinical features of newborns with the diagnoses of PCD are listed and compared with the own case. CONCLUSION: PCD is a rare cause of neonatal respiratory distress and should be considered in term infants with unknown and prolonged course even if Situs inversus is lacking.
32380069	Efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in primary ciliary dyskinesia (BESTCILIA): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Use of maintenance antibiotic therapy with the macrolide azithromycin is increasing in a number of chronic respiratory disorders including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, evidence for its efficacy in PCD is lacking. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in patients with PCD. METHODS: The Better Experimental Screening and Treatment for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (BESTCILIA) trial was a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial done at 6 European PCD clinics (tertiary paediatric care centres and university hospitals in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and UK). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, aged 7-50 years old, and predicted FEV1 greater than 40% were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age and study site, via a web-based randomisation system to azithromycin 250 mg or 500 mg as tablets according to bodyweight (</>= 40 kg) or identical placebo, three times a week for 6 months. The random allocation sequence was a permuted block randomisation, with a block size of four, generated by an external consultancy. Participants, investigators, and care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered in the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2013-004664-58. FINDINGS: Between June 24, 2014, and Aug 23, 2016, 102 patients were screened, of whom 90 were randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n=49) or placebo (n=41). The study was ended without having included the planned number of participants due to recruitment difficulties. The mean number of respiratory exacerbations over 6 months was 0 75 (SD 1 12) in the azithromycin group compared with 1 62 (1 64) in the placebo group, and participants receiving azithromycin had significantly lower rate of exacerbations during the individual treatment periods (rate ratio 0 45 [95% CI 0 26-0 78]; p=0 004). Four serious adverse events were reported, occurring in one (2%) of 47 participants in the azithromycin group and in three (7%) of 41 participants in the placebo group. Loose stools or diarrhoea were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (11 [23%] vs two [5%]). INTERPRETATION: This first multinational randomised controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD showed that azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months was well tolerated and halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations. Azithromycin maintenance therapy is an option for patients with PCD with frequent exacerbations potentially leading to reduced need for additional antibiotic treatments and preventing irreversible lung damage.

33250217	Robotic lobectomy in children with severe bronchiectasis: A worthwhile new technology.	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Lobectomy is required in children affected by non-responsive, symptomatic, localized bronchiectasis, but inflammation makes thoracoscopy challenging. We present the first published series of robotic-assisted pulmonary lobectomy in children with bronchiectasis. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary lobectomy for severe localized bronchiectasis (2014-2019) via thoracoscopic versus robotic lobectomy. Four 5 mm ports were used for thoracoscopy; a four-arm approach was used for robotic surgery (Da Vinci Surgical Xi System, Intuitive Surgical, California). RESULTS: Eighteen children were operated (robotic resection, n = 7; thoracoscopy, n = 11) with infected congenital pulmonary malformation, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and post-viral infection. There were no conversions to open surgery with robotic surgery, but five with thoracoscopy. Total operative time was significantly longer with robotic versus thoracoscopic surgery (mean 247 +- 50 versus 152 +- 57 min, p = 0.008). There were no significant differences in perioperative complications, length of thoracic drainage, or total length of stay (mean 7 +- 2 versus 8 +- 3 days, respectively). No blood transfusions were required. Two thoracoscopic patients had a type-3 postoperative complication. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric robotic lung lobectomy is feasible and safe, with excellent visualization and bi-manual hand-wrist dissection - useful properties in difficult cases of infectious pathologies. However, instrumentation dimensions limit use in smaller thoraxes.
34459071	Physical fitness and activities of daily living in primary ciliary dyskinesia: A retrospective study.	BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, hereditary, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections. This study aimed to compare pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and activities of daily living (ADLs) retrospectively between patients with PCD and healthy controls. METHODS: Data from 20 patients with PCD and 20 matched, healthy counterparts recorded between July 2015 and January 2017 were analyzed. The data evaluated and recorded included pulmonary function using a portable spirometer, respiratory muscle strength (using a mouth pressure device, exercise capacity using the incremental shuttle walk test,), physical fitness (using the Munich Fitness Test), and ADLs (using the Glittre ADL test). RESULTS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, incremental shuttle walk test scores (all parameters), and total Munich Fitness Test scores were lower in the PCD group relative to controls (P < 0.05). The duration to complete the Glittre ADL test was higher in PCD patients than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and ADL were affected by PCD. Thus, pulmonary rehabilitation regimens should be tailored according to these impacts.
31629643	Azithromycin is the answer in paediatric respiratory medicine, but what was the question?	The first clinical indication of non-antibiotic benefits of macrolides was in the Far East, in adults with diffuse panbronchiolitis. This condition is characterised by chronic airway infection, often with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, airway inflammation, bronchiectasis and a high mortality. Low dose erythromycin, and subsequently other macrolides, led in many cases to complete remission of the condition, and abrogated the neutrophilic airway inflammation characteristic of the disease. This dramatic finding sparked a flurry of interest in the many hundreds of macrolides in nature, especially their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The biggest subsequent trials of azithromycin were in cystic fibrosis, which has obvious similarities to diffuse panbronchiolitis. There were unquestionable improvements in lung function and pulmonary exacerbations, but compared to diffuse panbronchiolitis, the results were disappointing. Case reports, case series and some randomised controlled trials followed in other conditions. Three trials of azithromycin in preschool wheeze gave contradictory results; a trial in pauci-inflammatory adult asthma, and a trial in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis both showed a significant reduction in exacerbations, but none matched the dramatic results in diffuse panbronchiolitis. There is clearly a huge risk of antibacterial resistance if macrolides are used widely and uncritically in the community. In summary, Azithromycin is not the answer to anything in paediatric respiratory medicine; the paediatric respiratory community needs to refocus on the dramatic benefits of macrolides in diffuse panbronchiolitis, use modern - omics technologies to determine the endotypes of inflammatory diseases and discover in nature or synthesise designer macrolides to replicate the diffuse panbronchiolitis results. We must now find out how to do better!
24460437	Inhaled amikacin for treatment of refractory pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease.	RATIONALE: Treatment of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria, especially Mycobacterium abscessus, requires prolonged, multidrug regimens with high toxicity and suboptimal efficacy. Options for refractory disease are limited. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the efficacy and toxicity of inhaled amikacin in patients with treatment-refractory nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. METHODS: Records were queried to identify patients who had inhaled amikacin added to failing regimens. Lower airway microbiology, symptoms, and computed tomography scan changes were assessed together with reported toxicity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The majority (80%) of the 20 patients who met entry criteria were women; all had bronchiectasis, two had cystic fibrosis and one had primary ciliary dyskinesia. At initiation of inhaled amikacin, 15 were culture positive for M. abscessus and 5 for Mycobacterium avium complex and had received a median (range) of 60 (6, 190) months of mycobacterial treatment. Patients were followed for a median of 19 (1, 50) months. Eight (40%) patients had at least one negative culture and 5 (25%) had persistently negative cultures. A decrease in smear quantity was noted in 9 of 20 (45%) and in mycobacterial culture growth for 10 of 19 (53%). Symptom scores improved in nine (45%), were unchanged in seven (35%), and worsened in four (20%). Improvement on computed tomography scans was noted in 6 (30%), unchanged in 3 (15%), and worsened in 11 (55%). Seven (35%) stopped amikacin due to: ototoxicity in two (10%), hemoptysis in two (10%), and nephrotoxicity, persistent dysphonia, and vertigo in one each. CONCLUSIONS: In some patients with treatment-refractory pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, the addition of inhaled amikacin was associated with microbiologic and/or symptomatic improvement; however, toxicity was common. Prospective evaluation of inhaled amikacin for mycobacterial disease is warranted.
34985761	Intermittent prophylactic antibiotics for bronchiectasis.	BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is a common but under-diagnosed chronic disorder characterised by permanent dilation of the airways arising from a cycle of recurrent infection and inflammation. Symptoms including chronic, persistent cough and productive phlegm are a significant burden for people with bronchiectasis, and the main aim of treatment is to reduce exacerbation frequency and improve quality of life. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy aims to break this infection cycle and is recommended by clinical guidelines for adults with three or more exacerbations a year, based on limited evidence. It is important to weigh the evidence for bacterial suppression against the prevention of antibiotic resistance and further evidence is required on the safety and efficacy of different regimens of intermittently administered antibiotic treatments for people with bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted searches on 6 September 2021, with no restriction on language of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least three months' duration comparing an intermittent regime of prophylactic antibiotics with placebo, usual care or an alternate intermittent regimen. Intermittent prophylactic administration was defined as repeated courses of antibiotics with on-treatment and off-treatment intervals of at least 14 days' duration. We included adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis confirmed by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), plain film chest radiograph, or bronchography and a documented history of recurrent chest infections. We excluded studies where participants received high dose antibiotics immediately prior to enrolment or those with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary ciliary dyskinesia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, sarcoidosis, or a primary diagnosis of COPD. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. We did not exclude studies on the basis of review outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted GRADE assessments for the following primary outcomes: exacerbation frequency; serious adverse events and secondary outcomes: antibiotic resistance; hospital admissions; health-related quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with interventions ranging from 16 to 48 weeks, involving 2180 adults. All evaluated one of three types of antibiotics over two to six cycles of 28 days on/off treatment: aminoglycosides, ss-lactams or fluoroquinolones. Two studies also included 12 cycles of 14 days on/off treatment with fluoroquinolones. Participants had a mean age of 63.6 years, 65% were women and approximately 85% Caucasian. Baseline FEV1 ranged from 55.5% to 62.6% predicted. None of the studies included children. Generally, there was a low risk of bias in the included studies. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 14 days on/off. Ciprofloxacin reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared to placebo (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with eight people (95% CI 6 to 28) needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome. The intervention increased the risk of antibiotic resistance more than twofold (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.35; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 624 participants; high-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, lung function (FEV1), health-related quality of life, and adverse effects did not differ between groups. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 28 days on/off. Antibiotics did not reduce overall exacerbation frequency (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1695 participants; high-certainty evidence) but there were fewer severe exacerbations (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93; I2 = 54%; 3 studies, 624 participants), though this should be interpreted with caution due to low event rates. The risk of antibiotic resistance was more than twofold higher based on a pooled analysis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.42; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 685 participants; high-certainty evidence) and consistent with unpooled data from four further studies. Serious adverse events, time to first exacerbation, duration of exacerbation, respiratory-related hospital admissions, lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse effects did not differ between study groups. Antibiotic versus usual care. We did not find any studies that compared intermittent antibiotic regimens with usual care. Cycle of 14 days on/off versus cycle of 28 days on/off. Exacerbation frequency did not differ between the two treatment regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24; I2 = 71%; 2 studies, 625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) However, inconsistencies in the results from the two trials in this comparison indicate that the apparent aggregated similarities may not be reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in antibiotic resistance between groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.48; I2 = 60%; 2 studies, 624 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events, adverse effects, lung function and health-related quality of life did not differ between the two antibiotic regimens. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in adults who have frequent chest infections, long-term antibiotics given at 14-day on/off intervals slightly reduces the frequency of those infections and increases antibiotic resistance. Intermittent antibiotic regimens result in little to no difference in serious adverse events. The impact of intermittent antibiotic therapy on children with bronchiectasis is unknown due to an absence of evidence, and further research is needed to establish the potential risks and benefits.
27879058	Sinus surgery can improve quality of life, lung infections, and lung function in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.	BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and bacterial sinusitis are ubiquitous in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). From the sinuses, Pseudomonas aeruginosa can infect the lungs. METHODS: We studied the effect of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on symptoms of CRS and lower airway infections in PCD patients in a prospective single-arm intervention study of ESS with adjuvant therapy using nasal irrigation with saline, topical nasal steroids, and 2 weeks of systemic antibiotics. Additional treatment with local colistin for 6 months was instigated when P. aeruginosa was cultured at ESS. RESULTS: Twenty-four PCD patients underwent ESS to search for an infectious focus (n = 10), due to severe symptoms of CRS (n = 8), or both (n = 6). Bacteria were cultured from sinus samples in 21 patients (88%), and simultaneous sinus and lung colonization with identical pathogens were observed in 13 patients (62%). Four patients with preoperative P. aeruginosa lung colonization (25%) had no regrowth during follow-up; 2 of these had P. aeruginosa sinusitis. Sinonasal symptoms were improved 12 months after ESS and we observed a trend toward better lung function after ESS. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated an improvement in CRS-related symptoms after ESS and adjuvant therapy. In selected PCD patients, the suggested regimen may postpone chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa and stabilize lung function.
22137492	Normal live birth after testicular sperm extraction and intracytoplasmic sperm injection in variant primary ciliary dyskinesia with completely immotile sperm and structurally abnormal sperm tails.	OBJECTIVE: To report on the investigation and fertility management of variant primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University-affiliated assisted reproductive technologies practice. PATIENT(S): A 40 year-old man presenting with 12 months' primary infertility, complete sperm immotility, severe morphologic defects, and moderate sinopulmonary disease. INTERVENTION(S): Electron microscopy (EM) of sperm, nasal cilial function studies, open testis biopsy, and sperm extraction for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Outcome of ICSI treatment using immotile testicular sperm. RESULT(S): EM revealed abnormal connecting pieces, shortened midpieces with attenuated mitochondrial sheaths, poorly developed annulus, abnormal outer dense fibers, and axonemes missing the two central mircotubules. Nasal ciliary beat frequency was subnormal and dyssynchronous. Immotile testicular sperm were selected for ICSI based on physical characteristics and fertilized 12 of 18 eggs. A single day-5 blastocyst achieved a normal pregnancy and delivery of a healthy 3,840-g girl at 38 weeks' gestation. CONCLUSION(S): Nonclassic PCD may present with structurally abnormal completely immotile sperm, with seemingly little prospect of fertility, and moderate respiratory dysfunction supporting the presence of an underlying ciliopathy. Despite testicular sperm also being immotile and showing profound structural defects that would seem to preclude fertilization, more morphologically normal sperm are capable of establishing a normal pregnancy.
20682136	Nasal nitric oxide and pulmonary radioaerosol mucociliary clearance as supplementary tools in diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia.	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, usually autosomal recessive inherited disorder, characterized by abnormalities in ciliary structure and/or function. Frequent, intermittent or chronic airway infections precipitated by impaired airway mucociliary clearance may cause permanent lung damage and reduced lung function. Early diagnosis is considered important for the prevention of lung damage, but diagnosis is probably often delayed or even missed since diagnosis of PCD is both complex and time consuming, and yet not always exact. The aims of this PhD thesis were to evaluate the discriminative capacity and ""real-life"" clinical application of two candidates for supplemental diagnostic testing for PCD: Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement placed as a first line test to point out probable PCD patients for further investigation or exclude patients, regardless of age, Pulmonary radioaerosol mucociliary clearance (PRMC) as a second line test for PCD investigation in children from 5 years of age. And additionally, Proposing an algorithm for the pathway of diagnosing PCD based on these two studies and recommendations from the literature. Nasal NO and PRMC demonstrated to be two highly valid supplementary diagnostic tools to be placed in each end of the diagnostic pathway when investigating selected patients referred for PCD work up. Nasal NO measurement demonstrated to have an obvious place as a first line test in the pathway of PCD investigation and PRMC as second line test as a supplement to ciliary function test and EM-test in cases of difficult diagnoses. Neither of these tests can stand alone in diagnosis or excluding of PCD. PCD remains to be a diagnosis that should be made at a tertiary PCD centre, as clinical evaluation of referred patients is crucial before excluding the disease."
29402277	Live birth after Laser Assisted Viability Assessment (LAVA) to detect pentoxifylline resistant ejaculated immotile spermatozoa during ICSI in a couple with male Kartagener's syndrome.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disease with abnormalities in the structure of cilia, causing impairment of muco-ciliary clearance with respiratory tract infections, heterotaxia and abnormal sperm motility with male infertility. Here, with a comprehensive literature review, we report a couple with an infertility history of 9 years and three unsuccessful IVF treatments, where male partner has Kartagener's Syndrome, a subtype of PCD, displaying recurrent respiratory infections, dextrocardia and total asthenozoospermia. His diagnosis was verified with transmission electron microscopy and genetic mutation screening, revealing total absence of dynein arms in sperm tails and homozygous mutation in the ZMYND10, heterozygous mutations in the ARMC4 and DNAH5 genes. Laser assisted viability assay (LAVA) was performed by shooting the sperm tails during sperm retrieval for microinjection, following detection of pentoxifylline resistant immotile sperm. Live births of healthy triplets, one boy and two monozygotic girls, was achieved after double blastocyst transfer.
20501530	Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: its diagnosis and management.	"An increase in the frequency of diagnosing non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children is due to heightened awareness of the disease and the wider availability of high-resolution computed tomography. The most common underlying conditions leading to bronchiectasis include infections, immunodeficiency, aspiration and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment centres on airway clearance with aggressive antibiotic regimens and physiotherapy; more specific approaches are available for some of the underlying conditions. A high index of suspicion that a child may have underlying bronchiectasis must be maintained in the presence of prolonged or recurrent ""wet/productive"" cough. The classic definition of bronchiectasis is of irreversible bronchial dilatation; however, at the milder end of the spectrum it appears that radiographic changes may be reversible. Untreated, in its severest form bronchiectasis can progress to end stage pulmonary failure in adult life. In this article, we review its pathogenesis and diagnosis and the evidence base for available treatments."
18569496	Ectopic pregnancy in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	
20797703	A sperm viability test using SYBR-14/propidium iodide flow cytometry as a tool for rapid screening of primary ciliary dyskinesia patients and for choosing sperm sources for intracytoplasmic sperm injection.	Spermatozoa viability tests based on dual-color flow cytometry after staining with Sybr-14/propidium iodide were performed on 44 men with complete asthenospermia for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) screening, and seven were identified with PCD by electron microscopy of ultrastructural ciliary defects. Six PCD patients underwent eight intracytoplasmic sperm injection therapy cycles using ejaculated sperm or testicular sperm, obtaining a mean fertilization rate of 46.6%, with three healthy babies born and one in utero at the time of writing.
20184817	[Recombinant human DNase in conditions other than cystic fibrosis].	Recombinant human DNase (rhDNase) reduces viscosity of sputum. Effect has been documented in cystic fibrosis and postoperatively in paediatric heart disease. Single dose treatment with rhDNase in paediatric asthma has no effect. In respiratory syncytial virus infection, treatment with rhDNase may be associated with increased need for supplemental oxygen. In adults with idiopathic bronchiectasis, treatment with rhDNase leads to more pulmonary exacerbations and a greater decline in pulmonary function tests. There are no controlled studies on rhDNase in primary ciliary dyskinesia or atelectasis.
35595860	Does the effect of comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy home-program differ in children with cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis?	Bronchiectasis is a form of airway damage as a consequence of endobronchial infection and inflammation and may be present in different diseases. The underlying aetiologies include both cystic fibrosis (CF) and a group of non-cystic fibrosis diseases (NCFB) such as immunodeficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia, or severe pulmonary infection. Although children with CF and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) have many similar clinical features, their responses to exercise may be different. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy (CRP) home-program in children with CF and NCFB. Thirty children with CF and thirty children with NCFB were included in the study. Both groups performed the CRP home-program twice daily for 8 weeks. Pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and respiratory and peripheral muscle strength were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of training. Both groups experienced significant improvements in pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and respiratory and peripheral muscle strength (p < 0.001). Maximum expiratory pressure, exercise capacity, and peripheral muscle strength were further improved in NCFB group compared to CF (p < 0.05); however, there was a great variability in the improvements for each variable. CONCLUSION: CRP is beneficial both for children with CF and NCFB and adherence to the program was high in both groups. WHAT IS KNOWN:   Different physiotherapy approaches in the management of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis have been based on the experience gained from the research studies performed in cystic fibrosis.   Although having similar pathophysiology, these two diseases show variation in some pulmonary and extrapulmonary features. WHAT IS NEW:   The respiratory muscle strength and the efficacy of comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy have been compared for the first time in children with cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.   Comprehensive respiratory physiotherapy provides higher increases in children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in exercise capacity and expiratory and peripheral muscle strength; however, there was a great variability in these improvements. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that both groups significantly benefited from the CRP program.
19182755	Kartagener's Syndrome.	Kartagener's Syndrome or Immotile Cilia Syndrome, a variant of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD), is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by defect in the tiny hair like structure, the cilia lining the respiratory tract (upper and lower), sinuses, eustachian tubes, middle ear and fallopian tubes. Here electron microscopy shows abnormal arrangement of ciliary tubules and patients with Kartagener's syndrome has an absence of dynein arms at the base of the cilia. The inability of cilia to move results in inadequate clearance of bacteria from the air passages, resulting in an increased risk of infection and causing bronchiectasis. Another result of ciliary immobility is infertility. A 60 years old lady was diagnosed as a case of Kartagener's syndrome. She had history of chronic cough for 20 years, irregular fever for 20 years and occasional shortness of breath for 5 years. Relevant investigations revealed dextrocardia, situs inversus, bilateral maxillary sinusitis with non pneumatised frontal sinus and bronchiectasis. She was treated with low concentration oxygen inhalation, antibiotic, bronchodilator, chest physiotherapy including postural drainage, vitamins and other supportive treatment.
33966302	A report of pregnancy following ICSI in one of two sisters with familiar primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a disorder of structure and function of motor ciliary and dyskinetic activity of ciliary in the fallopian tubes of affected women and could lead to infertility in some cases. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a choice of treatment in infertile women with PCD, which could conquer the tubal dysfunction. In this case study, we report a PCD affected woman with infertility who was treated by IVF and pregnancy was achieved but it failed due to the spontaneous abortion. We also performed whole-exome sequencing for this case and her PCD-affected sister, which did not reveal any genetic abnormality related to the PCD or infertility.
18179758	Effects of a program of hospital-supervised chest physical therapy on lung function tests in children with chronic respiratory disease: 1-year follow-up.	To investigate whether a hospital-supervised program of chest physical therapy improves lung function in children with chronic pulmonary diseases, twenty-four children (4 with Kartagener?s syndrome, 12 with common variable immunodeficiency, and 8 with primary ciliary dyskinesia) average age 11.2 +/- 3.2 years, were randomly assigned to a one-month hospital-supervised program of chest physical therapy (13 patients) or to a control group (11 patients) that continued unsupervised chest physical therapy at home. Lung function was assessed before the program, and one and 12 months after. At the one-month assessment, thoracic gas volume was significantly lower in the supervised group than in the controls. At the one-year assessment, forced expiratory volume in one second was significantly higher in the supervised group than in controls. A supervised program of chest physical therapy significantly improved lung function in children with chronic pulmonary diseases.
35536410	Active video gaming in primary ciliary dyskinesia: a randomized controlled trial.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) impairs pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, and exercise capacity. We aimed to investigate the effects of active video games (AVGs) on pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity, muscle oxygenation (SMO2), physical activity, activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life (QOL) in PCD. Thirty-two PCD patients were randomly assigned to AVG group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 16). AVG group underwent AVGs using Xbox-Kinect-360 device for 40 min/day, 3 days/week for 8 weeks plus airway clearance techniques (ACT), and the control group was applied ACT only. Pulmonary function, respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength, exercise capacity (6-min walk test [6MWT], incremental shuttle walk test [ISWT]), and ADL (Glittre ADL test) were assessed. SMO2 during ISWT and ADL test was also recorded. Physical activity and QOL (PCD-QOL) were evaluated. Pulmonary function; respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength; 6MWT and ISWT distance; physical activity; ADL performance; SMO2; physical, emotional, and social functioning; treatment burden; and upper and lower symptom parameters of PCD-QOL significantly improved after 8 weeks in the AVG group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in measured parameters except emotional function and upper respiratory symptom scores of PCD-QOL in the control group (p > 0.05).    Conclusion: The AVGs positively affect pulmonary (pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength) and extrapulmonary (peripheral muscle strength, exercise capacity, SMO2, physical activity, ADL, and QOL) characteristics in children with PCD. The AVGs may be added to the pulmonary rehabilitation program as an exercise training modality in patients with PCD.   Trial registration: This study registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with NCT03832491 on February 6, 2019. What is Known:   It is indicated that exercise capacity is increased with traditional exercise-training in a case report of Kartagener Syndrome. What is New:   No randomized controlled study investigated the effects of exercise-training in PCD.   8-week moderate-intensity active video gaming (AVGs) improves pulmonary and extrapulmonary features in children with PCD. AVGs may be preferable due to being enjoyable, providing visual and audial feedback in the pulmonary rehabilitation programs of PCD.
30021461	Variation in treatment strategies for the eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in primary ciliary dyskinesia across European centers.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease causing motile cilia dysfunction, recurrent airway infection, and bronchiectasis. Airway infection management strategies are borrowed from cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to describe the management of airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA) in children and adults with PCD across European centers. An online survey questionnaire was sent electronically using SurveyMonkey  to 55 PCD centers in 36 European countries. Fifty-two responded from 43 centers in 26 countries, a response rate of 70%. Most (89%) countries did not have written guidelines for PCD management. Airway sampling for infection detection at each clinic visit was more likely when follow-up was frequent. Eighty-seven percent of centers chose to treat the first PA isolate, most prescribing combined oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistimethate sodium (43%, n = 18). The preferred treatment for chronic infection with PA was nebulized colistimethate in 51% ( n = 22). In summary, considerable variation exists across European centers in the frequency of patient follow-up and airway sampling for infection, treatment goals, and the management of PA infection. Few centers had written guidelines for PCD management. Clinical trials to determine optimal treatment of PA in PCD patients are urgently needed.
31345208	Primary ciliary dyskinesia in Japan: systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder. Although the genetic tests and new diagnostic algorithms have recently been recommended, clinical signs and electron microscope (EM) findings have historically been the mainstays of diagnosis in Asia. To characterize PCD previously reported in Japan, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (in Japanese) databases was carried out to identify articles reporting PCD, Kartagener syndrome, or immotile cilia syndrome in Japanese patients and published between 1985 and 2015. RESULTS: After excluding duplication from 334 reports, we extracted 316 patients according to the criteria. Diagnosis was most frequently made in adulthood (148 patients [46.8%] >= 18 years old, 24 patients [7.6%] < 1 year old, 68 patients [21.5%] 1-17 years old and 76 patients [24.1%] lacking information). Of the 230 patients (72.8%) who received EM examination, there were patients with inner dynein arm (IDA) defects (n = 55; 23.9%), outer dynein arm (ODA) defects (14; 6.1%), both ODA and IDA defects (57; 24.8%), other structural abnormalities (25; 10.9%), no abnormalities (4; 1.7%), and no detailed conclusion or description (75; 32.6%). CONCLUSION: Delayed diagnosis of this congenital disease with high frequency of IDA defects and low frequency of ODA defects appear to be historical features of PCD reported in Japan, when EM was a main diagnostic tool. This review highlights problems experienced in this field, and provides basic information to establish a modernized PCD diagnosis and management system in the future.
34672773	Successful Live Birth Following Natural Cycle Oocyte Retrieval in a Woman with Primary Infertility and Atypical Primary Ovarian Insufficiency with a DNAH1 Gene Deletion Mutation.	Background: Dynein, axonemal, heavy chain 1 (DNAH1) gene mutations have been found to be related to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and the DNAH1 gene is associated with abnormal flagellar morphology in spermatozoa. Infertility is a common condition in women presenting with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) characterized by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical significance of genetic diagnostics in several Chinese primary infertile women with atypical POI. Methods: Four atypical POI patients and 100 healthy subjects were recruited, genetic pathogenicityc factors were investigated by whole exome sequencing (WES). Results: WES revealed a homozygous deletion mutation in the DNAH1 gene (NM_015512.5; c.11726_11727delCT, p.Pro3909Argfs*33) in one of the four POI patients. The 31-year-old affected woman presented with a normal menstrual cycle and elevated plasma levels of FSH, around the postmenopausal range, but had a normal antral follicle count and normal anti-Mullerian hormone levels. The patient, after two failed ovulation cycles, became pregnant in the third IVF cycle and delivered a healthy girl at term. Conclusions: The homozygous deletion mutation in the DNAH1 gene suggested that the patient might have a cilia movement disorder of the fallopian tubes, which is a known infertility factor. Moreover, the significantly elevated plasma level of FSH in this patient is likely one of the most important factors leading to her decreased fertility.
30209139	Severe disease due to CCDC40 gene variants and the perils of late diagnosis in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) can manifest in the neonatal period with severe respiratory distress. We describe a child with PCD who presented at term with severe neonatal respiratory distress, persistent right upper lobe collapse and failure to thrive who underwent lobectomy prior to the diagnosis of PCD at the age of 3 years. This case report illustrates the severe spectrum of lung disease associated with coiled-coil domain containing protein 40 (CCDC40) gene variants in patients with PCD.
35738979	[Respiratory physiotherapy in pediatric practice].	Congestion of the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tracts (LRT) is a common symptom in several acute and chronic respiratory diseases that occur in childhood. To eliminate these secretions, airway clearance techniques (ACT) directed to the URT and LRT are frequently prescribed. The rationale for the application of these techniques is the same as in adults, but they need to be adapted to be transposed to children. The physiotherapist will be able to choose among a wide range of techniques, of which the most adequate will depend not only on the age of the child and the indication, but also on the basis of his preferences or habits, as well as those of the child. Upper airway clearance, including nasal irrigation, is now recommended for acute and chronic rhinosinusitis in children. It is also one of the symptomatic treatments recommended for infants with acute bronchiolitis. For LRT clearance, several indications, such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and neuromuscular disease, are now widely advocated. Conversely, other indications, such as for infants with acute viral bronchiolitis, are highly controversial. Thoughtful application of these techniques is lacking in robust and precise tools to objectively assess the presence of bronchial congestion, and to treat it accordingly. Similarly, no precise and reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of these ACTs is available to date. This review is designed to explore the ACTs used by physiotherapists, to provide an overview of their current indications, and to consider complementary approaches.
28232410	A randomised controlled trial on the effect of inhaled hypertonic saline on quality of life in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	Hypertonic saline inhalation lowers airway mucous viscosity. Increased cough transportability may improve quality of life (QoL) in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).In this randomised controlled trial (RCT), PCD patients received twice-daily inhalations of hypertonic (7%) saline or isotonic (0.9%) saline for 12 weeks, with 4 weeks washout during crossover. Primary outcome was change in QoL measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score. Secondary outcomes were SGRQ subscores, Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bronchiectasis (QoL-B) scores, lower respiratory tract infection symptoms, exacerbations, spirometry, systemic and sputum inflammatory markers, adherence, and adverse events.There was no significant change in median (interquartile range) SGRQ total score between hypertonic saline (-2.6 (-9.0-1.5)) and isotonic saline (-0.3 (-8.1-6.1)) in 22 patients (age range 22-73 years) (p=0.38). QoL-B Health Perception scale improved with hypertonic saline (p=0.03). Adverse events occurred more frequently with hypertonic saline, but were mild.12 weeks of inhaled hypertonic saline did not improve SGRQ total score in adult PCD patients in this RCT, but the sample size was small. On the secondary and more disease-specific end-point of the QoL-B, a significant improvement was observed in the Health Perception scale. This study found little evidence to support the hypothesis that hypertonic saline improves QoL in PCD patients. We advise the use of disease-specific outcome measures in future trials.
26729821	Gene editing of DNAH11 restores normal cilia motility in primary ciliary dyskinesia.	BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterised by dysfunction of motile cilia. Ciliary dysmotility causes poor mucociliary clearance and leads to impairment of pulmonary function and severe respiratory infections. PCD has no specific therapy. With the aim to permanently restore gene function and normalise ciliary motility, we used gene editing to replace mutated with wild-type sequence in defective cells. METHODS: The target gene was dynein heavy chain 11 (DNAH11), an essential component of ciliary structure. Airway ciliated cells were collected from two patients with PCD with DNAH11 nonsense mutations and altered ciliary beating and pattern. Repair of the genetic defect was performed ex vivo by site-specific recombination using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). RESULTS: In an epithelial cell line engineered to contain the DNAH11 target site, TALENs cleaved over 80% of the mutated DNAH11 sequence and replaced the mutated sequence with wild-type sequence in about 50% of cells. In airway ciliated cells of patients with PCD, site-specific recombination and normalisation of ciliary beating and pattern occurred in 33% and 29% of cells, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that gene editing can rescue ciliary beating ex vivo, opening up new avenues for treating PCD.
35854386	Clinical and genetic spectrum of primary ciliary dyskinesia in Chinese patients: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) represents a highly heterogenous disorder with extensive clinical and genetic patterns among populations of different geographic location and ethnic origin. However, data about Chinese patients are limited. We aimed to summarize the clinical and genetic spectrum of Chinese PCD patients based on all available literatures. METHODS: We searched Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science and Chinese databases including CNKI, SinoMed and Wanfang from 1981 to 2021, to identify articles reporting patients with PCD in China, which had included information about transmission electron microscopy and/or genetic testing. RESULTS: A total of 244 Chinese PCD patients in 52 articles were included. Of these patients, the mean age was 13.1 years, and 55 patients (22.5%) were diagnosed with PCD after 18 years old. Compared with patients diagnosed with PCD in childhood or infancy, patients diagnosed with PCD in adulthood had a higher prevalence of chronic wet cough, sinusitis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) isolation and radiological bronchiectasis as well as worse lung function. 25 PCD-related genes were identified in 142 patients, and DNAH5, DNAH11, CCDC39 and CCDC40 were the most frequently detected mutations. More than half of genetic variants were loss-of-function mutations, and the majority of these variants were seen only once. Correlations between PCD phenotype, genotype and ciliary ultrastructure were also evidenced. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic delay and under-recognition of PCD remain a big issue in China, which contributes to progressive lung disease and PA infection indicating worse outcome. Specialist equipment and expertise are urgently required to facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of PCD. TRIAL REGISTRY: PROSPERO; No.: CRD42021257804; URL: www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/.
28408202	Airway Clearance Techniques for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia; is the Cystic Fibrosis literature portable?	Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited disease with impaired mucociliary clearance. Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) are commonly recommended for patients with PCD to facilitate mucus clearance, despite a lack of evidence in this group. Current physiotherapy practice in PCD is based on evidence extrapolated from the field of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). This paper focuses on the available evidence and outlines challenges in extrapolating evidence between the conditions for best clinical practice.
34674941	A novel CCDC39 mutation causes multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella in a primary ciliary dyskinesia patient.	RESEARCH QUESTION: Male infertility is a widespread symptom in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD-related male infertility is often caused by asthenozoospermia, with barely normal sperm morphology. Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) are a major cause of asthenozoospermia, characterized by various malformed morphologies of sperm flagella. To date, a limited number of genes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of both PCD and MMAF. What other genes associated with both PCD and MMAF are waiting to be discovered? DESIGN: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the pathogenic mutation associated with MMAF in a PCD patient. Peripheral venous blood and semen samples were collected from the PCD patient. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were conducted to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation in CCDC39, c.983 T>C (p. Leu328Pro), was identified in two PCD-affected siblings of a consanguineous family showing a typical PCD phenotype, while the proband was infertile, which is associated with characterized MMAF. Furthermore, TEM revealed the abnormal ultrastructure of the patient's sperm flagella. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed that CCDC39 was almost undetectable in the spermatozoa, which was further confirmed by western blotting. The outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the patient with the CCDC39 mutation was also favourable. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a novel loss-of-function mutation of CCDC39 is involved in the pathogenesis of PCD and MMAF and initially reported that ICSI treatment has a good outcome. Therefore, the novel variant of CCDC39 contributes to the genetic diagnosis, counselling and treatment of male infertility in PCD patients with MMAF phenotype.
27492837	Diagnosing primary ciliary dyskinesia: an international patient perspective.	"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by progressive sino-pulmonary disease, with symptoms starting soon after birth. A European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force aims to address disparities in diagnostics across Europe by providing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. We aimed to identify challenges faced by patients when referred for PCD diagnostic testing.A patient survey was developed by patient representatives and healthcare specialists to capture experience. Online versions of the survey were translated into nine languages and completed in 25 countries. Of the respondents (n=365), 74% were PCD-positive, 5% PCD-negative and 21% PCD-uncertain/inconclusive. We then interviewed 20 parents/patients. Transcripts were analysed thematically.35% of respondents visited their doctor more than 40 times with PCD-related symptoms prior to diagnostic referral. Furthermore, the most prominent theme among interviewees was a lack of PCD awareness among medical practitioners and failure to take past history into account, leading to delayed diagnosis. Patients also highlighted the need for improved reporting of results and a solution to the ""inconclusive"" diagnostic status.These findings will be used to advise the ERS Task Force guidelines for diagnosing PCD, and should help stakeholders responsible for improving existing services and expanding provision for diagnosis of this rare disease."
33741788	Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Complicated by an Interrupted Inferior Vena Cava.	Heterotaxy refers to a congenital disorder in which there is a disruption of the normal left-right axis, resulting in duplication of one laterality, and can affect all of the thoracic and abdominal organs. Findings include atrial isomerism, vascular abnormalities affecting the great vessels, ciliary dyskinesia, polysplenia or asplenia, biliary atresia, and gut malrotation. These anomalies can present unique challenges in the critical care setting, particularly in those requiring mechanical circulatory support. Here, we present a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring venovenous extracorporeal oxygenation which was complicated by a persistent impedance of flow. She was subsequently discovered to have an interrupted inferior vena cava, where lower limb venous drainage returned to the heart via the azygos and hemiazygos systems. We use this case to also highlight other manifestations of heterotaxy which may affect critical care.
32156696	Clinical features and management of children with primary ciliary dyskinesia in England.	OBJECTIVE: In England, the National Health Service commissioned a National Management Service for children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The aims of this study were to describe the health of children seen in this Service and compare lung function to children with cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Multi-centre service evaluation of the English National Management PCD Service. SETTING: Four nationally commissioned PCD centres in England. PATIENTS: 333 children with PCD reviewed in the Service in 2015; lung function data were also compared with 2970 children with CF. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis for PCD was 2.6 years, significantly lower in children with situs inversus (1.0 vs 6.0 years, p<0.001). Compared with national data from the CF Registry, mean (SD) %predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 76.8% in PCD (n=240) and 85.0% in CF, and FEV1 was lower in children with PCD up to the age of 15 years. Approximately half of children had some hearing impairment, with 26% requiring hearing aids. Children with a lower body mass index (BMI) had lower FEV1 (p<0.001). One-third of children had positive respiratory cultures at review, 54% of these grew Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that children with PCD in England have worse lung function than those with CF. Nutritional status should be considered in PCD management, as those with a lower BMI have significantly lower FEV1. Hearing impairment is common but seems to improve with age. Well-designed and powered randomised controlled trials on management of PCD are needed to inform best clinical practice.
