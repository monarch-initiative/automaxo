input_text: Twenty-year Follow-up of the First Bilateral Living-donor Lobar Lung Transplantation
  in Japan. Patients with end-stage lung disease can undergo living-donor lobar lung
  transplantation (LDLLT), with survival rates improving every year. We herein report
  the 20-year follow-up findings of the first patient who underwent LDLLT in Japan.
  A 24-year-old woman with primary ciliary dyskinesia became ventilator-dependent
  after severe respiratory failure and right-sided heart failure following repeated
  respiratory infections. In 1998, she underwent LDLLT and received her sister's right
  lower lobe and her mother's left lower lobe. Although the patient required 21 hospitalizations
  and developed unilateral bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, she is in good physical
  condition and lives without restriction at 20 years after undergoing LDLLT.
