input_text: Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a recessive
  genetically heterogeneous disorder of motile cilia with chronic otosinopulmonary
  disease and organ laterality defects in ~50% of cases. The prevalence of PCD is
  difficult to determine. Recent diagnostic advances through measurement of nasal
  nitric oxide and genetic testing has allowed rigorous diagnoses and determination
  of a robust clinical phenotype, which includes neonatal respiratory distress, daily
  nasal congestion, and wet cough starting early in life, along with organ laterality
  defects. There is early onset of lung disease in PCD with abnormal airflow mechanics
  and radiographic abnormalities detected in infancy and early childhood.
