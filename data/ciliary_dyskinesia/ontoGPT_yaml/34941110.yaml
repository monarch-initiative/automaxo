input_text: "CCDC40 mutation as a cause of infertility in a Chinese family with primary
  ciliary dyskinesia. TRIAL DESIGN: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetical
  disease that inherited in an autosomal-recessive way. Its clinical manifestations
  (such as male infertility) are mainly caused by defects of motion-related cilia
  that encoded by mutated genes. Although some mutation has been verified, a number
  of mutations of PCD remain elusive. The main purpose of this study is to identify
  mutant genes in a Chinese family with PCD, and to verify the safety and effectiveness
  of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of infertility caused by PCD. METHODS:
  Imaging examination was used to exclude pulmonary inflammation and visceral translocation.
  Semen analysis was used to assess the quality of the proband's sperm. Transmission
  electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to assess the ultrastructure of flagella
  and cilia. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing and qPCR (real-time
  quantitative polymerase chain reaction detecting system) were applied to identified
  mutation of Chinese Family suspected of having PCD. Viable sperm were selected by
  hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) for ICSI. RESULTS: We report 2 novel mutations
  in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion) resulted in immobility of sperm
  and infertility of the proband. These mutations were confirmed in the proband's
  sister (heterozygous) and his parents (recessive carrier) by Sanger sequencing and
  qPCR. All the spermatozoa from the proband were immotile. Ultrastructural defects
  were found in flagella and cilia of proband and his sister. Viable sperms were selected
  by HOST for ICSI and fertilized 9 of 21 eggs. Two frozen embryos were transplanted
  and a healthy 3500 g boy was delivered at 40 + 4 weeks' gestation. And then, we
  summarized the genes related to PCD and the mutant sites of CCDC40 gene. CONCLUSION:
  We reported 2 novel mutants in CCDC40 gene (c.1259delA and EX17_20 deletion), which
  could be candidates for genetic diagnosis in PCD patients. The combination of targeted
  next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing may be a useful tool to diagnose
  PCD. ICSI is a considerable method in treatment of infertility caused by PCD."
