input_text: '[Analysis of a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia caused by DNAH5
  variants]. OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a patient with primary ciliary
  dyskinesia (PCD). METHODS: High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis
  were carried out to identify pathogenic variant in the patient. Suspected variant
  was verified by Sanger sequencing among the family members, and intracytoplasmic
  sperm injection (ICSI) was used to achieve the pregnancy. RESULTS: The patient had
  obstructive azoospermia, measurement of nasal NO exhalation at 84 ppb, and typical
  symptoms of PCD in nasal sinuses and lungs. DNA sequencing showed that he had carried
  biallelic variants of the DNAH5 gene, namely c.1489C>T (p.Q497X) in exon 11 and
  c.6304C>T (p.R2102C) in exon 38. His wife achieved clinical pregnancy with the assistance
  of ICSI. CONCLUSION: Above finding has enriched the spectrum of DNAH5 gene variants,
  though the latters did not affect the outcome of pregnancy by ICSI.'
