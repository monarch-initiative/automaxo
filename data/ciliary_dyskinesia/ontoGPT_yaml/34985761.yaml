input_text: "Intermittent prophylactic antibiotics for bronchiectasis. BACKGROUND:
  Bronchiectasis is a common but under-diagnosed chronic disorder characterised by
  permanent dilation of the airways arising from a cycle of recurrent infection and
  inflammation. Symptoms including chronic, persistent cough and productive phlegm
  are a significant burden for people with bronchiectasis, and the main aim of treatment
  is to reduce exacerbation frequency and improve quality of life. Prophylactic antibiotic
  therapy aims to break this infection cycle and is recommended by clinical guidelines
  for adults with three or more exacerbations a year, based on limited evidence. It
  is important to weigh the evidence for bacterial suppression against the prevention
  of antibiotic resistance and further evidence is required on the safety and efficacy
  of different regimens of intermittently administered antibiotic treatments for people
  with bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intermittent
  prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.
  SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register,
  which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches
  of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary
  studies. We conducted searches on 6 September 2021, with no restriction on language
  of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
  of at least three months' duration comparing an intermittent regime of prophylactic
  antibiotics with placebo, usual care or an alternate intermittent regimen. Intermittent
  prophylactic administration was defined as repeated courses of antibiotics with
  on-treatment and off-treatment intervals of at least 14 days' duration. We included
  adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis confirmed by high
  resolution computed tomography (HRCT), plain film chest radiograph, or bronchography
  and a documented history of recurrent chest infections. We excluded studies where
  participants received high dose antibiotics immediately prior to enrolment or those
  with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA),
  primary ciliary dyskinesia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, sarcoidosis, or a primary diagnosis
  of COPD. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events.
  We did not exclude studies on the basis of review outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND
  ANALYSIS: We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk (RRs)
  and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs).
  We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted GRADE
  assessments for the following primary outcomes: exacerbation frequency; serious
  adverse events and secondary outcomes: antibiotic resistance; hospital admissions;
  health-related quality of life. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with interventions
  ranging from 16 to 48 weeks, involving 2180 adults. All evaluated one of three types
  of antibiotics over two to six cycles of 28 days on/off treatment: aminoglycosides,
  ss-lactams or fluoroquinolones. Two studies also included 12 cycles of 14 days on/off
  treatment with fluoroquinolones. Participants had a mean age of 63.6 years, 65%
  were women and approximately 85% Caucasian. Baseline FEV1 ranged from 55.5% to 62.6%
  predicted. None of the studies included children. Generally, there was a low risk
  of bias in the included studies. Antibiotic versus placebo: cycle of 14 days on/off.
  Ciprofloxacin reduced the frequency of exacerbations compared to placebo (RR 0.75,
  95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence),
  with eight people (95% CI 6 to 28) needed to treat for an additional beneficial
  outcome. The intervention increased the risk of antibiotic resistance more than
  twofold (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.35; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 624 participants; high-certainty
  evidence). Serious adverse events, lung function (FEV1), health-related quality
  of life, and adverse effects did not differ between groups. Antibiotic versus placebo:
  cycle of 28 days on/off. Antibiotics did not reduce overall exacerbation frequency
  (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1695 participants; high-certainty
  evidence) but there were fewer severe exacerbations (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93;
  I2 = 54%; 3 studies, 624 participants), though this should be interpreted with caution
  due to low event rates. The risk of antibiotic resistance was more than twofold
  higher based on a pooled analysis (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.42; I2 = 0%; 3 studies,
  685 participants; high-certainty evidence) and consistent with unpooled data from
  four further studies. Serious adverse events, time to first exacerbation, duration
  of exacerbation, respiratory-related hospital admissions, lung function, health-related
  quality of life and adverse effects did not differ between study groups. Antibiotic
  versus usual care. We did not find any studies that compared intermittent antibiotic
  regimens with usual care. Cycle of 14 days on/off versus cycle of 28 days on/off.
  Exacerbation frequency did not differ between the two treatment regimens (RR 1.02,
  95% CI 0.84 to 1.24; I2 = 71%; 2 studies, 625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence)
  However, inconsistencies in the results from the two trials in this comparison indicate
  that the apparent aggregated similarities may not be reliable. There was no evidence
  of a difference in antibiotic resistance between groups (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to
  1.48; I2 = 60%; 2 studies, 624 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Serious
  adverse events, adverse effects, lung function and health-related quality of life
  did not differ between the two antibiotic regimens. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
  in adults who have frequent chest infections, long-term antibiotics given at 14-day
  on/off intervals slightly reduces the frequency of those infections and increases
  antibiotic resistance. Intermittent antibiotic regimens result in little to no difference
  in serious adverse events. The impact of intermittent antibiotic therapy on children
  with bronchiectasis is unknown due to an absence of evidence, and further research
  is needed to establish the potential risks and benefits."
