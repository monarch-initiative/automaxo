input_text: Never too old for an inherited condition. Primary ciliary dyskinesia is
  an uncommon, inherited condition causing progressive suppurative airway lung disease
  with subsequent bronchiectasis, chronic rhinitis-sinusitis, deafness and reduced
  fertility. Diagnosis is often delayed by lack of awareness of the condition in the
  medical community and limited access to the few centres in Australia able to do
  full diagnostic testing. This report details the late diagnosis of primary ciliary
  dyskinesia in two adults who have had long-standing interactions with medical services
  but in whom the diagnosis was never considered or even dismissed. Greater awareness
  of the condition will reduce time to diagnosis, prevent administration of ineffective
  therapy and allow earlier institution of targeted therapy.
