input_text: "Management of primary ciliary dyskinesia: the lower airways. Primary
  ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disease associated with defective ciliary
  structure and function. Chronic oto-sino-pulmonary infection is the most common
  clinical presentation. Patients should be monitored in centres with expertise in
  PCD. Regular respiratory monitoring consists of lung function tests, adapted to
  the patient's age, and cough swab or sputum cultures. Chest X-rays are insensitive
  but the use of high-resolution computed tomography should be considered carefully
  to avoid excessive radiation. Treatment of the chronic suppuration of the lower
  airways relies on antibiotics to which the isolated bacteria are sensitive, together
  with respiratory physiotherapy and exercise to clear excessive bronchial secretions.
  Bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents have no proven benefit and should be
  prescribed, if at all, on an individual basis. Treatment of the lower airways should
  always be in conjunction with that of the upper airways. Importantly in PCD, respiratory
  disease may be controlled with the use of early, adequate and aggressive management."
