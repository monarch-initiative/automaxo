input_text: Bi-allelic mutations in DNAH7 cause asthenozoospermia by impairing the
  integrality of axoneme structure. Asthenozoospermia is the most common cause of
  male infertility. Dynein protein arms play a crucial role in the motility of both
  the cilia and flagella, and defects in these proteins generally impair the axoneme
  structure and cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. But relatively little is known about
  the influence of dynein protein arm defects on sperm flagella function. Here, we
  recruited 85 infertile patients with idiopathic asthenozoospermia and identified
  bi-allelic mutations in DNAH7 (NM_018897.3) from three patients using whole-exome
  sequencing. These variants are rare, highly pathogenic, and very conserved. The
  spermatozoa from the patients with DNAH7 bi-allelic mutations showed specific losses
  in the inner dynein arms. The expression of DNAH7 in the spermatozoa from the DNAH7-defective
  patients was significantly decreased, but these patients were able to have their
  children via intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. Our study is the first
  to demonstrate that bi-allelic mutations in DNAH7 may impair the integrality of
  axoneme structure, affect sperm motility, and cause asthenozoospermia in humans.
  These findings may extend the spectrum of etiological genes and provide new clues
  for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with asthenozoospermia.
