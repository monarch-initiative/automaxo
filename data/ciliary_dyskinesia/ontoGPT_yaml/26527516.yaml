input_text: "Recent advances in primary ciliary dyskinesia. Primary ciliary dyskinesia
  (PCD) is a genetic disease inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The prevalence
  of PCD is estimated to be 1 in 20,000 live births. Congenital abnormality of the
  primary cilia results in situs inversus in 50% of patients. Decreased function of
  motile cilia causes chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media with effusion, bronchiectasis
  and infertility. Cases with situs inversus are considered to show \"Kartagener's
  syndrome\", and diagnosis is not difficult. However, in cases without situs inversus,
  the diagnosis is much more troublesome. PCD without situs inversus is thus probably
  underdiagnosed. Prolonged chronic cough represents an important symptom that is
  seen in most patients. The diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of the characteristic
  clinical phenotypes and either: (1) specific ciliary ultrastructural defects identified
  by transmission electron microscopy in biopsy samples of respiratory epithelium;
  or (2) identification of mutation in one of the genes known to be associated with
  PCD. Nasal nitric oxide concentration is extremely low in PCD, and this could be
  useful for screening of the disease. At present, no fundamental therapies are available
  for PCD. Diagnosis in the early stages is important to prevent progression of bronchiectasis
  and deterioration of lung function by guidance for daily life, immunization, cessation
  of smoking and prompt therapy at the time of respiratory tract infection. Since
  PCD is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner, genetic counseling is necessary
  after definite diagnosis. "
