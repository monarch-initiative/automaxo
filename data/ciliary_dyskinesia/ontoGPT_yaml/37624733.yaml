input_text: 'Restoring Ciliary Function: Gene Therapeutics for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.
  Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disease characterized by defects in
  motile cilia, that play an important role in several organ systems. Lung disease
  is a hallmark of PCD, given the essential role of cilia in airway surface defense.
  Diagnosis of PCD is complicated due to its reliance on complex tests that are not
  utilized by every clinic and also its phenotypic overlap with several other respiratory
  diseases. Nonetheless, PCD is increasingly being recognized as more common than
  once thought. The disease is genetically complex, with several genes reported to
  be associated with PCD. There is no cure for PCD, but gene therapy remains a promising
  therapeutic strategy. In this review we provide an overview of the clinical symptoms,
  diagnosis, genetics, and current treatment regimens for PCD. We also describe PCD
  model systems and discuss the therapeutic potential of different gene therapeutics
  for targeting the intended cellular target, the ciliated cells of the airway.'
