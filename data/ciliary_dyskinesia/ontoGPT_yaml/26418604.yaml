input_text: 'Diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia: PCD
  foundation consensus recommendations based on state of the art review. Primary ciliary
  dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, rare lung disease resulting in
  chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease in both children and adults. Many physicians
  incorrectly diagnose PCD or eliminate PCD from their differential diagnosis due
  to inexperience with diagnostic testing methods. Thus far, all therapies used for
  PCD are unproven through large clinical trials. This review article outlines consensus
  recommendations from PCD physicians in North America who have been engaged in a
  PCD centered research consortium for the last 10 years. These recommendations have
  been adopted by the governing board of the PCD Foundation to provide guidance for
  PCD clinical centers for diagnostic testing, monitoring, and appropriate short and
  long-term therapeutics in PCD patients.'
