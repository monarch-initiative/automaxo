input_text: 'Comparison of conventional chest physiotherapy and oscillatory positive
  expiratory pressure therapy in primary ciliary dyskinesia. BACKGROUND: Chest physiotherapy
  (CP) is a recommended treatment modality in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). OBJECTIVE:
  Primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of the conventional chest physiotherapy
  (CCP) and oscillatory positive expiratory pressure therapy (OPEPT). Secondary aims
  were to compare the exacerbation rate, time until the first exacerbation, patient
  compliance and comfort between the two CP methods. METHODS: This is a 6 month randomized,
  controlled crossover trial. Patients >6 years of age with PCD were randomized into
  two groups, first group was assigned to OPEPT (Acapella ) for 3 months while second
  group was assigned to CCP. Groups were crossed over to the other modality after
  a 15-day washout period. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and compliance were monitored
  by monthly clinic visits. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in FEV1 , FEF25-75
  , and PEF values (p = .018, p = .020, and p = .016, respectively) in the OPEPT group
  and in FVC values (p = .007) in CCP group compared to baseline. However PFT increase
  at 3rd month was not superior to each other with both physiotherapy methods. Median
  acute pulmonary exacerbation rate and time period until the first exacerbation were
  similar in both groups (p = .821, p = .092, respectively). Comfort and effectiveness
  of OPEPT was higher than CCP according to patients (p = .029 and p = .042, respectively).
  There were no adverse effects with either therapy. CONCLUSIONS: OPEPT was as effective
  as CCP in PCD patients. OPEPT was more comfortable and effective than CCP according
  to patients. OPEPT might be an efficient alternative method for airway cleareance
  in PCD patients.'
