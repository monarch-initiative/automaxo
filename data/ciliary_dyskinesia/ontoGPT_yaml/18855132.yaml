input_text: 'Successful twin birth following blastocyst culture of embryos derived
  from the immotile ejaculated spermatozoa from a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia:
  a case report. PURPOSE: To describe the ultrastructure of spermatozoa from a patient
  with complete asthenozoospermia that resulted in live births following blastocyst
  culture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analyses of spermatozoa from a 36 year old patient
  were performed using light and electron microscopy. The hypo-osmotic swelling test
  was used to select spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Embryos were
  cultured to the blastocyst stage. RESULTS: 100% of the spermatozoa had dynein arm
  deficiency with secondary defects varying from 3-17%. Six oocytes were injected;
  five fertilized normally and one was digynic. All five zygotes formed good quality
  blastocysts. Three blastocysts were cryopreserved and two blastocysts were transferred.
  Twin females were born at 37 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The hypo-osmotic swelling test
  can be used to select viable immotile ejaculated spermatozoa from a patient with
  dynein arm deficiency and can produce excellent fertilization rates and blastocyst
  development resulting in live births.'
