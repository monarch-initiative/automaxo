input_text: "Growing up with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia in Bradford, UK: exploring
  patients experiences as a physiotherapist. Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a
  condition which causes impaired mucociliary clearance, resulting in sputum retention
  and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Physiotherapy, in the form of airway
  clearance techniques and exercise is recommended to patients with PCD to facilitate
  sputum clearance. As children diagnosed with PCD develop into adults, understanding
  their experiences of growing up with this long-term condition and undertaking physiotherapy
  may help to provide insight to clinicians. No previous research has been published
  which explores the lived experiences of children and young people with PCD. The
  prevalence of PCD in Bradford in the North of the UK is unusually high, signifying
  the importance of understanding the experiences of this patient population. This
  qualitative study used Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis to allow the researcher,
  as a physiotherapist, to investigate the lived experiences of five paediatric patients
  with PCD. While patients' experiences are all unique, three themes emerged across
  the analysis of the interviews: (1) the experiences of day to day life with the
  symptoms and treatment burden of PCD; (2) participants' awareness of their own symptoms
  and knowledge of PCD; and (3) the development of mastery skills and devolution of
  management from the family to the growing child. The results from this study suggested
  that facilitation of disease acceptance, strategies to increase patient empowerment,
  the use of patient-centred communication and understanding the contextualisation
  of patients' experiences may all help to guide clinical practice."
