input_text: 'Clinical features of primary ciliary dyskinesia in Cyprus with emphasis
  on lobectomized patients. BACKGROUND: Despite the manifestations of primary ciliary
  dyskinesia (PCD) in early life, the diagnosis is often much delayed. Since 1998
  in Cyprus, we have established the only national diagnostic and clinical referral
  center for PCD. OBJECTIVE: To review the phenotypic features at presentation of
  PCD patients in Cyprus in relation to age at diagnosis, with emphasis on previously
  lobectomised patients. METHODS: The medical records of the diagnosed PCD patients
  were retrospectively reviewed to obtain clinical data on presentation. RESULTS:
  Thirty patients, aged 13.9 years (range 0.1, 58.4 years), were diagnosed with PCD.
  Twelve of them presented after the age of 18. The most common manifestations were
  chronic cough (100%), chronic rhinorrhea (96.7%), sputum production (92.9%), laterality
  defects (63.3%), a history of pneumonia (53.3%) and neonatal respiratory distress
  (50%). A history of lobectomy in the past was recorded in 16.7% (5 patients). Patients
  who presented in adulthood had significantly higher frequency of lobectomy (41.7%
  vs 0%, p-value = 0.006) and had more frequently low FEV1 (58.3% vs 0%, p-value =
  0.015) than those who presented before. Serial measurements of FEV1 and FVC indicated
  significantly lower intercepts in lobectomised compared to the adult non-lobectomised
  patients both in terms of FEV1 (-4.90 vs -1.80, p-value = 0.022) and FVC (-5.43
  vs -1.91, p-value = 0.029) z-score levels. Change in FEV1 and FVC across time was
  not statistically significant in either group. CONCLUSIONS: PCD often remains undiagnosed
  up to adulthood accompanied by appearance of advanced lung disease. Performance
  of lobectomies seems to be a poor prognostic factor for PCD in adulthood.'
