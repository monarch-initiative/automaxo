input_text: 'Airway Clearance Techniques in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: A Systematic
  Review. OBJECTIVE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a respiratory disorder that
  impairs mucociliary clearance, leading to decreased lung function. Conventional
  chest physiotherapy (CCP) is the traditional airway clearance technique (ACT) and
  is considered a standard treatment for PCD patients. This systematic review investigated
  whether device supported ACTs are better alternatives for improving lung function
  and/or quality of life in PCD, compared with CCP. METHODS: The OVID Medline, PubMed,
  CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. The Preferred Reporting Items for
  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and the Grading of
  Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to aggregate
  the data. This systematic review has been registered on the International Prospective
  Register of Systematic Reviews website. RESULTS: Of the 389 citations that resulted
  from our literature search, 2 randomized crossover trials that included a total
  of 54 patients were analyzed. The certainty of the aggregated study evidence was
  very low. No difference was identified between device-supported ACTs and CCP in
  terms of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second in PCD patients
  aged 6 to 20 years. CONCLUSION: Device-supported ACTs could be considered alternative
  treatment options to replace CCP. High quality research is required to confirm this
  result.'
