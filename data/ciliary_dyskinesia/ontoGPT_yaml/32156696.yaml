input_text: 'Clinical features and management of children with primary ciliary dyskinesia
  in England. OBJECTIVE: In England, the National Health Service commissioned a National
  Management Service for children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The aims
  of this study were to describe the health of children seen in this Service and compare
  lung function to children with cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Multi-centre service
  evaluation of the English National Management PCD Service. SETTING: Four nationally
  commissioned PCD centres in England. PATIENTS: 333 children with PCD reviewed in
  the Service in 2015; lung function data were also compared with 2970 children with
  CF. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis for PCD was 2.6 years, significantly lower
  in children with situs inversus (1.0 vs 6.0 years, p<0.001). Compared with national
  data from the CF Registry, mean (SD) %predicted forced expiratory volume in one
  second (FEV1) was 76.8% in PCD (n=240) and 85.0% in CF, and FEV1 was lower in children
  with PCD up to the age of 15 years. Approximately half of children had some hearing
  impairment, with 26% requiring hearing aids. Children with a lower body mass index
  (BMI) had lower FEV1 (p<0.001). One-third of children had positive respiratory cultures
  at review, 54% of these grew Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence
  that children with PCD in England have worse lung function than those with CF. Nutritional
  status should be considered in PCD management, as those with a lower BMI have significantly
  lower FEV1. Hearing impairment is common but seems to improve with age. Well-designed
  and powered randomised controlled trials on management of PCD are needed to inform
  best clinical practice.'
