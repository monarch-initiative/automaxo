input_text: Can pentoxifylline improve the sperm motion and ICSI success in the primary
  ciliary dyskinesia? Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), previously known as immotile
  cilia syndrome, can cause respiratory and reproductive problems. Because of the
  impaired motion of microtubules the patients suffer upper respiratory tract problems.
  Infertility is an other issue of these patients. Several attempt have been proposed
  to bring back sperm motion and to improve intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
  results. With our case we have described the management of a male infertility that
  causes from immotile cilia. The role of ICSI with incubated and activated ejaculatory
  sperm by pentoxifylline in the patient of PCD or as commonly named immotile cilia
  syndrome.
