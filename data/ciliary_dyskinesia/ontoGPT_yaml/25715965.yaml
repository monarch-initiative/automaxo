input_text: 'Bronchiectasis. INTRODUCTION: Bronchiectasis is usually a complication
  of previous lower respiratory infection and/or inflammation. It causes chronic cough,
  copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may
  cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may
  complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with
  primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases
  such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation.
  Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review.
  METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following
  clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic
  fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library,
  and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are
  updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of
  this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US
  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
  Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence
  for interventions. RESULTS: We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria.
  CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness
  and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids
  (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics,
  prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.'
