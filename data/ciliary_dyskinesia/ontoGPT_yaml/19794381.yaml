input_text: Recurrent peptic ulcer disease in a pediatric patient with type 1 neurofibromatosis
  and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant
  neurocutaneous disorder with characteristic features of skin and central nervous
  system involvement. Gastrointestinal complications are rare, especially during childhood.
  In adults, only two cases of peptic ulcer have been reported in neurofibromatosis,
  both due to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) may be primary
  or secondary in nature and it may be life threatening in the acute phase due to
  the risk of perforation. A case of recurrent gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a child
  with systemic neurofibromatosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is presented.
  The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of multiple gastric ulcers.
  The ulcers scarred after the long-term administration of a proton pump inhibitor
  (PPI), but recurred after the suspension. Laboratory and imaging studies excluded
  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other known causes of PUD, suggesting a potential
  role of neurofibromatosis itself and primary ciliary dyskinesia in developing of
  recurrent PUD. As early diagnosis of PUD is vital for patient survival, this case
  report highlights the possible association of neurofibromatosis and PCD with this
  condition, responsive to PPI therapy and the potential need of gastric protection
  before complications arise.
