input_text: 'Comparison of conventional pulmonary rehabilitation and high-frequency
  chest wall oscillation in primary ciliary dyskinesia. BACKGROUND: Enhancement of
  mucociliary clearance by pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is advocated in primary ciliary
  dyskinesia (PCD). Our primary aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of postural
  drainage, percussion and vibration [conventional PR (CPR)], and high frequency chest
  wall oscillation (HFCWO) by studying change in pulmonary function. Our secondary
  aim was to evaluate patient preferences regarding the two methods. METHODS: This
  was a controlled randomized crossover study. PCD patients between the ages of 7
  and 18 years were assigned to two groups, first group performed airway clearance
  with CPR at hospital for 5 days and after a 2-day washout period HFCWO was applied
  to the same group at home. HFCWO was applied first to the other group and then these
  patients were hospitalized for CPR. The primary outcome measure of the study was
  pulmonary function test (PFT). The secondary outcomes were pulse arterial oxygen
  saturation (SpO2 ) and the perceived efficiency and comfort level. RESULTS: PFT
  values of patients increased significantly after both PR methods (before/after):
  CPR: FVC: 77.0 +- 14.1/81.8 +- 13.0 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 72.9 +- 14.8/78.7 +- 13.5
  (P = 0.001); PEF: 73.8 +- 14.5/82.5 +- 14.5 (P = 0.001); FEF25-75 : 68.6 +- 27.6/74.9
  +- 29.3 (P = 0.007). HFCWO FVC: 75.1 +- 15.3/80.3 +- 13.9 (P = 0.002); FEV1 : 71.4
  +- 16/77.4 +- 14.6 (P = 0.001); PEF: 70.9 +- 18.0/78.3 +- 17.7 (P = 0.002); FEF25-75
  : 70.5 +- 23.4/76.4 +- 25.6 (P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in
  % predicted FVC, FEV1 , PEF, and FEF25-75 increased values with CPR and HFCWO. HFCWO
  was found more comfortable (P = 0.04). Two PR methods were found efficient and no
  desaturation occurred during PR. CONCLUSIONS: PFTs were significantly increased
  after both PR methods. There were no differences in PFTs and SpO2 between the CPR
  and HFCWO groups. Both PR methods were found efficient. HFCWO was found more comfortable.
  HFCWO may be an option in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and low adherence
  to PR.'
