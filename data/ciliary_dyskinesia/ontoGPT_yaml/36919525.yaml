input_text: "Underlying causes and outcomes of recurrent pneumonia in hospitalized
  children. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and underlying causes
  of recurrent pneumonia (RP) among hospitalized children, and to identify risk factors
  associated with adverse outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of hospitalized
  children diagnosed with RP at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January
  2016 to January 2021 and then described clinical characteristics and underlying
  causes. The associations between factors and adverse outcomes were assessed using
  logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 551 children with RP, 483 (87.7%) manifested underlying
  causes, with recurrent aspiration (127, 23.0%), primary immunodeficiency (PID) (91,
  16.5%), and congenital heart diseases (63, 11.4%) being the most common. Genetic
  defects were identified in about a quarter (158, 28.7%) of the patients. PID odds
  ratio (OR, 7.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-22.8), primary ciliary dyskinesia
  (OR, 12.9; 95% CI, 3.0-54.8), bronchiolitis obliterans (OR, 7.0; 95% CI, 1.7-28.5),
  and a diagnosis of RP at an age of >3 years (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-9.0) were risk
  factors for severe outcomes. Aspiration (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and an abnormal
  family history (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.2) were risk factors for rehospitalization.
  CONCLUSIONS: The majority (87.7%) of hospitalized children with RP exhibited underlying
  causes, and genetic defects were common."
