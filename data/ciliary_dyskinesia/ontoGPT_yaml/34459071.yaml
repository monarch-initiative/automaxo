input_text: 'Physical fitness and activities of daily living in primary ciliary dyskinesia:
  A retrospective study. BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, hereditary,
  autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent upper and lower respiratory
  tract infections. This study aimed to compare pulmonary function, respiratory muscle
  strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and activities of daily living (ADLs)
  retrospectively between patients with PCD and healthy controls. METHODS: Data from
  20 patients with PCD and 20 matched, healthy counterparts recorded between July
  2015 and January 2017 were analyzed. The data evaluated and recorded included pulmonary
  function using a portable spirometer, respiratory muscle strength (using a mouth
  pressure device, exercise capacity using the incremental shuttle walk test,), physical
  fitness (using the Munich Fitness Test), and ADLs (using the Glittre ADL test).
  RESULTS: Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, incremental shuttle walk
  test scores (all parameters), and total Munich Fitness Test scores were lower in
  the PCD group relative to controls (P < 0.05). The duration to complete the Glittre
  ADL test was higher in PCD patients than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
  Pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness,
  and ADL were affected by PCD. Thus, pulmonary rehabilitation regimens should be
  tailored according to these impacts.'
