input_text: 'Clinical care of children with primary ciliary dyskinesia. INTRODUCTION:
  Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare heterogeneous disorder, usually inherited
  as an autosomal recessive condition but X-linked inheritance is also described.
  Abnormal ciliary function in childhood leads to neonatal respiratory distress in
  term infants, persistent wet cough, bronchiectasis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and
  hearing impairment; approximately 50% of patients have situs inversus. There is
  a paucity of evidence for treating PCD, hence consensus guidelines are predominantly
  influenced by knowledge from cystic fibrosis (CF). Extrapolation of evidence from
  other diseases is inappropriate since differences in pathophysiology, morbidity
  and prognosis risk treatment failure and lack of adherence. Areas covered: Review
  authors searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for publications relating to management
  of children with PCD. Because of the paucity of data, we emphasise the need for
  well-designed clinical trials with PCD patients rather than reliance on evidence
  from other diseases. Expert commentary: The evidence for treatment of PCD is poor,
  and management is often extrapolated from studies of patients with CF or chronic
  rhinosinusitis. However, much work is underway to improve the situation and international
  consortia and networks are conducting well-designed projects to inform the management
  of children with PCD.'
