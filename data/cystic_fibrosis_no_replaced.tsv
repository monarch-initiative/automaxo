38171021	The role of hypermutation and collateral sensitivity in antimicrobial resistance diversity of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> populations in cystic fibrosis lung infection.Upon infection in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> rapidly acquires genetic mutations, especially in genes involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), often resulting in diverse, treatment-resistant populations. However, the role of bacterial population diversity within the context of chronic infection is still poorly understood. In this study, we found that hypermutator strains of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in the CF lung undergoing treatment with tobramycin evolved increased sensitivity to tobramycin relative to non-hypermutators within the same population. This finding suggests that antimicrobial treatment may only exert weak selection pressure on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> populations in the CF lung. We further found no evidence for collateral sensitivity in these clinical populations, suggesting that collateral sensitivity may not be a robust, naturally occurring phenomenon for this microbe.
38169295	An <i>in vitro</i> medium for modeling gut dysbiosis associated with cystic fibrosis.Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease that disrupts ion transport at mucosal surfaces, leading to mucus accumulation and altered physiology of both the lungs and the intestines, among other organs, with the resulting altered environment contributing to an imbalance of microbial communities. Culture media representative of the CF airway have been developed and validated; however, no such medium exists for modeling the CF intestine. Here, we develop and validate a first-generation culture medium inclusive of features that are altered in the CF colon. Our findings suggest this novel medium, called CF-MiPro, as a maintenance medium for CF gut microbiome samples and a flexible tool for studying key drivers of CF-associated gut dysbiosis.
38206016	The mechanism of action of auranofin analogs in <i>B. cenocepacia</i> revealed by chemogenomic profiling.The Burkholderia cepacia complex is a group of multidrug-resistant bacteria that can cause infections in the lungs of people with the autosomal recessive disease, cystic fibrosis. Specifically, the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia can cause severe infections, reducing lung function and leading to a devastating type of sepsis, cepacia syndrome. This bacterium currently does not have an accepted antibiotic treatment plan because of the wide range of antibiotic resistance. Here, we further the research on auranofin analogs as antimicrobials by finding the mechanism of action of these potent bactericidal compounds, using a powerful technique called BarSeq, to find the global response of the cell when exposed to an antimicrobial.
38231535	NorA efflux pump mediates <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> response to <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> pyocyanin toxicity.Endogenous transporters protect <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> against antibiotics and also contribute to bacterial defense from environmental toxins. We evaluated the effect of overexpression of four efflux pumps, NorA, NorB, NorC, and Tet38, on <i>S. aureus</i> survival following exposure to pyocyanin (PYO) of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, using a well diffusion assay. We measured the PYO-created inhibition zone and found that only an overexpression of NorA reduced <i>S. aureus</i> susceptibility to pyocyanin killing. The MIC<sub>PYO</sub> of the NorA overexpressor increased threefold compared to that of wild-type RN6390 and was reduced 2.5-fold with reserpine, suggesting that increased NorA efflux caused PYO resistance. The PYO-created inhibition zone of a <i>DnorA</i> mutant was consistently larger than that of a plasmid-borne NorA overexpressor. PYO also produced a modest increase in <i>norA</i> expression (1.8-fold at 0.25 ug/mL PYO) that gradually decreased with increasing PYO concentrations. Well diffusion assays carried out using <i>P. aeruginosa</i> showed that <i>DnorA</i> mutant was less susceptible to killing by PYO-deficient mutants PA14<i><sub>phzM</sub></i> and PA14<i><sub>phzS</sub></i> than to killing by PA14. NorA overexpression led to reduced killing by all tested <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. We evaluated the NorA-PYO interaction using a collection of 22 clinical isolates from adult and pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, which included both <i>S. aureus</i> (CF-SA) and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (CF-PA). We found that when isolated alone, CF-PA and CF-SA expressed varying levels of PYO and <i>norA</i> transcripts, but all four CF-PA/CF-SA pairs isolated concurrently from CF patients produced a low level of PYO and low <i>norA</i> transcript levels, respectively, suggesting a partial adaptation of the two bacteria in circumstances of persistent co-colonization.
38217903	Lung injuries induced by ozone exposure in female mice: Potential roles of the gut and lung microbes.Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is one of the most harmful pollutants affecting health. However, the potential effects of O<sub>3</sub> exposure on microbes in the gut-lung axis related to lung injuries remain elusive. In this study, female mice were exposed to 0-, 0.5- and 1-ppm O<sub>3</sub> for 28 days, followed by routine blood tests, lung function tests and histopathological examination of the colon, nasal cavity and lung. Mouse faeces and lungs were collected for 16s rRNA sequencing to assess the overall microbiological profile and screen for key differential enriched microbes (DEMs). The key DEMs in faecal samples were Butyricimonas, Rikenellaceae RC9 and Escherichia-Shigella, whereas those in lung samples were DNF00809, Fluviicola, Bryobacter, Family XII AD3011 group, Sharpea, MND1 and unclassified Phycisphaeraceae. After a search in microbe-disease databases, these key DEMs were found to be associated with lung diseases such as lung neoplasms, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory distress syndrome and bronchiectasis. Subsequently, we used transcriptomic data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with exposure conditions similar to those in this study to cross-reference with Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD). Il-6 and Ccl2 were identified as the key causative genes and were validated. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to O<sub>3</sub> leads to significant changes in the microbial composition of the gut and lungs. These changes are associated with increased levels of inflammatory factors in the lungs and impaired lung function, resulting in an increased risk of lung disease. Altogether, this study provides novel insights into the role of microbes present in the gut-lung axis in O<sub>3</sub> exposure-induced lung injury.
38201212	Paralogue-Specific Roles of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 in Protein Quality Control and Associated Diseases.Small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) function as post-translational protein modifications and regulate nearly every aspect of cellular function. While a single ubiquitin protein is expressed across eukaryotic organisms, multiple SUMO paralogues with distinct biomolecular properties have been identified in plants and vertebrates. Five SUMO paralogues have been characterized in humans, with SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3 being the best studied. SUMO2 and SUMO3 share 97% protein sequence homology (and are thus referred to as SUMO2/3) but only 47% homology with SUMO1. To date, thousands of putative sumoylation substrates have been identified thanks to advanced proteomic techniques, but the identification of SUMO1- and SUMO2/3-specific modifications and their unique functions in physiology and pathology are not well understood. The SUMO2/3 paralogues play an important role in proteostasis, converging with ubiquitylation to mediate protein degradation. This function is achieved primarily through SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs), which preferentially bind and ubiquitylate poly-SUMO2/3 modified proteins. Effects of the SUMO1 paralogue on protein solubility and aggregation independent of STUbLs and proteasomal degradation have also been reported. Consistent with these functions, sumoylation is implicated in multiple human diseases associated with disturbed proteostasis, and a broad range of pathogenic proteins have been identified as SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 substrates. A better understanding of paralogue-specific functions of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 in cellular protein quality control may therefore provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and therapeutic innovation. This review summarizes current understandings of the roles of sumoylation in protein quality control and associated diseases, with a focus on the specific effects of SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 paralogues.
38197494	A systematic review of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in people living with cystic fibrosis.There is a lack of research that has focused on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Given ADHD is associated with executive functioning impairments, exploring ADHD in the context of living with cystic fibrosis (CF) is of great importance. The purpose of the current systematic review was to examine ADHD in pwCF across the lifespan in terms of its prevalence, its impact on various health outcomes, and treatments for managing ADHD. This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Articles reporting studies of any design that focused on ADHD in pwCF were included. Studies were excluded if they did not meet this criterion and if they were written in languages other than English. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases were searched. Search items were based on three concepts: (1) terms related to CF, (2) terms related to ADHD, and (3) terms related to age. Ten studies were included in this systematic review. Reported prevalence rates of ADHD in pwCF ranged from 5.26% to 21.9%. The reported relationships between ADHD and CF and other health outcomes is inconsistent. In terms of treatment considerations, pharmacological interventions and behavioural strategies for managing ADHD in the context of living with CF have been reported as being successful. Additional research is needed to further explore ADHD in the CF population and health variables that may be associated with CF prognosis.
38191649	A revised nomenclature for the lemur family of protein kinases.The lemur family of protein kinases has gained much interest in recent years as they are involved in a variety of cellular processes including regulation of axonal transport and endosomal trafficking, modulation of synaptic functions, memory and learning, and they are centrally placed in several intracellular signalling pathways. Numerous studies have also implicated role of the lemur kinases in the development and progression of a wide range of cancers, cystic fibrosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, parallel discoveries and inaccurate prediction of their kinase activity have resulted in a confusing and misleading nomenclature of these proteins. Herein, a group of international scientists with expertise in lemur family of protein kinases set forth a novel nomenclature to rectify this problem and ultimately help the scientific community by providing consistent information about these molecules.
38171775	Regulation of Chloride Channels by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induced a-Defensin 5.Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are used to treat non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. However, first-generation erlotinib and second-generation afatinib often cause diarrhea, which may develop because of the association between EGFR-TKIs and the chloride channel or abnormalities in the intestinal microbiota due to disruption of the intestinal immune system. As reports on the effects of EGFR-TKIs on intestinal immunity are lacking, we aimed to determine whether the intestinal immune system is involved in the molecular effects of EGFR-TKIs on chloride channels using Caco-2 cells. Initially, we evaluated the association of chloride channels with a-defensin 5 (DEFA5), a marker of intestinal immunity. Erlotinib and afatinib significantly increased the extracellularly secreted DEFA5 level and autophagy-related 16-like 1 and X-box binding protein 1 transcript levels, indicative of enhanced granule exocytosis. Conversely, intracellular DEFA5 and Toll-like receptor 4 protein expression and tumor necrosis factor-a transcript levels decreased significantly, suggesting that Toll-like receptor 4 suppression repressed DEFA5 production. Furthermore, among the chloride channels, DEFA5 was found to significantly increase the transcript levels of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators. These results indicate that DEFA5 plays a significant role in the mechanism of chloride channel-mediated diarrhea induced by EGFR-TKIs. Therefore, we successfully elucidated the potential host action of DEFA5 in cancer therapy for the first time.
38229125	Evaluation of the efficiency of nanomicellar formulation of fat-soluble vitamins in patients with cystic fibrosis: the study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease, which is caused by the CFTR protein defects due to mutations in the CFTR gene. Along with CFTR dysfunction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency plays a key role in persistent fat malabsorption in CF patients; therefore, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) is still a therapeutic challenge. Even with efficient pancreatic enzyme medication and CF-specific vitamins, many patients with CF have fat-soluble vitamins deficiency. The present study aims to evaluate the efficiency of nanomicelle formulation of fat-soluble vitamins in children with CF in order to achieve the appropriate serum levels of these vitamins. METHODS: This prospective, single-blind control trial will be conducted at the Akbar Children's Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. Patients with CF will be enrolled based on the eligibility criteria. The control group will receive the standard formulation of fat-soluble vitamins similar to the routine CF treatment, and for the intervention group, the nanomicelle formulation of fat-soluble vitamins will be administered for 3 months. The primary outcome of this study is the measurement of serum levels of fat-soluble vitamins. The secondary outcomes are clinical assessment by the Shwachman-Kulczycki score, anthropometrics, and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed before and after 3 months. DISCUSSION: Due to persistent fat-soluble vitamin deficiency in CF disease, the nanomicelle formulation could be proposed as a new delivery method of fat-soluble vitamins in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT20220415054541N1. Registered on July 23, 2022.
38233247	Standards for the care of people with cystic fibrosis (CF); recognising and addressing CF health issues.This is the third in a series of four papers updating the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) standards for the care of people with CF. This paper focuses on recognising and addressing CF health issues. The guidance was produced with wide stakeholder engagement, including people from the CF community, using an evidence-based framework. Authors contributed sections, and summary statements which were reviewed by a Delphi consultation. Monitoring and treating airway infection, inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations remains important, despite the widespread availability of CFTR modulators and their accompanying health improvements. Extrapulmonary CF-specific health issues persist, such as diabetes, liver disease, bone disease, stones and other renal issues, and intestinal obstruction. These health issues require multidisciplinary care with input from the relevant specialists. Cancer is more common in people with CF compared to the general population, and requires regular screening. The CF life journey requires mental and emotional adaptation to psychosocial and physical challenges, with support from the CF team and the CF psychologist. This is particularly important when life gets challenging, with disease progression requiring increased treatments, breathing support and potentially transplantation. Planning for end of life remains a necessary aspect of care and should be discussed openly, honestly, with sensitivity and compassion for the person with CF and their family. CF teams should proactively recognise and address CF-specific health issues, and support mental and emotional wellbeing while accompanying people with CF and their families on their life journey.
38190706	Small Airways in Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis.
38169270	Structural basis for specific inhibition of salicylate synthase from Mycobacterium abscessus.Blocking iron uptake and metabolism has been emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy for the development of novel antimicrobial compounds. Like all mycobacteria, M. abscessus (Mab) has evolved several countermeasures to scavenge iron from host carrier proteins, including the production of siderophores, which play a crucial role in these processes. In this study, we solved, for the first time, the crystal structure of Mab-SaS, the first enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of siderophores. Moreover, we screened a small, focused library and identified a compound exhibiting a potent inhibitory effect against Mab-SaS (IC<sub>50</sub>   2 uM). Its binding mode was investigated by means of Induced Fit Docking simulations, performed on the crystal structure presented herein. Furthermore, cytotoxicity data and pharmacokinetic predictions revealed the safety and drug-likeness of this class of compounds. Finally, the crystallographic data were used to optimize the model for future virtual screening campaigns. Taken together, the findings of our study pave the way for the identification of potent Mab-SaS inhibitors, based on both established and unexplored chemotypes.
38169175	ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guideline on nutrition care for cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Nutritional status is paramount in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and is directly correlated with morbidity and mortality. The first ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guidelines on nutrition care for infants, children, and adults with CF were published in 2016. An update to these guidelines is presented. METHODS: The study was developed by an international multidisciplinary working group in accordance with officially accepted standards. Literature since 2016 was reviewed, PICO questions were discussed and the GRADE system was utilized. Statements were discussed and submitted for on-line voting by the Working Group and by all ESPEN members. RESULTS: The Working Group updated the nutritional guidelines including assessment and management at all ages. Supplementation of vitamins and pancreatic enzymes remains largely the same. There are expanded chapters on pregnancy, CF-related liver disease, and CF-related diabetes, bone disease, nutritional and mineral supplements, and probiotics. There are new chapters on nutrition with highly effective modulator therapies and nutrition after organ transplantation.

38248722	Assessment of Some Risk Factors and Biological Predictors in the Post COVID-19 Syndrome in Asthmatic Patients.Long COVID-19 or post-COVID infection (PCI) refers to the prolongation of symptoms in people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some meta-analysis studies have shown that patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, have severe complications after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The presence of chronic respiratory diseases such as bronchial asthma, COPD, pulmonary hypertension or cystic fibrosis increases the risk of developing severe forms of the COVID-19 disease. The risk of developing the severe form of COVID-19 was observed in patients with bronchial asthma being treated with corticosteroids, but also in those hospitalized with severe asthma. The biological variables determined in patients with PCI infection showed changes, especially in the hematological parameters, but also in some inflammatory markers. The aim of this study was to investigate some biological predictors in post-COVID-19 infection in patients with asthma and various comorbidities. In the case of patients diagnosed with moderate and severe forms of COVID-19, the variation in biological tests has shown high concentrations for serum glucose, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. Additionally, the calculation of the relative risk (RR) based on the associated comorbidities in patients with PCI points to higher values for patients with asthma, hypertension, diabetes and obesity (RR moderate/severe form = 0.98/1.52), compared to patients with PCI and asthma (RR moderate/severe form = 0.36/0.63). Based on the statistical results, it can be concluded that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and the age of patients (<i>p</i> = 0.001) are the variables that contribute the most to the separation of the four classes of comorbidities considered.
38206973	MRI of Pulmonary and Paranasal Sinus Abnormalities in Children with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Compared to Children with Cystic Fibrosis.RATIONALE: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are characterized by inherited impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic progressive lung disease as well as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Both diseases share morphological and functional commonalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lungs and paranasal sinuses, but comparative MRI studies are lacking. OBJECTIVES: Does PCD show different associations of pulmonary with paranasal sinus abnormalities on MRI as well as with lung function tests in infants to adolescents in comparison to children with CF? METHODS: 18 children with PCD (median age 9.5 [3.4-12.7]y, range 0-18y) and 36 age-matched, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator (CFTRm)-naive children with CF (median age 9.4 [3.4-13.2]y, range 0-18y) underwent same-session chest and paranasal sinus MRI, as well as spirometry (ppFEV1) and multiple breath washout (lung clearance index [LCI] z-score). Pulmonary and paranasal sinus abnormalities were assessed using previously validated chest MRI and CRS-MRI scoring systems. RESULTS: Mean chest MRI global score was similar in children with PCD and CF (15.0 [13.5-20.8] vs. 15.0 [9.0-15.0], P=0.601). Consolidations were more prevalent and severe in children with PCD (56% vs. 25% and 1.0 [0.0-2.8] vs. 0.0 [0.0-0.3], respectively; P<0.05). The chest MRI global score correlated moderately with ppFEV1 in both, children with PCD and with CF (r=-0.523 and -0.687, P<0.01), and with LCI in CF (r=0.650, P<0.001) but not in PCD (r=0.353, P=0.196). CRS-MRI sum score and mucopyocele subscore were lower in children with PCD than with CF (27.5 [26.3-32.0] vs. 37.0 [37.8-40.0] and 2.0 [0.0-2.0] vs. 7.5 [4.8-9.0], respectively; P<0.01). CRS-MRI sum score did not correlate with chest MRI scores in PCD (r=0.075 to 0.157, P=0.557-0.788), while it correlated moderately with MRI morphology score in CF (r=0.437, P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MRI detects differences in lung and paranasal sinus abnormalities between children with PCD and with CF. Lung disease does not correlate with CRS in PCD but in CF.
38173934	Club cell CREB regulates the goblet cell transcriptional network and pro-mucin effects of IL-1B.<b>Introduction:</b> Club cells are precursors for mucus-producing goblet cells. Interleukin 1b (IL-1B) is an inflammatory mediator with pro-mucin activities that increases the number of mucus-producing goblet cells. IL-1B-mediated mucin production in alveolar adenocarcinoma cells requires activation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Whether the pro-mucin activities of IL-1B require club cell CREB is unknown. <b>Methods:</b> We challenged male mice with conditional loss of club cell <i>Creb1</i> and wild type littermates with intra-airway IL-1B or vehicle. Secondarily, we studied human "club cell-like" H322 cells. <b>Results:</b> IL-1B increased whole lung mRNA of secreted (<i>Mucin 5ac, Mucin 5b</i>) and tethered (<i>Mucin 1, Mucin 4</i>) mucins independent of genotype. However, loss of club cell Creb1 increased whole lung mRNA of <i>member RAS oncogene family (Rab3D)</i>, decreased mRNA of the <i>muscarinic receptor 3 (M3R)</i> and prevented IL-1B mediated increases in <i>purinergic receptor P2Y, (P2ry2)</i> mRNA. IL-1B increased the density of goblet cells containing neutral mucins in wildtype mice but not in mice with loss of club cell Creb1. These findings suggested that club cell Creb1 regulated mucin secretion. Loss of club cell Creb1 also prevented IL-1B-mediated impairments in airway mechanics. Four days of pharmacologic CREB inhibition in H322 cells increased mRNA abundance of <i>forkhead box A2 (FOXA2)</i>, a repressor of goblet cell expansion, and decreased mRNA expression of <i>SAM pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF)</i>, a driver of goblet cell expansion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that CREB directly bound to the promoter region of <i>FOXA2</i>, but not to the promoter region of <i>SPDEF</i>. Treatment of H322 cells with IL-1B increased cAMP levels, providing a direct link between IL-1B and CREB signaling. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that club cell Creb1 regulates the pro-mucin properties of IL-1B through pathways likely involving FOXA2.
38191360	The clinical characteristics of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients with positive serum tumor markers: a retrospective study.BACKGROUND: Serum tumor markers (STM), extensively used for the diagnosis, monitoring and prognostic assessment of tumors, can be increased in some non-malignant lung diseases. To date, there is a paucity of studies regarding the clinical characteristics of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients with positive STMs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics and indicators of bronchiectasis with positive STMs. METHODS: The clinical data of 377 bronchiectasis patients was retrospectively collected from January 2017 to December 2019 from Beijing Chaoyang Hospital. Patients were divided into the STM negative group, the single STM positive group and the  2 STMs positive group according to the number of the positive STMs. The clinical characteristics are described and compared separately. The multivariate logistic regression analysis model was used to investigate the indicators regarding positive STMs. RESULTS: Patients in the  2 STMs positive group were older (P = 0.015), had higher mMRC scores (P < 0.001) and developed higher fever (P = 0.027). Additionally, these patients also had lower Albumin/Globulin Ratio (A/G), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB) (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively) and higher CRP, ESR and Fbg (P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Age (OR 1.022, 95%CI 1.003-1.042; P = 0.026) and the number of affected lobes (OR 1.443, 95%CI 1.233-1.690; P < 0.001) were independently associated with one and   2 positive STMs in bronchiectasis patients. CONCLUSION: The  2 positive STMs are associated with a higher inflammation status and severer radiologic manifestations in bronchiectasis patients.
38169359	[Cystic fibrosis carrier screening: a Health technology assessment.].This project of Health technology assessment was aimed at defining the impacts of offering a cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening to the general population, compared to the current situation, where the test is offered to individuals at high-risk to give birth to a child with CF. Results revealed: i) a lack of robust and updated data; ii) a return on investment up to six years from the screening's introduction, despite important economic and organizational efforts; iii) a general positive attitude of healthcare professionals, people with CF, families and general population; iv) possible issues related to the social impact.
38188360	Low-intensity ultrasound activates transmembrane chloride flow through CFTR.Ultrasound has been demonstrated to activate mechanosensitive channels, which is considered the main mechanism of ultrasound neuromodulation. Currently, all channels that have been shown to be sensitive to ultrasound are cation channels. In addition to cation channels, anion channels also play indispensable roles in neural function. However, there have been no research on ultrasound regulation of anion channels until now. If anion channels can be activated by ultrasound as well, they will inevitably lead to more versatility in ultrasound neuromodulation. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane transduction regulator (CFTR) has been demonstrated to be a mechanically sensitive channel, mediating anionic transmembrane flow. To identify that CFTR is sensitive to ultrasound, CFTR was exogenously expressed in HEK293T cells and was stimulated by low intensity ultrasound. Outward currents in CFTR-expressed HEK293T cells were observed by using whole-cell patch clamp when ultrasound (0.8 MHz, 0.20 MPa) was delivered to these cells. These currents were abolished when the CFTR inhibitor (GlyH101) was applied to the solution or chloride ions was cleared from the solution. Meanwhile, the amplitude of these currents increased when the CFTR agonist (Forskolin) was applied. These results suggest that ultrasound stimuli can activate the CFTR to mediate transmembrane flowing of chloride ions at the single cell level. These findings may expand the application of ultrasound in the neuromodulation field.
38214500	Inhibition of polymorphic MexXY-OprM efflux system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates by Berberine derivatives.The MexXY-OprM multidrug efflux pump (EP) in aminoglycosides resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the major resistance mechanisms, which is often overexpressed in strains isolated from pulmonary chronic disease such as cystic fibrosis [1-3]. In this research, we focused on the design of potential efflux pumps inhibitors, targeting MexY, the inner membrane component, in an allosteric site. Berberine [4] has been considered as lead molecule since we previously demonstrated its effectiveness in targeting MexY in laboratory reference strains [5,6]. Since this protein is often present in polymorphic variants in clinical strains, we sequenced and modeled all the mutated forms and we synthesized and evaluated by computational techniques, some berberine derivatives carrying an aromatic functionalization in its 13-C ring position. These compounds were tested in vitro against clinical P. aeruginosa strains for antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity. In conclusion, the results demonstrated the importance of the aromatic moiety functionalization in exerting the EP inhibitory activity in synergy with the aminoglycoside tobramycin. More, we found that aminoacidic composition of MexY in different strains must be considered for predicting potential binding site and affects the different activity of berberine derivatives. Finally, the antibiofilm effect of these new EPIs is promising, particularly for o-CH3-berberine derivative.
38179878	Impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on lipid and fat-soluble vitamin levels and association with body mass index.INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators improve gastrointestinal absorption of nutrients and may result in changes in body mass index (BMI), serum lipids, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. We hypothesized that serum lipids and vitamin levels would increase with CFTR modulator therapy and that greater increase in lipids and vitamin levels would be related to greater increase in BMI. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on nutritional parameters, serum lipids, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. Pre-ETI values (<2 years prior) and post-ETI values (>1 month after) were compared. Linear regression was used to evaluate whether change in BMI is associated with the change in lipid and/or vitamin levels and whether modulator duration is associated with the degree of rise in lipid and/or vitamin levels. RESULTS: Adults and adolescents with CF (n = 137) were evaluated before and 31-300 days after starting ETI. Median BMI (adults 21.9 vs. 23.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ; adolescents 48 vs. 63 percentile) increased after initiation of ETI. Total cholesterol (126 vs. 154 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (63 vs. 78 mg/dL), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (84 vs. 102 mg/dL), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (43 vs. 49 mg/dL) increased after ETI, while triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein did not change. Median values for vitamin D (34.5 vs. 38.0 ng/mL) and vitamin A (40.1 vs. 47.9 ug/dL) increased, while vitamin E did not change significantly. There was no significant correlation between BMI change or duration of modulator therapy with vitamin levels or lipid changes. CONCLUSION: After initiation of ETI therapy, serum lipids increased in our population, but most values remained within the normal range. Vitamins A and D levels increased post-ETI and no changes were noted in vitamin E. No significant correlation between the degree of BMI change and the magnitude of increase in lipids or vitamin levels was found.
38228208	Structural abnormality of hepatic glycogen in rat liver with diethylnitrosamine-induced carcinogenic injury.Growing evidence confirms associations between glycogen metabolic re-wiring and the development of liver cancer. Previous studies showed that glycogen structure changes abnormally in liver diseases such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes, etc. However, few studies focus on glycogen molecular structural characteristics during liver cancer development, which is worthy of further exploration. In this study, a rat model with carcinogenic liver injury induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was successfully constructed, and hepatic glycogen structure was characterized. Compared with glycogen structure in the healthy rat liver, glycogen chain length distribution (CLD) shifts towards a short region. In contrast, glycogen particles were mainly present in small-sized b particles in DEN-damaged carcinogenic rat liver. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed significant expression changes of genes and pathways involved in carcinogenic liver injury. A combination of transcriptomic analysis, RT-qPCR, and western blot showed that the two genes, Gsy1 encoding glycogen synthase and Gbe1 encoding glycogen branching enzyme, were significantly altered and might be responsible for the structural abnormality of hepatic glycogen in carcinogenic liver injury. Taken together, this study confirmed that carcinogenic liver injury led to structural abnormality of hepatic glycogen, which provided clues to the future development of novel drug targets for potential therapeutics of carcinogenic liver injury.
38197521	Akt activator SC79 stimulates antibacterial nitric oxide generation in human nasal epithelial cells in vitro.BACKGROUND: The role of Akt in nasal immunity is unstudied. Akt phosphorylates and activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expressed in epithelial ciliated cells. Nitric oxide (NO) production by ciliated cells can have antibacterial and antiviral effects. Increasing nasal NO may be a useful antipathogen strategy in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We previously showed that small-molecule Akt activator SC79 induces nasal cell NO production and suppresses IL-8 via the transcription factor Nrf-2. We hypothesized that SC79 NO production may additionally have antibacterial effects. METHODS: NO production was measured using fluorescent dye DAF-FM. We tested effects of SC79 during co-culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with primary nasal epithelial cells, using CFU counting and live-dead staining to quantify bacterial killing. Pharmacology determined the mechanism of SC79-induced NO production and tested dependence on Akt. RESULTS: SC79 induced dose-dependent, Akt-dependent NO production in nasal epithelial cells. The NO production required eNOS and Akt. The NO released into the airway surface liquid killed P. aeruginosa. No toxicity (LDH release) or inflammatory effects (IL8 transcription) were observed over 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest multiple immune pathways are stimulated by SC79, with antipathogen effects. This in vitro pilot study suggests that a small-molecule Akt activator may have clinical utility in CRS or respiratory other infection settings, warranting future in vivo studies.
38168711	Inference of infectious disease transmission through a relaxed bottleneck using multiple genomes per host.In recent times, pathogen genome sequencing has become increasingly used to investigate infectious disease outbreaks. When genomic data is sampled densely enough amongst infected individuals, it can help resolve who infected whom. However, transmission analysis cannot rely solely on a phylogeny of the genomes but must account for the within-host evolution of the pathogen, which blurs the relationship between phylogenetic and transmission trees. When only a single genome is sampled for each host, the uncertainty about who infected whom can be quite high. Consequently, transmission analysis based on multiple genomes of the same pathogen per host has a clear potential for delivering more precise results, even though it is more laborious to achieve. Here we present a new methodology that can use any number of genomes sampled from a set of individuals to reconstruct their transmission network. Furthermore, we remove the need for the assumption of a complete transmission bottleneck. We use simulated data to show that our method becomes more accurate as more genomes per host are provided, and that it can infer key infectious disease parameters such as the size of the transmission bottleneck, within-host growth rate, basic reproduction number and sampling fraction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method in applications to real datasets from an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa amongst cystic fibrosis patients and a nosocomial outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
38219353	Different forms of pulmonary aspergillosis: A pictorial essay.Pulmonary aspergillosis is a group of mycotic diseases affecting the lungs. The form of the disease mainly depends on the immune status of the patient and underlying conditions. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis usually affects immunocompromised patients - angio-invasive and airway-invasive forms are possible. Chronic aspergillosis usually appears in mildly immunosuppressed or immunocompetent patients with underlying structural lung changes and may have diverse forms: simple aspergilloma, chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis, subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, aspergillus nodules and endobronchial aspergilloma. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a hyper-reactivity reaction to Aspergillus species, and usually develops in asthma and cystic fibrosis patients. The aim of this article is to comprehensively overview different forms of aspergillosis, their symptoms and underlying conditions and to present imaging findings.
38248425	A Path towards Timely VAP Diagnosis: Proof-of-Concept Study on Pyocyanin Sensing with Cu-Mg Doped Graphene Oxide.In response to the urgent requirement for rapid, precise, and cost-effective detection in intensive care units (ICUs) for ventilated patients, as well as the need to overcome the limitations of traditional detection methods, researchers have turned their attention towards advancing novel technologies. Among these, biosensors have emerged as a reliable platform for achieving accurate and early diagnoses. In this study, we explore the possibility of using Pyocyanin analysis for early detection of pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lower respiratory tract infections in ventilated patients. To achieve this, we developed an electrochemical sensor utilizing a graphene oxide-copper oxide-doped MgO (<i>GO</i> - <i>Cu</i> - <i>Mgo</i>) (GCM) catalyst for Pyocyanin detection. Pyocyanin is a virulence factor in the phenazine group that is produced by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains, leading to infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and cystic fibrosis. We additionally investigated the use of DNA aptamers for detecting Pyocyanin as a biomarker of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a common causative agent of VAP. The results of this study indicated that electrochemical detection of Pyocyanin using a GCM catalyst shows promising potential for various applications, including clinical diagnostics and drug discovery.

38251347	A Novel Inhibitor against the Biofilms of Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria.Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM), previously classified as environmental microbes, have emerged as opportunistic pathogens causing pulmonary infections in immunocompromised hosts. The formation of the biofilm empowers NTM pathogens to escape from the immune response and antibiotic action, leading to treatment failures. NF1001 is a novel thiopeptide antibiotic first-in-class compound with potent activity against planktonic/replicating and biofilm forms of various NTM species. It is potent against both drug-sensitive and -resistant NTM. It has demonstrated a concentration-dependent killing of replicating and intracellularly growing NTM, and has inhibited and reduced the viability of NTM in biofilms. Combination studies using standard-of-care (SoC) drugs for NTM exhibited synergetic/additive effects, but no antagonism against both planktonic and biofilm populations of <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> and <i>Mycobacterium avium</i>. In summary, the activity of NF1001 alone or in combination with SoC drugs projects NF1001 as a promising candidate for the treatment of difficult-to-treat NTM pulmonary diseases (NTM-PD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients.
38168439	Strain-level characterization of health-associated bacterial consortia that colonize the human gut during infancy.BACKGROUND: The human gut microbiome develops rapidly during infancy, a key window of development coinciding with maturation of the adaptive immune system. However, little is known of the microbiome growth dynamics over the first few months of life and whether there are any generalizable patterns across human populations. We performed metagenomic sequencing on stool samples (n=94) from a cohort of infants (n=15) at monthly intervals in the first six months of life, augmenting our dataset with seven published studies for a total of 4,441 metagenomes from 1,162 infants. RESULTS: Strain-level <i>de novo</i> analysis was used to identify 592 of the most abundant organisms in the infant gut microbiome. Previously unrecognized consortia were identified which exhibited highly correlated abundances across samples and were composed of diverse species spanning multiple genera. Analysis of a cohort of infants with cystic fibrosis identified one such novel consortium of diverse <i>Enterobacterales</i> which was positively correlated with weight gain. While all studies showed an increased community stability during the first year of life, microbial dynamics varied widely in the first few months of life, both by study and by individual. CONCLUSION: By augmenting published metagenomic datasets with data from a newly established cohort we were able to identify novel groups of organisms that are correlated with measures of robust human development. We hypothesize that the presence of these groups may impact human health in aggregate in ways that individual species may not in isolation.
38233941	Lung clearance index short-term variability in cystic fibrosis: a pre-post pulmonary exacerbation study.BACKGROUND: Multiple Breath washout (MBW) represents an important tool to detect early a possible pulmonary exacerbation especially in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) disease. Lung clearance index (LCI) is the most commonly reported multiple breath washout (MBW) index and in the last years was used as management measure for evaluation. Our aim was to analyze clinical utility of LCI index variability in pulmonary exacerbation in CF after intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. METHODS: A single-center study was conducted at CF Unit of Bambino Ges  Children's Hospital among hospitalized > 3 years patients for pulmonary exacerbations and treated with antibiotic IV treatment for 14 days. MBW and spirometry were evaluated within 72 h of admission to hospital and at the end of hospitalization. Descriptive analysis was conducted and correlations between quantitative variables were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (M22/F35) with an average age 18.56 (  8.54) years were enrolled. LCI2.5 was significantly reduced at the end of antibiotic treatment in both pediatric and adult populations with an average reduction of -6,99%; 37/57 patients denoted an improvement, 20/57 are stable or worsened in LCI2.5 values and 4/57 (7.02%) had a significant deterioration (> 15%) at end of treatment. On the contrary a significative elevation of FEV1 and FVC were found, respectively of + 7,30% and of + 5,46%. A positive good correlection among LCI 2.5 and Scond (rho = + 0,615, p = 0.000) and LCI 2.5 and Sacin (rho = + 0,649, p = 0.000) and a negative strong correlation between FEV1 and LCI 2.5 were found in post treatment period. A similar modification of LCI 2.5 and FEV1 was noticed in both adult and pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: LCI may have a role in the routine clinical care of both adult and pediatric CF patients as a good tool to assess response to IV antibiotic end-therapy in the same way as FEV1.
38179880	Gilbert's syndrome leads to elevated bilirubin after initiation of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis.Nine people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) were found to have isolated elevations in serum total bilirubin after starting elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) that were associated with Gilbert's Syndrome. In longitudinal examination, total bilirubin levels increased substantially after initiation of ETI without elevations in liver transaminases in those with this syndrome. Because elevated bilirubin levels in Gilbert's Syndrome are benign, ETI was able to be continued in these individuals. Genetic testing for this relatively common syndrome should be strongly considered for pwCF experiencing isolated hyperbilirubinemia after starting ETI, since appropriate diagnosis may help pwCF avoid unnecessary interruption in this therapy with significant health benefits in CF.
38186649	Efficacy and safety profile of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor triple therapy on cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and single arm meta-analysis.<b>Background:</b> Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ELE/TEZ/IVA) is believed to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF), but the exact efficacy and safety profile are still unknown. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to clarify the extent of functional restoration when patients are given with triple combination treatment and demonstrate the prevalence of adverse events, to evaluate the overall profile of ELE/TEZ/IVA on CF. <b>Methods:</b> A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Random effects single-arm meta-analysis was performed to decipher the basal characteristics of CF, the improvement and safety profile after ELE/TEZ/IVA treatment. <b>Results:</b> A total 53 studies were included in this analysis. For all the patients in included studies. 4 weeks after ELE/TEZ/IVA treatment, the increasement of percentage of predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>) was 9.23% (95%CI, 7.77%-10.70%), the change of percentage of predicted Forced Vital Capacity (ppFVC) was 7.67% (95%CI, 2.15%-13.20%), and the absolute change of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) score was 21.46 points (95%CI, 18.26-24.67 points). The Sweat chloride (SwCl) was significantly decreased with the absolute change of -41.82 mmol/L (95%CI, -44.38 to -39.25 mmol/L). 24 weeks after treatment, the increasement of ppFEV<sub>1</sub> was 12.57% (95%CI, 11.24%-13.90%), the increasement of ppFVC was 10.44% (95%CI, 7.26%-13.63%), and the absolute change of CFQ-R score was 19.29 points (95%CI, 17.19-21.39 points).

38220475	Preventive service utilization among adults with cystic fibrosis covered by private insurance is comparable to the general population.BACKGROUND: As the life expectancy of the cystic fibrosis (CF) population is lengthening with modulator therapies, diligent age-appropriate screening and preventive care are increasingly vital for long-term health and wellbeing. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis comparing rates of receiving age- and sex-appropriate preventive services by commercially insured adult people with CF (PwCF) and adults without CF from the general population (GP) via the Truven Health MarketScan database (2012-2018). RESULTS: We captured 25,369 adults with CF and 488,534 adults from the GP in the United States. Comparing these groups, we found that 43% versus 39% received an annual preventive visit, 28% versus 28% were screened for chlamydia, 38% versus 37% received pap smears every 3 years (21-29-year-old females), 33% versus 31% received pap smears every 5 years (30-64-year-old females), 55% versus 44% received mammograms, 23% versus 21% received colonoscopies, and 21% versus 20% received dyslipidemia screening (all screening rates expressed per 100 person-years). In age-stratified analysis, 18-27-year-old PwCF had a lower rate of annual preventive visits compared to adults in the same age group of the GP (27% versus 42%). CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a comparable-to-superior rate of preventive service utilization in adults with CF relative to the GP, except in young adulthood from 18-27 years. Our findings establish the importance of meeting the primary care needs of adults with CF and call for development of strategies to improve preventive service delivery to young adults.
38184455	Neurovascular complications post bronchial artery embolisation in patients with cystic fibrosis. A 7-year single centre retrospective review.Bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) is a treatment used to manage haemoptysis. We performed a 7-year review of BAE procedures for haemoptysis at our CF centre aiming to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of patients with neurovascular complications post-BAE. Our review suggests that whilst BAE is an effective method for controlling life-threatening haemoptysis, patients are at risk of developing neurovascular complications with long term residual symptoms, and therefore careful consideration should be given in offering BAE, especially to otherwise well patients with chronic small volume haemoptysis and managing teams should have a low threshold to image symptomatic patients.
38203285	The Effect of Complex Alleles of the <i>CFTR</i> Gene on the Clinical Manifestations of Cystic Fibrosis and the Effectiveness of Targeted Therapy.The authors of this article analyzed the available literature with the results of studying the prevalence of complex alleles of the <i>CFTR</i> gene among patients with cystic fibrosis, and their pathogenicity and influence on targeted therapy with CFTR modulators. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic autosomal recessive disease caused by a defect in the expression of the CFTR protein, and more than 2000 genetic variants are known. Clinically significant variants are divided into seven classes. Information about the frequency of complex alleles appears in a number of registers, along with the traditional presentation of data on genetic variants. Complex alleles (those with the presence of more than two nucleotide variants on one allele) can complicate the diagnosis of the disease, and change the clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis and the response to treatment, since each variant in the complex allele can contribute to the functional activity of the CFTR protein, changing it both in terms of increasing and decreasing function. The role of complex alleles is often underestimated, and their frequency has not been studied. At the moment, characteristic frequently encountered complex alleles have been found for several populations of patients with cystic fibrosis, but the prevalence and pathogenicity of newly detected complex alleles require additional research. In this review, more than 35 complex alleles of the <i>CFTR</i> gene from existing research studies were analyzed, and an analysis of their influence on the manifestations of the disease and the effectiveness of CFTR modulators was also described.
38213378	Severe Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease in an Adult Cystic Fibrosis Patient.Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital heart disease. Bicuspid aortic valves are prone to accelerated degenerative changes and aortopathies. These changes often manifest in adulthood as severe aortic stenosis or mixed aortic valve disease. Cystic fibrosis patients are at high risk of adverse surgical outcomes. As survival in cystic fibrosis continues to increase, managing comorbidities including severe aortic stenosis requires consideration. The relatively non-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been posed as an intervention for high-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, traditional randomized trials have excluded patients with bicuspid aortic valves. Herein we present an extremely rare association of severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis in an adult cystic fibrosis patient. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical course and a multi-disciplinary approach for the management of this rare scenario.
38203723	Exploring the Mechanism of Activation of CFTR by Curcuminoids: An Ensemble Docking Study.Curcumin, a major constituent of turmeric (<i>Curcuma longa</i> L.), has beneficial effects against several diseases. In cystic fibrosis (CF), this compound improves patients' symptoms by recovering the activity of a number of mutants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Despite holding promise in the treatment of CF, the curcumin binding site in CFTR and the molecular mechanism of activation of this channel are still unknown. The results of this study, based on docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, allow us to propose that curcumin binds the closed ATP-free CFTR near the nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1)/ICl1/ICl4 interface. The bound ligand, once approached by the nucleotide-binding domain 2 (NBD2) during transient channel opening, lays at a multiple interdomain cross point. Thereafter, curcumin can bridge NBD1 and NBD2, and also ICL1/ICL4 and ICL2/ICL3, finally tightening the same interdomain interactions that normally uphold the open conformation in the wild-type ATP-bound CFTR. The proposed binding site is compatible with biochemical observations made in previous CFTR-curcumin interaction studies. These findings provide a framework for the design of novel drugs that activate CFTR mutants characterized by defects in ATP binding and/or NBD dimerization or even lacking NBD2.
38184167	Impact of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Seropositivity on the Risk of Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis.BACKGROUND: Despite the coexistence of bronchiectasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the poor prognosis associated with the combination of conditions, no longitudinal studies that comprehensively evaluated whether patients with RA have a higher risk of bronchiectasis compared with those without bronchiectasis have been published. Whether seropositivity is associated with an increased risk of bronchiectasis in RA is the subject of ongoing controversy. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does RA influence the development of bronchiectasis? Is seropositivity associated with an increased risk of bronchiectasis in RA? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The incidence of bronchiectasis was compared between individuals with RA (n=50,651; 35,879 seropositive RA [SPRA] and 14,772 seronegative RA [SNRA]) and 1:5 age- and sex-matched controls (n=253,255) enrolled between 2010 and 2017 in the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. The participants were followed from 1 year after RA diagnosis or the corresponding index date to the date of bronchiectasis incidence, censored date, or December 2019. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of bronchiectasis at 9 years of follow-up was approximately 7% in participants with RA. During a median follow-up of 4.3 years (interquartile range, 2.6-6.3 years), participants with RA showed a 2.12-fold higher risk of developing bronchiectasis compared with matched controls even after adjusting for potential confounders related to bronchiectasis development (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00-2.25), In an analysis of RA serologic status using a fully adjusted model, participants with SPRA and those with SNRA showed 2.34-fold (95% CI, 2.20-2.49) and 1.56-fold (95% CI, 1.40-1.73) increased risks, respectively, compared with matched controls. INTERPRETATION: Individuals with RA had approximately twice the risk of developing bronchiectasis than matched controls even after adjusting for potential confounders. The increased risk was more evident in individuals with SPRA than in those with SNRA, implying that rheumatic inflammation plays a major role in the development of RA-bronchiectasis.
38186087	Two rare variants that affect the same amino acid in CFTR have distinct responses to ivacaftor.Some residues in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel are the site of more than one CFTR variant that cause cystic fibrosis. Here, we investigated the function of S1159F and S1159P, two variants associated with different clinical phenotypes, which affect the same pore-lining residue in transmembrane segment 12 that are both strongly potentiated by ivacaftor when expressed in CFBE41o<sup>-</sup> bronchial epithelial cells. To study the single-channel behaviour of CFTR, we applied the patch-clamp technique to Chinese hamster ovary cells heterologously expressing CFTR variants incubated at 27oC to enhance channel residence at the plasma membrane. S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR formed Cl<sup>-</sup> channels activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and gated by ATP that exhibited thermostability at 37oC. Both variants modestly reduced the single-channel conductance of CFTR. By severely attenuating channel gating, S1159F- and S1159P-CFTR reduced the open probability (P<sub>o</sub> ) of wild-type CFTR by  75% at ATP (1 mM); S1159F-CFTR caused the greater decrease in P<sub>o</sub> consistent with its more severe clinical phenotype. Ivacaftor (10-100 nM) doubled the P<sub>o</sub> of both CFTR variants without restoring P<sub>o</sub> values to wild-type levels, but concomitantly, ivacaftor decreased current flow through open channels. For S1159F-CFTR, the reduction of current flow was marked at high (supersaturated) ivacaftor concentrations (0.5-1 uM) and voltage-independent, identifying an additional detrimental action of elevated ivacaftor concentrations. In conclusion, S1159F and S1159P are gating variants, which also affect CFTR processing and conduction, but not stability, necessitating the use of combinations of CFTR modulators to optimally restore their channel activity. KEY POINTS: Dysfunction of the ion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) causes the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). This study investigated two rare pathogenic CFTR variants, S1159F and S1159P, which affect the same amino acid in CFTR, to understand the molecular basis of disease and response to the CFTR-targeted therapy ivacaftor. Both rare variants diminished CFTR function by modestly reducing current flow through the channel and severely inhibiting ATP-dependent channel gating with S1159F exerting the stronger adverse effect, which correlates with its association with more severe disease. Ivacaftor potentiated channel gating by both rare variants without restoring their activity to wild-type levels, but concurrently reduced current flow through open channels, particularly those of S1159F-CFTR. Our data demonstrate that S1159F and S1159P cause CFTR dysfunction by multiple mechanisms that require combinations of CFTR-targeted therapies to fully restore channel function.
38173511	Plasma levels of chemokines decrease during elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor therapy in adults with cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with dysregulated immune responses, exaggerated inflammation and chronic infection. CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies directly target the underlying protein defects and resulted in significant clinical benefits for people with CF (pwCF). This study analysed the effects of triple CFTR modulator therapy elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on CF-associated inflammation, especially systemic chemokines. METHODS: A bead-based immunoassay was used to quantify proinflammatory chemokines (IL-8, IP-10, Eotaxin, TARC, RANTES, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, MIP-3a, MIG, ENA-78, GROa, I-TAC) in plasma samples from pwCF collected before, at three, and at six months after starting ETI therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-one pwCF (47 % female; mean age 32   10.4 years) were included. At baseline, 67 % were already receiving CFTR modulator therapy with tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor. After initiation of ETI therapy there was a significant improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (+12.7 points, p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in sweat chloride levels (-53.6 %, p < 0.001). After 6 months' treatment with ETI therapy there were significant decreases in plasma levels of MIP-3a (-68.2 %, p = 0.018), GROa (-17.7 %, p = 0.013), ENA-78 (-16.3 %, p = 0.034) and I-TAC (-3.4 %, p = 0.032). IL-8 exhibited a reduction that did not reach statistical significance (-17.8 %, p = 0.057); levels of other assessed cytokines did not change significantly from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: ETI appears to affect a distinct group of chemokines that are predominately associated with neutrophilic inflammation, demonstrating the anti-inflammatory properties of ETI therapy.
38218661	Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor improves chronic rhinosinusitis detected by magnetic resonance imaging in children with cystic fibrosis on long-term therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor.INTRODUCTION: Previous studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated early onset and progression of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) from infancy to school age, and response to lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) therapy in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the effect of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) on CRS detected by MRI in children with CF and at least one F508del mutation, and potential incremental effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA compared to LUM/IVA in F508del homozygous children have not been studied. METHODS: 30 children with CF with at least one F508del mutation underwent three longitudinal paranasal sinus MRI before (MRI1), without (n = 16) or with LUM/IVA therapy (n = 14, MRI2), and with ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy (MRI3, mean age at therapy initiation 11.1   3.4y, range 6-16y). MRI were evaluated using the CRS-MRI score. RESULTS: After therapy initiation with ELX/TEZ/IVA, the prevalence and in maxillary and sphenoid sinuses the dominance of mucopyoceles decreased (35% vs. 0 %, p<0.001 and 26% vs. 8 %, p < 0.05, respectively). This leads to a reduction in mucopyocele subscore (-3.4   1.9, p < 0.001), and sinus subscores in MRI3 (maxillary sinus: -5.3   3.1, p < 0.001, frontal sinus: -1.0   1.9, p < 0.01, sphenoid subscore: -2.8   3.5, p < 0.001, ethmoid sinus: -1.7   1.9, p < 0.001). The CRS-MRI sum score decreased after therapy initiation with ELX/TEZ/IVA by -9.6   5.5 score points (p < 0.001). The strength in reduction of mucopyoceles subscore and CRS-MRI sum score was independent of a pretreatment with LUM/IVA from MRI1-MRI2 (p = 0.275-0.999). CONCLUSIONS: ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy leads to improvement of CRS in eligible children with CF. Our data support the role of MRI for comprehensive monitoring of CRS disease severity and response to therapy in children with CF.

38212492	The challenges and promise of sweat sensing.The potential of monitoring biomarkers in sweat for health-related applications has spurred rapid growth in the field of wearable sweat sensors over the past decade. Some of the key challenges have been addressed, including measuring sweat-secretion rate and collecting sufficient sample volumes for real-time, continuous molecular analysis without intense exercise. However, except for assessment of cystic fibrosis and regional nerve function, the ability to accurately measure analytes of interest and their physiological relevance to health metrics remain to be determined. Although sweat is not a crystal ball into every aspect of human health, we expect sweat measurements to continue making inroads into niche applications involving active sweating, such as hydration monitoring for athletes and physical laborers and later for medical and casual health monitoring of relevant drugs and hormones.
38248793	Laboratory Tools to Predict CFTR Modulator Therapy Effectiveness and to Monitor Disease Severity in Cystic Fibrosis.The implementation of cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drugs into clinical practice has been attaining remarkable therapeutic outcomes for CF, a life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disease. However, there is elevated CFTR allelic heterogeneity, and various individuals carrying (ultra)rare CF genotypes remain without any approved modulator therapy. Novel translational model systems based on individuals' own cells/tissue are now available and can be used to interrogate in vitro CFTR modulator responses and establish correlations of these assessments with clinical features, aiming to provide prediction of therapeutic effectiveness. Furthermore, because CF is a progressive disease, assessment of biomarkers in routine care is fundamental in monitoring treatment effectiveness and disease severity. In the first part of this review, we aimed to focus on the utility of individual-derived in vitro models (such as bronchial/nasal epithelial cells and airway/intestinal organoids) to identify potential responders and expand personalized CF care. Thereafter, we discussed the usage of CF inflammatory biomarkers derived from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and sputum to routinely monitor treatment effectiveness and disease progression. Finally, we summarized the progress in investigating extracellular vesicles as a robust and reliable source of biomarkers and the identification of microRNAs related to CFTR regulation and CF inflammation as novel biomarkers, which may provide valuable information for disease prognosis.
38199892	Nasal lavage microbiome, but not nasal swab microbiome, correlates with sinonasal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by highly viscous mucus obstructing the lower and upper airways, chronic neutrophil inflammation and infection resulting not only in lung destruction but also in paranasal sinus involvement. The pathogenesis of CF-associated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is still not well understood, and it remains unclear how the microbiome in the upper airways (UAW) influences paranasal sinus inflammation. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study in pediatric patients with CF under stable disease conditions, we examined the microbiome in relation to inflammation by comparing nasal swabs (NS) and nasal lavage (NL) as two UAW sampling methods. The microbiota structure of both NS and NL was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a) and proteases (SLPI, TIMP-1, NE/A1-AT complex) as well as neutrophil elastase activity were measured in NL. RESULTS: Simultaneous NS and NL samples were collected from 36 patients with CF (age range: 7 - 19 years). The microbiome of NS samples was shown to be significantly lower in a-diversity and evenness compared to NL samples. NS samples were particularly found to be colonized with Staphylococcus species. NL microbiome was shown to correlate much better with the sinonasal inflammation status than NS microbiome. Especially the detection of Moraxella in NL was associated with increased inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the NL microbiome reflects sinonasal inflammation better than NS and support NL as a promising tool for simultaneous assessment of the UAW microbiome and inflammation in children with CF.
38183031	Testing a model of benefit-finding and growth in youths with chronic health conditions.BACKGROUND: The experience of benefit-finding and growth (BFG), defined as perceiving positive life changes resulting from adversity, is increasingly studied among youths with chronic health conditions (CCs). However, empirical evidence is scarce for explaining individual differences in BFG. The study aimed to test a model of BFG, including an interplay of personal and environmental factors and coping processes. METHODS: A sample of N = 498 youths (12-21 years) recruited from three German patient registries for CCs (type 1 diabetes: n = 388, juvenile idiopathic arthritis: n = 82, cystic fibrosis: n = 28) completed a questionnaire including self-reported optimism, social support from parents and peers, coping strategies, and BFG. The model was created to reflect the theoretical assumptions of the Life Crisis and Personal Growth model and current empirical evidence. Structural equation modeling was conducted to evaluate the incremental explanatory power of optimism, peer group integration, parental support, acceptance, cognitive reappraisal, and seeking social support over and above sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics. RESULTS: The model (CFI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.04; SRMR = 0.05) explained 32% of the variance in BFG. Controlling for sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics, acceptance, cognitive reappraisal, and seeking social support were directly and positively linked to BFG. All tested coping strategies significantly mediated the association between optimism and BFG, whereas seeking social support significantly mediated the relation between peer group integration and BFG. DISCUSSION: The study stresses the prominent role of emotion-focused coping strategies and peer group integration in enhancing BFG in youths with CCs.

38173971	<i>P. aeruginosa</i> interactions with other microbes in biofilms during co-infection.This review addresses the topic of biofilms, including their development and the interaction between different counterparts. There is evidence that various diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, otitis media, diabetic foot wound infections, and certain cancers, are promoted and aggravated by the presence of polymicrobial biofilms. Biofilms are composed by heterogeneous communities of microorganisms protected by a matrix of polysaccharides. The different types of interactions between microorganisms gives rise to an increased resistance to antimicrobials and to the host's defense mechanisms, with the consequent worsening of disease symptoms. Therefore, infections caused by polymicrobial biofilms affecting different human organs and systems will be discussed, as well as the role of the interactions between the gram-negative bacteria <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, which is at the base of major polymicrobial infections, and other bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the establishment of human infections and diseases. Considering that polymicrobial biofilms are key to bacterial pathogenicity, it is fundamental to evaluate which microbes are involved in a certain disease to convey an appropriate and efficacious antimicrobial therapy.
38179886	Comparison of particles in exhaled air and multiple breath washout for assessment of small airway function in children with cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: The introduction of modulator therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) has led to an increased interest in the detection of small airway disease (SAD) as sensitive marker of treatment response. The particles in exhaled air (PExA) method, which records exhaled particle mass (PEx ng/L) and number (PExNR), detects SAD in adult patients. Our primary aim was to investigate if PExA outcomes in children with CF are different when compared to controls and associated with more severe disease. Secondary aims were to assess feasibility and repeatability of PExA in children with CF and to correlate PExA to multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) as an established marker of SAD. METHODS: Thirteen healthy children (HC), 17 children with CF with normal lung function (CF-N) (FEV<sub>1</sub> z-score   -1.64) and six with airway obstruction (CF-AO) (FEV<sub>1</sub> z-score < -1.64) between 8 and 18 years performed MBNW followed by PExA and spirometry. Children with CF repeated the measurements after 3 months. RESULTS: PEx ng/L and PExNR/L per liter of exhaled breath were similar between the three groups. The lung clearance index (LCI) was significantly higher in both CF-N and CF-AO compared to HC. All participants, except one, were able to perform PExA. Coefficient of variation for PEx ng/l was (median) 0.38, range 0-1.25 and PExNR/l 0.38, 0-1.09. Correlation between LCI and PEx ng/l was low, r<sub>s</sub> 0.32 (p = .07). CONCLUSION: PExA is feasible in children. In contrast to LCI, PExA did not differentiate healthy children from children with CF suggesting it to be a less sensitive tool to detect SAD.
