28718995		A systematic review of the prevalence and impact of urinary incontinence in cystic fibrosis.This systematic review synthesizes published articles investigating the prevalence, severity and impact of urinary incontinence (UI), a condition associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). References were identified through searching Medline, Embase and PubMed using the medical subject headings 'cystic fibrosis' AND 'urinary incontinence'. Articles were included if UI prevalence was investigated as an outcome. Twelve studies met selection criteria. The prevalence of UI ranged from 5% to 76%. Age and gender contributed to this variability. When assessed, UI commonly limited airway clearance, exercise and/or spirometry, and had a variable impact on patients' lives. Worry and embarrassment were features for many; others were less affected. In CF, UI is common and can interfere with respiratory care and social well-being. The prevalence, characteristics and impact are poorly understood, which is made worse by inconsistent definitions across studies. Future research is needed to improve approaches to prevention, identification, management and education.
29094071		Clinical chronic rhinosinusitis outcomes in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis.Objectives: Chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis are common conditions in cystic fibrosis (CF). Approximately 2-3% of pediatric CF patients per year have sinus disease requiring surgery. It has been well established that there is a significant negative impact on quality of life associated with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in the non-CF patient population. However, the impact of CRS on the pediatric CF population remains uncertain. The purpose of this article is to review the current state of outcome measures for CRS in pediatric CF patients. Data Sources: PubMed and EMBASE literature review. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases were searched using Boolean searches that incorporated mesh headings and plain language for quality of life, symptom evaluation, pediatric patients, and sinusitis/rhinosinusitis. Studies were included if the study primarily evaluated a pediatric Cystic Fibrosis-Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CF-CRS) population and the primary outcome measure was quality of life evaluation. Results: The search yielded 34 unique articles. A total of 7 articles met inclusion criteria. Conclusions: Despite the high frequency of chronic rhinosinusitis in the pediatric CF patient population, its impact on quality of life is not well understood. Currently there is a lack of a validated disease specific quality of life instruments available to assess the impact of CRS on the pediatric CF patient population. Level of Evidence: 5.
28132082	cause|@CHEMICAL_Tacrolimus|@DISEASE_Acute_Kidney_Injury ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Tacrolimus|@DISEASE_Kidney_Diseases	High tacrolimus blood concentrations early after lung transplantation and the risk of kidney injury.PURPOSE: Lung transplant recipients often develop acute kidney injury (AKI) evolving into chronic kidney disease (CKD). The immunosuppressant tacrolimus might be associated with the emergence of AKI. We analyzed the development and recovery of kidney injury after lung transplantation and related AKI to whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations and other factors causing kidney injury. METHODS: We retrospectively studied kidney injury in 186 lung-transplantation patients at the UMC Utrecht between 2001 and 2011. Kidney function and whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations were determined from day 1 to 14 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperative. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), septic shock, and nephrotoxic medications were evaluated as covariates for AKI. We analyzed liver injury and drug-drug interactions. RESULTS: AKI was present in 85 (46%) patients. Tacrolimus concentrations were supra-therapeutic in 135 of 186 patients (73%). AKI in the first week after transplantation was related to supra-therapeutic tacrolimus concentrations (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06-2.27), >=3 other nephrotoxic drugs (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.02-3.77), infection (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.31-4.70), and cystic fibrosis (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.16-4.06). Recovery rate of AKI was lower than expected (19%), and the cumulative incidence of severe CKD at 1 year was 15%. CONCLUSIONS: After lung transplantation, AKI is common and often evolves into severe CKD, which is a known cause of morbidity and mortality. Supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations are related to the early onset of AKI. Conscientious targeting tacrolimus blood concentrations might be vital in the early phase after lung transplantation. What is known about this subject?   Lung transplant recipients often develop acute kidney injury evolving into chronic kidney disease increasing both morbidity and mortality.   To date, the pathophysiology of kidney injury after lung transplantation has not been fully elucidated.   The immunosuppressant tacrolimus is difficult to dose, especially in the unstable clinical setting, and is nephrotoxic. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS:   For the first time, supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations are related to the emergence of acute kidney injury in the first days after lung transplantation.   Supra-therapeutic whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations often occur early after lung transplantation.   AKI after lung transplantation shows low recovery rates.
29605218		Six-minute walk test as a determinant of the functional capacity of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis: A systematic review.Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder. The involvement of the respiratory system is frequent and culminates in dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Functional capacity is an important diagnostic tool, because it reflects the cardiorespiratory status, quality of life and prognosis. This systematic review aims to assess the reproducibility and validity of the six minute walk test (6MWT) to reflect the functional capacity of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis, and also the correlation between 6MWT and lung function. Searches for articles were performed in eight databases using MeSH/DeCS keywords. A total of 695 articles were found and, after verifying all eligibility criteria, six articles were included for analysis and scoring regarding the methodological quality according to the QUADAS scale (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). All articles had good methodology (QUADAS between 9 and 11 points). The 6MWT is not correlated with lung function. There is a strong indication that the 6MWT is a reproducible test to assess the functional capacity of children and adolescents with CF. The validity assessment could not be reached because the studies included in this systematic review did not use adequate statistical tools to carry out such an evaluation.
8476292	associate|@CHEMICAL_Alginates|@CHEMICAL_Uronic_Acids	Exopolysaccharide production in biofilms: substratum activation of alginate gene expression by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Reporter gene technology was employed to detect the activity of an alginate promoter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa when the organism was grown as a biofilm on a Teflon mesh substratum and as planktonic cells in liquid medium. Alginate biosynthetic activity was determined with a mucoid cell line derived from a cystic fibrosis isolate and containing an alginate algC promoter fused to a lacZ reporter gene. Reporter activity was demonstrated with chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for beta-galactosidase. Expression of algC was shown to be upregulated in biofilm cells compared with planktonic cells in liquid medium. Gene up-expression correlated with alginate biosynthesis as measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, uronic acid accumulation, and alginate-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The algC promoter was shown to have maximum activity in planktonic cultures during the late lag and early log phases of the cell growth cycle. During a time course experiment, biofilm algC activity exceeded planktonic activity except during the period immediately following inoculation into fresh medium. In continuous-culture experiments, conversion of lacZ substrate was demonstrated microscopically in individual cells by epifluorescence microscopy.
17459673		[Nebulized drugs: the evolution?].The revival of nebulization as a drug delivery route is real. The current delivery systems respond to the new European norms, the new mesh-vibrating nebulizers allow delivering drugs more quickly, other nebulizers, more performant because of less drug losses and of a better lung deposition of the drug, are in progress. Only 12 drugs are commercialized for nebulization. All are available in dispensaries, some requiring a first prescription by a physician working in a hospital (cystic fibrosis drugs), others requiring a prescription from only some specialists as paediatricians or pulmonologists (bronchodilators). Works are in progress concerning the diameter and shape of the drug particles (nanotechnology) and also concerning the use of nebulized drugs for a systemic effect (vaccines, insulin, cyclosporine, anticancerous agents, etc.).

34624628		Combined use of rheology and portable low-field NMR in cystic fibrosis patients.BACKGROUND: As most cystic fibrosis (CF) patients progress to respiratory failure, lung functionality assessment is pivotal. We previously developed a test that indirectly monitors airways (inflammation/functional test) by measuring the spin-spin relaxation time (T2m) of the water hydrogens present in CF sputum. Here the T2m significance in the monitoring of CF lung disease was further investigated by studying the correlation of T2m with: 1) sputum viscoelasticity, 2) mucociliary clearability index (MCI)/cough clearability index (CCI) and 3) sputum average mesh-size. METHODS: Sputum samples from 25 consenting CF subjects were analyzed by rheology tests (elastic modulus G and zero shear viscosity eta0) and Low Field Nuclear Magnetic (LF-NMR) resonance (T2m). MCI/CCI were calculated from the rheological parameters. The average mesh-size (xi) of the sputum structure was then evaluated by rheology/LF-NMR, together with FEV1 for each patient. RESULTS: There was an inverse correlation between G and eta0 versus T2m, indicating that a worsening of the lung condition (T2m-FEV1 drop) is paralleled by an increase in sputum viscoelasticity (G and eta0) favoring mucus stasis/inflammation. A direct correlation was also observed between T2m and MCI/CCI, showing that T2m provides information as to airway mucus clearing. Moreover, there was a direct correlation between T2m and the average sputum mesh size (xi). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a correlation between T2m (measured in CF patient's sputum) and the sputum viscoelasticity/average mesh-size and with MCI/CCI, parameters related to airway mucus clearing. Thus, the present data strengthen the potential of our test to provide indirect monitoring of airway disease course in CF patients as T2m depends on mucus solid concentration and nanostructure.
37423579		Nebulization of PEGylated recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I using vibrating membrane nebulizers: A technical feasibility study.Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (rhDNase, Pulmozyme ) is the most frequently used mucolytic agent for the symptomatic treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Conjugation of rhDNase to polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been shown to greatly prolong its residence time in the lungs and improve its therapeutic efficacy in mice. To present an added value over current rhDNase treatment, PEGylated rhDNase needs to be efficiently and less frequently administrated by aerosolization and possibly at higher concentrations than existing rhDNase. In this study, the effects of PEGylation on the thermodynamic stability of rhDNase was investigated, using linear 20 kDa, linear 30 kDa and 2-armed 40 kDa PEGs. The suitability of PEG30-rhDNase to electrohydrodynamic atomization (electrospraying) as well as the feasibility of using two vibrating mesh nebulizers, the optimized eFlow  Technology nebulizer (eFlow) and Innospire Go, at varying protein concentrations were investigated. PEGylation was shown to destabilize rhDNase upon chemical-induced denaturation and ethanol exposure. Yet, PEG30-rhDNase was stable enough to withstand aerosolization stresses using the eFlow and Innospire Go nebulizers even at higher concentrations (5 mg of protein per ml) than conventional rhDNase formulation (1 mg/ml). High aerosol output (up to 1.5 ml per min) and excellent aerosol characteristics (up to 83% fine particle fraction) were achieved while preserving protein integrity and enzymatic activity. This work demonstrates the technical feasibility of PEG-rhDNase nebulization with advanced vibrating membrane nebulizers, encouraging further pharmaceutical and clinical developments of a long-acting PEGylated alternative to rhDNase for treating patients with CF.
19949942		The prevalence of osteoporosis, osteopenia, and fractures among adults with cystic fibrosis: a systematic literature review with meta-analysis.Observational studies have indicated a high but heterogeneous prevalence of low bone mineral density for adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Fracture complications were also described. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis, osteopenia, and fractures among adult patients with cystic fibrosis. A systematic literature review was conducted using electronic databases. The keywords used were "cystic fibrosis [MeSH] AND bone density." Original studies were eligible if they reported the prevalence of osteoporosis and/or osteopenia and/or fractures in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. A meta-analysis of pooled proportions was performed. Heterogeneity was tested with the Cochran Q statistic, and in the case of heterogeneity a random effect model was used. Of 117 studies, 12 were selected, i.e., that represented a total of 1055 patients. Mean age ranged from 18.5 to 32 years (median: 28.2 years). Mean body mass index ranged from 19.9 to 22.4 (median: 20.7); 53.8% were men. The pooled prevalence of osteoporosis in adults with cystic fibrosis was 23.5% (95% CI, 16.6-31.0). The pooled prevalence of osteopenia was 38% (95% CI, 28.2-48.3). The pooled prevalences of radiological vertebral fractures and nonvertebral fractures were 14% (95% CI, 7.8-21.7) and 19.7% (95% CI, 6.0-38.8), respectively. In conclusion, this systematic literature review with meta-analysis emphasized the high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in young adults with cystic fibrosis. The prevalence of fracture was also high.

The diffusion of many different medical devices for inhalation therapy containing HA has led to an increase in their prescription, also in children. Here, we systematically review the published evidence on the efficacy and safety of HA for the treatment of upper and lower airway diseases in childhood. METHODS: Relevant published studies (randomized controlled trials) for the efficacy of HA inhalation in children with upper airways diseases, asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and non-CF bronchiectasis were searched in Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases by combining the adequate Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords, with no limit for the year of publication. RESULTS: We identified seven relevant publications for upper airways diseases, one for asthma, and five for CF, while we found no clinical trial including children with non-CF bronchiectasis. Meta-analysis was not conducted due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of HA efficacy in the treatment of the upper and lower airways is still limited in children. Available data suggest that inhaled HMW-HA could be useful in the treatment of recurrent upper respiratory infections and chronic or recurrent inflammation of the middle ear and adenoids as well as of the lower airways in cystic fibrosis in association with hypertonic saline solution. Studies on larger populations and on the different formulations and nebulization methods, especially in pediatric age, are urgently needed.
22856641		New nebulizer technology to monitor adherence and nebulizer performance in cystic fibrosis.Topical delivery of aerosolized therapies is an established treatment for chronic airway infection and inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent developments in nebuliser technology have enabled Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) of mesh generated aerosol particles resulting in more efficient airway deposition than existing jet nebulizers. An additional feature of these new devices is the ability to record and examine the performance of the device by downloading stored data (electronic data capture). In a series of studies we have used this downloading facility to monitor treatment times and examine adherence to nebulizer therapy in our pediatric patients. We found routine adherence monitoring is possible in busy CF clinic. We have shown that good adherence to treatment can be maintained in both patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa on long-term therapy, and in patients with first/new growths of Pseudomonas on short-term eradication therapy. When adherence was examined from an individual perspective, we demonstrated a wide variation both between and within individual patients. A further modification of AAD technology, Target Inhalation Mode (TIM) optimises patient inhalations through a direct feedback mechanism. This new breathing mode has also been evaluated in our pediatric CF clinic in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) and we have shown that children maintain adherence to treatment through the TIM mouthpiece and average treatment times reduced from 6.9 to 3.7 min when using TIM. This is a new era of aerosol delivery and novel advances in medical devices need to be monitored and assessed rigorously, particularly as new and potentially expensive therapies emerge from translational studies. Electronic data capture enables CF teams to work in an open partnership with patients to achieve the common goals of improving drug delivery and reducing patient burden.
22400363		[Inhaled therapies for cystic fibrosis].Inhaled therapies play a significant role in the management of cystic fibrosis patients. Mucolytic and airway-rehydrating agents improve mucociliary clearance and respiratory functional status. Nebulized antibiotherapy achieve high local concentration, while reducing systemic toxicity. Tolerance to inhaled treatments is good excepting frequent bronchoconstriction which can usually be prevented by prior administration of beta2-mimetics. The majority of treatments are only available in liquid formulations. Thus, nebulization is the most frequently used inhalation mode. Vibrating-mesh nebulizers have significantly reduced inhalation time.
34976079		An Overview on the Upper and Lower Airway Microbiome in Cystic Fibrosis Patients.BACKGROUND: In cystic fibrosis patients, the mucus is an excellent place for opportunistic bacteria and pathogens to cover. Chronic infections of upper and lower airways play a critical role in the mortality of cystic fibrosis. This study aimed to introduce the microbiota profiles in patients with cystic fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a comprehensive literature search was done for studies on upper and lower airway microbiota in cystic fibrosis patients. International and national databases were searched for the following MeSH words: microbiota, microbiome, upper airway, lower airway, cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, upper airway microbiome, lower airway microbiome, microbiome pattern in cystic fibrosis, microbiome pattern in cystic fibrosis, upper airway microbiota, lower airway microbiota, and microbiota pattern. RESULTS: Streptococcus spp. are in significantly higher relative abundance in infants and children with cystic fibrosis; however, Pseudomonas spp. are in higher relative abundance in adults with cystic fibrosis. Molecular diagnostic techniques can be remarkably accurate in detecting microbial strains. CONCLUSION: For the detection and isolation of most bacterial species, independent-culture methods in addition to the standard culture method are recommended, and sampling should include both upper and lower airways.
35286625		Effect of chest physiotherapy on cystic fibrosis sputum nanostructure: an experimental and theoretical approach.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by the production of viscous mucoid secretions in multiple organs, particularly the airways. The pathological increase of proteins, mucin and biological polymers determines their arrangement into a three-dimensional polymeric network, affecting the whole mucus and impairing the muco-ciliary clearance which promotes inflammation and bacterial infection. Thus, to improve the efficacy of the drugs usually applied in CF therapy (e.g., mucolytics, anti-inflammatory and antibiotics), an in-depth understanding of the mucus nanostructure is of utmost importance. Drug diffusivity inside a gel-like system depends on the ratio between the diffusing drug molecule radius and the mesh size of the network. Based on our previous findings, we propose the combined use of rheology and low field NMR to study the mesh size distribution of the sputum from CF patients. Specifically, we herein explore the effects of chest physiotherapy on CF sputum characteristic as evaluated by rheology, low field NMR and the drug penetration through the mucus via mathematical simulation. These data show that chest physiotherapy has beneficial effects on patients, as it favourably modifies sputum and enhances drug penetration through the respiratory mucus.
16160230		Bio-Health Information: a Preliminary Review of On-line Cystic Fibrosis Resources.The aims of this study are to determine, and to better understand, elements that are common across a range of bio-health information resources; and to characterize those resources in terms of search and display functionality. Our ultimate goal is to better define the role of bio-health information in clinical practice and in biological research. This paper reports our first step, which is to compare different web-based resources that describe cystic fibrosis. The resources came from PubMed, Nucleotide, EMBL-EBI, DDBJ, OMIM, MeSH, ICD-10, and the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database. We found obvious differences in terms of scope and purpose. However, while there were obvious similarities between related resources in terms of content, we also found differences among these resources in terms of display form, specificity of qualifiers, file format and the potential for computer processing. While our work is in its early stages, this study has clarified the nature of bio-health information resources and has allowed us to begin to characterize these resources in terms of their suitability in clinical practice and in biological research.
25267619		Probing biological nanotopology via diffusion of weakly constrained plasmonic nanorods with optical coherence tomography.Biological materials exhibit complex nanotopology, i.e., a composite liquid and solid phase structure that is heterogeneous on the nanoscale. The diffusion of nanoparticles in nanotopological environments can elucidate biophysical changes associated with pathogenesis and disease progression. However, there is a lack of methods that characterize nanoprobe diffusion and translate easily to in vivo studies. Here, we demonstrate a method based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) to depth-resolve diffusion of plasmon-resonant gold nanorods (GNRs) that are weakly constrained by the biological tissue. By using GNRs that are on the size scale of the polymeric mesh, their Brownian motion is minimally hindered by intermittent collisions with local macromolecules. OCT depth-resolves the particle-averaged translational diffusion coefficient (DT) of GNRs within each coherence volume, which is separable from the nonequilibrium motile activities of cells based on the unique polarized light-scattering properties of GNRs. We show how this enables minimally invasive imaging and monitoring of nanotopological changes in a variety of biological models, including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as relevant to carcinogenesis, and dehydration of pulmonary mucus as relevant to cystic fibrosis. In 3D ECM models, DT of GNRs decreases with both increasing collagen concentration and cell density. Similarly, DT of GNRs is sensitive to human bronchial-epithelial mucus concentration over a physiologically relevant range. This novel method comprises a broad-based platform for studying heterogeneous nanotopology, as distinct from bulk viscoelasticity, in biological milieu. 
28347790		Key considerations on nebulization of antimicrobial agents to mechanically ventilated patients.Nebulized antibiotics have an established role in patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis. Their potential benefit to treat respiratory infections in mechanically ventilated patients is receiving increasing interest. In this consensus statement of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, the body of evidence of the therapeutic utility of aerosolized antibiotics in mechanically ventilated patients was reviewed and resulted in the following recommendations: Vibrating-mesh nebulizers should be preferred to jet or ultrasonic nebulizers. To decrease turbulence and limit circuit and tracheobronchial deposition, we recommend: (a) the use of specifically designed respiratory circuits avoiding sharp angles and characterized by smooth inner surfaces, (b) the use of specific ventilator settings during nebulization including use of a volume controlled mode using constant inspiratory flow, tidal volume 8 mL/kg, respiratory frequency 12 to 15 bpm, inspiratory:expiratory ratio 50%, inspiratory pause 20% and positive end-expiratory pressure 5 to 10 cm H2O and (c) the administration of a short-acting sedative agent if coordination between the patient and the ventilator is not obtained, to avoid patient's flow triggering and episodes of peak decelerating inspiratory flow. A filter should be inserted on the expiratory limb to protect the ventilator flow device and changed between each nebulization to avoid expiratory flow obstruction. A heat and moisture exchanger and/or conventional heated humidifier should be stopped during the nebulization period to avoid a massive loss of aerosolized particles through trapping and condensation. If these technical requirements are not followed, there is a high risk of treatment failure and adverse events in mechanically ventilated patients receiving nebulized antibiotics for pneumonia.
21620782		A randomised controlled trial of breathing modes for adaptive aerosol delivery in children with cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Aerosol delivery is a cornerstone of CF airways disease management. New nebulisers have reduced treatment times by utilising mesh technology for aerosol production. We have evaluated a further modification (target inhalation mode (TIM)) that may reduce treatment delivery times further. METHODS: Following a baseline period on tidal breathing mode (TBM), children with CF on long-term aerosol therapy were randomly allocated to either TIM, which optimises patient inhalations through a direct feedback mechanism, or to continue TBM. The primary outcome was nebuliser treatment times with secondary outcomes being adherence and patient preference. RESULTS: The ten children allocated TIM reduced their mean (SD) treatment times from 6.9(2.9) to 3.7(2.3) minutes (p<0.001). In contrast, treatment times were unchanged in the ten children allocated TBM. Mean adherence was maintained in the TIM group but declined in patients allocated TBM by >5%. All children preferred TIM to TBM. CONCLUSION: TIM reduces nebuliser treatment times and may positively impact on adherence, although longer duration studies are required to examine this.

This article presents an updated review of the relationship between vitamin D and pediatric respiratory pathology. A literature search was performed in PUBMED using free terms and MESH terms: vitamin D, asthma, respiratory system diseases, and bronchiolitis. Stu dies in human patients younger than 18 years and animals, published in English and Spanish until 2017 were included. 507 articles were found, of which 43 were included. Indirect evidence suggests a role of vitamin D and fetal lung maturation. In relation to pediatric pulmonary pathology, studies are scarce and inconclusive. Recent meta-analyses performed with individualized evaluation of the participants shows an important protective role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of severe asthma exacerbations and acute viral infections. In bronchiolitis, the results are contradictory, with no clear relationship between plasma levels and severity. There is not enough evidence to assess the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in cystic fibrosis and tuberculosis. A direct relationship between the severity of sleep-related breathing disorders and vitamin D plasma levels has recently been proposed, although the exact mechanisms involved in this association are unknown. Current information suggests that vitamin D supplementation may represent a cost-effective strategy in redu cing important causes of infant morbidity and mortality.
28050369		A Case of Surgical Site Infection Caused by Mycobacterium fortuitum, following Herniorrhaphy.Rapidly Growing Mycobacteria (RGM) are opportunistic pathogens found in the environment. Mycobacterium fortuitum, M. chelonae and M.abscessus are the important human pathogens of this group. They cause wound infections, disseminated cutaneous disease, pulmonary infection in patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis, bone and joint infections and keratitis. Infections due to these Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly reported. Post laparoscopic wound infections, mesh site infections and other surgical site infections due to M. fortuitum and M. chelonae have been reported. Usually wound infections due to atypical mycobacteria have delayed onset and do not respond to conventional antibiotics. Identification of RGM can be done by a set of cumbersome biochemical tests, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), molecular methods using DNA probes or by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). We here report a case of post-herniorrhaphy wound infection due to M. fortuitum which was identified by molecular method (HAIN mycobacterial species system). This case report underscores the importance of examining Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain of all exudates with sterile culture on day one for non fastidious bacteria. Timely identification can lead to prompt therapy of patients preventing further complications.

In diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), pulmonary mucus exhibits altered features, which hamper clearance mechanisms and drug diffusion, ultimately leading to lung failure. Effectively modelling the passage through mucus still represents an unmet challenge. An airway CF mucus model is herein proposed to disassemble the complexity of the mucus barrier following a modular approach. A hydrogel, mainly composed of mucin in an alginate (Alg) network, is proposed to specifically model the chemical-physical properties of CF mucus. The steric retention of pathological mucus was reproduced by targeting its mesh size (approximately 50 nm) and viscoelastic properties. The interactive barrier was reproduced by a composition inspired from the CF mucus. Optimized mucus models, composed of 3 mg ml-1 Alg and 25 mg ml-1 mucin, exhibited a G' increasing from ~21.2 to 55.2 Pa and a G'' ranging from ~5.26 to 28.8 Pa in the frequency range of 0.1 to 20 Hz. Drug diffusion was tested using three model drugs. The proposed mucus model was able to discriminate between the mucin-drug interaction and the steric barrier of a mucus layer with respect to the parallel artificial membrane permeability (PAMPA) that models the phospholipidic cell membrane, the state-of-the-art screening tool for passive drug diffusion. The mucus model can be proposed as an in vitro tool for early drug discovery, representing a step forward to model the mucus layer. Additionally, the proposed methodology allows to easily include other molecules present within mucus, as relevant proteins, lipids and DNA.

A Systematic Review.Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in genes for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR gene is responsible for the production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus, and any mutation in this would lead to the thickening of these secretions. Cystic fibrosis is a multi-organ disorder, but 80% of patients suffer from respiratory problems due to chronic infections most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Eradication of these infections has become a challenge as P. aeruginosa has developed resistance to multiple antibiotics. In several studies, iron has been shown to play an integral role in biofilm formation, which is the predominant resistance mechanism used by P. aeruginosa to combat antibiotics. The increased iron content in cystic fibrosis patients' sputum samples explains their increased susceptibility to Pseudomonas infections. Hence in this review article, we have used the research data available on therapeutic agents that target iron as an adjuvant treatment for chronic Pseudomonas infection. We systematically screened three databases using focused words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for relevant articles. Further, we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed a thorough quality appraisal. Thirty shortlisted relevant studies were meticulously reviewed. In our opinion, novel therapeutic approaches targeting iron such as iron chelators, gallium, and cefiderocol have potent anti-biofilm properties. Future studies and clinical trials using these approaches in the management of chronic Pseudomonas infection might help in decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. Exploring these approaches might also help to combat other resistant organisms whose survival is dependent on iron.

DATA SOURCES: Studies identified through a MEDLINE search with the use of MeSH terms vitamin K, cystic fibrosis, PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence-II), coagulation abnormality and cystic fibrosis, and hepatic disorder and cystic fibrosis. STUDY SELECTION: Six articles published between January 1981 and December 1992 were selected: one general review of vitamin K in infancy and five studies involving clinical trials of vitamin K supplementation or screening for fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin K or PIVKA-II in patients with CF. Review articles on nutrition in patients with CF, technical reports, letters, comments and case studies not bearing directly on these issues were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Findings in these articles were analysed and compared to determine whether routine supplementation in all patients with CF is indicated, whether specific subgroups of these patients are susceptible to vitamin K deficiency and areas in which future research is needed. RESULTS: There is no consensus on routine vitamin K supplementation in patients with CF. Studies have found a few cases of vitamin K deficiency among the population of people with CF. In addition, various factors--including pancreatic failure, liver disease, bowel resection and long-term use of antibiotics--can put some of these patients at risk of vitamin K deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Specific indications for routine vitamin K supplementation in all patients with CF have not yet been identified. Pending further studies, it would be prudent to consider routine supplementation in patients with CF and severe noncholestatic and cholestatic liver disease, major small-bowel resection, pancreatic insufficiency or lung disease necessitating frequent use of antibiotics. A stronger body of evidence is needed as a basis for clinical strategies.
25445528	treat|@CHEMICAL_Lipids|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis	Sodium colistimethate loaded lipid nanocarriers for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections associated with cystic fibrosis.Lung impairment is the most life-threatening factor for cystic fibrosis patients. Indeed, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main pathogen in the pulmonary infection of these patients. In this work, we developed sodium colistimethate loaded lipid nanoparticles, namely, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), as a strategy to enhance the antimicrobial therapy against P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients. The nanoparticles obtained displayed a 200-400 nm size, high drug entrapment (79-94%) and a sustained drug release profile. Moreover, both SLN and NLC presented antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated P. aeruginosa. The integrity of the nanoparticles was not affected by nebulization through a mesh vibrating nebulizer. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles appeared to be less toxic than free sodium colistimethate in cell culture. Finally, an in vivo distribution experiment showed that nanoparticles spread homogenously through the lung and there was no migration of lipid nanoparticles to other organs, such as liver, spleen or kidneys.
25125326		Probing the size limit for nanomedicine penetration into Burkholderia multivorans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.Encapsulation of antibiotics into nanoparticles is a potential strategy to eradicate biofilms. To allow further optimization of nanomedicines for biofilm eradication, the influence of the nanoparticle size on the penetration into dense biofilm clusters needs to be investigated. In the present study, the penetration of nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 40 to 550 nm into two biofilms, Burkholderia multivorans LMG 18825 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 27622, was evaluated using confocal microscopy. Through image analysis, the percentage of particles able to penetrate into dense biofilm clusters was calculated. The size cut off for optimal penetration into biofilm clusters was located around 100-130 nm for both biofilms. The mesh size of the biofilm matrix and the size of the channels in between the bacteria of the clusters are two factors which likely play a role in the exclusion of the larger particles. For B. multivorans, a sharp drop in the penetration into the clusters is seen for particles larger than 130 nm while for P. aeruginosa, a more gradual decrease in penetration could be observed. The overall penetration of the nanoparticles was slightly lower for P. aeruginosa than for B. multivorans. Based on these results, it could be concluded that nanocarriers of about 100 nm and smaller are good candidates to improve the treatment of chronic pulmonary biofilms in CF patients. Furthermore, the confocal microscopy method demonstrated here is a useful tool to assess the penetration of nanomedicines in biofilm clusters. Such information is important to optimize nanomedicine formulations for the treatment of biofilm infections.
19176245	associate|@CHEMICAL_Polyethylene_Glycols|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis	The penetration of fresh undiluted sputum expectorated by cystic fibrosis patients by non-adhesive polymer nanoparticles.Highly viscoelastic and adhesive sputum has precluded efficient nanoparticle-based drug and gene delivery to the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We sought to determine whether nanoparticles coated with non-mucoadhesive polymers could penetrate CF sputum, and to use these "muco-inert particles" (MIPs) as non-destructive nanoprobes to characterize the sputum microstructure. Particles as large as 200 nm in diameter that were densely coated with low MW polyethylene glycol (PEG) moved through undiluted CF sputum with average speeds up to 90-fold faster than similarly-sized uncoated particles. On the other hand, the transport of both coated and uncoated 500 nm particles was strongly hindered. The local viscosity of sputum, encountered by the fastest 10% of 200 nm MIPs, was only 5-fold higher than that of water, whereas the bulk viscosity was 10,000-fold higher at low shear rates. Using measured transport rates of various sized MIPs combined with an obstruction-scaling model, we determined that the average 3D mesh spacing of CF sputum is approximately 140+/-50 nm (range: 60-300 nm). Taken together, these results demonstrate that nanoparticles up to 200 nm in diameter that do not adhere to CF sputum can move rapidly through this critical barrier by accessing pores that are filled with a low viscosity fluid. The results also offer hope that desperately needed sputum-penetrating drug- and gene-carrier nanoparticles can be developed for CF.

Activated neutrophils induce inflammation and severe alveolar injury by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The backbones of many DAMPs and NETs are made of extracellular, cell-free DNA decorated with highly toxic compounds such as elastase, myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histones. Dornase alfa is a FDA-approved recombinant human DNAse 1 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may break up cell-free DNA, loosening sticky mucus in the distal airways and reducing NETs-induced toxicity on alveolar pneumocytes. The COVIDornase trial intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. This drug might make lung mucus thinner and looser, promoting improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular double-stranded DNA-induced hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the lungs. TRIAL DESIGN: COVIDornase is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multicentric, open-label clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will recruit mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the recruiting centres (at the time of writing: The Rothschild foundation hospital in Paris, the Strasbourg university hospitals, and Metz-Thionville hospital) who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and meet ARDS criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Adult patient (age >= 18 years old); - Hospitalized in ICU; - With severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS according to Berlin criteria (PaO2/FiO2 < 300 and PEEP > 5 cmH2O); - Intubated for less than 8 days; - With an anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation > 48 hours; - Carrier of an arterial catheter; - For whom 4 PaO2/FiO2 values over the preceding 24 hours are available; NON-INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Known hypersensitivity to dornase alfa or any of its excipients; - Pregnant or breastfeeding status; - Patient under legal protection. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention 1, Study group Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme , Roche, Switzerland) will be administered by aerosol, at a dose of 2500 IU twice daily, 12 hours apart, for 7 consecutive days, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo , Aerogen, Ireland). The remainder of the management will be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, including mechanical ventilation (protective ventilation, PEEP > 5 cmH2O, tracheal balloon pressure check every 4 hours or automatic device, 30  head of the bed elevation, tidal volume 6-8mL/kg, plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O), neuromuscular blockers if necessary, prone position if PaO2/FiO2 < 150, early enteral nutrition, glycemic control and a sedation protocol based on the RASS score. Intervention 2, Comparator Patients will receive usual care in accordance with good practice (as detailed above), without aerosols. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one grade improvement between D0 (inclusion) and D7 in the ARDS scale severity (Berlin criteria). For instance from "severe" to "moderate" or from "moderate" to "mild". RANDOMISATION: All consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised 1:1 using an eCRF-based, computer-generated randomisation table, either to the dornase alfa arm or to the control arm. An interim analysis will be performed after inclusion of 20 patients. Inclusions may be stopped at the interim analysis per data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) advice, if statistical analyses conclude on the futility or efficacy of the intervention or by other DSMB decision. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants and caregivers will not be blinded to study group assignment. Those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to study group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Fifty patients will be randomized to each group, 100 patients in total. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version number 2, April 29th, 2020. Recruitment is ongoing. The trial started recruitment on the 21st April 2020. We estimate recruitment will finish August 21st 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on 21 April 2020, updated on 8 May 2020. Trial registration number is NCT04355364.

24675238		Exploration of the impact of 'mild phenotypes' on median age at death in the U.K. CF registry.BACKGROUND: The widespread availability of genetic testing allowing the identification of "milder" individuals with CF coincided with improvements in CF life expectancy but the relative contribution of case mix to that improved survival is uncertain. METHODS: Patients in the U.K. CF registry were divided into 'mild phenotype' defined as pancreatic sufficient and 'typical CF' defined as pancreatic insufficient. Distributions of age at death were compared with Mann-Whitney test. Temporal trends in incidence and prevalence were described. Jonckheere-Terpstra test was used to compare the trend for median age at death from 2007 to 2010. RESULTS: Patients with 'mild phenotype' had significantly higher age at death (32 years, interquartile range 14 years versus 27 years, interquartile range 29 years; Mann-Whitney test p-value = 0.026). The proportion of patients with 'mild phenotype' appeared to be increasing (0.128 in 2007, 0.144 in 2010). The trend for increasing age at death (from 25 years in 2007 to 29 years in 2010, Jonckheere-Terpstra test p-value = 0.012) was independent of the 'mild phenotype' patients. CONCLUSION: The impact of mild phenotypes on the improvement in the median age at death among people with CF was trivial.
28470579		Does probiotic supplementation affect pulmonary exacerbation and intestinal inflammation in cystic fibrosis: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.BACKGROUND: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) usually have abnormal intestinal microbiota due to massive exposure to antibiotics. Probiotics could modify the gut microbiota and hence may affect CF management. So the aim of present systematic review was evaluation of the efficacy and safety of probiotic supplementation for the management of cystic fibrosis. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Springer Cochrane Library Databases until January 2016 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in pediatric or adult populations related to the study aim. Key words were selected based on Mesh terms. Based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist, eligibility of included articles was evaluated. RESULTS: Five studies included in this review represent 188 participants with a follow up period ranging from 1 month to 6 months. The results of the included studies supporting the use of probiotics in management of pulmonary exacerbation and intestinal calprotectin in patients with cystic fibrosis. However the level of evidence was limited. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of high quality RCTs makes it impossible to support a general recommendation about the use of probiotics in the treatment of CF pulmonary exacerbation and intestinal inflammation.
28315491		Vibrating-mesh nebulizer maintenance by CF patients: Results from a French survey.PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Vibrating-mesh nebulizers are widely used at home for cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment, with a therapeutic efficiency closely linked to the mesh performance. This national study looks at the maintenance at home by CF patients and their families of the mesh of the eFlow rapid nebulizer. Ninety-two patients from 34 French CF centers, treated at home with inhaled drugs delivered with a vibrating-mesh nebulizer, answered to a phone standardized questionnaire specifying the different techniques of maintenance of the nebulizer. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Patients were aged from 2 to 68 years (58.7% of children). They inhaled a mean of 1.8 nebulizations per day. Maintenance was assumed by patients in 36% of the cases. All steps of the theoretical maintenance of a nebulizer were respected in 66% of the cases. The mesh was not cleaned in 45.6%, not disinfected or not thermically disinfected in 32.5%, and not rinsed after chemical disinfection in 45.5% of the case. Only 49% of the patients knew the role of the MeshCare  system in the mesh maintenance, and only 39% had already used it when the nebulization duration reached 10 min. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts about education, particularly for the maintenance of the mesh, are needed for CF patients using a vibrating-mesh nebulizer at home.
19466909		Inhalation equipment hygiene: a belgian national survey.BACKGROUND: Nebulizers are a potential source of contamination of the respiratory tract. Nevertheless, only a few clear guidelines regarding cleaning and disinfection of nebulizers are available. This survey aims to analyze the common household methods used by cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in Belgium. METHODS: A questionnaire about type of nebulizer, methods, and frequency of cleaning, disinfection, and drying was established by physiotherapists at the Belgian CF centers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Belgian CF Association sent this questionnaire to all Belgian CF patients. Of the 903 questionnaires distributed, 379 (42%) were returned. Fifty-two, 40 and 8% of patients used a vibrating-mesh nebulizer, jet nebulizer, or ultrasonic device, respectively. Ninety-eight percent of patients cleaned their material and soap was used by 35% of patients. Disinfection was performed by 91% of the patients and was daily performed by 57% of patients. Thermal disinfection (boiling water or sterilizer), a hypochlorite-based solution, or acetic acid solution was used by 44, 29, and 25% of patients, respectively, to disinfect their nebulizers. Thermal disinfection was used by 37 and 53% of patients using a classical or vibrating-mesh nebulizer, respectively. After cleaning or disinfection, 91% of the material was dried. The high percentage of Belgian CF patients disinfecting their nebulizer proves that they seem aware of the hygiene problem. The lack of unanimous guidelines in Belgium at the time of the study perhaps explains the variety of methods used. The arrival of vibrating-mesh nebulizers has led to a change in disinfection methods.
23633344	treat|@CHEMICAL_Tobramycin|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis	Nebuliser systems for drug delivery in cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Nebuliser systems are used to deliver medications to control the symptoms and the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Many types of nebuliser systems are available for use with various medications; however, there has been no previous systematic review which has evaluated these systems. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effectiveness, safety, burden of treatment and adherence to nebulised therapy using different nebuliser systems for people with cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data. Date of the most recent search: 15 Oct 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing nebuliser systems including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology systems, adaptive aerosol delivery systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third author assessed studies where agreement could not be reached. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 40 studies with 20 of these (1936 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of tobramycin, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic sodium chloride and other solutions through the different nebuliser systems. This review demonstrates variability in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. Conventional nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions and smaller particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition and may be preferred by people with CF, as compared to conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles. Nebulisers using adaptive aerosol delivery or vibrating mesh technology reduce treatment time to a far greater extent. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) is greater than conventional with adaptive aerosol delivery. Vibrating mesh technology systems may give greater deposition than conventional when measuring sputum levels, but lower deposition when measuring serum levels or using gamma scintigraphy. The available data indicate that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained or improved with systems which use these newer technologies, but also that some nebuliser systems using vibrating mesh technology may be subject to increased failures. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems. Technologies such as adaptive aerosol delivery and vibrating mesh technology have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, patient preference and adherence. There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials of these technologies to determine patient-focused outcomes (such as quality of life and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of medications and clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need for antibiotics) and an economic evaluation of their use.
27812540		Microstructural alterations of sputum in cystic fibrosis lung disease.The stasis of mucus secretions in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients leads to recurrent infections and pulmonary exacerbations, resulting in decreased survival. Prior studies have assessed the biochemical and biophysical features of airway mucus in individuals with CF. However, these measurements are unable to probe mucus structure on microscopic length scales relevant to key players in the progression of CF-related lung disease, namely, viruses, bacteria, and neutrophils. In this study, we quantitatively determined sputum microstructure based on the diffusion of muco-inert nanoparticle probes in CF sputum and found that a reduction in sputum mesh pore size is characteristic of CF patients with reduced lung function, as indicated by measured FEV1. We also discovered that the effect of ex vivo treatment of CF sputum with rhDNase I (Pulmozyme) on microstructure is dependent upon the time interval between the most recent inhaled rhDNase I treatment and the sample collection. Microstructure of mucus may serve as a marker for the extent of CF lung disease and as a parameter for assessing the effectiveness of mucus-altering agents.
19025706		Aerosol delivery of recombinant human DNase I: in vitro comparison of a vibrating-mesh nebulizer with a jet nebulizer.BACKGROUND: Inhaled recombinant human DNase I (rhDNase) improves clearance of visco-elastic secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis. Because of their portability, newer-generation vibrating-mesh nebulizers offer greater convenience for the patient, but their efficiency in delivering rhDNase has not been determined. METHODS: We compared a newer-generation vibrating-mesh nebulizer (Omron MicroAir) to a Pari LC+ with the Pari ProNeb Ultra compressor (a commonly employed rhDNase administration system). With the Next Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor, we determined aerosol particle distribution. We also measured mass output efficiency, nebulization time, and mass of rhDNase that deposited on a filter during simulated breathing. RESULTS: The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of aerosol from the MicroAir (MMAD 4.3 microm, GSD 2.8 microm) was equivalent to that from the Pari LC+ (MMAD 4.2 microm, GSD 2.7 microm). During simulated breathing the MicroAir had a higher total mass output efficiency (88%) than the Pari LC+ (68%) (P < .001), and total nebulization time was shorter with the MicroAir (6.1 min vs 7.2 min, P = .03). When nebulized to dryness, the mass of rhDNase delivered to the filter was comparable with the MicroAir (1.30 +/- 0.4 mg) and Pari LC+ (1.21 +/- 0.05 mg). CONCLUSION: The MicroAir could be employed as a portable nebulizer for rhDNase therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.
18830514		Newborn screening: what pediatricians should know.OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the current situation of neonatal screening worldwide and in Brazil. To define the role of pediatricians in neonatal screening programs. SOURCES: Scientific articles selected by means of searches run on the medical websites MEDLINE, Cochrane, PubMed (MeSH) and MD Consult, using the keywords newborn screening, neonatal, pediatrics, diagnosis, primary care, ethics and their equivalents in Portuguese, in isolation and in combination, in addition to medical textbooks on genetics and inborn errors of metabolism, published between January 1998 and December 2007, the National Neonatal Screening Program technical standards and routines manual, and Ministry of Health decree 822/2001. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Published data demonstrate a great diversity in the number of diseases included in the neonatal screening programs of different countries. In Brazil, the National Neonatal Screening Program was set up in 2001, to screen for phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism, sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. Screening for a wider range of conditions using mass spectrometry is currently the subject of disagreement and discussion of financial and ethical issues. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal screening is one of the most important advances for the prevention of pediatric diseases. Nevertheless, implementation is complex, multidisciplinary and dependent on public health policies and, to date, there is no consensus on which diseases should be included. A large number of scientific and ethical questions need to be discussed in order to better define the screening panels to be implemented. Pediatricians have important roles to play in all stages of neonatal screening programs.
37942828		Nebuliser systems for drug delivery in cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Nebuliser systems are used to deliver medications to the lungs, to control the symptoms and the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). There are many different nebulised-medications prescribed for people with CF and there are many different types of nebuliser systems. Some of these nebulised medications are licenced for, and can be taken via only one type of nebuliser system; some are licensed for, and can be taken via more than one type of nebuliser system. This is an update to a previous systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the time efficiency, effectiveness, safety, cost and impact of use (e.g. burden of care, adherence, quality of life (QoL)) of different nebuliser systems, when used with different inhaled medications for people with CF. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books containing conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data. We also searched online trial registries. Date of the most recent search: 9 August 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing nebuliser systems, including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology (VMT) systems, adaptive aerosol delivery (AAD) systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third review author assessed studies where agreement could not be reached. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 216 studies with 33 of these (2270 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of tobramycin, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and other solutions through the different nebuliser systems in children and adults with CF. This review demonstrates variability in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. The certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low. Some conventional nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions, and smaller particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition (the amount of drug reaching the lung), and may be preferred by people with CF, as compared to other conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles. Newer nebuliser systems using AAD, or VMT (or both) reduce treatment time compared to conventional systems. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) with AAD is greater than with conventional systems. VMT systems may give greater deposition than conventional systems when measuring sputum levels. The available data indicate that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained or improved and that individuals prefer AAD or VMT systems, but also that some nebuliser systems using VMT may be subject to increased system failures. There is limited, unclear evidence on the impact of different nebuliser systems on lung function and a lack of data on the impact of different nebuliser systems on our outcomes of quality of life (QoL), adverse effects, respiratory exacerbations and related implications, adherence, satisfaction, cost and device reliability. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Newer technologies e.g. AAD and VMT have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, preference and adherence. Data are lacking for all varieties of medications which are used in CF care, including different inhaled antibiotics or hypertonic saline, with all delivery (nebuliser system) possibilities. Long-term RCTs are needed to evaluate different nebuliser systems to determine patient-focused outcomes (such as QoL and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of a wide variety of medications, clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need for antibiotics), and an economic evaluation of their use. There are insufficient data to establish whether one nebuliser system is better than another overall. Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems, compatibility with specific nebulised medication, and they must work with their patients to choose the best nebuliser system for each individual. This is likely to be an ongoing process as the needs and circumstances of each individual change over time.
28741229		Inhaled Antimicrobials for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: Practical Aspects.Positive experience with inhaled antibiotics in pulmonary infections of patients with cystic fibrosis has paved the way for their utilization in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract infections. A successful antibiotic delivery depends upon the size of the generated particle and the elimination of drug impaction in the large airways and the ventilator circuit. Generated droplet size is mainly affected by the type of the nebulizer employed. Currently, jet, ultrasonic, and vibrating mesh nebulizers are marketed; the latter can deliver optimal antibiotic particle size. Promising novel drug-device combinations are able to release drug concentrations of 25- to 300-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration of the targeted pathogens into the pulmonary alveoli. The most important practical steps of nebulization include pre-assessment and preparation of the patient (suctioning, sedation, possible bronchodilation, adjustment of necessary ventilator settings); adherence to the procedure (drug preparation, avoidance of unnecessary tubing connections, interruption of heated humidification, removal of heat-moisture exchanger); inspection of the procedure (check for residual in drug chamber, change of expiratory filter, return sedation, and ventilator settings to previous status); and surveillance of the patient for adverse events (close monitoring of the patient and particularly of peak airway pressure and bronchoconstriction). Practical aspects of nebulization are very important to ensure optimal drug delivery and safe procedure for the patient. Therefore, the development of an operational checklist is a priority for every department adopting this modality.
24688094	treat|@CHEMICAL_Rhamnose|@DISEASE_Congenital_Abnormalities ;associate|@CHEMICAL_MPPPUP|@CHEMICAL_undecaprenyl_pyrophosphate	A Burkholderia cenocepacia MurJ (MviN) homolog is essential for cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial viability.The cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) of Burkholderia cenocepacia, an opportunistic pathogen, has not yet been characterized. However, the B. cenocepacia genome contains homologs of genes encoding PG biosynthetic functions in other bacteria. PG biosynthesis involves the formation of the undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate-linked N-acetyl glucosamine-N-acetyl muramic acid-pentapeptide, known as lipid II, which is built on the cytosolic face of the cell membrane. Lipid II is then translocated across the membrane and its glycopeptide moiety becomes incorporated into the growing cell wall mesh; this translocation step is critical to PG synthesis. We have investigated candidate flippase homologs of the MurJ family in B. cenocepacia. Our results show that BCAL2764, herein referred to as murJBc, is indispensable for viability. Viable B. cenocepacia could only be obtained through a conditional mutagenesis strategy by placing murJBc under the control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter. Under rhamnose depletion, the conditional strain stopped growing and individual cells displayed morphological abnormalities consistent with a defect in PG synthesis. Bacterial cells unable to express MurJBc underwent cell lysis, while partial MurJBc depletion sensitized the mutant to the action of beta-lactam antibiotics. Depletion of MurJBc caused accumulation of PG precursors consistent with the notion that this protein plays a role in lipid II flipping to the periplasmic compartment. Reciprocal complementation experiments of conditional murJ mutants in B. cenocepacia and Escherichia coli with plasmids expressing MurJ from each strain indicated that MurJBc and MurJEc are functional homologs. Together, our results are consistent with the notion that MurJBc is a PG lipid II flippase in B. cenocepacia. 
19466906	treat|@CHEMICAL_Tobramycin|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis	Changes in performance of the Pari eFlow rapid and Pari LC Plus during 6 months use by CF patients.BACKGROUND: Nebulized antibiotics are important in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The Pari eFlow rapid with vibrating mesh is often used off-label for the administration of tobramycin (TOBI) because of a reduced nebulization time and easier handling compared to a classic nebulizer-compressor combination. Mesh technology may be vulnerable, however. Therefore, we investigated particle size distribution and output as well as changes in the performance of the eFlow before and after 6 months of use, in comparison with the Pari LC Plus nebulizer plus Turboboy compressor. METHODS: Size distributions in the aerosols and nebulization times for TOBI were measured with laser diffraction technique; delivered doses by weighing. RESULTS: New eFlows produce considerably larger droplets (X(50) = 3.5 mum) from TOBI than new LC Plus nebulizers (X(50) = 2.8 mum). After use, the X(50) increases for both systems (to 3.7 and 3.3 mum, respectively). The relative span of the size distribution {(X(90)-X(10))/X(50)} changes from 1.26 to 1.28 mum for eFlow and from 2.19 to 2.45 mum for LC Plus. The total nebulization time doubles for LC Plus, whereas in 51% of all experiments the eFlow switched off after 10 min, resulting in incomplete dose delivery. For the eFlow, changes during use are related to clogging of orifices. Once being clogged, only replacement of the mesh restores the original performance. CONCLUSIONS: New eFlows produce larger droplets and in a narrower size range compared to new LC Plus nebulizers for TOBI, and therefore both devices are not equivalent. Theoretically a larger portion of the aerosol from eFlow is likely to be deposited in the upper airways. The performance of both tested nebulizers decreases after 6 months of use. For the eFlow, timely replacement of the mesh is necessary. These in vitro results underscore the importance of registration studies of new drug-device combinations.
6817037	cotreat|@CHEMICAL_malachite_green|@CHEMICAL_Glutaral	Comparative ultrastructure of a mucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patient and its spontaneous non-mucoid mutant.The ultrastructure of a mucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa of cystic fibrosis origin and its spontaneous non-mucoid variant was compared by transmission electron microscopy. Negatively-stained preparations of the mucoid strain obtained from plate cultures demonstrated dense, fibrous material projecting from the cell. No such material was observed in thin-sections or in negatively-strained preparations from liquid cultures. Thin-sections of ethanol-precipitated extracellular material from liquid cultures of the mucoid-strain revealed a cottony mesh of thin electron dense fibres. The non-mucoid strain did not produce such material. When prefixed with glutaraldehyde/malachite green mixture, cells of both strains demonstrated electron dense intracellular and extracellular malachite green-stainable structures. The internal complexes were frequently associated with the nucleoid or cell membrane and were replaced by electron transparent areas in cells prefixed with glutaraldehyde alone. Aeruginocins of the R-type were observed in mitomycin C induced cultures of both strains. Bacteriophages with 'claw-shaped' tail-tips were observed in the mucoid strain. Crystalline material was produced by the mucoid strain but only when plated on certain media.
37734235		Comparison of amikacin lung delivery between AKITA  and eFlow rapid  nebulizers in healthy controls and patients with CF: A randomized cross-over trial.INTRODUCTION: Nebulization plays a key role in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The Favorite function couple to jet nebulizers (AKITA ) emerged recently. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of the lung delivery by the AKITA  by comparing the urinary concentration of amikacin after nebulization with the AKITA  and the eFlow rapid , in healthy subjects and patients with CF (PwCF). METHOD: The two samples (healthy subjects and PwCF) were randomized (cross-over 1:1) for two nebulizations (500 mg of amikacin diluted in 4 mL of normal saline solution), with the AKITA  and with the eFlow rapid . The primary endpoint was the amount of urinary excretion of amikacin over 24 h. The constant of elimination (Ke) was calculated based on the maximal cumulative urinary amikacin excretion plotted over time. RESULTS: The total amount of urinary amikacin excretion was greater when AKITA  was used in PwCF (11.7 mg (8.2-14.1) vs 6.1 mg (3.7-13.3); p = 0.02) but not different in healthy subjects (14.5 mg (11.7-18.5) vs 12.4 mg (8.0-17.1); p = 0.12). The duration of the nebulization was always shorter with eFlow rapid  than with AKITA  (PwCF: 6.5 +- 0.6 min vs 9.2 +- 1.8 min; p = 0.001 - Healthy: 4.7 +- 1.3 min vs 9.7 +- 1.6 min; p = 0.03). The constant of elimination was similar between the two modalities in CF subjects (0.153 (0.071-0.205) vs 0.149 (0.041-0.182); p = 0.26) and in healthy subjects (0.166 (0.130-0.218) vs 0.167 (0.119-0.210), p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: the Favorite inhalation is better to deliver a specific amount of drug than a mesh nebulizer (eFlow rapid ) in PwCF but not in healthy subjects.
7532167		Structurally variant classes of pilus appendage fibers coexpressed from Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia.One or more of five morphologically distinct classes of appendage pili were determined to be peritrichously expressed by Burkholderia (formerly Pseudomonas) cepacia isolated from disparate sources. B. cepacia-encoded cblA pilin gene hybridization-based analysis revealed that one associated class, cable (Cbl) adhesin type IIB. cepacia pili, correlates with epidemically transmitted strains from a single cystic fibrosis (CF) center. When only phenotypic assays were available, correlations between the source and the pilus type were nonetheless observed: filamentous (Fil) type IIIB. cepacia pili correlated with CF-associated nonepidemic isolates, spine (Spn) type IVB. cepacia pili correlated with clinical (non-CF) isolates, and spike (Spk) type VB. cepacia pili correlated with environmental isolates. Further, Cbl, Fil, or Spk pili typically appear as an internal framework for constitutively coexpressed, peritrichously arranged dense mats of fine, curly mesh (Msh) type IB. cepacia pili. Constitutive coexpression of dense mats of Msh type IB. cepacia pili in association with a labyrinth of either Cbl, Fil, or Spk pili suggests possible cooperative pilus interactions mediating adhesion-based colonization in the differing environments from which the strains were isolated. Despite such correlations, phylogenetic analyses indicate that with the exception of the epidemically transmitted clusters of isolates, the remaining B. cepacia strains from the other three sources exhibited an equal degree of genetic relatedness independent of origin. As previously found for Escherichia coli, this discrepancy could be accounted for by selection-driven, in vivo horizontal transfer events between distantly related members of the species B. cepacia, leading to the genetic acquisition of environmentally appropriate adhesion-based colonization pilus operons.
31108949	treat|@CHEMICAL_Antimicrobial_Peptides|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Peptides|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis	Vibrating Mesh Nebulisation of Pro-Antimicrobial Peptides for Use in Cystic Fibrosis.BACKGROUND: There has been considerable interest in the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as antimicrobial therapeutics in many conditions including cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of this study is to determine if the prodrugs of AMPs (pro-AMPs) can be delivered to the lung by a vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) and whether the pro-AMP modification has any effect on delivery. METHODS: Physical characteristics of the peptides (AMP and pro-AMP) and antimicrobial activity were compared before and after nebulisation. Droplet size distribution was determined by laser diffraction and cascade impaction. Delivery to a model lung was determined in models of spontaneously-breathing and mechanically-ventilated patients. RESULTS: The physical characteristics and antimicrobial activities were unchanged after nebulisation. Mean droplet size diameters were below 5 mum in both determinations, with the fine particle fraction approximately 67% for both peptides. Approximately 25% of the nominal dose was delivered in the spontaneously-breathing model for both peptides, with higher deliveries observed in the mechanically-ventilated model. Delivery times were approximately 170 s per mL for both peptides and the residual volume in the nebuliser was below 10% in nearly all cases. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the delivery of (pro-)AMPs to the lung using a VMN is feasible and that the prodrug modification is not detrimental. They support the further development of pro-AMPs as therapeutics in CF.
18634743		Bilateral retrovascular femoral hernia.A 34-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis presented with bilateral femoral hernias, which were found to be retrovascular at operation. The hernias were not amenable to conventional open or laparoscopic repair, and were repaired using pre-peritoneal mesh inserted deep to transversalis fascia. The anatomical basis and management of uncommon variants of femoral hernia are discussed.
30223075	treat|@CHEMICAL_Ciprofloxacin|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Ciprofloxacin|@DISEASE_Respiratory_Tract_Infections	Synergy of nebulized phage PEV20 and ciprofloxacin combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Nebulization is currently used for delivery of antibiotics for respiratory infections. Bacteriophages (or phages) are effective predators of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly found in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is known that phages and antibiotics can potentially show synergistic antimicrobial effect on bacterial killing. In the present study, we investigated synergistic antimicrobial effect of phage PEV20 with five different antibiotics against three P. aeruginosa strains isolated from sputum of CF patients. The antibiotics included ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, colistin, aztreonam and amikacin, which are approved by U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for inhaled administration. Phage and antibiotic synergy was determined by assessing bacterial killing performing time-kill studies. Among the different phage-antibiotic combinations, PEV20 and ciprofloxacin exhibited the most synergistic effect. Two phage-ciprofloxacin combinations, containing 1/4 and 1/2 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa strains FADD1-PA001 (A) and JIP865, respectively were aerosolized using both air-jet and vibrating mesh nebulizers and the synergistic antibacterial activity was maintained after nebulization. Air-jet nebulizer generated droplets with smaller volume median diameters (3.6-3.7 microm) and slightly larger span (2.3-2.4) than vibrating mesh nebulizers (5.1-5.3 microm; 2.1-2.2), achieving a higher fine particle fraction (FPF) of 70%. In conclusion, nebulized phage PEV20 and ciprofloxacin combination shows promising antimicrobial and aerosol characteristics for potential treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by drug-resistant P. aeruginosa.

The treatment strategy in both acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is to reduce the severity of the symptoms, minimize the duration of the disease and prevent complications. Topical therapy has become an important tool in otolaryngologists armamentarium for rhinosinusitis treatment. Recently, topical hyaluronic acid (HA), the major component of many extracellular matrices that promotes tissue healing, including activation and moderation of the inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis, has been proposed for ARS and CRS adjuvant tool. The aim of the study is to systematically review the published literature regarding all the therapeutic effects of HA on the ARS and CRS. Relevant published studies were found in PubMed, Google Scholar and Ovid, using a combined keyword search or medical subject headings. At the end of our study selection process, 5 relevant publications were included: 2 of them investigated the potential role of HA in reducing symptoms and preventing exacerbations of CRS in adult population, two of them in paediatric patients affected by upper respiratory tract infections and one of them in cystic fibrosis patients with bacterial rhinopharyngitis. Data deriving from the present review of 5 clinical studies showed that the use of topical HA represents a relevant therapeutic advance in rhinosinusitis to minimize symptoms and prevent reacutization with a significant improvement of their quality of life, as it avoids systemic side effects and increases local drug activity. Further studies on larger populations and with new specific nebulization devices for upper airway are needed to confirm these encouraging results.
33919035		Evaluation of Aerosol Therapy during the Escalation of Care in a Model of Adult Cystic Fibrosis.Lung disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). CF patients inhale antibiotics regularly as treatment against persistent bacterial infections. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of clinical intervention on aerosol therapy during the escalation of care using a bench model of adult CF. Droplet size analysis of selected antibiotics was completed in tandem with the delivered aerosol dose (% of total dose) assessments in simulations of various interventions providing oxygen supplementation or ventilatory support. Results highlight the variability of aerosolised dose delivery. In the homecare setting, the vibrating mesh nebuliser (VMN) delivered significantly more than the jet nebuliser (JN) (16.15 +- 0.86% versus 6.51 +- 2.15%). In the hospital setting, using VMN only, significant variability was seen across clinical interventions. In the emergency department, VMN plus mouthpiece (no supplemental oxygen) was seen to deliver (29.02 +- 1.41%) versus low flow nasal therapy (10 L per minute (LPM) oxygen) (1.81 +- 0.47%) and high flow nasal therapy (50 LPM oxygen) (3.36 +- 0.34%). In the ward/intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation recorded 19.02 +- 0.28%, versus 22.64 +- 1.88% of the dose delivered during invasive mechanical ventilation. These results will have application in the design of intervention-appropriate aerosol therapy strategies and will be of use to researchers developing new therapeutics for application in cystic fibrosis and beyond.
20625676		Cell profile of BAL fluid in children and adolescents with and without lung disease.The objective of this study was to review the literature on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell profiles in healthy children and adolescents, as well as on the use of BAL as a diagnostic and follow-up tool for lung disease patients in this age bracket. To that end, we used the Medline database, compiling studies published between 1989 and 2009 employing the following MeSH descriptors (with Boolean operators) as search terms: bronchoalveolar lavage AND cytology OR cell AND child. In healthy children, the cell profile includes alveolar macrophages (> 80%), lymphocytes (approximately 10%), neutrophils (approximately 2%) and eosinophils (< 1%). The profile varies depending on the disease under study. The number of neutrophils is greater in wheezing children, especially in non-atopic children, as well as in those with pulmonary infectious and inflammatory profiles, including cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. Eosinophil counts are elevated in children/adolescents with asthma and can reach high levels in those with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or eosinophilic syndromes. In a heterogeneous group of diseases, the number of lymphocytes can increase. Evaluation of the BAL fluid cell profile, when used in conjunction with clinical and imaging findings, has proven to be an essential tool in the investigation of various lung diseases. Less invasive than transbronchial and open lung biopsies, BAL has great clinical value. Further studies adopting standard international protocols should be carried out. Such studies should involve various age groups and settings in order to obtain reference values for BAL fluid cell profiles, which are necessary for a more accurate interpretation of findings in children and adolescents with lung diseases.
31047122		Activity monitors in pulmonary disease.Physical activity is reduced in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. Activity monitors can measure physical activity objectively and accurately over prolonged periods of time. Research grade and commercially available devices, using accelerometer technology, are being increasingly used in clinical studies. Physical activity levels have been found to have a moderate to strong correlation with important measures such as pulmonary function, exercise capacity, quality of life, and mortality and hospitalizations in patients with COPD, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension and cystic fibrosis. Their use as a clinical trial end-point and as a tool to augment rehabilitation efforts has also been explored in patients with COPD with variable results. Due to the ease of use, economic viability, widespread availability and good patient compliance, their use in adult and pediatric medicine is expanding. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence of use of activity monitors in COPD, interstitial lung disease, asthma, pulmonary arterial hypertension, cystic fibrosis and lung transplant patients for the purposes of prognostication, monitoring, outcome measures and intervention.
36439573		Inhaled Antibiotics in Non-cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis (NCFB): A Systematic Review of Efficacy and Limitations in Adult Patients.Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis has recently been under the spotlight due to a better detection rate with advanced imaging techniques. Recurrent infections in such patients are the main cause of their deterioration. This invariably leads to a catastrophic wheel of decline in lung function, reinfection, and repeated hospital consultations. The main goal of their management is based on the principles of prevention and vigorous treatment of recurrent infections. This review aimed to gather recent therapeutic options for inhaled antibacterial use in such patients and compare them for their properties of safety and efficacy. Studies done in the last 10 years on adult patients were gathered using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) strategy and later sorted using the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Research engines used include Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Saudi Digital Library. Out of the 31,739 articles identified initially, 1362 were screened. The final eight selected papers were assessed for quality by using the quality assessment checklist, the Cochrane bias assessment tool, the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tools and cross-examined by co-authors. We concluded that the use of inhaled antibiotics as an adjuvant and follow-up treatment option is associated with better short and long-term prognoses in patients. They lead to lesser systemic side effects than the oral and intravenous varieties available on the market. However, the establishment of a hierarchy among the subgroups remains a grey area that needs further research.
30904464		Cystic fibrosis in the modern therapeutic era: Give the shower a thought!Fifty-two meshes of e-flow rapid  were characterized for tobramycin delivery with a laser diffractometer after 6 months of home use by cystic fibrosis patients treated with various nebulized drugs. Three meshes were out of order and 30 considered to be defective for tobramycin delivery. The use of the specific mesh cleaning shower system permitted 14 defective meshes to be in the expected range of nebulized volume.
26106207		Radioaerosol Pulmonary Deposition Using Mesh and Jet Nebulizers During Noninvasive Ventilation in Healthy Subjects.BACKGROUND: In vivo deposition studies of aerosol administration during noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are scarce in the literature. The aim of this study was to compare radioaerosol pulmonary index and radioaerosol mass balance in the different compartments (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) of radio-tagged aerosol administered using vibrating mesh nebulizers and conventional jet nebulizers during NIV. METHODS: This was a crossover clinical trial involving 10 healthy subjects (mean age of 33.7 +- 10.0 y) randomly assigned to both treatment arms of this study: group 1 (NIV + vibrating mesh nebulizer, n = 10) and group 2 (NIV + jet nebulizer, n = 10). All subjects inhaled 3 mL of technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (25 mCi) and 0.9% saline solution via vibrating mesh and jet nebulizers during NIV through a face mask secured with straps while receiving positive inspiratory and expiratory pressures of 12 and 5 cm H2O, respectively. Scintigraphy was performed to count radioaerosol particles deposited in the regions of interest to determine radioaerosol mass balance from the lungs, upper airways, stomach, nebulizer, ventilator circuit, inspiratory and expiratory filters, and mask as a percentage. RESULTS: Vibrating mesh nebulizers deposited 972,013 +- 214,459 counts versus jet nebulizer with 386,025 +- 130,363 counts (P = .005). In a determination of mass balance, vibrating mesh nebulizers showed a higher deposition of inhaled radioaerosol compared with jet nebulizers (23.1 +- 5.8% vs 6.1 +- 2.5%, P = .005) and a higher proportion of radioaerosol deposited into the lungs (5.5 +- 0.9% versus 1.5 +- 0.6%, respectively, P = .005). The residual drug volume was lower with vibrating mesh nebulizers (5.1 +- 1.5%) compared with jet nebulizers (41.3 +- 4.2%, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: During NIV in healthy subjects, vibrating mesh nebulizers delivered > 2-fold more radiolabeled drug into the respiratory tract compared with conventional jet nebulizers. Additional studies are recommended in subjects with asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis to better understand differences in both aerosol delivery and response.

21385138	associate|@CHEMICAL_Polyethylene_Glycols|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis ;treat|@CHEMICAL_Acetylcysteine|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis	Rapid transport of muco-inert nanoparticles in cystic fibrosis sputum treated with N-acetyl cysteine.AIMS: Sputum poses a critical diffusional barrier that strongly limits the efficacy of drug and gene carriers in the airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous attempts to enhance particle penetration of CF sputum have focused on either reducing its barrier properties via mucolytics, or decreasing particle adhesion to sputum constituents by coating the particle surface with non-mucoadhesive polymers, including polyethylene glycol (PEG). Neither approach has enabled particles to penetrate expectorated sputum at rates previously observed for non-mucoadhesive nanoparticles in human cervicovaginal mucus. Here, we sought to investigate whether a common mucolytic, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), in combination with dense PEG coatings on particles, can synergistically enhance particle penetration across fresh undiluted CF sputum. MATERIALS & METHODS: We used high-resolution multiple particle tracking to measure the diffusion of uncoated and PEG-coated nanoparticles in native and NAC-treated CF sputum. RESULTS: We discovered that 200 nm particles, if densely coated with PEG, were able to penetrate CF sputum pretreated with NAC with average speeds approaching their theoretical speeds in water. Based on the rapid penetration of PEG-coated particles in NAC-treated sputum, we determined that the average spacing between sputum mesh elements was increased from 145 +- 50 nm to 230 +- 50 nm upon NAC treatment. Mathematical models based on particle transport rates suggest as much as 75 and 30% of 200 and 500 nm PEG-coated particles, respectively, may penetrate a physiologically thick NAC-treated CF sputum layer within 20 min. Uncoated particles were trapped in CF sputum pretreated with NAC nearly to the same extent as in native sputum, suggesting that NAC treatment alone offered little improvement to particle penetration. CONCLUSION: NAC facilitated rapid diffusion of PEG-coated, muco-inert nanoparticles in CF sputum. Our results provide a promising strategy to improve drug and gene carrier penetration in CF sputum, offering hope for improved therapies for CF.
24865497		Aerosol delivery of DNA/liposomes to the lung for cystic fibrosis gene therapy.Abstract Lung gene therapy is being evaluated for a range of acute and chronic diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). As these therapies approach clinical realization, it is becoming increasingly clear that the ability to efficiently deliver gene transfer agents (GTAs) to target cell populations within the lung may prove just as critical as the gene therapy formulation itself in terms of generating positive clinical outcomes. Key to the success of any aerosol gene therapy is the interaction between the GTA and nebulization device. We evaluated the effects of aerosolization on our preferred formulation, plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexed with the cationic liposome GL67A (pDNA/GL67A) using commercially available nebulizer devices. The relatively high viscosity (6.3+-0.1 cP) and particulate nature of pDNA/GL67A formulations hindered stable aerosol generation in ultrasonic and vibrating mesh nebulizers but was not problematic in the jet nebulizers tested. Aerosol size characteristics varied significantly between devices, but the AeroEclipse II nebulizer operating at 50 psi generated stable pDNA/GL67A aerosols suitable for delivery to the CF lung (mass median aerodynamic diameter 3.4+-0.1 mum). Importantly, biological function of pDNA/GL67A formulations was retained after nebulization, and although aerosol delivery rate was lower than that of other devices (0.17+-0.01 ml/min), the breath-actuated AeroEclipse II nebulizer generated aerosol only during the inspiratory phase and as such was more efficient than other devices with 83+-3% of generated aerosol available for patient inhalation. On the basis of these results, we have selected the AeroEclipse II nebulizer for the delivery of pDNA/GL67A formulations to the lungs of CF patients as part of phase IIa/b clinical studies. 
28358158		Direct monitoring of pulmonary disease treatment biomarkers using plasmonic gold nanorods with diffusion-sensitive OCT.The solid concentration of pulmonary mucus (wt%) is critical to respiratory health. In patients with respiratory disease, such as Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), mucus hydration is impaired, resulting in high wt%. Mucus with high wt% is a hallmark of pulmonary disease that leads to obstructed airways, inflammation, and infection. Methods to measure mucus hydration in situ and in real-time are needed for drug development and personalized therapy. We employed plasmonic gold nanorod (GNR) biosensors that intermittently collide with macromolecules comprising the mucus mesh as they self-diffuse, such that GNR translational diffusion (DT) is sensitive to wt%. GNRs are attractive candidates for bioprobes due to their anisotropic optical scattering that makes them easily distinguishable from native tissue using polarization-sensitive OCT. Using principles of heterodyne dynamic light scattering, we developed diffusion-sensitive optical coherence tomography (DS-OCT) to spatially-resolve changing DT in real-time. DS-OCT enables, for the first time, direct monitoring of changes in nanoparticle diffusion rates that are sensitive to nanoporosity with spatial and temporal resolutions of 4.7 mum and 0.2 s. DS-OCT therefore enables us to measure spatially-resolved changes in mucus wt% over time. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of DS-OCT on well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells during a clinical mucus-hydrating therapy, hypertonic saline treatment (HST), to reveal, for the first time, mucus mixing, cellular secretions, and mucus hydration on the micrometer scale that translate to long-term therapeutic effects.

Administration of nanoparticles (NPs) with high antibiotic load capable of penetrating the tight mesh of biofilm/mucus can be an advent to overcome the treatment bottlenecks. Biodegradable and biocompatible polymer nanoparticles efficiently loaded with ciprofloxacin complex offer a solution for emerging treatment strategies. NPs were prepared under controlled conditions by utilizing MicroJet Reactor (MJR) to yield a particle size of 190.4+-28.6nm with 0.089 PDI. Encapsulation efficiency of the drug was 79% resulting in a loading of 14%. Release was determined to be controlled and medium-independent in PBS, PBS+0.2% Tween 80 and simulated lung fluid. Cytotoxicity assays with Calu-3 cells and CF bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) indicated that complex-loaded PLGA NPs were non-toxic at concentrations >> MICcipro against lab strains of the bacteria. Antibacterial activity tests revealed enhanced activity when applied as nanoparticles. NPs' colloidal stability in mucus was proven. Notably, a decrease in mucus turbidity was observed upon incubation with NPs. Herewith, ciprofloxacin complex-loaded PLGA NPs are introduced as promising pulmonary nano drug delivery systems against P.aeruginosa infections in CF lung.
37422433		Nonsense mutations accelerate lung disease and decrease survival of cystic fibrosis children.RATIONALE: Limited information is available on the clinical status of people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) carrying 2 nonsense mutations (PTC/PTC). The main objective of this study was to compare disease severity between pwCF PTC/PTC, compound heterozygous for F508del and PTC (F508del/PTC) and homozygous for F508del (F508del+/+). METHODS: Based on the European CF Society Patient Registry clinical data of pwCF living in high and middle income European and neighboring countries, PTC/PTC (n = 657) were compared with F508del+/+ (n = 21,317) and F508del/PTC(n = 4254).CFTR mRNA and protein activity levels were assessed in primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells sampled from 22 PTC/PTC pwCF. MAIN RESULTS: As compared to F508del+/+ pwCF; both PTC/PTC and F508del/PTC pwCF exhibited a significantly faster rate of decline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1) from 7 years (-1.33 for F508del +/+, -1.59 for F508del/PTC; -1.65 for PTC/PTC, p < 0.001) until respectively 30 years (-1.05 for F508del +/+, -1.23 for PTC/PTC, p = 0.048) and 27 years (-1.12 for F508del +/+, -1.26 for F508del/PTC, p = 0.034). This resulted in lower FEV1 values in adulthood. Mortality of pediatric pwCF with one or two PTC alleles was significantly higher than their F508del homozygous pairs. Infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequent in PTC/PTC versus F508del+/+ and F508del/PTC pwCF. CFTR activity in PTC/PTC pwCF's HNE cells ranged between 0% to 3% of the wild-type level. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsense mutations decrease the survival and accelerate the course of respiratory disease in children and adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis.
30038933		An Adeno-Associated Viral Vector Capable of Penetrating the Mucus Barrier to Inhaled Gene Therapy.Diffusion of the viral vectors evaluated in inhaled gene therapy clinical trials to date are largely hindered within airway mucus, which limits their access to, and transduction of, the underlying airway epithelium prior to clearance from the lung. Here, we discovered that adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 6 was able to rapidly diffuse through mucus collected from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, unlike previously tested AAV serotypes. A point mutation of the AAV6 capsid suggests a potential mechanism by which AAV6 avoids adhesion to the mucus mesh. Significantly greater transgene expression was achieved with AAV6 compared to a mucoadhesive serotype, AAV1, in air-liquid interface cultures of human CF bronchial epithelium with naturally secreted mucus or induced mucus hypersecretion. In addition, AAV6 achieved superior distribution and overall level of transgene expression compared to AAV1 in the airways and whole lungs, respectively, of transgenic mice with airway mucus obstruction. Our findings motivate further evaluation and clinical development of AAV6 for inhaled gene therapy.
32655858	associate|@CHEMICAL_Cyclodextrins|@CHEMICAL_Propylamines ;associate|@CHEMICAL_Nitric_Oxide|@DISEASE_Cystic_Fibrosis	Nitric oxide diffusion through cystic fibrosis-relevant media and lung tissue.A simplified diffusion cell methodology was employed to measure the diffusion coefficient of nitric oxide (NO) through phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and artificial sputum medium (ASM)-an in vitro analog for airway mucus. Diffusion through the proteinaceous ASM yielded a significantly lower diffusion coefficient compared to PBS, which is attributed to both the physical obstruction by the mucin mesh and reactive nature of NO radicals towards the biological compounds in ASM. To further confirm that ASM was restricting NO from diffusing freely, a macromolecular propylamine-modified cyclodextrin donor (CD-PA) was employed to release the NO more slowly. The NO diffusion characteristics in ASM via the NO donor were also slower relative to PBS. As NO is likely to interact with lung cells after passing through the mucus barrier, the diffusion of both NO and the CD-PA macromolecular NO donor through differentiated lung tissue was investigated with and without an ASM layer. Comparison of NO diffusion through the three diffusion barriers indicated that the lung tissue significantly impeded NO penetration over the course of the experiment compared to PBS and ASM. In fact, the diffusion of CD-PA through the lung tissue was hindered until after the release of its NO payload, potentially due to the increased net charge of the NO donor structure. Of importance, the viability of the tissue was not influenced by the NO-releasing CD-PA at bactericidal concentrations.
36309203		Quantifying the effectiveness of ultraviolet-C light at inactivating airborne Mycobacterium abscessus.BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium abscessus (MABS) group are environmental organisms that can cause infection in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and other suppurative lung diseases. There is potential for person-to-person airborne transmission of MABS among people with CF attending the same care centre. Ultraviolet light (band C, UV-C) is used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis control indoors; however, no studies have assessed UV-C for airborne MABS. AIM: To determine whether a range of UV-C doses increased the inactivation of airborne MABS, compared with no-UVC conditions. METHODS: MABS was generated by a vibrating mesh nebulizer located within a 400 L rotating drum sampler, and then exposed to an array of 265 nm UV-C light-emitting diodes (LED). A six-stage Andersen Cascade Impactor was used to collect aerosols. Standard microbiological protocols were used for enumerating MABS, and these quantified the effectiveness of UV-C doses (in triplicate). UV-C effectiveness was estimated using the difference between inactivation with and without UV-C. FINDINGS: Sixteen tests were performed, with UV-C doses ranging from 276 to 1104 muW s/cm2. Mean (+-SD) UV-C effectiveness ranged from 47.1% (+-13.4) to 83.6% (+-3.3). UV-C led to significantly greater inactivation of MABS (all P-values <=0.045) than natural decay at all doses assessed. Using an indoor model of the hospital environment, it was estimated that UV-C doses in the range studied here could be safely delivered in clinical settings where patients and staff are present. CONCLUSION: This study provides empirical in-vitro evidence that nebulized MABS are susceptible to UV-C inactivation.

Despite over 27 clinical trials, there are still very few gene therapy vectors that have shown any improvement in lung function; highlighting the need to develop formulations with improved gene transfer potency and the desirable physiochemical characteristics for efficacious therapy. Herein, we introduce a novel cell penetrating peptide (CPP)-based non-viral vector that utilises glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding enhanced transduction (GET) for highly efficient gene transfer. GET peptides couple directly with DNA through electrostatic interactions to form nanoparticles (NPs). In order to adapt the GET peptide for efficient in vivo delivery, we engineered PEGylated versions of the peptide and employed a strategy to form DNA NPs with different densities of PEG coatings. We were able to identify candidate formulations (PEGylation rates >=40%) that shielded the positively charged surface of particles, maintained colloidal stability in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and retained gene transfer activity in human bronchial epithelial cell lines and precision cut lung slices (PCLS) in vitro. Using multiple particle tracking (MPT) technology, we demonstrated that PEG-GET complexes were able to navigate the mucus mesh and diffuse rapidly through patient CF sputum samples ex vivo. When tested in mouse lung models in vivo, PEGylated particles demonstrated superior biodistribution, improved safety profiles and efficient gene transfer of a reporter luciferase plasmid compared to non-PEGylated complexes. Furthermore, gene expression was significantly enhanced in comparison to polyethylenimine (PEI), a non-viral gene carrier that has been widely tested in pre-clinical settings. This work describes an innovative approach that combines novel GET peptides for enhanced transfection with a tuneable PEG coating for efficacious lung gene therapy.
21283985	compare|@CHEMICAL_Mannitol|@CHEMICAL_Sodium_Chloride	Mannitol delivery by vibrating mesh nebulisation for enhancing mucociliary clearance.Mucociliary clearance is compromised by airway surface liquid dehydration in respiratory disease states such as cystic fibrosis. Rehydration by hyperosmolar agents such as nebulised hypertonic saline and dry powder mannitol has demonstrated in vivo safety and efficacy for restoring mucociliary function. Mannitol, delivered as a nebulised formulation for this purpose, has not been investigated as yet. The current study examines the feasibility of delivering such a formulation using recent vibrating mesh technology. Nebulisation was conducted using an Aeroneb Go(TM) vibrating mesh nebuliser, and aerosol size was assessed by laser diffraction. Cascade impaction coupled with mass assay by high-performance liquid chromatography was used to confirm fluid uniformity and correlation with laser diffraction sizing. The following nebuliser formulations were prepared and aerosolised: deionised water, mannitol (150 mg/mL) aqueous solution, sodium chloride aqueous solution [0.2%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7% (w/v)] and mannitol (150 mg/mL) in sodium chloride solution [0.2%, 1%, 3%, 7% (w/v)]. Mannitol aqueous solution was poorly nebulised, resulting in lengthy treatment times and large median droplet size. Addition of sodium chloride drastically improved nebuliser performance and aerosol characteristics. In vivo studies are necessary to confirm efficacy of nebulised mannitol. If substantiated, it could provide a pleasant-tasting alternative mucoactive agent with prolonged therapeutic action.
23234801		Psychological impact of working with patients with cystic fibrosis at end-of-life, pre-transplant stage.OBJECTIVE: Multidisciplinary staff who work with end-of-life, pre-transplant patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have to juggle two seemingly opposing care approaches; active care to maintain their patients' health and condition in anticipation of a transplant, and sensitive palliative care that takes their end-of-life wishes into consideration should they not receive a transplant. Little is known about the psychological impact on staff working within this care dichotomy. The aim of this study is to explore staff's experiences and understand more about the psychological impact of this work on them professionally and personally, and how this affects their ability to provide appropriate care for their patients. METHOD: A qualitative explorative research design was used. Ten semistructured interviews with multidisciplinary staff working in cystic fibrosis centers and units across the United Kingdom were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). RESULTS: Two superordinate themes emerged from the analysis: factors contributing to the "juggle" of active and palliative care, and extent of emotional impact on staff. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The study indicates that there is an emotional impact on staff working with patients with CF at end-of-life, pre-transplant stages. Specifically, it reveals the extent of the unpredictability that staff work with, and the range of emotions that staff experience, including uncertainty about professional identity and anxiety about working practices. The depth and intimacy of professional-patient relationships is highlighted, particularly for staff in close contact with and similar in age to their patients. Additionally, the strength of staff's commitment and desire to care for patients within broader humanistic terms that mesh with their own personal values is brought to light. Despite the difficulties with their work, the majority of staff adopted numerous coping strategies to manage their emotions, many of which emphasized the link between their professional and personal values in undertaking their roles.
37159780		A Systematic Review of Cystic Fibrosis in Children: Can Non-Medical Therapy Options Lead to a Better Mental Health Outcome?Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disorder that begins at an early age, so it is crucial to be aware of the physical and emotional burden placed on individuals suffering from it and their families. It significantly impacts an individual's life; therefore, it is essential to acknowledge the effects of the disease on physical and mental health. Our systematic review aims to highlight the areas of life affected by cystic fibrosis and evaluate various non-medical treatment options that may support the mental health of CF patients. We selected PubMed, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) as our databases. We initially found 146,095 articles and narrowed the number of articles down using filters, exclusion and inclusion criteria, and various combinations of Medical Subheadings (MeSH) and key terms. We decided to use a final count of nine articles for our systematic review. The studies we included highlighted the negative impact of cystic fibrosis on mental health, like depression and anxiety, as well as on sleep, physical health, and overall quality of life. Several non-medical interventions, such as logotherapy, psychological interventions, complementary and alternative medicine, and many more, have been shown to enhance the mental health of many participants. Studies suggested that such therapy options may greatly benefit individuals with cystic fibrosis and their current treatment plan. This review indicates that non-medical therapy options can enhance the mental health of individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis and that it is crucial to bring more attention to preventing and treating mental health issues in cystic fibrosis patients. However, as current data is limited, more research with a larger number of participants over an extended period of time is necessary to better evaluate the efficacy of non-medical interventions on mental health.

METHODS: A randomized, open-label, crossover study was performed. In 2 separate study visits, blood samples from 22 children were collected following TIS nebulization with I-neb (75 mg) and PARI-LC Plus (300 mg). Study visits were separated by 1 month, in which 1 of the study nebulizers was used twice daily. Tobramycin PK for both nebulizers was established using measured tobramycin concentrations and Bayesian PK modelling software. Hearing and renal function tests were performed to test for aminoglycoside associated toxicity. In addition to standard estimated glomerular filtration rate values, biomarkers for tubular injury (KIM-1 and NAG) were measured. Patient and nebulizer satisfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Inhalations were well tolerated and serum trough concentrations below the predefined toxic limit were reached with no significant differences in PK parameters between nebulizers. Results of audiometry and estimated glomerular filtration rate revealed no abnormalities. However, increased urinary NAG/creatinine ratios at visit 2 for both nebulizers suggest TIS-induced subclinical tubular kidney injury. Nebulization time was 50% shorter and patient satisfaction was significantly higher with the I-neb. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulization of 75 mg TIS with the I-neb in children with cystic fibrosis resulted in comparable systemic exposure to 300 mg TIS with the PARI-LC Plus and was well tolerated and preferred over the PARI-LC Plus. Long-term safety of TIS nebulization should be monitored clinically, especially regarding the effects on tubular kidney injury.

The aim of tobramycin inhalation therapy in CF patients with chronic pulmonary infection is to deliver high amounts of drug directly to the site of infection. TOBI( ) is a tobramycin nebulizer solution (300 mg/5 ml) approved by FDA for maintenance therapy for patient with CF. The 20% tobramycin sulfate solution was reported as the optimal and maximal concentration. METHODS: Nebulization of high strength tobramycin solution (20% tobramycin sulfate) (HSTS) has been assessed in this study by using different selected high performance nebulizer delivery systems: two different designs of jet nebulizers, and three new nebulizers based on vibrating mesh technology. The aerosol particle size distribution and output characteristics were measured for in vitro performance assessment of the nebulizer systems. The methodology was adapted from the current European standard, EN 13544-1:2001E. RESULTS: The particle size distribution characteristic measurements showed that all tested nebulizers may be suitable for inhalation of HSTS. The mean (SD) of highest percentage of fine particles (<5 mum) was 77.64 (2.3) % for Sidestream( ), at flow rate 16 L/min. The highest respirable inhaled mass was for Pari LC Plus( ) combined with PariBoyN( ) compressor, with mean (SD) 90.85 (8.6) mg. The mean (SD) of highest drug wastage percentage was 63.9 (3.9) % for Sidestream( ) jet nebulizer combined with compressed air cylinder at flow rate 16 L/min, while the lowest was 2.3 (0.26) % for NE-U22 Omron( ) (high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: The HSTS can be nebulized by all tested nebulisers but the high frequency NE-U22 Omron( ) and Aeroneb Go( ) are more efficient. When the HSTS compared to TOBI( ), the respirable inhaled dose was increased to more than 73%.

Tobramycin (TOBI , 300 mg at 60 mg/ml) inhaled from the PARI LC PLUS  nebulizer requires about 20 min. This study determined if equivalent levels of pulmonary deposition could be achieved in shorter time using 1.5 ml of 100 mg/ml tobramycin solution delivered by an investigational eFlow  nebulizer. Sixteen males with stable CF, 8 children and 8 adults, and an FEV(1)  > 45% predicted inhaled both preparations on two occasions with (99m) Tc-DTPA added to the tobramycin. Blood samples were taken for quantification of tobramycin in the serum. The PARI LC PLUS  delivered 45.4 (39.3-51.6), mean and 95% CI, mg to the lungs in 17.0 +- 2.5 min (mean +- SD) with serum levels of 1,089 +- 388 microg/L. The investigational eFlow  delivered 46.3(40.3-51.7) mg in 4.0 +- 1.0 min with blood levels of 909 +- 458 microg/L. Only the time of delivery was significantly different with P < 0.0001 (paired t-test). Tolerability of the treatment was comparable for both inhalation regimes, but the shorter treatment was preferred by all patients. These results demonstrate the possibility of delivering equivalent levels of tobramycin much faster into the lungs of CF patients when using eFlow , a very efficient electronic nebulizer.
35002357		Pulmonary Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infection in Infants: A Systematic Review.Limited information and literature exist examining pulmonary infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacterial specifically in an infant population. The objective of our study was to summarize clinical characteristics and outcomes of infant patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection via systematic literature review to identify common diagnostic and treatment regimens for this infection in infants. A search of MEDLINE and PubMed databases in October 2019 using MeSH search terms "infant," "NTM," "pulmonary," and "Mycobacterium abscessus" yielded 139 articles. Inclusion criteria were i) English-language studies including cases and case series with ii) established nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection in iii) a patient population of infants no older than 24 months. Patients with cystic fibrosis and any study which did not contain relevant information such as infection and age were excluded. This yielded data on 37 patients extracted from 28 studies analyzed. The most common strain was Mycobacterium avium complex, isolated in 56.8% of patient diagnoses. Bronchoscopy/thoracoscopy with a subsequent culture were the most common diagnostic techniques, utilized in 64.9% of cases. Drug therapeutic treatment was utilized in 86% of cases, with a median of three drugs administered. Notable limitations of this study are the small sample size and its retrospective nature, which relies on information reported in previous case studies. Although there is limited formal clinician consensus on the treatment of NTM pulmonary infection and how it may differ in an infant population, our findings indicate an informal consensus typically involving diagnostic lung specimen culture and antibiotic therapy.
37909943		[Pediatric pulmonary rehabilitation in the light of qualitative research: What statistic cannot show].Several studies have supported the positive effect of respiratory rehabilitation (RR) in children and adolescents (CRA) with chronic respiratory diseases (CRD); however, qualitative aspects related to the experiences and perceptions about RR have been scarcely studied. OBJECTIVE: to analyze the qualitative evidence regarding the perceptions and experiences of patients, families and professionals related to the RR of children and adolescents with CKD. METHODS: Review of qualitative studies in 5 databases. We used MeSH terms and free English-language terms grouped into three dimensions: patients, intervention, and research design. The study subjects had to be patients, their families, teachers or treating health teams. No restrictions were placed on language or year of publication. The search strategy was configured as follows: ((Cystic fibrosis) OR (Asthma) OR (Neuromuscular diseases)) AND ((Respiratory rehabilitation) OR (Exercise)) AND ((Qualitative research) OR (Phenomenology) OR (Grounded theory) OR (Ethnography)). Two independent authors analyzed atingent titles, abstracts and long texts. Finally, a qualitative description of the results was made. RESULTS: Twenty-one qualitative studies were selected, all on patients, family members, teachers or professionals treating patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma or neuromuscular diseases (NMD). Perception of benefits, parental influence, enjoyment of the protocols, and time required to engage in physical activity were categories identified in all three groups. Aspects such as perceived safety on school grounds and parental stress were specific categories, highlighted in the context of asthma and CF respectively. CONCLUSION: Several general and specific factors of a qualitative nature influence the experience of children with CRD during RR. Future studies conducted in our cultural context should be conducted to confirm these results.

In patients with respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis, and asthma, an increase in crosslinking and physical entanglement of mucin polymers as well as mucus dehydration often alters and typically reduces mucus mesh network pore size, which reduces neutrophil migration, decreases pathogen capture, sustains bacterial infection, and accelerates lung function decline. Conventional aerosol particles containing hydrophobic drugs are rapidly captured and removed by MCC. Therefore, it is critical to design aerosol delivery systems with the appropriate size and surface chemistry that can improve drug retention and absorption with the goal of increased efficacy. Biodegradable muco-adhesive particles (MAPs) and muco-penetrating particles (MPPs) have been engineered to achieve effective pulmonary delivery and extend drug residence time in the lungs. MAPs can be used to target mucus as they get trapped in airway mucus by steric obstruction and/or adhesion. MPPs avoid muco-adhesion and are designed to have a particle size smaller than the mucus network, enhancing lung retention of particles as well as transport to the respiratory epithelial layer and drug absorption. In this review, we aim to provide insight into the composition of airway mucus, rheological characteristics of airway mucus in healthy and diseased subjects, the most recent techniques to study the flow dynamics and particle diffusion in airway mucus (in particular, multiple particle tracking, MPT), and the advancements in engineering MPPs that have contributed to improved airway mucus penetration, lung distribution, and retention.

High drug costs mandate a very efficient aerosol system to deliver a high payload to the airways. The I-neb Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) System is a portable, electronic, vibrating mesh nebulizer that delivers aerosol only during inhalation. It can be operated in conventional tidal breathing mode (TBM) or in target inhalation mode (TIM) that guides the patient to inhale deeply and slowly. The purposes of this in vitro study were to determine aerosol characteristics, device efficiency, and delivery time of AAT using the I-neb AAD System with TBM and TIM. METHODS: We studied the I-neb AAD System in TBM and TIM (inspiratory time 6 or 9 sec) using a breath simulator. The loaded dose was 0.5 mL AAT (50 mg/mL). Nebulized drug captured on an inspiratory filter was reported as emitted dose. Particle size was measured by laser diffraction. Predicted lung doses were calculated based on the results of a prior scintigraphy study of the I-neb AAD System. RESULTS: Particle size (VMD) for TBM and TIM was similar (4.4-4.8 microm). The emitted doses were very high and similar between modes (82-90% of loaded dose). Predicted lung dose of AAT (percent of loaded dose) and delivery times were: TBM 56.6% in 7.5 min; TIM-6 59.9% in 4.4 min; and TIM-9 64.5% in 2.5 min. CONCLUSIONS: The I-neb AAD System enhanced AAT delivery by inhalation-only aerosol generation and a low-residual dose. Predicted lung dose was high for both TBM and TIM, but longer inspiratory times with TIM reduced the administration time to one-third that of tidal breathing. We conclude that slow, deep, controlled inspirations using the I-neb AAD System is an efficient method to deliver AAT.

Without properly functioning CFTR channels, chloride does not exit respiratory epithelial cells, and consequently the mucus lining the surface of the cells becomes thick. This viscous mucus accumulates and causes abnormal function of the mucociliary apparatus, which can lead to bacterial colonization, infections with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and eventually lung damage. Recent studies have shown that the increased susceptibility to respiratory infections in CF patients may also be due to defects in neutrophil function, but the exact mechanism is uncertain. Methods: The PubMed database was searched on February 10, 2023 and again on July 23, 2023 to compile a comprehensive list of clinical and experimental studies to evaluate neutrophil function in CF. The first search included a combination of MeSH terms: "cystic fibrosis" and "neutrophils/physiology". A separate second search included a combination of the MeSH terms: "neutrophils" and "cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator". Key Content and Findings: Neutrophils from patients with CF have decreased transfer of chloride into phagolysosomes after bacterial ingestion and have dysregulated degranulation. This reduces the production of toxic oxidative radicals, especially hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and reduces bactericidal activity. CFTR potentiators correct the dysregulated degranulation in patients with CF and increased neutrophil killing activity. A reduced concentration of chloride in in vitro assays also reduces neutrophil killing activity; these observations are relevant to the reduced chloride concentrations in respiratory secretions in patients with CF. Conclusions: This literature review summarizes studies that demonstrate that an important defect in CF neutrophils lies in the oxygen-dependent pathway in phagolysosomes and studies with ivacaftor demonstrate that this drug corrects CF neutrophil function. These studies demonstrate the potential utility of using easily available neutrophils to study drug effects in CF patients.
23617606		Ex vivo characterization of particle transport in mucus secretions coating freshly excised mucosal tissues.Sustained drug delivery to mucosal surfaces has the potential to improve the effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for numerous diseases and conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, sexually transmitted diseases, cystic fibrosis, glaucoma, dry eye, and various cancers. Sustained delivery systems such as nanoparticles can be useful for mucosal delivery, but recent work suggests they must penetrate the rapidly cleared mucus barrier that overlies all mucosal epithelia to achieve uniform distribution on epithelial surfaces and enhanced residence time. Thus, it is important to evaluate the mucus-penetrating ability of nanosized delivery systems in preclinical animal studies, and for administration to humans. We describe a simple ex vivo method to visualize and quantify nanoparticle transport in mucus on fresh mucosal tissues. Using this method in murine models, we observed variations in the mucus mesh at different anatomical locations, as well as cyclical variations that may have implications for mucosal delivery.
22988559		Mucus penetrating nanoparticles: biophysical tool and method of drug and gene delivery.A method that could provide more uniform and longer-lasting drug and gene delivery to mucosal surfaces holds the potential to greatly improve the effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for numerous diseases and conditions, including sexually transmitted infections, cystic fibrosis, chronic rhinosinusitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and glaucoma to name a few. However, the body's natural defenses, including adhesive, rapidly cleared mucus linings coating nearly all entry points to the body not covered by skin, has limited the effectiveness of drug and gene delivery by nanoscale delivery systems. This article discusses the recent development of the "mucuspenetrating particle" or "MPP" nanotechnology, and how it has been used to both enhance understanding of the nanoscale barrier properties of human mucus secretions, and to achieve more uniform and longer-lasting drug delivery to mucosal tissues following topical administration. Drug loaded MPPs possess non-adhesive coatings that allow them to rapidly penetrate mucus layers through openings in the mucus mesh at rates nearly as fast as they would penetrate pure water. Critically, MPPs allow enhanced drug and gene delivery to mucosal tissues without diminishing the protective function of mucus. Recent progress in the development of MPPs as a biophysical tool to probe the length-scale dependent rheological properties of mucosal secretions and as a method for drug and gene delivery is highlighted.
32992472		Nebulizer Care and Inhalation Technique in Children with Cystic Fibrosis.Nebulizers are used by the great majority of cystic fibrosis patients for delivery of cornerstone treatments. Inhalation technique and adequate disinfection and maintenance are important for optimizing medication delivery. In this study, inhalation technique and nebulizer disinfection/maintenance were assessed in cystic fibrosis patients by direct observation in clinic and completion of a scoring sheet. A total of 108 patients were recruited. The maximum inhalation technique score was attained by 30.5% and adequate inhalation technique score by 74.08% of patients. The inhalation technique score was best with the vibrating mesh nebulizer (p = 0.038), while patient age and number of nebulized medications did not affect ITS significantly (p > 0.05). Nebulizer disinfection/maintenance score was excellent in only 31.48%. Most families kept the nebulizer clean and used appropriate disinfection method, but only half of them replaced the nebulizer and nebulizer cup at the recommended time intervals. Nebulizer disinfection/maintenance score was positively affected by a number of nebulized medications and negatively by years of equipment use (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively). Even though inhalation technique and disinfection/maintenance practices were found to be adequate in a large proportion of cases, there is still a need for regular review and education. The type of nebulizer was associated with improved inhalation technique, but more data are required before making specific recommendations.

METHODS: A systematic review of 1,435 studies was performed in adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Two different administration strategies (adjunctive and substitute) were considered clinically relevant. Inclusion was restricted to studies using jet, ultrasonic, and vibrating-mesh nebulizers. Studies involving children, colonized-but-not-infected adults, and cystic fibrosis patients were excluded. RESULTS: Five of the 11 studies included had a small sample size (fewer than 50 patients), and only 6 were randomized. Diversity of case-mix, dosage, and devices are sources of bias. Only a few patients had severe hypoxemia. Aminoglycosides and colistin were the most common antibiotics, being safe regarding nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, but increased respiratory complications in 9% (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; I = 52%), particularly when administered to hypoxemic patients. For tracheobronchitis, a significant decrease in emergence of resistance was evidenced (risk ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.64; I = 0%). Similar findings were observed in pneumonia by susceptible pathogens, without improvement in mortality or ventilation duration. In pneumonia caused by resistant pathogens, higher clinical resolution (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.96; I = 0%) was evidenced. These findings were not consistently evidenced in the assessment of efficacy against pneumonia caused by susceptible pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Performance of randomized trials evaluating the impact of nebulized antibiotics with more homogeneous populations, standardized drug delivery, predetermined clinical efficacy, and safety outcomes is urgently required. Infections by resistant pathogens might potentially have higher benefit from nebulized antiinfective agents. Nebulization, without concomitant systemic administration of the drug, may reduce nephrotoxicity but may also be associated with higher risk of respiratory complications.

Textbooks and reviews only marginally address the homeostasis of magnesium in cystic fibrosis. METHODS: We performed a search of the Medical Subject Headings terms (cystic fibrosis OR mucoviscidosis) AND (magnesium OR hypomagnes[a]emia) in the US National Library of Medicine and Excerpta Medica databases. RESULTS: We identified 25 reports dealing with magnesium and cystic fibrosis. The results of the review may be summarized as follows. First, hypomagnesemia affects more than half of the cystic fibrosis patients with advanced disease; second, magnesemia, which is normally age-independent, relevantly decreases with age in cystic fibrosis; third, aminoglycoside antimicrobials frequently induce both acute and chronic renal magnesium-wasting; fourth, sweat magnesium concentration was normal in cystic fibrosis patients; fifth, limited data suggest the existence of an impaired intestinal magnesium balance. Finally, stimulating observations suggest that magnesium supplements might achieve an improvement in respiratory muscle strength and mucolytic activity of both recombinant and endogenous deoxyribonuclease. CONCLUSIONS: The first comprehensive review of the literature confirms that, despite being one of the most prevalent minerals in the body, the importance of magnesium in cystic fibrosis is largely overlooked. In these patients, hypomagnesemia should be sought once a year. Furthermore, the potential of supplementation with this cation deserves more attention.

The stiff mucus in these patients represents a compartment, which cannot easily be reached by systemic treatment. While bacterial infections are now successfully treated with repeated inhalation of antibiotics such as tobramycine, 57% of CF patients are colonized by Aspergillus species. About 10-20% of colonized patients develop symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). While current standard of treatment of ABPA in CF patients is to suppress the allergy related symptoms by administration of glucocorticoids, itraconazole (ITRA), administered orally at high doses, can alleviate the symptoms of ABPA. However, no inhalable formulation of ITRA is available to enable local treatment of aspergillosis. The aim of this study was to describe an aqueous nanosuspension of ITRA and to characterize the pharmacokinetics after single dose inhalation. Using wet-milling with organic milling beads, a stable nanosuspension with particle size in the range of 200nm and an ITRA concentration of 20% (v/w) could be obtained, using polysorbate 80 at a concentration of 14% relative to ITRA. The suspension was stable if stored at 8 C for 3 months without particle growth and could be nebulized using standard nebulizer technologies including mesh technology and pressured air nebulizers. A 10% suspension was well tolerated upon repeated dose inhalation once daily for 7 days at a predicted dose of 45mg/kg in rats. A single dose inhalation at a predicted dose of 22.5mg/kg resulted in maximum lung tissue concentration of 21.4mug/g tissue with a terminal half-life of 25.4h. Serum concentrations were lower, with a maximum concentration of 104ng/ml at 4h after dosing and a terminal half-life of 10.5h. The data indicate that ITRA nanosuspension represents an interesting formulation for inhaled administration in CF patients suffering from ABPA. High and long lasting lung tissue concentrations well above the minimal inhibitory concentration of Aspergillus species enable once daily administration with minimal systemic exposure.
