Long-term treatment is defined as >=1 year or >=50 sessions. To be eligible studies must include a standardised outcome measure of symptoms (global or disorder specific) with at least one proof of reliability. The primary outcome is symptom reduction (global or specific), secondary outcome criteria are reliable change, remission, functional capacities, personality, personality functioning and interpersonal pathology. Relevant studies will mainly be identified by searching relevant databases: PubMed, PsycINFO (via EBSCO), Web of Science (via Elsevier), Chochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Wiley). Risk of bias will be evaluated in line with the Cochrane assessments tools for quasi-experimental trials and RCTs, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Aggregation of data from primary trials collected based on ethics votes. Dissemination into clinical practice via open access publications of findings.

In this context, we discuss a novel biomarker, the \"split ADC sign,\" where the cerebral cortex demonstrates restricted diffusion (high DWI signal and low ADC) and the underlying white matter demonstrates facilitated diffusion (high or low DWI signal and high ADC). We hypothesize that this sign can be used as a biomarker to suggest either acute encephalitis onset or to raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-text radiological information system search of radiological reports was performed for all entities known to produce restricted diffusion in the cortex excluding stroke between January 2012 and June 2022. Initial MRI studies performed upon onset of clinical symptoms were screened for the split ADC sign. RESULTS: 25 subjects were encountered with a positive split ADC sign (15 female; median age = 57 years, range 18-82). Diagnosis included six herpes simplex encephalitis, three peri-ictal MRI changes, eight PRES, two MELAS, and six autoimmune (3 anti-GABAAR, two seronegative, and one anti-Ma2/Ta). Subjects were imaged at a mean 1.8 days after the onset of symptoms (range 0-8). DISCUSSION: We present a novel visual MRI biomarker, the split ADC sign, and highlight its potential usefulness in subjects with encephalopathy to suggest acute disease onset or to raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology when location-based criteria are applied. When positive, the sign was present on the initial MRI and can therefore be used to help focus further clinical and laboratory workup.",
