PATIENT CONCERNS: This report chronicles the experiences of a 14-year-old female patient who underwent multiple misdiagnoses before the eventual identification of diseaseD017241. Her journey began with symptoms that included diseaseD006130, diseaseD002312, and diseaseD004827. DIAGNOSIS: The definitive diagnosis of diseaseD017241 was established through genetic confirmation, revealing a mutation in the ncbi4567 gene (variant#4567#). INTERVENTIONS: Upon diagnosis, the patient received targeted symptomatic treatment, which led to pronounced improvements in her symptoms. OUTCOMES: The patient's condition stabilized with the administered treatments, and she exhibited significant symptom relief, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. LESSONS: This case underscores the imperative for heightened clinical vigilance and thorough differential diagnosis in the face of complex clinical presentations, such as those seen in diseaseD017241, to ensure timely and appropriate interventions.
37698258		Coating-Free Culture Medium for Establishing and Maintaining Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.Cell expansion of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) commonly depends on Matrigel as a coating matrix on two-dimensional (2D) culture plates and 3D microcarriers. However, the xenogenic Matrigel requires sophisticated quality-assurance processes to meet clinical requirements. In this study, we develop an innovative coating-free medium for expanding hPSCs. The xenofree medium supports the weekend-free culture and competitive growth of hPSCs on several cell culture plastics without an additional pre-coating process. The pluripotent stemness of the expanded cells is stably sustained for more than 10 passages, featured with high pluripotent marker expressions, normal karyotyping, and differentiating capacity for three germ layers. The expression levels of some integrins are reduced, compared with those of the hPSCs on Matrigel. This medium also successfully supports the clonal expansion and induced pluripotent stem cell establishment from diseaseD017241 (diseaseD017237, diseaseD000140, and diseaseD020521-like episodes) patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This innovative hPSC medium provides a straightforward scale-up process for producing clinical-orientated hPSCs by excluding the conventional coating procedure.

38146643		The split apparent diffusion coefficient sign: A novel magnetic resonance imaging biomarker for cortical pathology with possible implications in diseaseD020274.INTRODUCTION: MRI is the imaging modality of choice for assessing 9606 with diseaseD001927. In this context, we discuss a novel biomarker, the "split ADC sign," where the cerebral cortex demonstrates restricted diffusion (high DWI signal and low ADC) and the underlying white matter demonstrates facilitated diffusion (high or low DWI signal and high ADC). We hypothesize that this sign can be used as a biomarker to suggest either acute diseaseD004660 onset or to raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-text radiological information system search of radiological reports was performed for all entities known to produce restricted diffusion in the cortex excluding diseaseD020521 between January 2012 and June 2022. Initial MRI studies performed upon onset of clinical symptoms were screened for the split ADC sign. RESULTS: 25 subjects were encountered with a positive split ADC sign (15 female; median age = 57 years, range 18-82). Diagnosis included six diseaseD020803, three peri-ictal MRI changes, eight PRES, two diseaseD017241, and six autoimmune (3 anti-GABAAR, two seronegative, and one anti-ncbi10687/Ta). Subjects were imaged at a mean 1.8 days after the onset of symptoms (range 0-8). DISCUSSION: We present a novel visual MRI biomarker, the split ADC sign, and highlight its potential usefulness in subjects with diseaseD001927 to suggest acute disease onset or to raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology when location-based criteria are applied. When positive, the sign was present on the initial MRI and can therefore be used to help focus further clinical and laboratory workup.
36905963		Genetic aberration analysis of mitochondrial respiratory complex I implications in the development of diseaseD009461 and their clinical significance.Growing diseaseD020271 pose difficult challenges for modern medicine to diagnose and manage them effectively. Many diseaseD009461 mainly occur due to genetic alteration in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, mitochondrial genes exhibit a higher rate of mutation due to the generation of chemicalD017382 (chemicalD017382) during oxidative phosphorylation operating in their vicinity. Among the different complexes of Electron transport chain (ETC), NADH: Ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Mitochondrial complex I) is the most important. This multimeric enzyme, composed of 44 subunits, is encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. It often exhibits mutations resulting in development of various diseaseD020271. The most prominent diseases include diseaseD007888 (diseaseD007888), diseaseD029242 (diseaseD029242), diseaseD017241 (diseaseD017241), diseaseD017243 (diseaseD017243), diseaseD010300 (diseaseD010300) and, diseaseD000544 (diseaseD000544). Preliminary data suggest that mitochondrial complex I subunit genes mutated are frequently of nuclear origin; however, most of the mtDNA gene encoding subunits are also primarily involved. In this review, we have discussed the genetic origins of diseaseD009461 involving mitochondrial complex I and signified recent approaches to unravel the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials and their management.
37474167		Efficacy of high-intensity versus low-intensity psychoanalytically oriented long-term treatments and determinants of outcome: individual participant data Meta-analysis of Long-term Analytic treatment Studies (MeLAS).INTRODUCTION: Long-term psychodynamic/psychoanalytic psychotherapy (LTPP) is a prevalent treatment option for complex diseaseD001523. Yet, little is known about the role of treatment intensity in LTPP. We present a study protocol for a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis aggregating and analysing individual data from randomised and quasi-experimental trials by meta-analysis. The purpose is to (1) determine the treatment effectiveness of LTPP with low versus high intensity (up to 2 weekly sessions vs three or more), (2) compare their joint effectiveness to shorter therapies and treatments as usual, (3) identify predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes and (4) determine reciprocal relationships between different outcome domains (symptomatic and structural/personality change) over the courses of LTPP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We include studies from (randomised controlled trial, RCT) and quasi-experimental trials, where at least one condition was LTPP of high or low frequency. Long-term treatment is defined as >=1 year or >=50 sessions. To be eligible studies must include a standardised outcome measure of symptoms (global or disorder specific) with at least one proof of reliability. The primary outcome is symptom reduction (global or specific), secondary outcome criteria are reliable change, remission, functional capacities, personality, personality functioning and interpersonal pathology. Relevant studies will mainly be identified by searching relevant databases: PubMed, PsycINFO (via EBSCO), Web of Science (via Elsevier), Chochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Wiley). Risk of bias will be evaluated in line with the Cochrane assessments tools for quasi-experimental trials and RCTs, respectively. diseaseD009103: Aggregation of data from primary trials collected based on ethics votes.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical, myopathological and brain MRI features of 9606 with diseaseD017241 caused by mt-diseaseC537849 variants (diseaseD017241-mtND) were collected and compared with those of diseaseD017241 9606 carrying the variant#1351# variant (diseaseD017241-variant#1351#g.3243A>G). RESULT: A total of 18 diseaseD017241-mtND 9606 (female: 7; median age: 24.5 years) represented 15.9% (n = 113) of all 9606 with diseaseD017241 caused by mtDNA variants in our neuromuscular center from January 2012 to June 2022. In this diseaseD017241-mtND cohort, the two most common variants were m.10191 T > C (4/18, 22.2%) and m.13513 G > A (3/18, 16.7%). The most frequent symptoms were diseaseD012640 (14/18, 77.8%) and diseaseD018908 (11/18, 61.1%). Compared with 87 diseaseD017241-variant#1351#g.3243A>G 9606, diseaseD017241-mtND 9606 were significantly more likely to have a variant that was absent in blood cells (40% vs. 1.4%). Furthermore, diseaseD017241-mtND 9606 had a significantly lower MDC score (7.8 +- 2.7 vs. 9.8 +- 1.9); less diseaseD034381 (27.8% vs. 54.0%), diseaseD003920 (11.1% vs. 37.9%), and diseaseD008881 (33.3% vs. 62.1%); less diseaseD006130 (males <= 165 cm; females <= 155 cm; 23.1% vs. 60.8%) and higher body mass index (20.4 +- 2.5 vs. 17.8 +- 2.7). diseaseD017241-mtND 9606 had significantly more normal muscle pathology (31.3% vs. 4.1%) and fewer RRFs/RBFs (62.5% vs. 91.9%), ncbi1351-deficient fibers/blue fibers (25.0% vs. 85.1%) and SSVs (50.0% vs. 81.1%). Moreover, brain MRI evaluated at the first diseaseD020521-like episode showed significantly more small diseaseD054220 in diseaseD017241-mtND 9606 (66.7% vs. 12.2%). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggested that diseaseD017241-mtND 9606 have distinct clinical, myopathological and brain MRI features compared with diseaseD017241variant#1351#g.3243A>G 9606.
