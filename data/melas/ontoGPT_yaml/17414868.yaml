input_text: 'Ocular motor disorders in mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acid
  and stroke-like episodes with the 3271 (T-C) point mutation in mitochondrial DNA.BACKGROUND:
  Ocular motor function can provide insights into areas of dysfunction within the
  nervous system. There are no published eye movement recordings in patients with
  mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acid and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).
  Our purpose in this study was to analyze the ocular motor features of a family with
  MELAS with a (T-C) mutation at nucleotide position 3271 in the mitochondrial tRNA-Leu
  gene. METHODS: The search coil method was used to record visually-guided saccades,
  antisaccades, and triangular pursuit tasks in the horizontal and vertical planes
  in three patients in a Japanese family with MELAS. RESULTS: The patients showed
  saccadic dysmetria and prolonged saccadic reaction times, deficits in the ability
  to suppress reflex eye movements, and increased reaction time during antisaccades,
  downbeat nystagmus, square wave jerks, and impairment in pursuit. CONCLUSIONS: On
  the basis of eye movement recordings, patients with MELAS have frontal cortex as
  well as cerebellar dysfunction.'
