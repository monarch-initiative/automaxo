input_text: Clinical spectrum and prognostic factors of acute necrotizing encephalopathy
  in children.This study was conducted to investigate the etiology, the clinical characteristics
  and prognosis of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) in Korean children. Six
  children (1 yr to 7 yr) patients with ANE were enrolled. They were diagnosed by
  clinical and radiological characteristics and their clinical data were retrospectively
  analyzed. In a search of clinically plausible causes, brain MRI in all patients,
  mitochondrial DNA studies for mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis,
  and strokelike episodes (MELAS) and myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF)
  in four patients, and genomic typing on HLA DRB/HLA DQB genes in three patients
  were performed. All had precedent illnesses and the main initial symptoms included
  mental change (83%), seizures (50%), and focal deficits (50%). MRI revealed increased
  T2 signal density in the bilateral thalami and/or the brainstem in all patients.
  Mitochodrial DNA studies for MELAS and MERRF were negative in those children and
  HLA-DRB1*1401, HLA-DRB3*0202, and HLA-DQB1*0502 seemed to be significant. A high
  dose steroid was given to all patients, which seemed to be partly effective except
  for 2 patients. In conclusion, ANE is relatively rare, but can result in serious
  neurological complication in children. Early detection and appropriate treatment
  may lead to a better neurological outcome.
