input_text: Heteroplasmic segregation associated with trisomy-9 in cultured human
  cells. In cybrid cells carrying the mitochondrial A3243G MELAS mutation, which were
  also heteroplasmic for the G12300A suppressor mutation, we observed a transient
  episode of heteroplasmic instability, resulting in a wide diversification in G12300A
  heteroplasmy levels and a shift in the average heteroplasmy level from 11 to 29%.
  These cells were found to be trisomic for chromosome 9, whereas a minority of cells
  that retained disomy-9 showed no instability. Coculture experiments implied that
  trisomy-9 cells exhibited a significant growth advantage, but neither heteroplasmy
  levels, respiratory phenotype nor trisomy-9 itself had direct selective value under
  standard culture conditions. Mitochondrial nucleoid number was the same (50-100)
  in cells that had or had not experienced transient heteroplasmic instability, but
  1-2 orders of magnitude less than the segregation number in such cells. These findings
  support the idea that mtDNA partition is under nuclear genetic control, and implicate
  a locus on chromosome 9 in this regulation.
