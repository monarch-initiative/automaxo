input_text: Movement disorders in mitochondrial diseases.Mitochondrial diseases (MIDs)
  are a large group of heterogeneous disorders due to mutations in either mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA) genes, the latter encoding proteins involved in
  mitochondrial function. A multisystem clinical picture that involves several organs,
  including both the peripheral and central nervous systems, is a common presentation
  of MID. Movement disorders, even isolated ones, are not rare. Cerebellar ataxia
  is common in myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERFF) due to mutations
  in the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) lysine gene, in Kearns-Sayre syndrome due
  to mtDNA deletions, in sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia
  (SANDO) due to nuclear POLG1 gene mutations, and also in ARCA2, Friedreich's ataxia,
  SPG7, SCA28 and autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS)
  due to mutations in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial morphology or function.
  Myoclonus is a key feature of MERFF, but may also be encountered in mitochondrial
  encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), ARCA2, POLG1
  mutations and Leigh syndrome. Dystonia is common in Leigh syndrome (which may be
  caused by 75 different genes) and in Leber hereditary ocular neuropathy (LHON) plus
  disease, due to mutations in mtDNA genes that encode subunits of NADH dehydrogenase,
  as well as in ARCA2, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), mitochondrial
  membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MPAN) and POLG1 mutations. Other
  movement disorders are rarer (such as parkinsonism, tremor, chorea). Although parkinsonism
  is more frequent in POLG1 mutations, and myoclonus in MERFF, most movement disorders
  are found either isolated or combined in numerous MIDs. The presence of associated
  neurological signs, whether central or peripheral, or of evocative magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) abnormalities (striatal necrosis) should prompt a search for MID.
  In cases of a particular clinical spectrum (LHON, MERFF, Kearns-Sayre, SANDO, SPG7,
  ARCA2, ARSACS), a search for the most frequently implicated mutation(s) is recommended.
  In other cases, muscle biopsies followed by metabolic and genetic studies may be
  useful for arriving at a diagnosis.
