input_text: Characteristics of stroke-like lesions on cerebral imaging.<p><strong>Objective</strong>
  &ndash; Stroke-like lesions (SLLs) are pathognomonic for mitochondrial ence&shy;pha&shy;lopathy,
  lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome but occur in other mitochondrial
  and non-mitochondrial disorders as well. This mini-review aims at summarising and
  discussing recent findings to open up future perspectives how to manage this fleeting
  phenomenon.<br><strong>Results </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Typically, SLLs
  are dynamic lesions, which increase in size and intensity to regress after a nadir.
  SLLs are incongruent with a vascular territory, originate frequently from the cortex
  to spread subcortically, can be monofocal or multifocal, run through an acute (attack)
  and chronic (remission) stage, and may either completely disappear or end up as
  laminar cortical necrosis, white matter lesion, subcortical atrophy, cyst, or the
  toenail sign. On cerebral CT, SLLs are hypodense. SLLs can be best visualized on
  multimodal MRI showing up as hyperintensity on T2, FLAIR, DWI, and PWI, and as hypointensity
  on OEF-MRI. On MR-spectroscopy, SLLs typically present with a decreased N-acetyl-aspartate
  peak and an increased lactate peak. DTI in acute SLLs reveals reduced connectivity,
  increased global efficiency, and reduced focal efficiency. Tc-HMPAO SPECT of SLLs
  indicates hyperperfusion and L-iomazenil SPECT reduced tracer uptake. FDG-PET typically
  shows hypometabolism within a SLL.<br><strong>Conclusion</strong> &ndash; SLLs present
  with typical findings on various imaging modalities but the combination of cerebral
  CT, multimodal MRI, MRS, and PET clearly delineate a SLL from other acute or chronic
  cerebral lesions.&nbsp;</p>.
