input_text: 'Autometallographic tracing of mercury in pilot whale tissues in the Faroe
  Islands.OBJECTIVES: Autometallography (AMG) was applied for tracing mercury in long-finned
  pilot whales (Globicephala melas) harvested in the Faroe Islands. RESULTS: Ample
  mercury accumulation was found in kidney tubules, in contrast to the largely unstained
  glomeruli. Hepatocytes, as well as liver macrophages, exhibited high mercury uptake.
  The muscle tissue accumulated only scant amounts of mercury, primarily around the
  nuclei of the striated muscle cells. At the ultrastructural level, mercury was found
  to accumulate intracellularly in lysosomes, and extracellularly in the basement
  membranes of vessels. The results were verified by proton induced X-ray emission
  (PIXE) analysis, and it was established that the tissue contained no other AMG traceable
  metals. CONCLUSION: The use of AMG analysis on autopsies and biopsies is suggested
  as a tool for evaluating mercury pollution.'
