input_text: Evolution of brain imaging abnormalities in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy
  with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. An 18-year-old man developed consecutive
  homonymous hemianopias that were eventually attributed to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy
  with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The diagnosis was initially
  suspected when brain CT scans showed bilateral dystrophic basal ganglia calcifications
  and MR spectroscopy later showed a prominent lactate peak. Diffusion-weighted MRI
  showed progressive evolution of restricted proton diffusion at the margins of the
  lesion from day 3 through 3 weeks. Genetic testing from peripheral blood confirmed
  an A3243G transition in the patient's MTTL1 gene encoding the transfer RNA for leucine.
  The patient's visual function improved, but severe atrophy of gray and white matter
  was visible on MRI.
