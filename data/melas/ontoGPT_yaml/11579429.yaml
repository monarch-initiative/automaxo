input_text: "Mitochondrial disorders: genetics, counseling, prenatal diagnosis and
  reproductive options. Most patients with mitochondrial disorders are diagnosed by
  finding a respiratory chain enzyme defect or a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA
  (mtDNA). The provision of accurate genetic counseling and reproductive options to
  these families is complicated by the unique genetic features of mtDNA that distinguish
  it from Mendelian genetics. These include maternal inheritance, heteroplasmy, the
  threshold effect, the mitochondrial bottleneck, tissue variation, and selection.
  Although we still have much to learn about mtDNA genetics, it is now possible to
  provide useful guidance to families with an mtDNA mutation or a respiratory chain
  enzyme defect. We describe a range of current reproductive options that may be considered
  for prevention of transmission of mtDNA mutations, including the use of donor oocytes,
  prenatal diagnosis (by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis), and preimplantation
  genetic diagnosis, plus possible future options such as nuclear transfer and cytoplasmic
  transfer. For common mtDNA mutations associated with mitochondrial cytopathies (such
  as NARP, Leigh Disease, MELAS, MERRF, Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, CPEO,
  Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and Pearson syndrome), we summarize the available data on
  recurrence risk and discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of reproductive
  options."
