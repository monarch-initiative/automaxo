input_text: Crossed cerebellar hyperperfusion after MELAS attack followed up by whole
  brain continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging. Crossed cerebellar hyperperfusion
  (CCH) is detected in patients with epilepsy by brain perfusion studies including
  single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography. In
  addition, brain perfusion can be studied with arterial spin labeling (ASL), which
  is a non-invasive MRI perfusion method that quantitatively measures cerebral blood
  flow per unit tissue mass. We followed up a 47-year-old patient with mitochondrial
  myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) by continuous
  arterial spin labeling technique, which showed crossed cerebellar hyperperfusion
  after acute stroke-like episode. This cerebellar hyperperfusion normalized in the
  follow-up.
