input_text: 'Differential diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis
  and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and ischemic stroke using 3D pseudocontinuous arterial
  spin labeling.PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of 3D pseudocontinuous arterial
  spin labeling (3D pCASL) in the differential diagnosis between mitochondrial encephalopathy
  with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and acute ischemic stroke
  (AIS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including
  T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 3D pCASL
  perfusion data were obtained on a 3.0T MR scanner in 16 newly appearing lesions
  in nine patients with MELAS and 14 acute lesions in 12 patients with AIS. A postlabeling
  delay (PLD) time of 2025 msec was applied. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) values
  were measured in the central part and the peripheral part of the lesions and the
  CBF values were compared between MELAS and AIS patients. RESULTS: The lesions of
  both MELAS and AIS showed high signal intensity on T2 WI and demonstrated hyperintensity
  on DWI. Compared with the perfusion defects or hypoperfusion in all AIS, hyperperfusion
  was revealed in 16 acute MELAS lesions, especially in the peripheral part of the
  lesions. The CBF values of 16 lesions in MELAS were 11.20-73.11 ml/100g/min in the
  central part and 65.33-169.11 ml/100g/min in the peripheral part. The CBF values
  of 14 lesions in AIS were 12.32-19.94 ml/100g/min in the central part and 11.66-18.37
  ml/100g/min in the peripheral part. The CBF value of the peripheral part (119.80
  +- 35.41) in MELAS was significantly higher than that (14.66 +- 2.61) in AIS (P
  = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The whole-brain 3D pCASL technique might be useful in differentiating
  MELAS from AIS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2017;45:199-206.'
