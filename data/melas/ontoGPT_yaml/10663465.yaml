input_text: Increased cerebral blood flow in MELAS shown by Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT.
  We report cerebral SPECT studies on two siblings with the syndrome of mitochondrial
  myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Tc-99m
  HMPAO brain SPECT was performed 8, 19 and 30 days after a stroke-like episode in
  one case and 10 days after a stroke-like episode, 6 h after a partial seizure and
  as a follow-up study in the other. Increased blood flow was seen in both these patients
  with stroke-like episodes due to MELAS. The cause of the increased blood flow is
  uncertain, but it may be related to the decreased pH created by local increase in
  lactic acid.
