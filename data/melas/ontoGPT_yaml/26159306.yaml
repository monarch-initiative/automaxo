input_text: 'MitoTALEN: A General Approach to Reduce Mutant mtDNA Loads and Restore
  Oxidative Phosphorylation Function in Mitochondrial Diseases.We have designed mitochondrially
  targeted transcription activator-like effector nucleases or mitoTALENs to cleave
  specific sequences in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with the goal of eliminating
  mtDNA carrying pathogenic point mutations. To test the generality of the approach,
  we designed mitoTALENs to target two relatively common pathogenic mtDNA point mutations
  associated with mitochondrial diseases: the m.8344A>G tRNA(Lys) gene mutation associated
  with myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) and the m.13513G>A ND5 mutation
  associated with MELAS/Leigh syndrome. Transmitochondrial cybrid cells harbouring
  the respective heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations were transfected with the respective
  mitoTALEN and analyzed after different time periods. MitoTALENs efficiently reduced
  the levels of the targeted pathogenic mtDNAs in the respective cell lines. Functional
  assays showed that cells with heteroplasmic mutant mtDNA were able to recover respiratory
  capacity and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes activity after transfection with
  the mitoTALEN. To improve the design in the context of the low complexity of mtDNA,
  we designed shorter versions of the mitoTALEN specific for the MERRF m.8344A>G mutation.
  These shorter mitoTALENs also eliminated the mutant mtDNA. These reductions in size
  will improve our ability to package these large sequences into viral vectors, bringing
  the use of these genetic tools closer to clinical trials. '
