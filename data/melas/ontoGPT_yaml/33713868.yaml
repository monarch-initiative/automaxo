input_text: 'Vessel flow void sign and hyperintense vessel sign on FLAIR images distinguish
  between MELAS and AIS.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and
  specificity of the vessel signs, including the Vessel Flow Void Sign (VFVS) and
  the Hyperintense Vessel Sign (HVS) in Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)
  images during the differentiation of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis,
  and Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS) in Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS). METHODS: Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of 13 MELAS and 20 AIS patients were obtained during
  the acute stage of the diseases (median time to scan <1 day from symptom onset).
  To evaluate VFVS and HVS on the FLAIR images, Logistic Regression was used to analyze
  their correlation with MELAS. Then, a new scale of scoring, involving two aspects
  (VFVS and HVS) on FLAIR images was established. Receiver operating characteristic
  (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the efficacy of the developed criterion. RESULTS:
  FLAIR images from 12 of the 13 MELAS patients exhibited VFVS while none exhibited
  HVS. Moreover, FLAIR images from 3 of the 20 AIS patients exhibited VFVS while 17
  exhibited HVS. Logistic Regression showed that VFVS and the absence of HVS (NoHVS)
  were independent MELAS predictors. If there were VFVS, the patient scored 2 points,
  while there were NoHVS, the patient scored 1 point. Patients with >1.5 scores were
  prone to be MELAS, while patients with <1.5 scores were prone to be AIS. Sensitivity
  was found to be 92.3%, specificity was 85%, with an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: We
  have established a new scoring criterion, with a high sensitivity and specificity,
  for differentiating between MELAS and AIS in patients during the acute stage.'
