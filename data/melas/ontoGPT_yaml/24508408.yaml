input_text: 'Adrenal insufficiency in a child with MELAS syndrome. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy,
  lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are established subgroups of mitochondrial
  encephalomyopathy. m.3243A>G a common point mutation is detected in tRNA in majority
  of patients with MELAS phenotype whereas m.8344A>G point mutation in tRNA is observed,
  in MERRF phenotype. Adrenal insufficiency has not been reported in mitochondrial
  disease, except in Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS), which is a mitochondrial deletion
  syndrome. We report an unusual presentation in a five year old boy who presented
  with clinical phenotype of MELAS and was found to have m.8344A>G mutation in tRNA.
  Addison disease was identified due to hyperpigmentation of lips and gums present
  from early childhood. This is the first report describing adrenal insufficiency
  in a child with MELAS phenotype. '
