input_text: 'The split apparent diffusion coefficient sign: A novel magnetic resonance
  imaging biomarker for cortical pathology with possible implications in autoimmune
  encephalitis.INTRODUCTION: MRI is the imaging modality of choice for assessing patients
  with encephalopathy. In this context, we discuss a novel biomarker, the "split ADC
  sign," where the cerebral cortex demonstrates restricted diffusion (high DWI signal
  and low ADC) and the underlying white matter demonstrates facilitated diffusion
  (high or low DWI signal and high ADC). We hypothesize that this sign can be used
  as a biomarker to suggest either acute encephalitis onset or to raise the possibility
  of an autoimmune etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-text radiological information
  system search of radiological reports was performed for all entities known to produce
  restricted diffusion in the cortex excluding stroke between January 2012 and June
  2022. Initial MRI studies performed upon onset of clinical symptoms were screened
  for the split ADC sign. RESULTS: 25 subjects were encountered with a positive split
  ADC sign (15 female; median age = 57 years, range 18-82). Diagnosis included six
  herpes simplex encephalitis, three peri-ictal MRI changes, eight PRES, two MELAS,
  and six autoimmune (3 anti-GABAAR, two seronegative, and one anti-Ma2/Ta). Subjects
  were imaged at a mean 1.8 days after the onset of symptoms (range 0-8). DISCUSSION:
  We present a novel visual MRI biomarker, the split ADC sign, and highlight its potential
  usefulness in subjects with encephalopathy to suggest acute disease onset or to
  raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology when location-based criteria are
  applied. When positive, the sign was present on the initial MRI and can therefore
  be used to help focus further clinical and laboratory workup.'
