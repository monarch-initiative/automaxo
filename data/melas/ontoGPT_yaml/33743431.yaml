input_text: Synchrotron X-ray phase contrast micro tomography to explore the morphology
  of abdominal organs in Pterostichus melas italicus Dejean, 1828 (Coleoptera, Carabidae).Micro-computer
  tomography imaging is a fast and non-destructive data acquisition technique which
  can replace or complement the traditional investigation methodologies used in entomology
  to study morphology. In this paper, Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Phase-Contrast micro
  tomography (SR-PhC micro-CT) was combined with histology and scanning electron microscopy
  (SEM) observations to describe the abdominal organs of Pterostichus melas italicus
  Dejean, 1828 (Coleoptera, Carabidae). This species was used as a representative
  model because of its ecological role as a generalist predator in agroecosystems.
  SR-PhC micro-CT allowed us to identify in situ abdominal structures including dorsal
  vessel, digestive tract with Malpighian tubules, male reproductive system, ganglia,
  fat bodies, pygidial glands, muscles and tracheae. The histology was performed to
  define the tissue organization of the digestive and reproductive systems. SR-PhC
  micro-CT and 3D rendering provided more accurate information on shape and size of
  organs than histological and SEM analyses, respectively. The finding of this study
  was to describe the anatomy and histology of organs involved in crucial life history
  traits, such as reproduction, nutrition and excretion. High quality images and the
  supplementary video represent a significant advance in knowledge of the carabid
  anatomy and are a baseline for future research.
