input_text: "Humanin detected in skeletal muscles of MELAS patients: a possible new
  therapeutic agent.Humanin (HN) was originally identified as an endogenous peptide
  that protects neuronal cells from apoptosis induced by various types of Alzheimer's
  disease-related insults. We have previously indicated that HN increases cellular
  ATP levels and speculated that this peptide may rescue energy-deficient cells in
  mitochondrial disorders. Here, we report, for the first time, increased HN expression
  in skeletal muscles from patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic
  acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). HN was strongly positive in all ragged-red
  fibers (RRFs) and some non-RRFs, and most of them were type 1 fibers generally requiring
  higher energy than type 2 fibers. HN in these fibers was localized in mitochondria.
  HN expression was also increased in small arteries that strongly reacted for succinate
  dehydrogenase. Our experiments on muscular TE671 cells indicated the possibility
  that synthesized HN increases cellular ATP levels by directly acting on mitochondria.
  From these in vivo and in vitro findings, we propose that HN expression might be
  induced in response to the energy crisis within affected fibers and vessels in MELAS
  muscles and further be a possible therapeutic candidate for MELAS."
