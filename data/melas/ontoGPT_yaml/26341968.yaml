input_text: 'Magnetic resonance imaging correlates of genetically characterized patients
  with mitochondrial disorders: A study from south India.BACKGROUND: Large studies
  analyzing magnetic resonance imaging correlates in different genotypes of mitochondrial
  disorders are far and few. This study sought to analyze the pattern of magnetic
  resonance imaging findings in a cohort of genetically characterized patients with
  mitochondrial disorders. METHODS: The study cohort included 33 patients (age range
  18 months-50 years, M:F - 0.9:1) with definite mitochondrial disorders seen over
  a period of 8 yrs. (2006-2013). Their MR imaging findings were analyzed retrospectively.
  RESULTS: The patients were classified into three groups according to the genotype,
  Mitochondrial point mutations and deletions (n=21), SURF1 mutations (n=7) and POLG1
  (n=5). The major findings included cerebellar atrophy (51.4%), cerebral atrophy
  (24.2%), signal changes in basal ganglia (45.7%), brainstem (34.2%) & white matter
  (18.1%) and stroke like lesions (25.7%). Spinal cord imaging showed signal changes
  in 4/6 patients. Analysis of the special sequences revealed, basal ganglia mineralization
  (7/22), lactate peak on magnetic resonance spectrometry (10/15), and diffusion restriction
  (6/22). Follow-up images in six patients showed that the findings are dynamic. Comparison
  of the magnetic resonance imaging findings in the three groups showed that cerebral
  atrophy and cerebellar atrophy, cortical signal changes and basal ganglia mineralization
  were seen mostly in patients with mitochondrial mutation. Brainstem signal changes
  with or without striatal lesions were characteristically noted in SURF1 group. There
  was no consistent imaging pattern in POLG1 group. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance
  imaging findings in mitochondrial disorders are heterogeneous. Definite differences
  were noted in the frequency of anatomical involvement in the three groups. Familiarity
  with the imaging findings in different genotypes of mitochondrial disorders along
  with careful analysis of the family history, clinical presentation, biochemical
  findings, histochemical and structural analysis will help the physician for targeted
  metabolic and genetic testing.'
