input_text: 'Mitochondrial Strokes: Diagnostic Challenges and Chameleons. Mitochondrial
  stroke-like episodes (SLEs) are a hallmark of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic
  acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). They should be suspected in anyone with
  an acute/subacute onset of focal neurological symptoms at any age and are usually
  driven by seizures. Suggestive features of an underlying mitochondrial pathology
  include evolving MRI lesions, often originating within the posterior brain regions,
  the presence of multisystemic involvement, including diabetes, deafness, or cardiomyopathy,
  and a positive family history. The diagnosis of MELAS has important implications
  for those affected and their relatives, given it enables early initiation of appropriate
  treatment and genetic counselling. However, the diagnosis is frequently challenging,
  particularly during the acute phase of an event. We describe four cases of mitochondrial
  strokes to highlight the considerable overlap that exists with other neurological
  disorders, including viral and autoimmune encephalitis, ischemic stroke, and central
  nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, and discuss the clinical, laboratory, and imaging
  features that can help distinguish MELAS from these differential diagnoses.'
