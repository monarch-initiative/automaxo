input_text: "Genetic aberration analysis of mitochondrial respiratory complex I implications
  in the development of neurological disorders and their clinical significance.Growing
  neurological diseases pose difficult challenges for modern medicine to diagnose
  and manage them effectively. Many neurological disorders mainly occur due to genetic
  alteration in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, mitochondrial genes
  exhibit a higher rate of mutation due to the generation of Reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) during oxidative phosphorylation operating in their vicinity. Among the different
  complexes of Electron transport chain (ETC), NADH: Ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Mitochondrial
  complex I) is the most important. This multimeric enzyme, composed of 44 subunits,
  is encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. It often exhibits mutations
  resulting in development of various neurological diseases. The most prominent diseases
  include leigh syndrome (LS), leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial
  encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), myoclonic
  epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), idiopathic Parkinson's disease
  (PD) and, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preliminary data suggest that mitochondrial
  complex I subunit genes mutated are frequently of nuclear origin; however, most
  of the mtDNA gene encoding subunits are also primarily involved. In this review,
  we have discussed the genetic origins of neurological disorders involving mitochondrial
  complex I and signified recent approaches to unravel the diagnostic and therapeutic
  potentials and their management."
