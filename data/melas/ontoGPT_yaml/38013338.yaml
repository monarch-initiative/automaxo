input_text: "Prolonged misdiagnosis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis,
  and stroke-like episodes syndrome: A case report.RATIONALE: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy,
  lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a subset of rare mitochondrial
  diseases characterized by diverse clinical manifestations, which often complicates
  its diagnosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: This report chronicles the experiences of a 14-year-old
  female patient who underwent multiple misdiagnoses before the eventual identification
  of MELAS syndrome. Her journey began with symptoms that included growth retardation,
  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and epilepsy. DIAGNOSIS: The definitive diagnosis of
  MELAS syndrome was established through genetic confirmation, revealing a mutation
  in the MT-TL1 gene (m.3242A > G). INTERVENTIONS: Upon diagnosis, the patient received
  targeted symptomatic treatment, which led to pronounced improvements in her symptoms.
  OUTCOMES: The patient's condition stabilized with the administered treatments, and
  she exhibited significant symptom relief, emphasizing the importance of accurate
  diagnosis and timely intervention. LESSONS: This case underscores the imperative
  for heightened clinical vigilance and thorough differential diagnosis in the face
  of complex clinical presentations, such as those seen in MELAS syndrome, to ensure
  timely and appropriate interventions."
