input_text: 'Characteristic cardiac phenotypes are detected by cardiovascular magnetic
  resonance in patients with different clinical phenotypes and genotypes of mitochondrial
  myopathy. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial myopathies (MM) are a heterogeneous group of
  inherited conditions resulting from a primary defect in the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain with consecutively impaired cellular energy metabolism. Small sized studies
  using mainly electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography have revealed cardiac
  abnormalities ranging from conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias to hypertrophic
  or dilated cardiomyopathy in these patients. Recently, characteristic patterns of
  cardiac involvement were documented by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
  patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)/Kearns-Sayre syndrome
  (KSS) and with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like
  episodes (MELAS). The present study aimed to characterize the prevalence and pattern
  of cardiac abnormalities and to test the additional diagnostic value of CMR in this
  patient population. The hypothesis that different neuromuscular MM syndromes present
  with different cardiac disease phenotypes was evaluated. METHODS: Sixty-four MM
  patients (50 +- 15 years, 44% male) and 25 matched controls (52 +- 14 years, 36%
  male) prospectively underwent cardiac evaluations including CMR (comprising cine-
  and late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging). Based on the neuromuscular phenotype
  and genotype, the patients were grouped: (a) CPEO/KSS (N = 33); (b) MELAS/-like
  (N = 11); c) myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) (N = 3) and d) other
  non-specific MM forms (N = 17). RESULTS: Among the 64 MM patients, 34 (53%) had
  at least one abnormal CMR finding: 18 (28%) demonstrated an impaired left ventricular
  ejection-fraction (LV-EF <60%), 14 (22%) had unexplained LV hypertrophy and 21 (33%)
  were LGE-positive. Compared to controls, MM patients showed significantly higher
  maximal wall thickness (10 +- 3 vs. 8 +- 2 mm, p = 0.005) and concentricity (LV
  mass to end-diastolic volume: 0.84 +- 0.27 vs. 0.67 +- 0.11, p < 0.0001) with frequent
  presence of non-ischemic LGE (30% vs. 0%, p = 0.001). CPEO/KSS showed a predominantly
  intramural pattern of LGE mostly confined to the basal LV inferolateral wall (8/10;
  80%) in addition to a tendency toward concentric remodelling. MELAS/-like patients
  showed the highest frequency of cardiac disease (in 10/11 (91%)), a mostly concentric
  LV hypertrophy (6/9; 67%) with or without LV systolic dysfunction and a predominantly
  focal, patchy LGE equally distributed among LV segments (8/11; 73%). Patients with
  MERRF and non-specific MM had no particular findings. Pathological CMR findings
  indicating cardiac involvement were detected significantly more often than pathological
  ECG results or elevated cardiac serum biomarkers (34 (53%) vs. 18 (28%) vs. 21 (33%);
  p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Cardiac involvement is a frequent finding in MM patients
  - and particularly present in KSS/CPEO as well as MELAS/-like patients. Despite
  a high variability in clinical presentation, CPEO/KSS patients typically show an
  intramural pattern of LGE in the basal inferolateral wall whereas MELAS patients
  are characterized by overt concentric hypertrophy and a rather unique, focally accentuated
  and diffusely distributed LGE.'
