input_text: 'Cerebral hyperperfusion and decreased cerebrovascular reactivity correlate
  with neurologic disease severity in MELAS.OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanisms underlying
  stroke-like episodes (SLEs) in MELAS syndrome. METHODS: We performed a case control
  study in 3 siblings with MELAS syndrome (m.3243A>G tRNA(Leu(UUR))) with variable
  % mutant mtDNA in blood (35 to 59%) to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (CBF)
  and arterial cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) compared to age- and sex-matched healthy
  study controls and a healthy control population. Subjects were studied at 3T MRI
  using arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure CBF; CVR was measured as a change
  in % Blood Oxygen Level Dependent signal (as a surrogate of CBF) to repeated 10
  mmHg step increase in arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2). RESULTS: MELAS siblings
  had decreased CVR (p <= 0.002) and increased CBF (p < 0.0026) compared to controls;
  changes correlated with disease severity and % mutant mtDNA (inversely for CVR:
  r = -0.82 frontal, r = -0.91 occipital cortex; directly for CBF: r = +0.85 frontal,
  not for occipital infarct penumbra). Mean CVR was reduced more in frontal (p < 0.001)
  versus occipital cortex (p = 0.002); mean CBF was increased more in occipital (p
  = 0.001) than frontal (p = 0.0026) cortices compared to controls. CBF correlated
  inversely with CVR (r = -0.99 in frontal; not in occipital infarct penumbra) suggesting
  that increased frontal resting flows are at the expense of flow reserve. INTERPRETATION:
  MELAS disease severity and mutation load were inversely correlated with Interictal
  CVR and directly correlated with frontal CBF. These metrics offer further insight
  into the cerebrovascular hemodynamics in MELAS syndrome and may serve as noninvasive
  prognostic markers to stratify risk for SLEs. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: Class
  III.'
