input_text: Atypical MELAS syndrome associated with a new mitochondrial tRNA glutamine
  point mutation.The authors studied a 47-year-old patient who presented with an association
  of deafness, acute cerebral stroke-like episode, leukoencephalopathy, and extensive
  basal ganglia calcifications. Late onset and neuroradiologic findings were atypical
  for MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and
  Strokelike episodes). A heteroplasmic G to A transition at nucleotide 4332 in the
  tRNA glutamine gene was identified in the patient's muscle mitochondrial DNA. The
  pathogenicity of the mutation was shown in single muscle fibers by the correlation
  between high mutation load and cytochrome c oxidase defect.
