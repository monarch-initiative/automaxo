input_text: Lingual ultrastructure of the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas).Microscopic
  studies on the cetacean tongue are limited and, to date, only a few ultrastructural
  reports on dolphins have been published. This report presents the initial description
  of the lingual ultrastructure of the long-finned pilot whale. The lingual integumental
  surface was smooth, lacking papillae, although flaking of outer stratum corneum
  cells could be observed at high resolution. The keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum
  of the epidermis resembled those of cetacean skin on other regions of the body.
  The similarities included the presence of cytoplasmic lipid droplets around the
  nuclei of stratutm spinosum cells, a lingual feature not seen in terrestrial mammals.
  Keratin intermediate filaments were numerous and occasionally formed aggregates
  of circular whorls. At cell surfaces, bundles of keratin intermediate filaments
  were frequently observed inserting into desmosomal plaques. Pigment granules were
  not evident and organelles were sparse. Stratum corneal cells contained nuclear
  remnants (parakeratosis) and small multivesicular bodies, and the corneal layer
  was approximately 18 cells thick. The nuclei of the stratum basale keratinocytes
  possessed exceptionally numerous and deep clefts. The dermis was nondistinctive.
  The skeletal muscle of the tongue was arranged in widely separated fasiculi containing
  small numbers of muscle fibres. Typical fine structure of skeletal muscle bands
  and tubular elements was observed by transmission electron microscopy.
