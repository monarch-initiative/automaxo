input_text: Paralytic ileus in MELAS with phenotypic features of MNGIE.This report
  describes a child having the syndrome of overlapping phenotypic features of mitochondrial
  myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and
  mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Mitochondrial
  DNA analysis revealed a point mutation at position A3243G, whereas activity of thymidine
  phosphorylase and its corresponding gene analysis were normal. The most striking
  feature of this case was paralysis of one segment of the terminal ileum observed
  on laparotomy. The electron microscopic findings of the resected ileum and colon
  by limited right hemicolectomy disclosed accumulation of numerous enlarged mitochondria
  with ill-defined cristae which were similar to mitochondria reported in three previous
  MELAS cases and one MNGIE case with intestinal dysmotility. We emphasize that the
  MELAS and MNGIE phenotypes overlapped in this case and that the mechanism of acute
  ileus in MELAS was associated with functional paralysis of the intestine.
