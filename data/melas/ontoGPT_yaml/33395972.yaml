input_text: Topological reorganization of brain functional networks in patients with
  mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Mitochondrial
  encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a rare
  maternally inherited genetic disease; however, little is known about its underlying
  brain basis. Furthermore, the topological organization of brain functional network
  in MELAS has not been explored. Here, 45 patients with MELAS (22 at acute stage,
  23 at chronic stage) and 22 normal controls were studied using resting- state functional
  magnetic resonance imaging and graph theory analysis approaches. Topological properties
  of brain functional networks including global and nodal metrics, rich club organization
  and modularity were analyzed. At the global level, MELAS patients exhibited reduced
  clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient, normalized characteristic
  path length and local network efficiency compared with the controls. At the nodal
  level, several nodes with abnormal degree centrality and nodal efficiency were detected
  in MELAS patients, and the distribution of these nodes was partly consistent with
  the stroke-like lesions. For rich club organization, rich club nodes were reorganized
  and the connections among them were decreased in MELAS patients. Modularity analysis
  revealed that MELAS patents had altered intra- or inter-modular connections in default
  mode network, fronto-parietal network, sensorimotor network, occipital network and
  cerebellum network. Notably, the patients at acute stage showed more obvious changes
  in these topological properties than the patients at chronic stage. These findings
  indicated that MELAS patients, particularly those at acute stage, exhibited topological
  reorganization of the whole-brain functional network. This study may help us to
  understand the neuropathological mechanisms of MELAS.
