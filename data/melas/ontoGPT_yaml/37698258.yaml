input_text: Coating-Free Culture Medium for Establishing and Maintaining Human Induced
  Pluripotent Stem Cells.Cell expansion of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) commonly
  depends on Matrigel as a coating matrix on two-dimensional (2D) culture plates and
  3D microcarriers. However, the xenogenic Matrigel requires sophisticated quality-assurance
  processes to meet clinical requirements. In this study, we develop an innovative
  coating-free medium for expanding hPSCs. The xenofree medium supports the weekend-free
  culture and competitive growth of hPSCs on several cell culture plastics without
  an additional pre-coating process. The pluripotent stemness of the expanded cells
  is stably sustained for more than 10 passages, featured with high pluripotent marker
  expressions, normal karyotyping, and differentiating capacity for three germ layers.
  The expression levels of some integrins are reduced, compared with those of the
  hPSCs on Matrigel. This medium also successfully supports the clonal expansion and
  induced pluripotent stem cell establishment from mitochondrial-defective MELAS (mitochondrial
  encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) patient's peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells. This innovative hPSC medium provides a straightforward
  scale-up process for producing clinical-orientated hPSCs by excluding the conventional
  coating procedure.
