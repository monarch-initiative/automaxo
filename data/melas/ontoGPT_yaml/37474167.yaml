input_text: "Efficacy of high-intensity versus low-intensity psychoanalytically oriented
  long-term treatments and determinants of outcome: individual participant data Meta-analysis
  of Long-term Analytic treatment Studies (MeLAS).INTRODUCTION: Long-term psychodynamic/psychoanalytic
  psychotherapy (LTPP) is a prevalent treatment option for complex mental disorders.
  Yet, little is known about the role of treatment intensity in LTPP. We present a
  study protocol for a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis
  aggregating and analysing individual data from randomised and quasi-experimental
  trials by meta-analysis. The purpose is to (1) determine the treatment effectiveness
  of LTPP with low versus high intensity (up to 2 weekly sessions vs three or more),
  (2) compare their joint effectiveness to shorter therapies and treatments as usual,
  (3) identify predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes and (4) determine reciprocal
  relationships between different outcome domains (symptomatic and structural/personality
  change) over the courses of LTPP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We include studies from
  (randomised controlled trial, RCT) and quasi-experimental trials, where at least
  one condition was LTPP of high or low frequency. Long-term treatment is defined
  as >=1 year or >=50 sessions. To be eligible studies must include a standardised
  outcome measure of symptoms (global or disorder specific) with at least one proof
  of reliability. The primary outcome is symptom reduction (global or specific), secondary
  outcome criteria are reliable change, remission, functional capacities, personality,
  personality functioning and interpersonal pathology. Relevant studies will mainly
  be identified by searching relevant databases: PubMed, PsycINFO (via EBSCO), Web
  of Science (via Elsevier), Chochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (via
  Wiley). Risk of bias will be evaluated in line with the Cochrane assessments tools
  for quasi-experimental trials and RCTs, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:
  Aggregation of data from primary trials collected based on ethics votes. Dissemination
  into clinical practice via open access publications of findings. PROSPERO REGISTRATION
