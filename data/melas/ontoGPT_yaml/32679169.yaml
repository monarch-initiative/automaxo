input_text: 'Altered spontaneous brain activity at attack and remission stages in
  patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes
  (MELAS): Beyond stroke-like lesions.Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis
  and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) may cause whole-brain functional changes due to
  mitochondrial dysfunction. Our purpose is to comprehensively evaluate the alterations
  of spontaneous brain activity in MELAS patients at stroke-like episodes (SLE) attack
  and remission stages using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
  Forty MELAS patients at attack stage (n = 20) and remission stage (n = 20) and 22
  healthy controls were enrolled in this study. We suggested that MELAS patients presented
  decreased spontaneous brain activities beyond the areas of stroke-like lesions (SLLs),
  with a downward trend from SLE attack stage to remission stage. In addition, the
  regional spontaneous activity of SLL, an inherent change in MELAS, was less than
  that in unaffected areas. Furthermore, the fractional amplitude of low frequency
  fluctuations value in left precuneus may be used as a promising neuroimaging biomarker
  for monitoring the disease status of MELAS.'
