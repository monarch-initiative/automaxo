input_text: 'Involvement of nervous system in maternally inherited diabetes and deafness
  (MIDD) with the A3243G mutation of mitochondrial DNA.OBJECTIVES: The A3243G mutation
  of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been associated with maternally inherited diabetes
  and deafness (MIDD) in a number of reports; however, the involvement of the nervous
  system has rarely been mentioned, prompting this exploration of the manifestation
  of neurological disorders in MIDD cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated four
  generations of a large Taiwanese family in which MIDD is manifest. We conducted
  a series of clinical examinations, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, brain 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission computed
  tomography (SPECT), cognitive function tests, and nerve conduction velocity (NCV)
  studies. Blood levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate, pathology of muscle biopsy
  samples and proportions of mutant mtDNA in blood cells, hair follicles, muscle and
  skin were also analyzed. Mean follow-up period was 4 years. RESULTS: The patients
  exhibited the clinical features of diabetes mellitus including sensorineural hearing
  loss, short stature, and/or histories of spontaneous abortion. No stroke-like episodes
  were reported. Analysis for mtDNA revealed that the A3243G mutation existed in 11
  members (6 symptomatic and 5 asymptomatic members) of this MIDD-prone family, with
  the proportion of mutant mtDNA ranging from 21% to 47% in leukocytes. Head CT revealed
  diffuse brain atrophy for all 6 (100%) patients examined and bilateral basal ganglia
  calcification in 4 of 6 (67%) patients. Brain 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT revealed diminished
  uptake in the bilateral parieto-occipital or occipital regions for all 6 tested
  patients, cognitive function for these patients was normal. Results of head CT and
  SPECT were normal in one asymptomatic member of the family. One muscle biopsy revealed
  abundant ragged-red fibers with modified Gomori-trichrome stain. Muscle-enzyme activity
  and serum-lactate levels were normal. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that a wide
  spectrum of sub clinical pathologies of the central nervous system and muscle are
  present for this MIDD-prone family, none of whom developed typical MELAS during
  the 4-year period of follow-up study.'
