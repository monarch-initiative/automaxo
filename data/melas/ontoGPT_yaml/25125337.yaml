input_text: Novel MTCYB mutation in a young patient with recurrent stroke-like episodes
  and status epilepticus. The acronym "MELAS" (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with
  lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) denotes patients with histological, biochemical
  and/or molecular evidence of mitochondrial disease who experience stroke-like episodes.
  Here we report on a girl with repeated stroke-like episodes and status epilepticus,
  who was diagnosed with MELAS due to a novel mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (MTCYB)
  mutation (m.15092G>A, which predicts p.G116S). Western blotting and in silico analyses
  suggested that this mutation could affect the stability of complex III. Cytochrome
  b is the only mtDNA-encoded subunit of respiratory chain complex III. Mutations
  in MTCYB have been associated with isolated mitochondrial myopathy and exercise
  intolerance, and rarely with multisystem and/or central nervous system involvement.
  If the m.3243A>G and other common MELAS mutations are absent in several tissues,
  MTCYB should be sequenced from muscle in patients with stroke-like episodes, especially
  if muscle histology does not support a mitochondrial myopathy and lactic acidosis
  is absent.
