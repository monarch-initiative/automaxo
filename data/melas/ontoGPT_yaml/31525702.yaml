input_text: 'Individual dietary intervention in adult patients with mitochondrial
  disease due to the m.3243 A>G mutation.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate
  the effect of an individually tailored dietary intervention on personalized goals,
  body composition (BC), functioning, and quality of life (QoL) in adult patients
  with mitochondrial disease (MD) due to the m.3243 A>G mutation. METHODS: This explorative
  randomized controlled trial included 39 patients with MD. The intervention group
  (n = 20) received an individually tailored dietary intervention over a 6-mo period.
  The control group (n = 19) received standard care over a 6-mo timeframe (control
  period), followed by an individually tailored dietary intervention for the next
  6 mo (intervention period). Nutritional assessment and QoL measurements were performed
  at 3-mo intervals. Personalized treatment goals of the patients with MD were evaluated
  at 3 and 6 mo during the dietary intervention. Achievement of the personalized goals
  was assessed using descriptive statistics and mixed models. Linear mixed models
  were used to test the effect of the dietary intervention on continuous outcomes.
  RESULTS: The personal goals of patients were significantly more frequently achieved
  in the intervention group than in the control group. After 3 mo of intervention,
  57% of the goals were achieved. Most goals were achieved for BC, handgrip strength
  (HGS), and gastrointestinal complaints. Intervention increased HGS (P = 0.037),
  the vitality component of QoL (P = 0.026), and decreased the fatigue score (P =
  0.024) after 3 mo of treatment. Effects did not seem to last after 3 mo, however.
  CONCLUSION: An individually tailored dietary intervention is promising to achieve
  personalized goals of patients with MD, especially with regard to BC, HGS, and gastrointestinal
  complaints. The intervention also improves QoL, and decreases fatigue.'
