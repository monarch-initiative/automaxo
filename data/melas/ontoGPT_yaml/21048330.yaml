input_text: 'Abnormal myocardial energy-production state in mitochondrial cardiomyopathy
  and acute response to L-arginine infusion. C-11 acetate kinetics revealed by positron
  emission tomography. BACKGROUND: Cardiomyopathy is a life-threatening condition
  in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like
  episodes (known as MELAS). However, no effective therapy has been available until
  now. In the present study cardiac energetics and acute effects of L-arginine (Arg)
  were evaluated in MELAS patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 6 patients with MELAS
  (M-group) and 6 volunteers (C-group) underwent dynamic C-11 acetate positron emission
  tomography (PET) imaging. TCA-cycle metabolic rate (k(mono)), myocardial efficiency
  (double product (DP)/k(mono)), and myocardial blood flow (MBF) were determined before
  and after L-Arg administration. Baseline k(mono) showed a lower value in the M-group
  than in the C-group (0.051+-0.013 vs 0.070+-0.019min(-1), P=0.055). On the other
  hand, baseline DP/k(mono) was significantly greater in the M-group (1.69+-5.9 vs
  0.95+-1.2x10(5), P=0.004). After L-Arg administration, 4 patients showed significant
  elevation of k(mono). No relationship was observed between the distribution of k(mono)
  elevation and the increase in MBF. CONCLUSIONS: The TCA cycle metabolic rate is
  markedly suppressed in MELAS patients, indicating a shift in energy production to
  the anaerobic pathway, leading to a paradoxical increase in myocardial efficiency.
  L-Arg can enhance TCA-cycle metabolism, regardless of its vasodilatation effect,
  and can be used as a treatment for patients with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy.'
