input_text: '[A case of MELAS associated with histochemical findings of muscles characteristic
  of MERRF].We here report a 39-year-old woman of short stature with sensorineural
  deafness, who suddenly developed status epilepticus. T2-weighed image of brain magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a high signal lesion in the left temporal area,
  the distribution of which was not compatible with any particular arterial supply.
  Lactate and pyruvate were elevated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. As the
  mitochondrial gene analysis revealed the m.3243A>G mutation, diagnosis of mitochondrial
  myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode (MELAS) was made.
  In the histochemical study of a biopsied muscle, the intramuscular blood vessels
  reacted strongly with SDH (SSV), but the SSV was negative for cytochrome c oxidase
  (COX), the findings characteristic of myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers
  (MERRF). This is the first case of MELAS in which the muscle histochemistry showed
  positive SSV unassociated with increased COX. '
