input_text: Exploring mTOR inhibition as treatment for mitochondrial disease.Leigh
  syndrome and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like
  episodes) are two of the most frequent pediatric mitochondrial diseases. Both cause
  severe morbidity and neither have effective treatment. Inhibiting the mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been shown in model mice of Leigh syndrome
  to extend lifespan and attenuate both the clinical and pathological progression
  of disease. Based on this observation, we treated two children with everolimus,
  a rapamycin analogue. The child with Leigh syndrome showed sustained benefit, while
  the child with MELAS failed to respond and died of progressive disease. We discuss
  possible mechanisms underlying these disparate responses to mTOR inhibition.
