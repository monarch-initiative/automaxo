input_text: 'Cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in mitochondrial disorders.OBJECTIVE:
  To investigate cerebral metabolism by 2-[18F]fluorodeoxy-d-glucose (FDG) uptake
  using PET and cerebrovascular reverse capacity by transcranial Doppler sonography
  (TCD) in different mitochondrial diseases (mitochondrial myopathy; mitochondrial
  encephalopathy, lactacidosis, and stroke-like episodes [MELAS]; and chronic external
  ophthalmoplegia). BACKGROUND: Previous studies on individual patients with mitochondriopathies
  revealed abnormal accumulations of mitochondria in endothelium, smooth muscle cells,
  and pericytes of blood vessels in different parts of the nervous system (cerebrum,
  cerebellum, sural nerve) and skeletal muscle. On this basis, some investigators
  suggested a pathogenic role of vascular involvement in the MELAS syndrome and other
  encephalopathies. smhd1 DESIGN/METHODS: The authors investigated neuronal metabolism
  and cerebrovascular involvement with PET in 5 cases and with TCD with acetazolamide
  stimulation in 15 cases. The patients were divided into three groups: 1) interictal
  MELAS (n = 4); 2) progressive external ophthalmoplegia (n = 6); and 3) pure mitochondrial
  myopathy and neuropathy (n = 5). The results were compared with those from matched
  normal control subjects. The diagnoses were based on clinical phenotype as well
  as histopathologic and molecular analysis. RESULTS: Cerebral glucose uptake was
  impaired in all patients, both with and without CNS symptoms, particularly in the
  occipital and temporal lobes. The vasoreactivity of the small arterioles to acetazolamide
  did not differ significantly between the patients and healthy control subjects or
  between the different groups of mitochondrial disorders. CONCLUSIONS: MELAS does
  not appear to be a functional disturbance of arterioles leading to an ischemic vascular
  event. The clinical symptoms in MELAS are not the result of a mitochondrial angiopathy
  but are the consequences of a mitochondrial cytopathy affecting neurons or glia.
  There is no correlation between the decreased glucose metabolism and the duration
  of the disease.'
