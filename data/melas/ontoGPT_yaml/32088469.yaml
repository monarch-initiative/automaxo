input_text: 'Metabolic stroke or stroke-like lesion: Peculiarities of a phenomenon.
  OBJECTIVES: One of the most frequent cerebral lesions in mitochondrial disorders(MIDs)
  on imaging is the stroke-like lesion(SLL) clinically manifesting as stroke-like
  episode (SLE, metabolic stroke). This review aims at discussing recent advances
  concerning the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of SLLs. METHODS: Systematic
  literature review using appropriate search terms. RESULTS: SLLs are the hallmark
  of MELAS but occasionally occur in other MIDs. SLLs are best identified on multimodal,
  cerebral MRI. SLLs may present as uni-/multilocular, symmetric/asymmetric, cortical/subcortical,
  supra-/infratentorial condition, initially resembling a cytotoxic edema and later
  a vasogenic edema, or a variable mix between them. SLLs run through an acute and
  a chronic stage. The acute stage is characterised by a progressively expanding lesion
  over days, weeks, or months, showing up as increasing hyperintensity on T2/FLAIR,
  DWI, and PWI and by hyperperfusion, that does not conform to a vascular territory.
  ADC maps are initially hypointens to become hyperintens during the course. More
  rarely, a variable mixture of hyper- and hypointensities may be found. The chronic
  stage is characterised by hypoperfusion, gadolinium enhancement, and regression
  of hyperintensities to various endpoints. SLLs originate from an initial cortical
  lesion due to focal metabolic breakdown, which either remains stable or expands
  within the cortex or to subcortical areas. Some SLLs show spontaneous reversibility
  (fleeing cortical lesions) suggesting that neuronal/glial damage does not reach
  the threshold of irreversible cell death. CONCLUSIONS: SLLs are a unique feature
  of various MIDs in particular MELAS. SLLs are dynamic and change their appearance
  over time. SLLs are accessible to treatment.'
