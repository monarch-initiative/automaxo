input_text: 'Impact of cardiovascular involvement on the clinical course of paediatric
  mitochondrial disorders. BACKGROUND: Primary mitochondrial disorders (PMD) are rare
  conditions resulting in progressive multi-organ failure. Cardiovascular involvement
  (CVI) has been reported in paediatric patients. However, its age-related prevalence,
  clinical presentation and prognostic impact are unresolved. We detailed CVI in a
  cohort of children diagnosed with PMD over two decades at a tertiary referral centre.
  RESULTS: We enrolled 86 PMD patients (M/F = 30/56; mean age 6.4 +- 8.58 years).
  CVI was detected in 31 patients (36%), with mean age at onset of 5.7 +- 7.8 years
  including the pre- and neonatal phase in 14, often representing the first sign of
  PMD (42% of those with CVI). Heart disease resulted more common in males and in
  children with specific aetiologies (Barth, TMEM70 and MELAS syndromes). Hypertrophic,
  non-compaction and dilated cardiomyopathies were the prevalent disorders, although
  pulmonary arterial hypertension was also found. Adverse cardiac events (heart failure,
  resuscitated cardiac arrest, ICD/PM implantation, sudden death) occurred in 19%
  of children with CVI over a follow-up period of 5.4 +- 4.3 years. All-cause mortality
  was higher in patients with CVI compared to those without CVI (45.1% vs 21.8%; p
  < 0.01); female sex, age at onset < 5 years, acute heart failure at presentation
  and diabetes also proved independent predictors of outcome. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular
  involvement occurred in over one-third of children diagnosed with PMD, often at
  a very early age, and was associated with adverse prognosis. Final outcome of PMD-related
  CVI was influenced by the specific underlying aetiology, suggesting the need for
  tailored management of heart failure and sudden death prevention.'
