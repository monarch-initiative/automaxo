input_text: A new chromosomal phylogeny supports the repeated origin of vectorial
  capacity in malaria mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex. Understanding phylogenetic
  relationships within species complexes of disease vectors is crucial for identifying
  genomic changes associated with the evolution of epidemiologically important traits.
  However, the high degree of genetic similarity among sibling species confounds the
  ability to determine phylogenetic relationships using molecular markers. The goal
  of this study was to infer the ancestral-descendant relationships among malaria
  vectors and nonvectors of the Anopheles gambiae species complex by analyzing breakpoints
  of fixed chromosomal inversions in ingroup and several outgroup species. We identified
  genes at breakpoints of fixed overlapping chromosomal inversions 2Ro and 2Rp of
  An. merus using fluorescence in situ hybridization, a whole-genome mate-paired sequencing,
  and clone sequencing. We also mapped breakpoints of a chromosomal inversion 2La
  (common to An. merus, An. gambiae, and An. arabiensis) in outgroup species using
  a bioinformatics approach. We demonstrated that the "standard" 2R+(p) arrangement
  and "inverted" 2Ro and 2La arrangements are present in outgroup species Anopheles
  stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. The data indicate that the
  ancestral species of the An. gambiae complex had the 2Ro, 2R+(p), and 2La chromosomal
  arrangements. The "inverted" 2Ro arrangement uniquely characterizes a malaria vector
  An. merus as the basal species in the complex. The rooted chromosomal phylogeny
  implies that An. merus acquired the 2Rp inversion and that its sister species An.
  gambiae acquired the 2R+(o) inversion from the ancestral species. The karyotype
  of nonvectors An. quadriannulatus A and B was derived from the karyotype of the
  major malaria vector An. gambiae. We conclude that the ability to effectively transmit
  human malaria had originated repeatedly in the complex. Our findings also suggest
  that saltwater tolerance originated first in An. merus and then independently in
  An. melas. The new chromosomal phylogeny will facilitate identifying the association
  of evolutionary genomic changes with epidemiologically important phenotypes.
