input_text: 'Lactate quantification by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy using
  a clinical MRI machine: a basic study.The purpose of this study was to establish
  quantification method of lactate concentration by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
  (MRS) carried out using a conventional 1.5-T MRI machine. We used a lactate phantom
  with known concentrations (1, 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 14 mmol/L). As a clinical example,
  a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like
  episodes (MELAS) was evaluated. Proton MRS was carried out using a clinical 1.5-T
  super-conducting magnetic resonance whole-body system. Data were acquired by point
  resolved spectroscopy. A coupling constant of J = 7.35 Hz (2/J = 272 ms) and two
  long in-phase echo time of 272 ms and 544 ms were used to calculate the T2 relaxation
  time. The tissue water signal was used as an internal standard to quantify lactate.
  The correlation coefficient R between the calculated lactate concentrations and
  the known concentration of lactate was 0.99 with a constant factor of 0.32 (1/3.14).
  In patients with MELAS, the lactate concentration measured by MRS was 6.2 mmol/kg
  wet weight, which is similar to the value obtained in previous studies. In the present
  study, we have established a reliable method for lactate quantification in a phantom
  study and have shown a sample of clinical case of MELAS.'
