input_text: Elements in fish of Malibu Creek and Malibu Lagoon near Los Angeles, California.Our
  aim was to assess whether past discharges from a wastewater treatment plant increased
  metal pollutant loads in stream mobile species in a one-day baseline sampling study
  that included a coastal wetland. Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) of two sizes, black
  bullhead (Ameiurus melas), and crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) were collected
  from Malibu Creek, and California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis) of three sizes,
  as well as arroyo chub (Gila orcutti) were sampled from Malibu Lagoon near Los Angeles,
  California. Species from each locality were pooled by length, homogenized, digested
  by microwave wet ashing, and analyzed by simultaneous inductively coupled plasma
  atomic emission spectroscopy for 27 elements. Lagoon killifish 2.0-3.5 cm long contained
  levels of arsenic and lead above the levels for 95% of California fish, the EDL95.
  Black bullhead upstream of the discharge contained elevated levels of As, Cr and
  Se. Young mosquitofish <3 cm in length upstream of the discharge differed greatly
  in the order of abundance of their elements relative to larger mosquitofish and
  to other species collected. More sampling than this baseline study allowed was needed
  to determine if the wastewater treatment plant was a pollution source.
