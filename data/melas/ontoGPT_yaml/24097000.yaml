input_text: 'Findings of 123I-iomazenil SPECT during and after stroke-like episodes
  in a patient with MELAS.Reduced cortical benzodiazepine receptor binding potential
  in late images of I-iomazenil SPECT indicates neuronal damage in the cortex. We
  present the case of a 31-year-old woman with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy,
  lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who had focal seizures in the
  right hand. FLAIR imaging in the ictal state revealed a high-intensity lesion in
  the left post-central gyrus, while I-iomazenil SPECT showed decreased tracer uptake
  in this lesion. The lesion completely disappeared on FLAIR imaging performed 1 month
  after the focal seizures; in contrast, I-iomazenil SPECT still revealed a significant
  decrease in tracer uptake in this lesion. '
