input_text: Prenatal diagnosis of a fetus harboring an intermediate load of the A3243G
  mtDNA mutation in a maternal carrier diagnosed with MELAS syndrome.We prenatally
  diagnosed MELAS syndrome in a fetus whose mother and older brother had the MELAS-specific
  A3243G mutation. The mutant mtDNA level of the amniotic fluid cells was not significantly
  different from that of the postnatal peripheral blood and hair follicle samples.
  The obstetrical course was uncomplicated except for transient exacerbation of the
  mother's diabetes, which required insulin control. At term, the infant was macrosomic,
  and the delivery was complicated by shoulder dystocia. MELAS syndrome in itself
  does not influence either the prenatal course of the mother or the fetal outcome.
  In contrast to the fulminating clinical course of this mother's first child, MELAS
  symptoms did not develop in her second child until age four, despite similar high
  tissue levels of mutant mtDNA. The phenotypic diversity in two offspring with similar
  higher levels of mutant mtDNA suggests that prenatal genetic diagnosis of cultured
  amniotic cells may yield results that are poor prognosticators of fetal outcome.
