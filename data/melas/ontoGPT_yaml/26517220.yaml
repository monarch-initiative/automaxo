input_text: 'When should MELAS (Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis,
  and Stroke-like episodes) be the diagnosis? Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy,
  Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a rare mitochondrial disorder.
  Diagnostic criteria for MELAS include typical manifestations of the disease: stroke-like
  episodes, encephalopathy, evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction (laboratorial or
  histological) and known mitochondrial DNA gene mutations. Clinical features of MELAS
  are not necessarily uniform in the early stages of the disease, and correlations
  between clinical manifestations and physiopathology have not been fully elucidated.
  It is estimated that point mutations in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene of the DNAmt, mainly
  A3243G, are responsible for more of 80% of MELAS cases. Morphological changes seen
  upon muscle biopsy in MELAS include a substantive proportion of ragged red fibers
  (RRF) and the presence of vessels with a strong reaction for succinate dehydrogenase.
  In this review, we discuss mainly diagnostic criterion, clinical and laboratory
  manifestations, brain images, histology and molecular findings as well as some differential
  diagnoses and current treatments. '
