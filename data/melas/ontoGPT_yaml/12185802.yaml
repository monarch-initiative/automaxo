input_text: '[MELAS--mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like
  episodes syndrome--two cases confirmed by biochemical and molecular investigations.
  Differential diagnosis of stroke causes]. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic
  acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) is a maternally inherited multisystem
  disease caused by mutations of the mitochondrial DNA. The characteristic clinical
  features are: encephalopathy manifesting as dementia and seizures, stroke-like episodes
  at young age (usually < 40), lactic acidosis and myopathy with ragged-red fibres.
  Other frequent manifestations include: sensorineural deafness, diabetes, hypoparathyroidism,
  peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. We present two patients with MELAS who
  were diagnosed 4 and 9 years respectively following the onset of the disease despite
  the characteristic clinical pictures. The differential diagnostics of inborn and
  acquired disorders causing stroke is included. We regard that mitochondrial diseases
  are still insufficiently known and are frequently misdiagnosed. The knowledge is
  indispensable for establishing diagnosis and accurate genetic counselling. Although
  there is no specific therapy for mitochondrial diseases to date, coenzyme Q and
  various vitamins as well as moderate degree exercise might be recommended.'
