input_text: "Enterovirus D68-associated community-acquired pneumonia in children living
  in Milan, Italy.BACKGROUND: An increasing number of children infected by enterovirus
  D68 (EV-D68) and affected by severe respiratory illness, muscle weakness and paralysis
  were described in the USA and Canada in 2014 OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential
  involvement of EV-D68 in determining community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalised
  children in order to acquire information concerning the clinical problems associated
  with EV-D68 in Italy. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective study of children hospitalised
  for CAP in the largest Pediatric Department in Milan, Italy, was carried out between
  1 June and 31 December 2014. All of the children's admission nasopharyngeal swabs
  were investigated for the presence of EV-D68. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six
  children with radiographically confirmed CAP were hospitalised during the 7-month
  study period: 97 (55.1%) had enterovirus/rhinovirus-positive nasopharyngeal samples,
  including four (2.3%) positive for EV-D68. These four samples were collected between
  9 and 21 October, a month in which 21 cases of CAP were recorded. Phylogenetic analysis
  showed that all of the sequences fell into clade B. The most severe case was diagnosed
  in a 14-year-old girl with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like
  episodes (MELAS syndrome), who died after 12 days of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS:
  EV-D68 was detected in few children with usually mild-to-moderate lower respiratory
  tract infection, although the disease lead to the death of a girl with a severe
  chronic underlying disease. Further studies capable of better defining the epidemiological,
  genetic and pathogenetic characteristics of the virus are required in order to be
  able to prepare appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures."
