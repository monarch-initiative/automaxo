input_text: ATP, phosphocreatine and lactate in exercising muscle in mitochondrial
  disease and McArdle's disease. We studied exercise-induced changes in the adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and lactate levels in the skeletal muscle
  of mitochondrial patients and patients with McArdle's disease. Needle muscle biopsy
  specimens for biochemical measurement were obtained before and immediately after
  maximal short-term bicycle exercise test from 12 patients suffering from autosomal
  dominant and recessive forms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia and multiple
  deletions of mitochondrial DNA (adPEO, arPEO, respectively), five patients with
  mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)
  3243 A-->G point mutation, and four patients with McArdle's disease. Muscle ATP
  and PCr levels at rest or after exercise did not differ significantly from those
  of the controls in any patient group. In patients with mitochondrial disease, muscle
  lactate tended to be lower at rest and increase more during exercise than in controls,
  the most remarkable rise being measured in patients with adPEO with generalized
  muscle symptoms and in patients with MELAS point mutation. In McArdle patients,
  the muscle lactate level decreased during exercise. No correlation was found between
  the muscle ATP and PCr levels and the respiratory chain enzyme activity.
