input_text: "Black Toenail Sign in MELAS Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial encephalopathy
  with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a mitochondrial
  disorder often causing progressive brain injury that is not confined to large arterial
  territories. Severe insults ultimately lead to gyral necrosis affecting the cortex
  and juxtacortical white matter; the neuroimaging correlate is partial gyral signal
  suppression on T2/FLAIR sequences that resemble black toenails. We aimed to characterize
  the imaging features and the natural history of MELAS-related gyral necrosis. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: Databases at two children's hospitals were searched for brain magnetic
  resonance imaging studies of individuals with MELAS. Examinations with motion artifact
  and those lacking T2/FLAIR sequences were excluded. The location, the cumulative
  number, and the maximum transverse diameter of necrotic gyral lesions were assessed
  using T2-weighted images and T2/FLAIR sequences. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed
  to evaluate the relationship between disease duration and the number of necrotic
  lesions. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four examinations from patients with 14 unique
  MELAS patients (16 +- 3 years) were evaluated. Six of the eight patients who developed
  brain lesions also developed gyral necroses (mean 13, range 0 to 44). Necrotic lesions
  varied in maximal diameter from 4 to 25 mm. Cumulative necrotic lesions correlated
  with disease duration (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The black toenail sign signifying
  gyral necrosis is a common imaging feature in individuals with MELAS syndrome. The
  extent of gyral necrosis correlates with disease duration."
