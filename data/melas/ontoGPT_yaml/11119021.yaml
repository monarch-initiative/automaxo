input_text: Ketoacidosis accompanied by epileptic seizures in a patient with diabetes
  mellitus and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like
  episodes (MELAS).We herein report a rare case of MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy,
  encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and diabetes mellitus
  with ketoacidosis. An 18-year-old female patient was diagnosed to have diabetes
  mellitus and insulin therapy was thereafter initiated. At 26 years of age, she was
  hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis, soon followed by a loss of consciousness,
  left-sided dysmetria, and ataxic speech. MELAS was diagnosed because of the presence
  of ragged red fibers in a muscle biopsy. At 33 years of age, she was admitted to
  our hospital because of ketoacidosis and partial status epilepticus. A blood gas
  examination revealed as follows; arterial pH, 6.88; bicarbonate, 2.1 mmol/l; base
  excess - 29.8 mmol/l. The serum level of glucose had also increased to 30 mmol/l.
  The serum levels of lactate and B-hydroxybutyrate were elevated to 11.4 mmol/l and
  1,990 micromol/l, respectively. Ketoacidosis improved by fluid replacement and continuous
  intravenous insulin infusion. A brain MRI demonstrated hyperintensity areas on FLAIR
  images in the bilateral temporal lobes and the cerebellum. A proton MRS demonstrated
  the abnormal lactate accumulation in the bilateral temporal and occipital lobes.
  Since epileptic seizures are rare in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, such seizures
  may indicate the existence of MELAS syndrome.
