input_text: 'Mutation-free baby born from a mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis
  and stroke-like syndrome carrier after blastocyst trophectoderm preimplantation
  genetic diagnosis. To investigate the applicability of preimplantation genetic diagnosis
  (PGD), we used trophectoderm (TE) biopsy to determine the mutation load in a 35-year-old
  female with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome
  (MELAS). Transfer of a mutation-free blastocyst gave birth to a healthy boy with
  undetectable mutation in any of the analyzed tissues. We found strong correlation
  among TE cells (r=0.90) within blastocysts and also between cytoplasmic fragments
  and TE (r=0.95). This is the first case of mutation-free baby born from a MELAS
  patient after TE biopsy and supports the applicability of blastocyst PGD for patients
  with mtDNA disorders to establish healthy offspring. '
