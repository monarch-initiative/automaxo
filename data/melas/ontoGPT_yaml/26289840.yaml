input_text: Presentation of m.3243A>G (MT-TL1; tRNALeu) variant with focal neurology
  in infancy. The Mitochondrial tRNALeu (MT-TL1) mutation, m.3243A>G constitutes the
  commonest identified mitochondrial genome mutation. Characteristically, giving rise
  to MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes),
  a phenotypic spectrum associated with this genetic variant is now apparent. We report
  on the first patient with infantile hemiparesis, without comorbid encephalopathy,
  attributed to this variant. This further expands the recognized disease spectrum
  and highlights the need to consider mitochondrial genomic mutations in cases of
  cryptogenic focal neurological deficit in infancy. The potential for genetic disease
  modifiers is additionally discussed.
