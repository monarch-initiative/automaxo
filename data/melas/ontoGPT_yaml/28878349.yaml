input_text: Peptide-mediated delivery of donor mitochondria improves mitochondrial
  function and cell viability in human cybrid cells with the MELAS A3243G mutation.
  The cell penetrating peptide, Pep-1, has been shown to facilitate cellular uptake
  of foreign mitochondria but further research is required to evaluate the use of
  Pep-1-mediated mitochondrial delivery (PMD) in treating mitochondrial defects. Presently,
  we sought to determine whether mitochondrial transplantation rescue mitochondrial
  function in a cybrid cell model of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic
  acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) disease. Following PMD, recipient cells
  had internalized donor mitochondria after 1 h, and expressed higher levels of normal
  mitochondrial DNA, particularly at the end of the treatment and 11 days later. After
  4 days, mitochondrial respiratory function had recovered and biogenesis was evident
  in the Pep-1 and PMD groups, compared to the untreated MELAS group. However, only
  PMD was able to reverse the fusion-to-fission ratio of mitochondrial morphology,
  and mitochondria shaping proteins resembled the normal pattern seen in the control
  group. Cell survival following hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress was also
  improved in the PMD group. Finally, we observed that PMD partially normalized cytokine
  expression, including that of interleukin (IL)-7, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating
  factor (GM-CSF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in the MELAS cells.
  Presently, our data further confirm the protective effects of PMD as well in MELAS
  disease.
