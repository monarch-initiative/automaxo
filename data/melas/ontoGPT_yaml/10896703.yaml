input_text: Can diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging help differentiate stroke
  from stroke-like events in MELAS? The precise mechanism of neurological symptoms
  in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like
  episodes (MELAS) is still controversial. The diffusion weighted MR findings at the
  acute phase of a neurological event in MELAS are described and the pathophysiology
  of stroke-like lesion in the light of diffusion changes is discussed. Brain MRI
  was performed 2 days after the sudden onset of cortical blindness in a 25 year old
  patient with MELAS. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed multifocal
  cortical and subcortical hyperintensities located bilaterally in the frontobasal
  and the temporo-occipital lobes. Diffusion weighted images showed normal to increased
  apparent diffusion coefficient values in the acute left temporooccipital lesion
  and increased values in the older stroke-like lesions. These diffusion weighted
  findings support the metabolic rather than the ischaemic pathophysiological hypothesis
  for stroke-like episodes occurring in MELAS. Normal or increased apparent diffusion
  coefficient values within 48 hours of a neurological deficit of abrupt onset should
  raise the possibility of MELAS, especially if conventional MR images show infarct-like
  lesions.
