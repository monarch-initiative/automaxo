input_text: 'Blastocyst preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of a mitochondrial
  DNA disorder.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of trophectoderm biopsy for preimplantation
  genetic diagnosis (PGD) of mitochondrial (mt) DNA mutation load. DESIGN: A PGD case
  and analysis of blastocyst mosaicism. SETTING: Academic center for reproductive
  medicine. PATIENT(S): A 30-year-old carrier of 35% 3243A>G mtDNA mutation load with
  a daughter affected by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like
  episodes (MELAS) syndrome. INTERVENTION(S): Blastocyst biopsy for PGD of mutation
  load and gender. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Variation in mutation load within and
  among embryos, and newborn mutation load after PGD-based selection. RESULT(S): Oocytes
  and embryos were found to possess a variety of 3243A>G mutation loads from 9% to
  90% in oocytes and 7% to 91% in embryos, demonstrating that PGD would be a relevant
  procedure. Highly consistent results were obtained within multiple biopsies of both
  cleavage- and blastocyst-stage embryos. Importantly, mutation loads observed in
  trophectoderm were predictive of the inner cell mass (r(2) = 0.97). Transfer of
  a male embryo, predicted to possess 12% mutation load by analysis of a trophectoderm
  biopsy, resulted in the delivery of a boy with tissue-specific mutation loads ranging
  from undetectable to 15%. CONCLUSION(S): This study represents the first successful
  clinical application of PGD to reduce the transgenerational risk of transmitting
  an mtDNA disorder and supports the applicability of blastocyst trophectoderm PGD
  for carriers of mtDNA mutations attempting reproduction.'
