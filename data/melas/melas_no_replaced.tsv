38013338	associate|@DISEASE_MELAS_Syndrome|@GENE_TRNL1	Prolonged misdiagnosis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome: A case report.RATIONALE: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a subset of rare mitochondrial diseases characterized by diverse clinical manifestations, which often complicates its diagnosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: This report chronicles the experiences of a 14-year-old female patient who underwent multiple misdiagnoses before the eventual identification of MELAS syndrome. Her journey began with symptoms that included growth retardation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and epilepsy. DIAGNOSIS: The definitive diagnosis of MELAS syndrome was established through genetic confirmation, revealing a mutation in the MT-TL1 gene (m.3242A > G). INTERVENTIONS: Upon diagnosis, the patient received targeted symptomatic treatment, which led to pronounced improvements in her symptoms. OUTCOMES: The patient's condition stabilized with the administered treatments, and she exhibited significant symptom relief, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. LESSONS: This case underscores the imperative for heightened clinical vigilance and thorough differential diagnosis in the face of complex clinical presentations, such as those seen in MELAS syndrome, to ensure timely and appropriate interventions.
37698258		Coating-Free Culture Medium for Establishing and Maintaining Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.Cell expansion of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) commonly depends on Matrigel as a coating matrix on two-dimensional (2D) culture plates and 3D microcarriers. However, the xenogenic Matrigel requires sophisticated quality-assurance processes to meet clinical requirements. In this study, we develop an innovative coating-free medium for expanding hPSCs. The xenofree medium supports the weekend-free culture and competitive growth of hPSCs on several cell culture plastics without an additional pre-coating process. The pluripotent stemness of the expanded cells is stably sustained for more than 10 passages, featured with high pluripotent marker expressions, normal karyotyping, and differentiating capacity for three germ layers. The expression levels of some integrins are reduced, compared with those of the hPSCs on Matrigel. This medium also successfully supports the clonal expansion and induced pluripotent stem cell establishment from mitochondrial-defective MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This innovative hPSC medium provides a straightforward scale-up process for producing clinical-orientated hPSCs by excluding the conventional coating procedure.

36892301	associate|@CHEMICAL_N_acetylaspartate|@DISEASE_Stroke ;cause|@CHEMICAL_Lactic_Acid|@DISEASE_Stroke	Characteristics of stroke-like lesions on cerebral imaging.<p><strong>Objective</strong> &ndash; Stroke-like lesions (SLLs) are pathognomonic for mitochondrial ence&shy;pha&shy;lopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome but occur in other mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial disorders as well. This mini-review aims at summarising and discussing recent findings to open up future perspectives how to manage this fleeting phenomenon.<br><strong>Results </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Typically, SLLs are dynamic lesions, which increase in size and intensity to regress after a nadir. SLLs are incongruent with a vascular territory, originate frequently from the cortex to spread subcortically, can be monofocal or multifocal, run through an acute (attack) and chronic (remission) stage, and may either completely disappear or end up as laminar cortical necrosis, white matter lesion, subcortical atrophy, cyst, or the toenail sign. On cerebral CT, SLLs are hypodense. SLLs can be best visualized on multimodal MRI showing up as hyperintensity on T2, FLAIR, DWI, and PWI, and as hypointensity on OEF-MRI. On MR-spectroscopy, SLLs typically present with a decreased N-acetyl-aspartate peak and an increased lactate peak. DTI in acute SLLs reveals reduced connectivity, increased global efficiency, and reduced focal efficiency. Tc-HMPAO SPECT of SLLs indicates hyperperfusion and L-iomazenil SPECT reduced tracer uptake. FDG-PET typically shows hypometabolism within a SLL.<br><strong>Conclusion</strong> &ndash; SLLs present with typical findings on various imaging modalities but the combination of cerebral CT, multimodal MRI, MRS, and PET clearly delineate a SLL from other acute or chronic cerebral lesions.&nbsp;</p>.
38146643		The split apparent diffusion coefficient sign: A novel magnetic resonance imaging biomarker for cortical pathology with possible implications in autoimmune encephalitis.INTRODUCTION: MRI is the imaging modality of choice for assessing patients with encephalopathy. In this context, we discuss a novel biomarker, the "split ADC sign," where the cerebral cortex demonstrates restricted diffusion (high DWI signal and low ADC) and the underlying white matter demonstrates facilitated diffusion (high or low DWI signal and high ADC). We hypothesize that this sign can be used as a biomarker to suggest either acute encephalitis onset or to raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-text radiological information system search of radiological reports was performed for all entities known to produce restricted diffusion in the cortex excluding stroke between January 2012 and June 2022. Initial MRI studies performed upon onset of clinical symptoms were screened for the split ADC sign. RESULTS: 25 subjects were encountered with a positive split ADC sign (15 female; median age = 57 years, range 18-82). Diagnosis included six herpes simplex encephalitis, three peri-ictal MRI changes, eight PRES, two MELAS, and six autoimmune (3 anti-GABAAR, two seronegative, and one anti-Ma2/Ta). Subjects were imaged at a mean 1.8 days after the onset of symptoms (range 0-8). DISCUSSION: We present a novel visual MRI biomarker, the split ADC sign, and highlight its potential usefulness in subjects with encephalopathy to suggest acute disease onset or to raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology when location-based criteria are applied. When positive, the sign was present on the initial MRI and can therefore be used to help focus further clinical and laboratory workup.
36905963		Genetic aberration analysis of mitochondrial respiratory complex I implications in the development of neurological disorders and their clinical significance.Growing neurological diseases pose difficult challenges for modern medicine to diagnose and manage them effectively. Many neurological disorders mainly occur due to genetic alteration in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, mitochondrial genes exhibit a higher rate of mutation due to the generation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative phosphorylation operating in their vicinity. Among the different complexes of Electron transport chain (ETC), NADH: Ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Mitochondrial complex I) is the most important. This multimeric enzyme, composed of 44 subunits, is encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. It often exhibits mutations resulting in development of various neurological diseases. The most prominent diseases include leigh syndrome (LS), leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), myoclonic epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preliminary data suggest that mitochondrial complex I subunit genes mutated are frequently of nuclear origin; however, most of the mtDNA gene encoding subunits are also primarily involved. In this review, we have discussed the genetic origins of neurological disorders involving mitochondrial complex I and signified recent approaches to unravel the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials and their management.
37474167		Efficacy of high-intensity versus low-intensity psychoanalytically oriented long-term treatments and determinants of outcome: individual participant data Meta-analysis of Long-term Analytic treatment Studies (MeLAS).INTRODUCTION: Long-term psychodynamic/psychoanalytic psychotherapy (LTPP) is a prevalent treatment option for complex mental disorders. Yet, little is known about the role of treatment intensity in LTPP. We present a study protocol for a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis aggregating and analysing individual data from randomised and quasi-experimental trials by meta-analysis. The purpose is to (1) determine the treatment effectiveness of LTPP with low versus high intensity (up to 2 weekly sessions vs three or more), (2) compare their joint effectiveness to shorter therapies and treatments as usual, (3) identify predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes and (4) determine reciprocal relationships between different outcome domains (symptomatic and structural/personality change) over the courses of LTPP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We include studies from (randomised controlled trial, RCT) and quasi-experimental trials, where at least one condition was LTPP of high or low frequency. Long-term treatment is defined as >=1 year or >=50 sessions. To be eligible studies must include a standardised outcome measure of symptoms (global or disorder specific) with at least one proof of reliability. The primary outcome is symptom reduction (global or specific), secondary outcome criteria are reliable change, remission, functional capacities, personality, personality functioning and interpersonal pathology. Relevant studies will mainly be identified by searching relevant databases: PubMed, PsycINFO (via EBSCO), Web of Science (via Elsevier), Chochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Wiley). Risk of bias will be evaluated in line with the Cochrane assessments tools for quasi-experimental trials and RCTs, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Aggregation of data from primary trials collected based on ethics votes. Dissemination into clinical practice via open access publications of findings.

37221696	associate|@DISEASE_MELAS_Syndrome|@GENE_COX8A	A different pattern of clinical, muscle pathology and brain MRI findings in MELAS with mt-ND variants.OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) caused by mitochondrial DNA-encoded complex I subunit (mt-ND) variants. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical, myopathological and brain MRI features of patients with MELAS caused by mt-ND variants (MELAS-mtND) were collected and compared with those of MELAS patients carrying the m.3243A > G variant (MELAS-A3243G). RESULT: A total of 18 MELAS-mtND patients (female: 7; median age: 24.5 years) represented 15.9% (n = 113) of all patients with MELAS caused by mtDNA variants in our neuromuscular center from January 2012 to June 2022. In this MELAS-mtND cohort, the two most common variants were m.10191 T > C (4/18, 22.2%) and m.13513 G > A (3/18, 16.7%). The most frequent symptoms were seizures (14/18, 77.8%) and muscle weakness (11/18, 61.1%). Compared with 87 MELAS-A3243G patients, MELAS-mtND patients were significantly more likely to have a variant that was absent in blood cells (40% vs. 1.4%). Furthermore, MELAS-mtND patients had a significantly lower MDC score (7.8 +- 2.7 vs. 9.8 +- 1.9); less hearing loss (27.8% vs. 54.0%), diabetes (11.1% vs. 37.9%), and migraine (33.3% vs. 62.1%); less short stature (males <= 165 cm; females <= 155 cm; 23.1% vs. 60.8%) and higher body mass index (20.4 +- 2.5 vs. 17.8 +- 2.7). MELAS-mtND patients had significantly more normal muscle pathology (31.3% vs. 4.1%) and fewer RRFs/RBFs (62.5% vs. 91.9%), COX-deficient fibers/blue fibers (25.0% vs. 85.1%) and SSVs (50.0% vs. 81.1%). Moreover, brain MRI evaluated at the first stroke-like episode showed significantly more small cortical lesions in MELAS-mtND patients (66.7% vs. 12.2%). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggested that MELAS-mtND patients have distinct clinical, myopathological and brain MRI features compared with MELAS-A3243G patients.
