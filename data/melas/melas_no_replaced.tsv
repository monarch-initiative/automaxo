11119021	Ketoacidosis accompanied by epileptic seizures in a patient with diabetes mellitus and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We herein report a rare case of MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis. An 18-year-old female patient was diagnosed to have diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy was thereafter initiated. At 26 years of age, she was hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis, soon followed by a loss of consciousness, left-sided dysmetria, and ataxic speech. MELAS was diagnosed because of the presence of ragged red fibers in a muscle biopsy. At 33 years of age, she was admitted to our hospital because of ketoacidosis and partial status epilepticus. A blood gas examination revealed as follows; arterial pH, 6.88; bicarbonate, 2.1 mmol/l; base excess - 29.8 mmol/l. The serum level of glucose had also increased to 30 mmol/l. The serum levels of lactate and B-hydroxybutyrate were elevated to 11.4 mmol/l and 1,990 micromol/l, respectively. Ketoacidosis improved by fluid replacement and continuous intravenous insulin infusion. A brain MRI demonstrated hyperintensity areas on FLAIR images in the bilateral temporal lobes and the cerebellum. A proton MRS demonstrated the abnormal lactate accumulation in the bilateral temporal and occipital lobes. Since epileptic seizures are rare in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, such seizures may indicate the existence of MELAS syndrome.

24097000	Findings of 123I-iomazenil SPECT during and after stroke-like episodes in a patient with MELAS. Reduced cortical benzodiazepine receptor binding potential in late images of I-iomazenil SPECT indicates neuronal damage in the cortex. We present the case of a 31-year-old woman with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who had focal seizures in the right hand. FLAIR imaging in the ictal state revealed a high-intensity lesion in the left post-central gyrus, while I-iomazenil SPECT showed decreased tracer uptake in this lesion. The lesion completely disappeared on FLAIR imaging performed 1 month after the focal seizures; in contrast, I-iomazenil SPECT still revealed a significant decrease in tracer uptake in this lesion. 
17414868	Ocular motor disorders in mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acid and stroke-like episodes with the 3271 (T-C) point mutation in mitochondrial DNA. BACKGROUND: Ocular motor function can provide insights into areas of dysfunction within the nervous system. There are no published eye movement recordings in patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acid and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Our purpose in this study was to analyze the ocular motor features of a family with MELAS with a (T-C) mutation at nucleotide position 3271 in the mitochondrial tRNA-Leu gene. METHODS: The search coil method was used to record visually-guided saccades, antisaccades, and triangular pursuit tasks in the horizontal and vertical planes in three patients in a Japanese family with MELAS. RESULTS: The patients showed saccadic dysmetria and prolonged saccadic reaction times, deficits in the ability to suppress reflex eye movements, and increased reaction time during antisaccades, downbeat nystagmus, square wave jerks, and impairment in pursuit. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of eye movement recordings, patients with MELAS have frontal cortex as well as cerebellar dysfunction.
22921075	Blastocyst preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of a mitochondrial DNA disorder. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of trophectoderm biopsy for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of mitochondrial (mt) DNA mutation load. DESIGN: A PGD case and analysis of blastocyst mosaicism. SETTING: Academic center for reproductive medicine. PATIENT(S): A 30-year-old carrier of 35% 3243A>G mtDNA mutation load with a daughter affected by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. INTERVENTION(S): Blastocyst biopsy for PGD of mutation load and gender. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Variation in mutation load within and among embryos, and newborn mutation load after PGD-based selection. RESULT(S): Oocytes and embryos were found to possess a variety of 3243A>G mutation loads from 9% to 90% in oocytes and 7% to 91% in embryos, demonstrating that PGD would be a relevant procedure. Highly consistent results were obtained within multiple biopsies of both cleavage- and blastocyst-stage embryos. Importantly, mutation loads observed in trophectoderm were predictive of the inner cell mass (r(2) = 0.97). Transfer of a male embryo, predicted to possess 12% mutation load by analysis of a trophectoderm biopsy, resulted in the delivery of a boy with tissue-specific mutation loads ranging from undetectable to 15%. CONCLUSION(S): This study represents the first successful clinical application of PGD to reduce the transgenerational risk of transmitting an mtDNA disorder and supports the applicability of blastocyst trophectoderm PGD for carriers of mtDNA mutations attempting reproduction.
26960269	[A case of MELAS associated with histochemical findings of muscles characteristic of MERRF]. We here report a 39-year-old woman of short stature with sensorineural deafness, who suddenly developed status epilepticus. T2-weighed image of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a high signal lesion in the left temporal area, the distribution of which was not compatible with any particular arterial supply. Lactate and pyruvate were elevated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. As the mitochondrial gene analysis revealed the m.3243A>G mutation, diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode (MELAS) was made. In the histochemical study of a biopsied muscle, the intramuscular blood vessels reacted strongly with SDH (SSV), but the SSV was negative for cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the findings characteristic of myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF). This is the first case of MELAS in which the muscle histochemistry showed positive SSV unassociated with increased COX. 
25801712	Cerebral hyperperfusion and decreased cerebrovascular reactivity correlate with neurologic disease severity in MELAS. OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanisms underlying stroke-like episodes (SLEs) in MELAS syndrome. METHODS: We performed a case control study in 3 siblings with MELAS syndrome (m.3243A>G tRNA(Leu(UUR))) with variable % mutant mtDNA in blood (35 to 59%) to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) compared to age- and sex-matched healthy study controls and a healthy control population. Subjects were studied at 3T MRI using arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure CBF; CVR was measured as a change in % Blood Oxygen Level Dependent signal (as a surrogate of CBF) to repeated 10 mmHg step increase in arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2). RESULTS: MELAS siblings had decreased CVR (p <= 0.002) and increased CBF (p < 0.0026) compared to controls; changes correlated with disease severity and % mutant mtDNA (inversely for CVR: r = -0.82 frontal, r = -0.91 occipital cortex; directly for CBF: r = +0.85 frontal, not for occipital infarct penumbra). Mean CVR was reduced more in frontal (p < 0.001) versus occipital cortex (p = 0.002); mean CBF was increased more in occipital (p = 0.001) than frontal (p = 0.0026) cortices compared to controls. CBF correlated inversely with CVR (r = -0.99 in frontal; not in occipital infarct penumbra) suggesting that increased frontal resting flows are at the expense of flow reserve. INTERPRETATION: MELAS disease severity and mutation load were inversely correlated with Interictal CVR and directly correlated with frontal CBF. These metrics offer further insight into the cerebrovascular hemodynamics in MELAS syndrome and may serve as noninvasive prognostic markers to stratify risk for SLEs. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: Class III.

15759134	Humanin detected in skeletal muscles of MELAS patients: a possible new therapeutic agent. Humanin (HN) was originally identified as an endogenous peptide that protects neuronal cells from apoptosis induced by various types of Alzheimer's disease-related insults. We have previously indicated that HN increases cellular ATP levels and speculated that this peptide may rescue energy-deficient cells in mitochondrial disorders. Here, we report, for the first time, increased HN expression in skeletal muscles from patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). HN was strongly positive in all ragged-red fibers (RRFs) and some non-RRFs, and most of them were type 1 fibers generally requiring higher energy than type 2 fibers. HN in these fibers was localized in mitochondria. HN expression was also increased in small arteries that strongly reacted for succinate dehydrogenase. Our experiments on muscular TE671 cells indicated the possibility that synthesized HN increases cellular ATP levels by directly acting on mitochondria. From these in vivo and in vitro findings, we propose that HN expression might be induced in response to the energy crisis within affected fibers and vessels in MELAS muscles and further be a possible therapeutic candidate for MELAS.
33713868	Vessel flow void sign and hyperintense vessel sign on FLAIR images distinguish between MELAS and AIS. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the vessel signs, including the Vessel Flow Void Sign (VFVS) and the Hyperintense Vessel Sign (HVS) in Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images during the differentiation of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS) in Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS). METHODS: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of 13 MELAS and 20 AIS patients were obtained during the acute stage of the diseases (median time to scan <1 day from symptom onset). To evaluate VFVS and HVS on the FLAIR images, Logistic Regression was used to analyze their correlation with MELAS. Then, a new scale of scoring, involving two aspects (VFVS and HVS) on FLAIR images was established. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the efficacy of the developed criterion. RESULTS: FLAIR images from 12 of the 13 MELAS patients exhibited VFVS while none exhibited HVS. Moreover, FLAIR images from 3 of the 20 AIS patients exhibited VFVS while 17 exhibited HVS. Logistic Regression showed that VFVS and the absence of HVS (NoHVS) were independent MELAS predictors. If there were VFVS, the patient scored 2 points, while there were NoHVS, the patient scored 1 point. Patients with >1.5 scores were prone to be MELAS, while patients with <1.5 scores were prone to be AIS. Sensitivity was found to be 92.3%, specificity was 85%, with an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: We have established a new scoring criterion, with a high sensitivity and specificity, for differentiating between MELAS and AIS in patients during the acute stage.
26341968	Magnetic resonance imaging correlates of genetically characterized patients with mitochondrial disorders: A study from south India. BACKGROUND: Large studies analyzing magnetic resonance imaging correlates in different genotypes of mitochondrial disorders are far and few. This study sought to analyze the pattern of magnetic resonance imaging findings in a cohort of genetically characterized patients with mitochondrial disorders. METHODS: The study cohort included 33 patients (age range 18 months-50 years, M:F - 0.9:1) with definite mitochondrial disorders seen over a period of 8 yrs. (2006-2013). Their MR imaging findings were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The patients were classified into three groups according to the genotype, Mitochondrial point mutations and deletions (n=21), SURF1 mutations (n=7) and POLG1 (n=5). The major findings included cerebellar atrophy (51.4%), cerebral atrophy (24.2%), signal changes in basal ganglia (45.7%), brainstem (34.2%) & white matter (18.1%) and stroke like lesions (25.7%). Spinal cord imaging showed signal changes in 4/6 patients. Analysis of the special sequences revealed, basal ganglia mineralization (7/22), lactate peak on magnetic resonance spectrometry (10/15), and diffusion restriction (6/22). Follow-up images in six patients showed that the findings are dynamic. Comparison of the magnetic resonance imaging findings in the three groups showed that cerebral atrophy and cerebellar atrophy, cortical signal changes and basal ganglia mineralization were seen mostly in patients with mitochondrial mutation. Brainstem signal changes with or without striatal lesions were characteristically noted in SURF1 group. There was no consistent imaging pattern in POLG1 group. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance imaging findings in mitochondrial disorders are heterogeneous. Definite differences were noted in the frequency of anatomical involvement in the three groups. Familiarity with the imaging findings in different genotypes of mitochondrial disorders along with careful analysis of the family history, clinical presentation, biochemical findings, histochemical and structural analysis will help the physician for targeted metabolic and genetic testing.
11240563	Involvement of nervous system in maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) with the A3243G mutation of mitochondrial DNA. OBJECTIVES: The A3243G mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been associated with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) in a number of reports; however, the involvement of the nervous system has rarely been mentioned, prompting this exploration of the manifestation of neurological disorders in MIDD cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated four generations of a large Taiwanese family in which MIDD is manifest. We conducted a series of clinical examinations, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, brain 99mTc-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cognitive function tests, and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies. Blood levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate, pathology of muscle biopsy samples and proportions of mutant mtDNA in blood cells, hair follicles, muscle and skin were also analyzed. Mean follow-up period was 4 years. RESULTS: The patients exhibited the clinical features of diabetes mellitus including sensorineural hearing loss, short stature, and/or histories of spontaneous abortion. No stroke-like episodes were reported. Analysis for mtDNA revealed that the A3243G mutation existed in 11 members (6 symptomatic and 5 asymptomatic members) of this MIDD-prone family, with the proportion of mutant mtDNA ranging from 21% to 47% in leukocytes. Head CT revealed diffuse brain atrophy for all 6 (100%) patients examined and bilateral basal ganglia calcification in 4 of 6 (67%) patients. Brain 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT revealed diminished uptake in the bilateral parieto-occipital or occipital regions for all 6 tested patients, cognitive function for these patients was normal. Results of head CT and SPECT were normal in one asymptomatic member of the family. One muscle biopsy revealed abundant ragged-red fibers with modified Gomori-trichrome stain. Muscle-enzyme activity and serum-lactate levels were normal. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that a wide spectrum of sub clinical pathologies of the central nervous system and muscle are present for this MIDD-prone family, none of whom developed typical MELAS during the 4-year period of follow-up study.
32679169	Altered spontaneous brain activity at attack and remission stages in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS): Beyond stroke-like lesions. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) may cause whole-brain functional changes due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Our purpose is to comprehensively evaluate the alterations of spontaneous brain activity in MELAS patients at stroke-like episodes (SLE) attack and remission stages using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Forty MELAS patients at attack stage (n = 20) and remission stage (n = 20) and 22 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. We suggested that MELAS patients presented decreased spontaneous brain activities beyond the areas of stroke-like lesions (SLLs), with a downward trend from SLE attack stage to remission stage. In addition, the regional spontaneous activity of SLL, an inherent change in MELAS, was less than that in unaffected areas. Furthermore, the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations value in left precuneus may be used as a promising neuroimaging biomarker for monitoring the disease status of MELAS.
11820406	Lingual ultrastructure of the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas). Microscopic studies on the cetacean tongue are limited and, to date, only a few ultrastructural reports on dolphins have been published. This report presents the initial description of the lingual ultrastructure of the long-finned pilot whale. The lingual integumental surface was smooth, lacking papillae, although flaking of outer stratum corneum cells could be observed at high resolution. The keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum of the epidermis resembled those of cetacean skin on other regions of the body. The similarities included the presence of cytoplasmic lipid droplets around the nuclei of stratutm spinosum cells, a lingual feature not seen in terrestrial mammals. Keratin intermediate filaments were numerous and occasionally formed aggregates of circular whorls. At cell surfaces, bundles of keratin intermediate filaments were frequently observed inserting into desmosomal plaques. Pigment granules were not evident and organelles were sparse. Stratum corneal cells contained nuclear remnants (parakeratosis) and small multivesicular bodies, and the corneal layer was approximately 18 cells thick. The nuclei of the stratum basale keratinocytes possessed exceptionally numerous and deep clefts. The dermis was nondistinctive. The skeletal muscle of the tongue was arranged in widely separated fasiculi containing small numbers of muscle fibres. Typical fine structure of skeletal muscle bands and tubular elements was observed by transmission electron microscopy.
15519124	Paralytic ileus in MELAS with phenotypic features of MNGIE. This report describes a child having the syndrome of overlapping phenotypic features of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE). Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed a point mutation at position A3243G, whereas activity of thymidine phosphorylase and its corresponding gene analysis were normal. The most striking feature of this case was paralysis of one segment of the terminal ileum observed on laparotomy. The electron microscopic findings of the resected ileum and colon by limited right hemicolectomy disclosed accumulation of numerous enlarged mitochondria with ill-defined cristae which were similar to mitochondria reported in three previous MELAS cases and one MNGIE case with intestinal dysmotility. We emphasize that the MELAS and MNGIE phenotypes overlapped in this case and that the mechanism of acute ileus in MELAS was associated with functional paralysis of the intestine.
17428710	Siblings with infantile cerebral stroke and delayed multivessel involvement--a new hereditary vasculopathy? We describe an unusual vasculopathy in two sisters of non-consanguineous parents. The first child developed an acute hemiparesis and focal seizures at the age of 6 months during a febrile illness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed bilateral cortical-subcortical infarction not confined to a vascular territory. Subsequently, the child had a persistent stable neurological deficit. Her younger sister had a similar encephalitis-like episode at the age of 4 months, with left-sided cortical-subcortical ischaemic lesions. Two months later she had left-sided focal seizures. MRI showed a right-sided cortical enhancement, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was normal. The neurological deficit was stable and she was seizure free. These episodes were initially interpreted as metabolic strokes, but work-up was normal and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) was excluded. In their teens both sisters were diagnosed with pulmonary and systemic hypertension and, due to the arterial hypertension, myocardial hypertrophy. Renal artery stenosis, pathological pulmonary arteries, and stenosis and rarefication of coronary arteries were found; the aorta and retinal vessels were normal. Repeat cranial MRI and MRA showed multiple collaterals, while the carotid and basilar arteries were extremely narrowed (moyamoya appearance). We suggest the diagnosis is a hereditary systemic vasculopathy of unknown origin.
27348222	Differential diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and ischemic stroke using 3D pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of 3D pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (3D pCASL) in the differential diagnosis between mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 3D pCASL perfusion data were obtained on a 3.0T MR scanner in 16 newly appearing lesions in nine patients with MELAS and 14 acute lesions in 12 patients with AIS. A postlabeling delay (PLD) time of 2025 msec was applied. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) values were measured in the central part and the peripheral part of the lesions and the CBF values were compared between MELAS and AIS patients. RESULTS: The lesions of both MELAS and AIS showed high signal intensity on T2 WI and demonstrated hyperintensity on DWI. Compared with the perfusion defects or hypoperfusion in all AIS, hyperperfusion was revealed in 16 acute MELAS lesions, especially in the peripheral part of the lesions. The CBF values of 16 lesions in MELAS were 11.20-73.11 ml/100g/min in the central part and 65.33-169.11 ml/100g/min in the peripheral part. The CBF values of 14 lesions in AIS were 12.32-19.94 ml/100g/min in the central part and 11.66-18.37 ml/100g/min in the peripheral part. The CBF value of the peripheral part (119.80 +- 35.41) in MELAS was significantly higher than that (14.66 +- 2.61) in AIS (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The whole-brain 3D pCASL technique might be useful in differentiating MELAS from AIS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2017;45:199-206.
15164411	Prenatal diagnosis of a fetus harboring an intermediate load of the A3243G mtDNA mutation in a maternal carrier diagnosed with MELAS syndrome. We prenatally diagnosed MELAS syndrome in a fetus whose mother and older brother had the MELAS-specific A3243G mutation. The mutant mtDNA level of the amniotic fluid cells was not significantly different from that of the postnatal peripheral blood and hair follicle samples. The obstetrical course was uncomplicated except for transient exacerbation of the mother's diabetes, which required insulin control. At term, the infant was macrosomic, and the delivery was complicated by shoulder dystocia. MELAS syndrome in itself does not influence either the prenatal course of the mother or the fetal outcome. In contrast to the fulminating clinical course of this mother's first child, MELAS symptoms did not develop in her second child until age four, despite similar high tissue levels of mutant mtDNA. The phenotypic diversity in two offspring with similar higher levels of mutant mtDNA suggests that prenatal genetic diagnosis of cultured amniotic cells may yield results that are poor prognosticators of fetal outcome.

38013338	Prolonged misdiagnosis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome: A case report. RATIONALE: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a subset of rare mitochondrial diseases characterized by diverse clinical manifestations, which often complicates its diagnosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: This report chronicles the experiences of a 14-year-old female patient who underwent multiple misdiagnoses before the eventual identification of MELAS syndrome. Her journey began with symptoms that included growth retardation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and epilepsy. DIAGNOSIS: The definitive diagnosis of MELAS syndrome was established through genetic confirmation, revealing a mutation in the MT-TL1 gene (m.3242A > G). INTERVENTIONS: Upon diagnosis, the patient received targeted symptomatic treatment, which led to pronounced improvements in her symptoms. OUTCOMES: The patient's condition stabilized with the administered treatments, and she exhibited significant symptom relief, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. LESSONS: This case underscores the imperative for heightened clinical vigilance and thorough differential diagnosis in the face of complex clinical presentations, such as those seen in MELAS syndrome, to ensure timely and appropriate interventions.
12862181	Autometallographic tracing of mercury in pilot whale tissues in the Faroe Islands. OBJECTIVES: Autometallography (AMG) was applied for tracing mercury in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) harvested in the Faroe Islands. RESULTS: Ample mercury accumulation was found in kidney tubules, in contrast to the largely unstained glomeruli. Hepatocytes, as well as liver macrophages, exhibited high mercury uptake. The muscle tissue accumulated only scant amounts of mercury, primarily around the nuclei of the striated muscle cells. At the ultrastructural level, mercury was found to accumulate intracellularly in lysosomes, and extracellularly in the basement membranes of vessels. The results were verified by proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) analysis, and it was established that the tissue contained no other AMG traceable metals. CONCLUSION: The use of AMG analysis on autopsies and biopsies is suggested as a tool for evaluating mercury pollution.
17635468	Lactate quantification by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy using a clinical MRI machine: a basic study. The purpose of this study was to establish quantification method of lactate concentration by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) carried out using a conventional 1.5-T MRI machine. We used a lactate phantom with known concentrations (1, 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 14 mmol/L). As a clinical example, a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) was evaluated. Proton MRS was carried out using a clinical 1.5-T super-conducting magnetic resonance whole-body system. Data were acquired by point resolved spectroscopy. A coupling constant of J = 7.35 Hz (2/J = 272 ms) and two long in-phase echo time of 272 ms and 544 ms were used to calculate the T2 relaxation time. The tissue water signal was used as an internal standard to quantify lactate. The correlation coefficient R between the calculated lactate concentrations and the known concentration of lactate was 0.99 with a constant factor of 0.32 (1/3.14). In patients with MELAS, the lactate concentration measured by MRS was 6.2 mmol/kg wet weight, which is similar to the value obtained in previous studies. In the present study, we have established a reliable method for lactate quantification in a phantom study and have shown a sample of clinical case of MELAS.
27476418	Movement disorders in mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial diseases (MIDs) are a large group of heterogeneous disorders due to mutations in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA) genes, the latter encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial function. A multisystem clinical picture that involves several organs, including both the peripheral and central nervous systems, is a common presentation of MID. Movement disorders, even isolated ones, are not rare. Cerebellar ataxia is common in myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERFF) due to mutations in the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) lysine gene, in Kearns-Sayre syndrome due to mtDNA deletions, in sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO) due to nuclear POLG1 gene mutations, and also in ARCA2, Friedreich's ataxia, SPG7, SCA28 and autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) due to mutations in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial morphology or function. Myoclonus is a key feature of MERFF, but may also be encountered in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), ARCA2, POLG1 mutations and Leigh syndrome. Dystonia is common in Leigh syndrome (which may be caused by 75 different genes) and in Leber hereditary ocular neuropathy (LHON) plus disease, due to mutations in mtDNA genes that encode subunits of NADH dehydrogenase, as well as in ARCA2, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MPAN) and POLG1 mutations. Other movement disorders are rarer (such as parkinsonism, tremor, chorea). Although parkinsonism is more frequent in POLG1 mutations, and myoclonus in MERFF, most movement disorders are found either isolated or combined in numerous MIDs. The presence of associated neurological signs, whether central or peripheral, or of evocative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities (striatal necrosis) should prompt a search for MID. In cases of a particular clinical spectrum (LHON, MERFF, Kearns-Sayre, SANDO, SPG7, ARCA2, ARSACS), a search for the most frequently implicated mutation(s) is recommended. In other cases, muscle biopsies followed by metabolic and genetic studies may be useful for arriving at a diagnosis.
26159306	MitoTALEN: A General Approach to Reduce Mutant mtDNA Loads and Restore Oxidative Phosphorylation Function in Mitochondrial Diseases. We have designed mitochondrially targeted transcription activator-like effector nucleases or mitoTALENs to cleave specific sequences in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with the goal of eliminating mtDNA carrying pathogenic point mutations. To test the generality of the approach, we designed mitoTALENs to target two relatively common pathogenic mtDNA point mutations associated with mitochondrial diseases: the m.8344A>G tRNA(Lys) gene mutation associated with myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) and the m.13513G>A ND5 mutation associated with MELAS/Leigh syndrome. Transmitochondrial cybrid cells harbouring the respective heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations were transfected with the respective mitoTALEN and analyzed after different time periods. MitoTALENs efficiently reduced the levels of the targeted pathogenic mtDNAs in the respective cell lines. Functional assays showed that cells with heteroplasmic mutant mtDNA were able to recover respiratory capacity and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes activity after transfection with the mitoTALEN. To improve the design in the context of the low complexity of mtDNA, we designed shorter versions of the mitoTALEN specific for the MERRF m.8344A>G mutation. These shorter mitoTALENs also eliminated the mutant mtDNA. These reductions in size will improve our ability to package these large sequences into viral vectors, bringing the use of these genetic tools closer to clinical trials. 
10953189	Cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in mitochondrial disorders. OBJECTIVE: To investigate cerebral metabolism by 2-[18F]fluorodeoxy-d-glucose (FDG) uptake using PET and cerebrovascular reverse capacity by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in different mitochondrial diseases (mitochondrial myopathy; mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactacidosis, and stroke-like episodes [MELAS]; and chronic external ophthalmoplegia). BACKGROUND: Previous studies on individual patients with mitochondriopathies revealed abnormal accumulations of mitochondria in endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and pericytes of blood vessels in different parts of the nervous system (cerebrum, cerebellum, sural nerve) and skeletal muscle. On this basis, some investigators suggested a pathogenic role of vascular involvement in the MELAS syndrome and other encephalopathies. smhd1 DESIGN/METHODS: The authors investigated neuronal metabolism and cerebrovascular involvement with PET in 5 cases and with TCD with acetazolamide stimulation in 15 cases. The patients were divided into three groups: 1) interictal MELAS (n = 4); 2) progressive external ophthalmoplegia (n = 6); and 3) pure mitochondrial myopathy and neuropathy (n = 5). The results were compared with those from matched normal control subjects. The diagnoses were based on clinical phenotype as well as histopathologic and molecular analysis. RESULTS: Cerebral glucose uptake was impaired in all patients, both with and without CNS symptoms, particularly in the occipital and temporal lobes. The vasoreactivity of the small arterioles to acetazolamide did not differ significantly between the patients and healthy control subjects or between the different groups of mitochondrial disorders. CONCLUSIONS: MELAS does not appear to be a functional disturbance of arterioles leading to an ischemic vascular event. The clinical symptoms in MELAS are not the result of a mitochondrial angiopathy but are the consequences of a mitochondrial cytopathy affecting neurons or glia. There is no correlation between the decreased glucose metabolism and the duration of the disease.
19234880	Aortic distensibility alterations in adults with m.3243A>G MELAS gene mutation. PRINCIPLES: MELAS, or mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes is a new distinctive clinical entity. The current study was designed to assess ascending aortic elasticity in adult patients with MELAS syndrome and in gene carriers, and to compare the results with age- and gender-matched healthy controls. METHODS: The study comprised eight patients with MELAS syndrome and four asymptomatic gene carriers. All subjects underwent complete 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography, and systolic and diastolic ascending aortic diameters (SD and DD respectively) were recorded in M-mode 3 cm above the aortic valve from a parasternal long-axis view. Aortic elastic properties were calculated using aortic data and forearm blood pressure values. RESULTS: SD and DD of MELAS patients and gene carriers were enlarged compared with controls. Aortic stiffness index was increased (16.4+/-3.7 vs 3.6+/-1.1, p=0.00001), while aortic strain (0.035+/-0.012% vs 0.146+/-0.050%, p=0.00002) and aortic distensibility (1.03+/-0.30 cm2/dynes 10(-6) vs 4.70+/-1.69 cm2/dynes 10(-6), p=0.0002) were decreased in MELAS patients compared with controls. Aortic elastic properties of gene carriers were between MELAS patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Increased ascending aortic stiffness and enlarged aortic dimensions suggesting vascular remodelling were found in MELAS patients as compared with controls.
33743431	Synchrotron X-ray phase contrast micro tomography to explore the morphology of abdominal organs in Pterostichus melas italicus Dejean, 1828 (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Micro-computer tomography imaging is a fast and non-destructive data acquisition technique which can replace or complement the traditional investigation methodologies used in entomology to study morphology. In this paper, Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Phase-Contrast micro tomography (SR-PhC micro-CT) was combined with histology and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations to describe the abdominal organs of Pterostichus melas italicus Dejean, 1828 (Coleoptera, Carabidae). This species was used as a representative model because of its ecological role as a generalist predator in agroecosystems. SR-PhC micro-CT allowed us to identify in situ abdominal structures including dorsal vessel, digestive tract with Malpighian tubules, male reproductive system, ganglia, fat bodies, pygidial glands, muscles and tracheae. The histology was performed to define the tissue organization of the digestive and reproductive systems. SR-PhC micro-CT and 3D rendering provided more accurate information on shape and size of organs than histological and SEM analyses, respectively. The finding of this study was to describe the anatomy and histology of organs involved in crucial life history traits, such as reproduction, nutrition and excretion. High quality images and the supplementary video represent a significant advance in knowledge of the carabid anatomy and are a baseline for future research.
11171912	Atypical MELAS syndrome associated with a new mitochondrial tRNA glutamine point mutation. The authors studied a 47-year-old patient who presented with an association of deafness, acute cerebral stroke-like episode, leukoencephalopathy, and extensive basal ganglia calcifications. Late onset and neuroradiologic findings were atypical for MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Strokelike episodes). A heteroplasmic G to A transition at nucleotide 4332 in the tRNA glutamine gene was identified in the patient's muscle mitochondrial DNA. The pathogenicity of the mutation was shown in single muscle fibers by the correlation between high mutation load and cytochrome c oxidase defect.
17294289	Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome with hypothyroidism and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in a paediatric patient. Herein, we report on a paediatric patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who was hospitalized for acute on chronic renal insufficiency, seizures and deterioration of the level of consciousness. She also had hypertension, hypothyroidism and nephrotic range proteinuria. Kidney biopsy revealed many sclerotic glomeruli and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Glomerulopathy is rare in patients with MELAS, and FSGS has been reported only in a few patients. The histopathological features of the renal biopsy suggested that the aetiology of the FSGS may have been secondary to chronic renal injury rather than from a primary immunologic cause. Moreover, our case is unique in that, the coexistence of MELAS, hypothalamic hypothyroidism and FSGS has not been reported in the past. The purpose of this report is to increase the awareness of health-care professionals, especially in the fields of paediatrics, neurology, endocrinology and nephrology, regarding the manifestations and complications of MELAS.
12705915	Elements in fish of Malibu Creek and Malibu Lagoon near Los Angeles, California. Our aim was to assess whether past discharges from a wastewater treatment plant increased metal pollutant loads in stream mobile species in a one-day baseline sampling study that included a coastal wetland. Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) of two sizes, black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), and crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) were collected from Malibu Creek, and California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis) of three sizes, as well as arroyo chub (Gila orcutti) were sampled from Malibu Lagoon near Los Angeles, California. Species from each locality were pooled by length, homogenized, digested by microwave wet ashing, and analyzed by simultaneous inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy for 27 elements. Lagoon killifish 2.0-3.5 cm long contained levels of arsenic and lead above the levels for 95% of California fish, the EDL95. Black bullhead upstream of the discharge contained elevated levels of As, Cr and Se. Young mosquitofish <3 cm in length upstream of the discharge differed greatly in the order of abundance of their elements relative to larger mosquitofish and to other species collected. More sampling than this baseline study allowed was needed to determine if the wastewater treatment plant was a pollution source.
20191046	Clinical spectrum and prognostic factors of acute necrotizing encephalopathy in children. This study was conducted to investigate the etiology, the clinical characteristics and prognosis of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) in Korean children. Six children (1 yr to 7 yr) patients with ANE were enrolled. They were diagnosed by clinical and radiological characteristics and their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. In a search of clinically plausible causes, brain MRI in all patients, mitochondrial DNA studies for mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) and myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF) in four patients, and genomic typing on HLA DRB/HLA DQB genes in three patients were performed. All had precedent illnesses and the main initial symptoms included mental change (83%), seizures (50%), and focal deficits (50%). MRI revealed increased T2 signal density in the bilateral thalami and/or the brainstem in all patients. Mitochodrial DNA studies for MELAS and MERRF were negative in those children and HLA-DRB1*1401, HLA-DRB3*0202, and HLA-DQB1*0502 seemed to be significant. A high dose steroid was given to all patients, which seemed to be partly effective except for 2 patients. In conclusion, ANE is relatively rare, but can result in serious neurological complication in children. Early detection and appropriate treatment may lead to a better neurological outcome.
15319559	Post-ictal recovery of anarthria and weakness in MELAS syndrome. 
37698258	Coating-Free Culture Medium for Establishing and Maintaining Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. Cell expansion of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) commonly depends on Matrigel as a coating matrix on two-dimensional (2D) culture plates and 3D microcarriers. However, the xenogenic Matrigel requires sophisticated quality-assurance processes to meet clinical requirements. In this study, we develop an innovative coating-free medium for expanding hPSCs. The xenofree medium supports the weekend-free culture and competitive growth of hPSCs on several cell culture plastics without an additional pre-coating process. The pluripotent stemness of the expanded cells is stably sustained for more than 10 passages, featured with high pluripotent marker expressions, normal karyotyping, and differentiating capacity for three germ layers. The expression levels of some integrins are reduced, compared with those of the hPSCs on Matrigel. This medium also successfully supports the clonal expansion and induced pluripotent stem cell establishment from mitochondrial-defective MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This innovative hPSC medium provides a straightforward scale-up process for producing clinical-orientated hPSCs by excluding the conventional coating procedure.

25446397	GDF15 is a novel biomarker to evaluate efficacy of pyruvate therapy for mitochondrial diseases. Pyruvate therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases. To identify novel biomarkers for diagnosis and to evaluate therapeutic efficacy, we performed microarray analysis of 2SD cybrid cells harboring a MELAS-causing mutation and control cells treated with either lactate or pyruvate. We found that expression and secretion of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) were increased in 2SD cells treated with lactate and that serum GDF15 levels were significantly higher in patients with mitochondrial diseases than in those with other diseases, suggesting that GDF15 could be a useful marker for diagnosis and evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of pyruvate.
31386302	Exploring mTOR inhibition as treatment for mitochondrial disease. Leigh syndrome and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) are two of the most frequent pediatric mitochondrial diseases. Both cause severe morbidity and neither have effective treatment. Inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been shown in model mice of Leigh syndrome to extend lifespan and attenuate both the clinical and pathological progression of disease. Based on this observation, we treated two children with everolimus, a rapamycin analogue. The child with Leigh syndrome showed sustained benefit, while the child with MELAS failed to respond and died of progressive disease. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying these disparate responses to mTOR inhibition.
31525702	Individual dietary intervention in adult patients with mitochondrial disease due to the m.3243 A>G mutation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an individually tailored dietary intervention on personalized goals, body composition (BC), functioning, and quality of life (QoL) in adult patients with mitochondrial disease (MD) due to the m.3243 A>G mutation. METHODS: This explorative randomized controlled trial included 39 patients with MD. The intervention group (n = 20) received an individually tailored dietary intervention over a 6-mo period. The control group (n = 19) received standard care over a 6-mo timeframe (control period), followed by an individually tailored dietary intervention for the next 6 mo (intervention period). Nutritional assessment and QoL measurements were performed at 3-mo intervals. Personalized treatment goals of the patients with MD were evaluated at 3 and 6 mo during the dietary intervention. Achievement of the personalized goals was assessed using descriptive statistics and mixed models. Linear mixed models were used to test the effect of the dietary intervention on continuous outcomes. RESULTS: The personal goals of patients were significantly more frequently achieved in the intervention group than in the control group. After 3 mo of intervention, 57% of the goals were achieved. Most goals were achieved for BC, handgrip strength (HGS), and gastrointestinal complaints. Intervention increased HGS (P = 0.037), the vitality component of QoL (P = 0.026), and decreased the fatigue score (P = 0.024) after 3 mo of treatment. Effects did not seem to last after 3 mo, however. CONCLUSION: An individually tailored dietary intervention is promising to achieve personalized goals of patients with MD, especially with regard to BC, HGS, and gastrointestinal complaints. The intervention also improves QoL, and decreases fatigue.
26071345	Enterovirus D68-associated community-acquired pneumonia in children living in Milan, Italy. BACKGROUND: An increasing number of children infected by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and affected by severe respiratory illness, muscle weakness and paralysis were described in the USA and Canada in 2014 OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential involvement of EV-D68 in determining community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalised children in order to acquire information concerning the clinical problems associated with EV-D68 in Italy. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective study of children hospitalised for CAP in the largest Pediatric Department in Milan, Italy, was carried out between 1 June and 31 December 2014. All of the children's admission nasopharyngeal swabs were investigated for the presence of EV-D68. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six children with radiographically confirmed CAP were hospitalised during the 7-month study period: 97 (55.1%) had enterovirus/rhinovirus-positive nasopharyngeal samples, including four (2.3%) positive for EV-D68. These four samples were collected between 9 and 21 October, a month in which 21 cases of CAP were recorded. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the sequences fell into clade B. The most severe case was diagnosed in a 14-year-old girl with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome), who died after 12 days of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: EV-D68 was detected in few children with usually mild-to-moderate lower respiratory tract infection, although the disease lead to the death of a girl with a severe chronic underlying disease. Further studies capable of better defining the epidemiological, genetic and pathogenetic characteristics of the virus are required in order to be able to prepare appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures.
26001801	Characteristic cardiac phenotypes are detected by cardiovascular magnetic resonance in patients with different clinical phenotypes and genotypes of mitochondrial myopathy. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial myopathies (MM) are a heterogeneous group of inherited conditions resulting from a primary defect in the mitochondrial respiratory chain with consecutively impaired cellular energy metabolism. Small sized studies using mainly electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography have revealed cardiac abnormalities ranging from conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias to hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy in these patients. Recently, characteristic patterns of cardiac involvement were documented by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)/Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) and with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The present study aimed to characterize the prevalence and pattern of cardiac abnormalities and to test the additional diagnostic value of CMR in this patient population. The hypothesis that different neuromuscular MM syndromes present with different cardiac disease phenotypes was evaluated. METHODS: Sixty-four MM patients (50 +- 15 years, 44% male) and 25 matched controls (52 +- 14 years, 36% male) prospectively underwent cardiac evaluations including CMR (comprising cine- and late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging). Based on the neuromuscular phenotype and genotype, the patients were grouped: (a) CPEO/KSS (N = 33); (b) MELAS/-like (N = 11); c) myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) (N = 3) and d) other non-specific MM forms (N = 17). RESULTS: Among the 64 MM patients, 34 (53%) had at least one abnormal CMR finding: 18 (28%) demonstrated an impaired left ventricular ejection-fraction (LV-EF <60%), 14 (22%) had unexplained LV hypertrophy and 21 (33%) were LGE-positive. Compared to controls, MM patients showed significantly higher maximal wall thickness (10 +- 3 vs. 8 +- 2 mm, p = 0.005) and concentricity (LV mass to end-diastolic volume: 0.84 +- 0.27 vs. 0.67 +- 0.11, p < 0.0001) with frequent presence of non-ischemic LGE (30% vs. 0%, p = 0.001). CPEO/KSS showed a predominantly intramural pattern of LGE mostly confined to the basal LV inferolateral wall (8/10; 80%) in addition to a tendency toward concentric remodelling. MELAS/-like patients showed the highest frequency of cardiac disease (in 10/11 (91%)), a mostly concentric LV hypertrophy (6/9; 67%) with or without LV systolic dysfunction and a predominantly focal, patchy LGE equally distributed among LV segments (8/11; 73%). Patients with MERRF and non-specific MM had no particular findings. Pathological CMR findings indicating cardiac involvement were detected significantly more often than pathological ECG results or elevated cardiac serum biomarkers (34 (53%) vs. 18 (28%) vs. 21 (33%); p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Cardiac involvement is a frequent finding in MM patients - and particularly present in KSS/CPEO as well as MELAS/-like patients. Despite a high variability in clinical presentation, CPEO/KSS patients typically show an intramural pattern of LGE in the basal inferolateral wall whereas MELAS patients are characterized by overt concentric hypertrophy and a rather unique, focally accentuated and diffusely distributed LGE.
17896266	Pregnancy with mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome) leading to confusion in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. 
25159128	Mutation-free baby born from a mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome carrier after blastocyst trophectoderm preimplantation genetic diagnosis. To investigate the applicability of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), we used trophectoderm (TE) biopsy to determine the mutation load in a 35-year-old female with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS). Transfer of a mutation-free blastocyst gave birth to a healthy boy with undetectable mutation in any of the analyzed tissues. We found strong correlation among TE cells (r=0.90) within blastocysts and also between cytoplasmic fragments and TE (r=0.95). This is the first case of mutation-free baby born from a MELAS patient after TE biopsy and supports the applicability of blastocyst PGD for patients with mtDNA disorders to establish healthy offspring. 
28818358	Black Toenail Sign in MELAS Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder often causing progressive brain injury that is not confined to large arterial territories. Severe insults ultimately lead to gyral necrosis affecting the cortex and juxtacortical white matter; the neuroimaging correlate is partial gyral signal suppression on T2/FLAIR sequences that resemble black toenails. We aimed to characterize the imaging features and the natural history of MELAS-related gyral necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Databases at two children's hospitals were searched for brain magnetic resonance imaging studies of individuals with MELAS. Examinations with motion artifact and those lacking T2/FLAIR sequences were excluded. The location, the cumulative number, and the maximum transverse diameter of necrotic gyral lesions were assessed using T2-weighted images and T2/FLAIR sequences. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to evaluate the relationship between disease duration and the number of necrotic lesions. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four examinations from patients with 14 unique MELAS patients (16 +- 3 years) were evaluated. Six of the eight patients who developed brain lesions also developed gyral necroses (mean 13, range 0 to 44). Necrotic lesions varied in maximal diameter from 4 to 25 mm. Cumulative necrotic lesions correlated with disease duration (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The black toenail sign signifying gyral necrosis is a common imaging feature in individuals with MELAS syndrome. The extent of gyral necrosis correlates with disease duration.

10599803	Vasogenic edema on MELAS: a serial study with diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The authors performed a serial study of a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) who presented with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI). DWI demonstrated a higher apparent diffusion coefficient in the lesion than in the control region during the acute stage of stroke. Vasogenic edema is present in stroke-like episodes in MELAS.
24508408	Adrenal insufficiency in a child with MELAS syndrome. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are established subgroups of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. m.3243A>G a common point mutation is detected in tRNA in majority of patients with MELAS phenotype whereas m.8344A>G point mutation in tRNA is observed, in MERRF phenotype. Adrenal insufficiency has not been reported in mitochondrial disease, except in Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS), which is a mitochondrial deletion syndrome. We report an unusual presentation in a five year old boy who presented with clinical phenotype of MELAS and was found to have m.8344A>G mutation in tRNA. Addison disease was identified due to hyperpigmentation of lips and gums present from early childhood. This is the first report describing adrenal insufficiency in a child with MELAS phenotype. 
10896703	Can diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging help differentiate stroke from stroke-like events in MELAS? The precise mechanism of neurological symptoms in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is still controversial. The diffusion weighted MR findings at the acute phase of a neurological event in MELAS are described and the pathophysiology of stroke-like lesion in the light of diffusion changes is discussed. Brain MRI was performed 2 days after the sudden onset of cortical blindness in a 25 year old patient with MELAS. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed multifocal cortical and subcortical hyperintensities located bilaterally in the frontobasal and the temporo-occipital lobes. Diffusion weighted images showed normal to increased apparent diffusion coefficient values in the acute left temporooccipital lesion and increased values in the older stroke-like lesions. These diffusion weighted findings support the metabolic rather than the ischaemic pathophysiological hypothesis for stroke-like episodes occurring in MELAS. Normal or increased apparent diffusion coefficient values within 48 hours of a neurological deficit of abrupt onset should raise the possibility of MELAS, especially if conventional MR images show infarct-like lesions.
26289840	Presentation of m.3243A>G (MT-TL1; tRNALeu) variant with focal neurology in infancy. The Mitochondrial tRNALeu (MT-TL1) mutation, m.3243A>G constitutes the commonest identified mitochondrial genome mutation. Characteristically, giving rise to MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), a phenotypic spectrum associated with this genetic variant is now apparent. We report on the first patient with infantile hemiparesis, without comorbid encephalopathy, attributed to this variant. This further expands the recognized disease spectrum and highlights the need to consider mitochondrial genomic mutations in cases of cryptogenic focal neurological deficit in infancy. The potential for genetic disease modifiers is additionally discussed.
32736646	Impact of cardiovascular involvement on the clinical course of paediatric mitochondrial disorders. BACKGROUND: Primary mitochondrial disorders (PMD) are rare conditions resulting in progressive multi-organ failure. Cardiovascular involvement (CVI) has been reported in paediatric patients. However, its age-related prevalence, clinical presentation and prognostic impact are unresolved. We detailed CVI in a cohort of children diagnosed with PMD over two decades at a tertiary referral centre. RESULTS: We enrolled 86 PMD patients (M/F = 30/56; mean age 6.4 +- 8.58 years). CVI was detected in 31 patients (36%), with mean age at onset of 5.7 +- 7.8 years including the pre- and neonatal phase in 14, often representing the first sign of PMD (42% of those with CVI). Heart disease resulted more common in males and in children with specific aetiologies (Barth, TMEM70 and MELAS syndromes). Hypertrophic, non-compaction and dilated cardiomyopathies were the prevalent disorders, although pulmonary arterial hypertension was also found. Adverse cardiac events (heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, ICD/PM implantation, sudden death) occurred in 19% of children with CVI over a follow-up period of 5.4 +- 4.3 years. All-cause mortality was higher in patients with CVI compared to those without CVI (45.1% vs 21.8%; p < 0.01); female sex, age at onset < 5 years, acute heart failure at presentation and diabetes also proved independent predictors of outcome. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular involvement occurred in over one-third of children diagnosed with PMD, often at a very early age, and was associated with adverse prognosis. Final outcome of PMD-related CVI was influenced by the specific underlying aetiology, suggesting the need for tailored management of heart failure and sudden death prevention.
15328906	Heteroplasmic segregation associated with trisomy-9 in cultured human cells. In cybrid cells carrying the mitochondrial A3243G MELAS mutation, which were also heteroplasmic for the G12300A suppressor mutation, we observed a transient episode of heteroplasmic instability, resulting in a wide diversification in G12300A heteroplasmy levels and a shift in the average heteroplasmy level from 11 to 29%. These cells were found to be trisomic for chromosome 9, whereas a minority of cells that retained disomy-9 showed no instability. Coculture experiments implied that trisomy-9 cells exhibited a significant growth advantage, but neither heteroplasmy levels, respiratory phenotype nor trisomy-9 itself had direct selective value under standard culture conditions. Mitochondrial nucleoid number was the same (50-100) in cells that had or had not experienced transient heteroplasmic instability, but 1-2 orders of magnitude less than the segregation number in such cells. These findings support the idea that mtDNA partition is under nuclear genetic control, and implicate a locus on chromosome 9 in this regulation.
23055932	A new chromosomal phylogeny supports the repeated origin of vectorial capacity in malaria mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex. Understanding phylogenetic relationships within species complexes of disease vectors is crucial for identifying genomic changes associated with the evolution of epidemiologically important traits. However, the high degree of genetic similarity among sibling species confounds the ability to determine phylogenetic relationships using molecular markers. The goal of this study was to infer the ancestral-descendant relationships among malaria vectors and nonvectors of the Anopheles gambiae species complex by analyzing breakpoints of fixed chromosomal inversions in ingroup and several outgroup species. We identified genes at breakpoints of fixed overlapping chromosomal inversions 2Ro and 2Rp of An. merus using fluorescence in situ hybridization, a whole-genome mate-paired sequencing, and clone sequencing. We also mapped breakpoints of a chromosomal inversion 2La (common to An. merus, An. gambiae, and An. arabiensis) in outgroup species using a bioinformatics approach. We demonstrated that the "standard" 2R+(p) arrangement and "inverted" 2Ro and 2La arrangements are present in outgroup species Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. The data indicate that the ancestral species of the An. gambiae complex had the 2Ro, 2R+(p), and 2La chromosomal arrangements. The "inverted" 2Ro arrangement uniquely characterizes a malaria vector An. merus as the basal species in the complex. The rooted chromosomal phylogeny implies that An. merus acquired the 2Rp inversion and that its sister species An. gambiae acquired the 2R+(o) inversion from the ancestral species. The karyotype of nonvectors An. quadriannulatus A and B was derived from the karyotype of the major malaria vector An. gambiae. We conclude that the ability to effectively transmit human malaria had originated repeatedly in the complex. Our findings also suggest that saltwater tolerance originated first in An. merus and then independently in An. melas. The new chromosomal phylogeny will facilitate identifying the association of evolutionary genomic changes with epidemiologically important phenotypes.

22139718	Crossed cerebellar hyperperfusion after MELAS attack followed up by whole brain continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging. Crossed cerebellar hyperperfusion (CCH) is detected in patients with epilepsy by brain perfusion studies including single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography. In addition, brain perfusion can be studied with arterial spin labeling (ASL), which is a non-invasive MRI perfusion method that quantitatively measures cerebral blood flow per unit tissue mass. We followed up a 47-year-old patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) by continuous arterial spin labeling technique, which showed crossed cerebellar hyperperfusion after acute stroke-like episode. This cerebellar hyperperfusion normalized in the follow-up.
34681037	Mitochondrial Strokes: Diagnostic Challenges and Chameleons. Mitochondrial stroke-like episodes (SLEs) are a hallmark of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). They should be suspected in anyone with an acute/subacute onset of focal neurological symptoms at any age and are usually driven by seizures. Suggestive features of an underlying mitochondrial pathology include evolving MRI lesions, often originating within the posterior brain regions, the presence of multisystemic involvement, including diabetes, deafness, or cardiomyopathy, and a positive family history. The diagnosis of MELAS has important implications for those affected and their relatives, given it enables early initiation of appropriate treatment and genetic counselling. However, the diagnosis is frequently challenging, particularly during the acute phase of an event. We describe four cases of mitochondrial strokes to highlight the considerable overlap that exists with other neurological disorders, including viral and autoimmune encephalitis, ischemic stroke, and central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, and discuss the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features that can help distinguish MELAS from these differential diagnoses.

11369188	ATP, phosphocreatine and lactate in exercising muscle in mitochondrial disease and McArdle's disease. We studied exercise-induced changes in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and lactate levels in the skeletal muscle of mitochondrial patients and patients with McArdle's disease. Needle muscle biopsy specimens for biochemical measurement were obtained before and immediately after maximal short-term bicycle exercise test from 12 patients suffering from autosomal dominant and recessive forms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia and multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA (adPEO, arPEO, respectively), five patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) 3243 A-->G point mutation, and four patients with McArdle's disease. Muscle ATP and PCr levels at rest or after exercise did not differ significantly from those of the controls in any patient group. In patients with mitochondrial disease, muscle lactate tended to be lower at rest and increase more during exercise than in controls, the most remarkable rise being measured in patients with adPEO with generalized muscle symptoms and in patients with MELAS point mutation. In McArdle patients, the muscle lactate level decreased during exercise. No correlation was found between the muscle ATP and PCr levels and the respiratory chain enzyme activity.
25125337	Novel MTCYB mutation in a young patient with recurrent stroke-like episodes and status epilepticus. The acronym "MELAS" (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) denotes patients with histological, biochemical and/or molecular evidence of mitochondrial disease who experience stroke-like episodes. Here we report on a girl with repeated stroke-like episodes and status epilepticus, who was diagnosed with MELAS due to a novel mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (MTCYB) mutation (m.15092G>A, which predicts p.G116S). Western blotting and in silico analyses suggested that this mutation could affect the stability of complex III. Cytochrome b is the only mtDNA-encoded subunit of respiratory chain complex III. Mutations in MTCYB have been associated with isolated mitochondrial myopathy and exercise intolerance, and rarely with multisystem and/or central nervous system involvement. If the m.3243A>G and other common MELAS mutations are absent in several tissues, MTCYB should be sequenced from muscle in patients with stroke-like episodes, especially if muscle histology does not support a mitochondrial myopathy and lactic acidosis is absent.
21048330	Abnormal myocardial energy-production state in mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and acute response to L-arginine infusion. C-11 acetate kinetics revealed by positron emission tomography. BACKGROUND: Cardiomyopathy is a life-threatening condition in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (known as MELAS). However, no effective therapy has been available until now. In the present study cardiac energetics and acute effects of L-arginine (Arg) were evaluated in MELAS patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 6 patients with MELAS (M-group) and 6 volunteers (C-group) underwent dynamic C-11 acetate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. TCA-cycle metabolic rate (k(mono)), myocardial efficiency (double product (DP)/k(mono)), and myocardial blood flow (MBF) were determined before and after L-Arg administration. Baseline k(mono) showed a lower value in the M-group than in the C-group (0.051+-0.013 vs 0.070+-0.019min(-1), P=0.055). On the other hand, baseline DP/k(mono) was significantly greater in the M-group (1.69+-5.9 vs 0.95+-1.2x10(5), P=0.004). After L-Arg administration, 4 patients showed significant elevation of k(mono). No relationship was observed between the distribution of k(mono) elevation and the increase in MBF. CONCLUSIONS: The TCA cycle metabolic rate is markedly suppressed in MELAS patients, indicating a shift in energy production to the anaerobic pathway, leading to a paradoxical increase in myocardial efficiency. L-Arg can enhance TCA-cycle metabolism, regardless of its vasodilatation effect, and can be used as a treatment for patients with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy.
28878349	Peptide-mediated delivery of donor mitochondria improves mitochondrial function and cell viability in human cybrid cells with the MELAS A3243G mutation. The cell penetrating peptide, Pep-1, has been shown to facilitate cellular uptake of foreign mitochondria but further research is required to evaluate the use of Pep-1-mediated mitochondrial delivery (PMD) in treating mitochondrial defects. Presently, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial transplantation rescue mitochondrial function in a cybrid cell model of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) disease. Following PMD, recipient cells had internalized donor mitochondria after 1 h, and expressed higher levels of normal mitochondrial DNA, particularly at the end of the treatment and 11 days later. After 4 days, mitochondrial respiratory function had recovered and biogenesis was evident in the Pep-1 and PMD groups, compared to the untreated MELAS group. However, only PMD was able to reverse the fusion-to-fission ratio of mitochondrial morphology, and mitochondria shaping proteins resembled the normal pattern seen in the control group. Cell survival following hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress was also improved in the PMD group. Finally, we observed that PMD partially normalized cytokine expression, including that of interleukin (IL)-7, granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in the MELAS cells. Presently, our data further confirm the protective effects of PMD as well in MELAS disease.

20799154	Disruption of endothelial tight junctions in a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). An electron microscopic study revealed disruption of capillary endothelial tight junctions (TJs) in both biopsied muscle, taken at 5 years and 1 month of age, and the autopsied brain, taken at 13 years and 6 months of age, in a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutation A3243G. This endothelial barrier disruption might result in vasogenic edema and systemic lactic acidosis, possibly the critical pathology of MELAS.

17204916	Evolution of brain imaging abnormalities in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. An 18-year-old man developed consecutive homonymous hemianopias that were eventually attributed to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The diagnosis was initially suspected when brain CT scans showed bilateral dystrophic basal ganglia calcifications and MR spectroscopy later showed a prominent lactate peak. Diffusion-weighted MRI showed progressive evolution of restricted proton diffusion at the margins of the lesion from day 3 through 3 weeks. Genetic testing from peripheral blood confirmed an A3243G transition in the patient's MTTL1 gene encoding the transfer RNA for leucine. The patient's visual function improved, but severe atrophy of gray and white matter was visible on MRI.

12185802	[MELAS--mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome--two cases confirmed by biochemical and molecular investigations. Differential diagnosis of stroke causes]. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) is a maternally inherited multisystem disease caused by mutations of the mitochondrial DNA. The characteristic clinical features are: encephalopathy manifesting as dementia and seizures, stroke-like episodes at young age (usually < 40), lactic acidosis and myopathy with ragged-red fibres. Other frequent manifestations include: sensorineural deafness, diabetes, hypoparathyroidism, peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. We present two patients with MELAS who were diagnosed 4 and 9 years respectively following the onset of the disease despite the characteristic clinical pictures. The differential diagnostics of inborn and acquired disorders causing stroke is included. We regard that mitochondrial diseases are still insufficiently known and are frequently misdiagnosed. The knowledge is indispensable for establishing diagnosis and accurate genetic counselling. Although there is no specific therapy for mitochondrial diseases to date, coenzyme Q and various vitamins as well as moderate degree exercise might be recommended.
33395972	Topological reorganization of brain functional networks in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a rare maternally inherited genetic disease; however, little is known about its underlying brain basis. Furthermore, the topological organization of brain functional network in MELAS has not been explored. Here, 45 patients with MELAS (22 at acute stage, 23 at chronic stage) and 22 normal controls were studied using resting- state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theory analysis approaches. Topological properties of brain functional networks including global and nodal metrics, rich club organization and modularity were analyzed. At the global level, MELAS patients exhibited reduced clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient, normalized characteristic path length and local network efficiency compared with the controls. At the nodal level, several nodes with abnormal degree centrality and nodal efficiency were detected in MELAS patients, and the distribution of these nodes was partly consistent with the stroke-like lesions. For rich club organization, rich club nodes were reorganized and the connections among them were decreased in MELAS patients. Modularity analysis revealed that MELAS patents had altered intra- or inter-modular connections in default mode network, fronto-parietal network, sensorimotor network, occipital network and cerebellum network. Notably, the patients at acute stage showed more obvious changes in these topological properties than the patients at chronic stage. These findings indicated that MELAS patients, particularly those at acute stage, exhibited topological reorganization of the whole-brain functional network. This study may help us to understand the neuropathological mechanisms of MELAS.
17226098	Valproic acid aggravates epilepsy due to MELAS in a patient with an A3243G mutation of mitochondrial DNA. Epilepsy is one of the most common presentations of patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). MELAS is typically caused by an A-to-G substitution at nucleotide position 3243 of mitochondrial DNA. Valproic acid, a common anticonvulsant, can actually increase the frequency of seizures in individuals with MELAS. Here, we report a single case-study of a 38-year-old man who presented with focal seizures and had MELAS Syndrome due to the A3243G mitochondrial DNA mutation. Manifestation of epilepsia partialis continua was aggravated by use of valproic acid. Convulsions abated after discontinuation of valproic acid. Our experience suggests that valproic acid should be avoided for the treatment of epilepsy in individuals with mitochondrial disease.
26517220	When should MELAS (Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) be the diagnosis? Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a rare mitochondrial disorder. Diagnostic criteria for MELAS include typical manifestations of the disease: stroke-like episodes, encephalopathy, evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction (laboratorial or histological) and known mitochondrial DNA gene mutations. Clinical features of MELAS are not necessarily uniform in the early stages of the disease, and correlations between clinical manifestations and physiopathology have not been fully elucidated. It is estimated that point mutations in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene of the DNAmt, mainly A3243G, are responsible for more of 80% of MELAS cases. Morphological changes seen upon muscle biopsy in MELAS include a substantive proportion of ragged red fibers (RRF) and the presence of vessels with a strong reaction for succinate dehydrogenase. In this review, we discuss mainly diagnostic criterion, clinical and laboratory manifestations, brain images, histology and molecular findings as well as some differential diagnoses and current treatments. 
11579429	Mitochondrial disorders: genetics, counseling, prenatal diagnosis and reproductive options. Most patients with mitochondrial disorders are diagnosed by finding a respiratory chain enzyme defect or a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The provision of accurate genetic counseling and reproductive options to these families is complicated by the unique genetic features of mtDNA that distinguish it from Mendelian genetics. These include maternal inheritance, heteroplasmy, the threshold effect, the mitochondrial bottleneck, tissue variation, and selection. Although we still have much to learn about mtDNA genetics, it is now possible to provide useful guidance to families with an mtDNA mutation or a respiratory chain enzyme defect. We describe a range of current reproductive options that may be considered for prevention of transmission of mtDNA mutations, including the use of donor oocytes, prenatal diagnosis (by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis), and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, plus possible future options such as nuclear transfer and cytoplasmic transfer. For common mtDNA mutations associated with mitochondrial cytopathies (such as NARP, Leigh Disease, MELAS, MERRF, Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, CPEO, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and Pearson syndrome), we summarize the available data on recurrence risk and discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of reproductive options.
32088469	Metabolic stroke or stroke-like lesion: Peculiarities of a phenomenon. OBJECTIVES: One of the most frequent cerebral lesions in mitochondrial disorders(MIDs) on imaging is the stroke-like lesion(SLL) clinically manifesting as stroke-like episode (SLE, metabolic stroke). This review aims at discussing recent advances concerning the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of SLLs. METHODS: Systematic literature review using appropriate search terms. RESULTS: SLLs are the hallmark of MELAS but occasionally occur in other MIDs. SLLs are best identified on multimodal, cerebral MRI. SLLs may present as uni-/multilocular, symmetric/asymmetric, cortical/subcortical, supra-/infratentorial condition, initially resembling a cytotoxic edema and later a vasogenic edema, or a variable mix between them. SLLs run through an acute and a chronic stage. The acute stage is characterised by a progressively expanding lesion over days, weeks, or months, showing up as increasing hyperintensity on T2/FLAIR, DWI, and PWI and by hyperperfusion, that does not conform to a vascular territory. ADC maps are initially hypointens to become hyperintens during the course. More rarely, a variable mixture of hyper- and hypointensities may be found. The chronic stage is characterised by hypoperfusion, gadolinium enhancement, and regression of hyperintensities to various endpoints. SLLs originate from an initial cortical lesion due to focal metabolic breakdown, which either remains stable or expands within the cortex or to subcortical areas. Some SLLs show spontaneous reversibility (fleeing cortical lesions) suggesting that neuronal/glial damage does not reach the threshold of irreversible cell death. CONCLUSIONS: SLLs are a unique feature of various MIDs in particular MELAS. SLLs are dynamic and change their appearance over time. SLLs are accessible to treatment.
16504796	An infant with a mitochondrial A3243G mutation demonstrating the MELAS phenotype. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a syndrome associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations such as A3243G, the most common mutation. Ragged-red fibers and strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels in the muscle are diagnostic pathologic features of MELAS. In general, the first typical attack of MELAS occurs in children at school age; it is rare for stroke-like episodes to occur in early infancy. This report describes a 4-month-old male harboring A3243G, whose phenotype at onset was consistent with that of MELAS in infancy. The patient was admitted because of disturbances of consciousness and ventilatory insufficiency. Remarkable lactic acidosis was observed. MRI revealed several bilateral lesions. Periodic lateralized epileptic discharges on the EEG suggested regional lesions. Biopsied muscle displayed scattered ragged-red fibers and succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels; over 90% of muscle mitochondrial DNA had A3243G. This case suggests that MELAS can develop in early infancy with its typical clinical presentation. The high percentage of A3243G may contribute to the early onset of the MELAS phenotype in this patient.
10663465	Increased cerebral blood flow in MELAS shown by Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT. We report cerebral SPECT studies on two siblings with the syndrome of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT was performed 8, 19 and 30 days after a stroke-like episode in one case and 10 days after a stroke-like episode, 6 h after a partial seizure and as a follow-up study in the other. Increased blood flow was seen in both these patients with stroke-like episodes due to MELAS. The cause of the increased blood flow is uncertain, but it may be related to the decreased pH created by local increase in lactic acid.
34049744	Linear cortical cystic lesions: Characteristic MR findings in MELAS patients. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with stroke-like lesions. The common MRI findings are gyral swelling and high signal intensity on T2WI/FLAIR images crossing the vascular territories. We have observed a linear cystic lesion and a laminar necrosis in the affected cortices of MELAS patients. Herein, we evaluated these cortical MRI findings in each subtype of mitochondrial disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the MRI findings of 71 consecutive patients with clinically and genetically confirmed mitochondrial diseases. The cortical cystic lesions and laminar necrotic lesions were evaluated on T1, T2, and FLAIR images in each subtype of mitochondrial disease, as were their clinical and other imaging characteristics. RESULTS: The cortical cystic lesion was observed in 21 of the 71 patients (29.6%) with mitochondrial diseases. Laminar necrosis was detected in only three patients (4.2%). MELAS was the most frequent subtype with cortical cystic lesions, accounting for 81.0%, and all showed the linear pattern except for one patient whose pattern was beaded-like. CONCLUSION: A cortical linear cystic lesion was a common MRI finding in our series of patients with mitochondrial disease, especially in those with MELAS, but laminar necrosis was not. These findings can help differentiate MELAS from infarction.
10699115	Childhood encephalopathies and myopathies: a prospective study in a defined population to assess the frequency of mitochondrial disorders. OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency of mitochondrial abnormalities in muscle histology, defects in respiratory chain enzyme activities, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in children with unexplained psychomotor retardation in the population of Northern Finland. BACKGROUND: The frequency of mitochondrial diseases among patients with childhood encephalopathies and myopathies is not known. Frequencies are difficult to estimate because the clinical presentation of these disorders is variable. METHODS: A total of 116 consecutive patients with undefined encephalopathies and myopathies were enrolled during a 7-year period in a hospital serving as the only neurologic unit for a pediatric population of 97 609 and as the only tertiary level neurologic unit for a pediatric population of 48 873. Biochemical and morphologic investigations were performed on muscle biopsy material, including oximetric and spectrophotometric analyses of oxidative phosphorylation, histochemistry, electron microscopy, and molecular analysis of mtDNA. RESULTS: Ultrastructural changes in the mitochondria were the most common finding in the muscle biopsies (71%). Ragged-red fibers were found in 4 cases. An oxidative phosphorylation defect was found in 26 children (28%), complex I (n = 15) and complex IV (n = 13) defects being the most common. Fifteen percent of patients (n = 17/116) with unexplained encephalomyopathy or myopathy had a probable mitochondrial disease. Common pathogenic mutations were found in the mtDNA of only 1 patient (.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The common known mutations in mtDNA are rarely causes of childhood encephalomyopathies, which is in contrast to the considerable frequency of the common MELAS mutation observed among adults in the same geographical area. Biochemically and morphologically verified mitochondrial disorders were nevertheless common among the children, making the analysis of a muscle biopsy very important for clinical diagnostic purposes.
30371584	Simultaneous 18F-FDG PET/MRI Assists Diagnosis of a Rare Disease, MELAS. MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) is a rare congenital mitochondrial DNA mutation disease. Here, we report a 4-year-old girl, who presented with short stature, mental retardation, and recurrent seizures, underwent simultaneous F-FDG PET/MRI examination. An interesting contradiction images were found on bilateral frontal, left temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes, which were with high blood flow shown on 3D-ASL perfusion images, but low uptake of F-FDG on PET images. The contradiction of high blood flow and low glucose metabolism gave us a clue to make the diagnosis of MELAS. The final diagnosis was MELAS confirmed by genetic testing.
20083621	Prevalence and natural history of heart disease in adults with primary mitochondrial respiratory chain disease. AIMS: The prevalence and natural history of cardiovascular disease in adult patients with respiratory chain disease (RCD) is poorly characterized. We sought to determine the frequency and natural history of cardiac disease in patients with primary RCD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (37.8 + or - 12.6 years) with a definite diagnosis of RCD underwent clinical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), 24 h Holter ECG, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Patients were classified into six different phenotypes: mitochondrial myopathy (MM; n = 8), chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia (CPEO; n = 2), chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia with myopathy (CPEO + MM; n = 12), Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS; n = 2), mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS; n = 7), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres (MERRF, n = 1). [corrected] Twenty-two patients (69%) had a mitochondrial DNA mutation. Twenty-six patients (81%) had evidence for cardiac involvement: ECG abnormalities (69%) and cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic 19%; restrictive 3%; left ventricular non-compaction 3%). During follow-up (4.1 + or - 2.8 years), two patients with CPEO + MM developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and one patient with NARP developed peripartum dilated cardiomyopathy. Four patients (KSS = 2; MM = 1; MELAS = 1) developed arrhythmias or syncope requiring device therapy or invasive procedures. One patient with MM and cardiomyopathy had an orthotopic heart transplant. One patient with CPEO + MM died from respiratory failure. Freedom from all cardiovascular events at 5 years was 67% (95% CI 47.4-86.6). CONCLUSION: All patients with RCD should undergo careful and repeated clinical assessment to diagnose and manage cardiovascular involvement. However, life-threatening cardiovascular complications rarely occur, and the prognosis is generally favourable.

23139618	Mucosal necrosis of the small intestine in myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome. This report presents a case of massive mucosal necrosis of the small intestine in a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), which particularly affects the brain, nervous system and muscles. A 45-year-old Japanese female, with an established diagnosis of MELAS, presented with vomiting. Computed tomography showed portomesenteric venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis. She underwent a resection of the small intestine. A microscopic study showed necrosis of the mucosa and vacuolar degeneration of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall. Immunohistochemistry showed anti-mitochondrial antibody to be highly expressed in the crypts adjacent the necrotic mucosa. The microscopic and immunohistochemical findings suggested the presence of a large number of abnormal mitochondria in MELAS to be closely linked to mucosal necrosis of the small intestine.
11147883	Focal hyperperfusion in a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes. Case report. A 28-year-old woman presented with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). The diagnosis was based on the results of molecular genetic analysis, which indicated a typical point mutation at the nucleotide pair 3243. Xenon computerized tomography scans obtained during the strokelike episodes revealed the lesion responsible for the symptoms to be an area of focal hyperperfusion, and scans obtained after the episodes revealed an area of hypoperfusion. Pathogenesis of the strokelike episodes appears to be metabolic dysfunction, although the involvement of a vascular event cannot be excluded.

11224785	Progressive sensorineural hearing loss in children with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. OBJECTIVE: Mitochondrial disorders are responsible for a variety of neurological syndromes. Specific mitochondrial DNA mutations have been identified recently in some of these rare disorders. Clinical symptoms may occur in different organs to various extent; often they are associated with progressive hearing loss. The aims of this study were to determine incidence, onset, and characteristics of hearing loss in children with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies and to investigate a possible correlation between the degree of hearing loss and neurological symptoms. In addition, we investigated the prognostic value of hearing loss as a predictor of the disease. STUDY DESIGN: From August 1992 to September 1998, 29 patients ranging in age from 5 to 23 years (mean years) were studied. These children were hospitalized for diagnostic purposes in the neuropediatric department. METHODS: The mitochondrial disorder was diagnosed by clinical and laboratory testings, including analysis of the mtDNA. Audiological evaluation consisted of measurements of pure-tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry, and acoustic refle- threshold testing, auditory brainstem response, and evoked as well as distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. RESULTS: A sensorineural hearing loss was identified in 12 children. Three of these were diagnosed as having classic Kearns-Sayre syndrome; five as having multisystem KSS; two as having the syndrome of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); one as having KSS-MELAS overlap syndrome; and one as having Friedreich ataxia. Longitudinal testing was performed in seven children, and in all of them a progression of the hearing loss could be demonstrated. Audiological test results in all 12 children suggested cochlear as well as retrocochlear origin of the hearing loss presenting independently from the severity of hearing impairment. No correlation between the characteristics and degrees of hearing loss and the number and severity of clinical neurological symptoms could be found. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated a high incidence (42%) of sensorineural hearing loss in children with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. The progressive nature of the hearing impairment was confirmed by a significant correlation between the duration in years and severity of hearing loss in the children. The hearing loss does not have a prognostic value for the progression of the disorder. Based on our findings, we recommend regular audiometric examinations in patients with mitochondrial disorders.
10653568	Molecular genetic evidence of a novel morbillivirus in a long-finned pilot whale (Globicephalus melas). A long-finned pilot whale with morbilliviral disease was stranded in New Jersey. An immunohistochemical stain demonstrated morbilliviral antigen. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for morbillivirus P and N genes was positive. Novel sequences most closely related to, but distinct from, those of dolphin and porpoise morbilliviruses suggest that this virus may represent a third member of the cetacean morbillivirus group.
21514942	Effect of long-term oral treatment with L-arginine and idebenone on the prevention of stroke-like episodes in an adult MELAS patient. INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a maternally-inherited multisystem disorder. Mitochondrial angiopathy mediated by nitric oxide, a metabolite of L-arginine, is among the proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms of stroke-like episodes (SLEs) in MELAS. There are very few reports on long-term prevention of SLEs with oral L-arginine and idebenone treatment in MELAS adult patients. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old patient with MELAS and SLEs was treated with oral L-arginine and idebenone for 27months. She remained free of attacks throughout the treatment period except when she stopped her treatment on two occasions during which she had recurrent cerebral metabolic attacks. The patient experienced no side effect of treatment with L-arginine and idebenone. CONCLUSION: Our observation suggests long-term safety and potential benefit of oral L-arginine and idebenone in the prevention of recurrence of SLEs in adult MELAS patients.

18826806	Migraine and stroke: current perspectives. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to review the latest concepts regarding migraine and ischemic stroke. In addition, focal neurological deficits and MRI changes in migraine patients will be reviewed. METHODS: A PubMed search of neurological literature pertaining to this study was conducted using specific keyword search terms pertaining to migraine and ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Migraine, especially with aura, is a relative risk factor for stroke. Neuroimaging demonstrates the posterior circulation as being most vulnerable, although the reason for this distribution is unclear. Factors that may contribute to stroke in migraine include changes during cortical spreading depression with hyper- or hypoperfusion of neural tissue, vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction. Estrogen affects migraine expression as well as cerebral circulation, yet most women with migraine without aura are not at increased risk. Co-morbidity with patent foramen ovale can be mechanism of both disorders via presumed lack of filtration of microemboli or toxic substances; however, closure with reversal of right to left shunt seems to be more beneficial for cryptogenic stroke than migraine. Migraine and stroke are found in specific genetic disorders such as CADASIL, HERNS and MELAS giving clues to genetic factors. Stroke associated with migraine treatments such as ergots or triptans is rare, and usually associated with special circumstances such as overuse or concomitant thrombogenic conditions. CONCLUSION: Although true migrainous infarction is rare, our understanding of the subtle associations between migraine and cerebrovascular behavior is expanding.
27477183	Imaging of MELAS. Mitochondrial diseases are multisystem disorders that frequently involve the central nervous system. The clinical presentation of these disorders may be challenging to differentiate from cerebrovascular disorders. Various imaging techniques are now available that provide a wide range of imaging modalities during initial clinical evaluation and throughout the disease course. Recent technological advancements have introduced advanced neuroimaging modalities that provide detailed information of metabolic disorders at the tissue level. Imaging findings, though diverse, usually have characteristic features that support differentiating these disorders from vascular syndromes. This article provides an overview of various neuroimaging modalities available along with the advent of new imaging techniques being utilized in these disorders. 
30924003	Diagnosing MELAS requires not only an mtDNA variant but also an appropriate phenotype. 
21179558	Detection of heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA in single mitochondria. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome mutations can lead to energy and respiratory-related disorders like myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fiber disease (MERRF), mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke (MELAS) syndrome, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). It is not well understood what effect the distribution of mutated mtDNA throughout the mitochondrial matrix has on the development of mitochondrial-based disorders. Insight into this complex sub-cellular heterogeneity may further our understanding of the development of mitochondria-related diseases. METHODOLOGY: This work describes a method for isolating individual mitochondria from single cells and performing molecular analysis on that single mitochondrion's DNA. An optical tweezer extracts a single mitochondrion from a lysed human HL-60 cell. Then a micron-sized femtopipette tip captures the mitochondrion for subsequent analysis. Multiple rounds of conventional DNA amplification and standard sequencing methods enable the detection of a heteroplasmic mixture in the mtDNA from a single mitochondrion. SIGNIFICANCE: Molecular analysis of mtDNA from the individually extracted mitochondrion demonstrates that a heteroplasmy is present in single mitochondria at various ratios consistent with the 50/50 heteroplasmy ratio found in single cells that contain multiple mitochondria.
11562875	[MELAS syndrome masquerading as herpes encephalitis: genetic diagnosis]. INTRODUCTION: MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke like episodes) is a mitochondrial disease related to the mitochondrial DNA mutation. The tRNALeu(UUR) mutation at the base pair 3234 is associated to 80% of cases of MELAS syndrome. The onset with the stroke like episodes is often before the age 40. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) presents as acute episodes of focal neurologic deficit that are often related to the temporal lobe. Occasionally MELAS syndrome and HSE may have a similar clinical presentation. CLINICAL CASE: A 33-year-old woman presented with seizures and a right parietotemporal syndrome of acute onset. The differential diagnosis between HSE and MELAS syndrome was established. MELAS syndrome was suspected based on her phenotype. The diagnosis of MELAS syndrome was confirmed by the presence of the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) mutation at the base pair 3243. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of the MELAS syndrome may mimic that of the HSE, and antiviral treatment should be given until the diagnosis of MELAS syndrome is definitive. The study of the mitochondrial DNA helps diagnosing in a non invasive way many patients with MELAS syndrome.
24095972	Detection of preclinically latent hyperperfusion due to stroke-like episodes by arterial spin-labeling perfusion MRI in MELAS patients. In stroke-like episodes (SEs) of patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), the detection of preclinically latent lesions is a challenge. We report regional cerebral hyperperfusion observed on arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preclinical phase more than 3 months before the clinical onset of SEs in 3 MELAS patients. These hyperperfused areas were not detected by conventional MRI in the preclinical phase and developed into acute lesions at the clinical onset of SEs, suggesting that ASL imaging has the potential for predicting the emergence of SEs. 
24260310	Quantitative measurement of cerebral oxygen extraction fraction using MRI in patients with MELAS. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the cerebral OEF at different phases of stroke-like episodes in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) by using MRI. METHODS: We recruited 32 patients with MELAS confirmed by gene analysis. Conventional MRI scanning, as well as functional MRI including arterial spin labeling and oxygen extraction fraction imaging, was undertaken to obtain the pathological and metabolic information of the brains at different stages of stroke-like episodes in patients. A total of 16 MRI examinations at the acute and subacute phase and 19 examinations at the interictal phase were performed. In addition, 24 healthy volunteers were recruited for control subjects. Six regions of interest were placed in the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the bilateral hemispheres to measure the OEF of the brain or the lesions. RESULTS: OEF was reduced significantly in brains of patients at both the acute and subacute phase (0.266 +- 0.026) and at the interictal phase (0.295 +- 0.009), compared with normal controls (0.316 +- 0.025). In the brains at the acute and subacute phase of the episode, 13 ROIs were prescribed on the stroke-like lesions, which showed decreased OEF compared with the contralateral spared brain regions. Increased blood flow was revealed in the stroke-like lesions at the acute and subacute phase, which was confined to the lesions. CONCLUSION: MRI can quantitatively show changes in OEF at different phases of stroke-like episodes. The utilization of oxygen in the brain seems to be reduced more severely after the onset of episodes in MELAS, especially for those brain tissues involved in the episodes.

23677422	Transient ischemic attack-like episodes without stroke-like lesions in MELAS. A stroke-like episode is a core symptom in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is useful in the diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases. We report an 8-year-old girl with MELAS, presenting with a seizure and blindness. 1H-MRS showed a strikingly elevated lactate peak in the right occipital region, where no abnormal signals appeared on either T2-W or diffusion-weighted MRI. She recovered completely within a day. We describe this mild clinical condition with abnormal lactate peak in normal-appearing gray matter as a transient ischemic attack-like episode in MELAS.
29482705	MELAS: A Complex and Challenging Diagnosis. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a rare multisystem disorder and is the most common maternally inherited mitochondrial disease. This condition has a special predilection for the nervous system and muscles. Typical findings on brain imaging include stroke-like areas, calcification of basal ganglia and brain atrophy. This accounts for the disease being, both clinically and radiologically, mistaken for ischemic stroke. The differentiation features from stroke include comparatively young age of the patients, site of the lesions, and relative overlap between the cerebral vasculature territories. In this case report, we discuss a 16-year male with clinical and radiological features highly suggestive of MELAS syndrome. Since this disease is rare and its clinical presentation is complex, it is among the most challenging to diagnose. It is particularly difficult to differentiate between ischemic stroke and MELAS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) sequences and MR spectroscopy may aid in establishing the diagnosis. A particularly characteristic feature of MELAS syndrome is that recurrence may occur in locations different than previously noted, which was also seen in our patient.
19470619	The clinical variability of maternally inherited diabetes and deafness is associated with the degree of heteroplasmy in blood leukocytes. CONTEXT: Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) is a rare form of diabetes with a matrilineal transmission, sensorineural hearing loss, and macular pattern dystrophy due to an A to G transition at position 3243 of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (m.3243A>G). The phenotypic heterogeneity of MIDD may be the consequence of different levels of mutated mtDNA among mitochondria in a given tissue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was thus to ascertain the correlation between the severity of the phenotype in patients with MIDD and the level of heteroplasmy in the blood leukocytes. PARTICIPANTS: The GEDIAM prospective multicenter register was initiated in 1995. Eighty-nine Europid patients from this register, with MIDD and the mtDNA 3243A>G mutation, were included. Patients with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) or with mitochondrial diabetes related to other mutations or to deletions of mtDNA were excluded. RESULTS: A significant negative correlation was found between levels of heteroplasmy and age of the patients at the time of sampling for molecular analysis, age at the diagnosis of diabetes, and body mass index. After adjustment for age at sampling for molecular study and gender, the correlation between heteroplasmy levels and age at the diagnosis of diabetes was no more significant. The two other correlations remained significant. A significant positive correlation between levels of heteroplasmy and HbA(1c) was also found and remained significant after adjustment for age at molecular sampling and gender. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that heteroplasmy levels are at least one of the determinants of the severity of the phenotype in MIDD.
30300453	Patients with MELAS not only require treatment of stroke-like episodes but a comprehensive individual and family management. 
12791122	Anaesthesia for an adolescent with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy-lactic acidosis-stroke-like episodes syndrome. Anaesthesia for patients with mitochondrial disorders occurs with regularity, either for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure associated with the syndrome or for unassociated surgery. We report the case of a 17-year-old boy with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy-lactic acidosis-stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome who underwent a laparotomy for fundoplication. The potential hazards of anaesthesia for this patient, and the steps taken to avoid them, are discussed.
18176143	MELAS masquerading as a systemic vasculitis. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke (MELAS) is a mitochondrial genetic disorder caused by a point mutation, resulting in the substitution of guanine for adenine at nucleotide 3243 (A3243G). It is a multisystem disorder with variable manifestations and typically presents between the first and third decades of life. It should be suspected if a patient exhibits stroke-like episodes before age 40, encephalopathy characterized by seizures, dementia, or both, and lactic acidosis, ragged-red fibers in muscle, or both. We present the case of a 26-year-old white man suspected with primary central nervous system vasculitis admitted to our facility with profound constipation from severe intestinal dysmotility. Although his gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms did not meet criteria for a specific vasculitic syndrome, his symptoms and blood test abnormalities were concerning for such a process. MELAS was included in our differential diagnosis because his symptoms failed to fit a defined vasculitic process. When genetic testing documented the presence of the point mutation A3243G, his diagnosis was changed. This case illustrates the importance of considering a mitochondrial genetic disorder in the differential diagnosis of patients who present to Rheumatologists with suspected unusual or atypical vasculitic symptoms.
23623855	MRI of the brain in childhood-onset mitochondrial disorders with central nervous system involvement. We retrospectively studied the brain MRIs of 66 pediatric patients with mitochondrial disorder with central nervous system involvement. Forty-one patients had an identified genetic etiology. A predominance of cerebrocortical lesions was mainly seen in patients with MELAS and Alpers syndrome. Basal ganglia were predominantly affected in patients with Leigh syndrome. All patients with leukoencephalopathy had pathological spectroscopy. Cerebrocortical atrophy with agenesis/atrophy of the corpus callosum was seen in patients with congenital lactic acidosis with or without pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency. The diagnostic approach used in our study--from the neuroanatomical/neurofunctional lesion to disease identification--assists the physician in the use of brain neuroimaging early in the diagnostic work-up of suspected mitochondrial disorders.
21514610	[Mutism and acute behavioral disorders revealing MELAS syndrome]. INTRODUCTION: MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a rare genetic mitochondrial disease which can cause cerebral (cerebrovascular accident, migraine, mental deterioration..), sensorial (bilateral symmetrical deafness) and peripheral (muscular involvement, neuropathy) disorders potentially associated with diabetes, renal or cardiac disorders, or growth retardation. Eighty percent of the patients have the 3243 A>G mutation in the leucine RNA transfer gene. Clinical manifestations leading to discovery of the mutation can be extremely varied, affecting patients of different age groups. CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a 49-year-old man who presented acute fits of confusion followed by mutism and praxic disorders. History taking revealed recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes, axonal neuropathy, and bilateral symmetrical deafness requiring hearing aids. The initial MRI showed FLAIR sequences with bi-parietal abnormalities, no signs of recent stroke on the DW/B10000 sequences, and basal ganglia calcifications. Blood tests and morphological findings ruled out a vascular origin. Search for lactic acidosis remained constantly negative in blood samples despite positive cerebrospinal fluid samples (Nx3). The 3243 A>G mitochondrial DNA mutation was identified. The neuropsychological evaluation revealed a serious dysexecutive syndrome with a major impact on the patient's self sufficiency. CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive disorders are not common in MELAS syndrome. Brain MRI results and the presence of extra-neurological signs can be helpful for diagnosis.
15335122	Moyamoya disease initially mimicking MELAS syndrome in a 14-month-old child. Moyamoya disease is a neurological disease rarely seen in children outside Japan. It is difficult to differentiate moyamoya disease in its early stage from mitochondrial disorders in children when nontraumatic ischemic stroke is considered. We present a 14-month-old Taiwanese female child who had suffered from sudden onset of nontraumatic seizure attack, after which progressive left limb weakness was noted. Initial brain imaging and a series of laboratory studies were performed which suggested mitochondrial disorders, especially mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) syndrome. The patient underwent an oral glucose lactate stimulation test (OGLST), and mitochondrial disorders were not favored. MR angiography of the circle of Willis showed moyamoya disease. The patient then underwent an encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis (EDAMS) operation. Evaluation of the neurodevelopmental and intelligence outcome required close long-term follow-up.
28124854	MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, Stroke) - a Diagnosis Not to be Missed. MELAS is a rare mitochondrial disorder. We report two cases in Irish males where the characteristics were evident, but the diagnosis not made for a considerable period of time. In one of the cases the symptoms were presumed secondary to prematurity. In the other the symptoms were presumed secondary to epilepsy and he had three respiratory arrests secondary to benzodiazepine administration. This report wishes to highlight MELAS as a differential diagnosis in paediatric patients who present with stroke.
11506313	An autopsy case of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome with chronic renal failure. A 25-year-old man developed a stroke-like episode. He suffered from renal failure and became dialysis-dependent. His mother was also dialysis-dependent. A3243G point mutation of the mitochondrial tRNA(leu) gene was detected in both of them. The patient was diagnosed with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and died of a recurrence of stroke-like episodes at the age of 30. Autopsy revealed numerous abnormal mitochondria in the kidneys, but no renal vascular changes. This is the first report of a MELAS case in which the presence of numerous abnormal mitochondria in podocytes and tubules was confirmed by electron microscopy.
16022465	[A case of stroke-like episode of MELAS of which progressive spread would be prevented by edaravone]. A thirty-two-year-old woman who had been diagnosed MELAS with 3243A > G mutation presented headache, nausea, decreased bilateral visual acuity, and topographical disturbance on January 1 in 2002. Although brain CT showed no fresh lesion, recurrence of stroke-like episode was considered. Immediately, she was treated with ubiquinone (210 mg/day, p.o.) and tocopherol nicotinate (300 mg/day, p.o.). She became confused on the fifth day. Diffusion weighted- and T2 weighted-MRI revealed appearance of hyperintense lesion at the right occipital lobe. We started edaravone infusion (30 mg, twice a day, div.) for two weeks with informed consent from her family. On 13th day her consciousness was improved. Edema and signal intensity of the lesion were decreased on MRI with minimal spread to the parietal lobe. She discharged on the 30th day with marked visual field loss, hemispatial neglect, and topographical amnesia. MRI after four months showed remarkable atrophy of the right occipital region. In our department, five stroke-like episodes including this case were treated with ubuiquinone and tocopherol nicotinate. This regimen was effective in prevention of progressive spread of lesions only in two episodes. Edaravone is radical scavenger used in acute cerebral infarction. Progressive spread into the neighboring regions is one of characteristics of MELAS, although its precise mechanisms are not well known. Oxidative stress induced by released free radicals through mitochondrial dysfunction might be one of factors and edaravone would make an effect through blockage of the free radicals. Edaravone could not rescue neurons in the initial lesion. Although more numbers of cases are needed to establish the effect of edaravone on MELAS, it could minimize the neurological deficits after stroke-like episode of MELAS.
21473984	Poor correlations in the levels of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations in polar bodies versus oocytes and blastomeres in humans. Because the mtDNA amount remains stable in the early embryo until uterine implantation, early human development is completely dependent on the mtDNA pool of the mature oocyte. Both quantitative and qualitative mtDNA defects therefore may negatively impact oocyte competence or early embryonic development. However, nothing is known about segregation of mutant and wild-type mtDNA molecules during human meiosis. To investigate this point, we compared the mutant levels in 51 first polar bodies (PBs) and their counterpart (oocytes, blastomeres, or whole embryos), at risk of having (1) the "MELAS" m.3243A>G mutation in MT-TL1 (n = 30), (2) the "MERRF" m.8344A>G mutation in MT-TK (n = 15), and (3) the m.9185T>G mutation located in MT-ATP6 (n = 6). Seven out of 51 of the PBs were mutation free and had homoplasmic wild-type counterparts. In the heteroplasmic PBs, measurement of the mutant load was a rough estimate of the counterpart mutation level (R(2) = 0.52), and high mutant-load differentials between the two populations were occasionally observed (ranging from -34% to +34%). The mutant-load differentials between the PB and its counterpart were higher in highly mutated PBs, suggestive of a selection process acting against highly mutated cells during gametogenesis or early embryonic development. Finally, individual discrepancies in mutant loads between PBs and their counterparts make PB-based preconception diagnosis unreliable for the prevention of mtDNA disorder transmission. Such differences were not observed in animal models, and they emphasize the need to conduct thorough studies on mtDNA segregation in humans.
24656211	Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) may respond to adjunctive ketogenic diet. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome can present management challenges. Refractory seizures and stroke-like episodes leading to disability are common. PATIENT: We analyzed the clinical, electrophysiologic, and radiologic data of a 22-year-old woman with multiple episodes of generalized and focal status epilepticus and migratory cortical stroke-like lesions who underwent muscle biopsy for mitochondrial genome sequencing. RESULTS: Although initial mitochondrial genetic testing was negative, muscle biopsy demonstrated a mitochondrial DNA disease-causing mutation (m.3260A > G). New antiepileptic medications were added with each episode of focal status epilepticus with only temporary improvement, until a modified ketogenic diet and magnesium were introduced, leading to seizure freedom despite development of a new stroke-like lesion, and subsequent decrease in frequency of stroke-like episodes. We propose a metabolic model in which the ketogenic diet may lead to improvement of the function of respiratory chain complexes. CONCLUSIONS: The ketogenic diet may lead to improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in MELAS, which in turn may promote better seizure control and less frequent stroke-like episodes.
10750342	Cerebral blood flow, vascular response and metabolism in patients with MELAS syndrome--xenon CT and PET study. UNLABELLED: Two patients with MELAS syndrome underwent serial measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) with xenon CT while they were presenting stroke like episodes accompanying cerebral lesion detectable with CT. One of them underwent PET measurement of regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and glucose (CMRGlu) after his symptoms and lesion disappeared. METHODS: The xenon CT CBF study was performed by 4 min wash-in and 3 min wash-out protocol with serial measurement of endexpiratory concentration of xenon gas. The CBF after acetazolamide loading was also quantified in one of them. The PET study was performed to quantify CBF, CMRO2, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) by continuous inhalation of O-15 labeled gases and arterial blood sampling. The PET measurement of CMRGlu was performed by i.v. injection of F-18 FDG and arterial blood sampling. RESULTS: 1) During the symptomatic period, Xe-CBF was normal or slightly increased both in and outside the low density lesion. 2) The CBF response to acetazolamide loading was well preserved both in and outside the low density lesions. 3) After the neurological symptoms and low density lesions disappeared, Xe-CBF pattern and vascular response was the same as during the symptomatic period. 4) In the PET study, normal or slightly increased PET-CBF, increased CMRGlu and markedly decreased CMRO2 in comparison to normal control was noted resulting in a marked decrease in OEF and CMRO2/CMRGlu ratio, a characteristic metabolic pattern for MELAS. CONCLUSION: In the present cases, resting CBF and vasomotor reactivity was well preserved both in symptomatic and remission period. On the contrary, abnormal metabolic pattern was noted. The stroke like episode of the present patients is more likely attributed to metabolic failure than vascular accident.
18206799	Clinical and genetic features in a MELAS child with a 3271T>C mutation. A mitochondrial DNA 3271T>C point mutation was reported to be the second most common mutation (following the mutation 3243A>G) in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in Japan. This mutation has rarely been reported in other countries. We present an 11-year-old Taiwanese girl with MELAS, who harbored the 3271T>C mutation and had manifested short stature, epilepsia partialis continua, and recurrent basal ganglia infarctions since age 6 years, and rapid intellectual regression, dysarthria, and unsteady gait since age 10 years. The proportion of 3271T>C mutant genomes in various tissues, including urinary sediments, hair follicles, blood leukocytes, and buccal mucosa cells from the patient and her mother, was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The proportion of mutant load in the patient's muscles was near 100%. Except for muscle, the highest mutation load was detected in urinary sediments of the patient by both methods. This is the first report involving mutant load analysis with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the 3271T>C mutation. The results suggest that urinary sediments may be an alternative tissue of choice which can be obtained noninvasively in the diagnosis of mitochondrial DNA 3271T>C mutations.
19925507	Heart diseases in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke syndrome. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke (MELAS) syndrome is a mitochondrial genetic disorder caused by a point mutation, resulting in the substitution of guanine for adenine at nucleotide 3243 (A3243G) of mitochondrial DNA. This disease is characterized by a multisystem disorder with variable manifestations. The authors review heart involvement in this disease.
32424662	[Management of patients with MELAS syndrome : A case report and general characteristics from an anesthesiological perspective]. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a rare progressive disease with acute neurological episodes caused by a mitochondriopathy. Due to a defect of oxidative phosphorylation in the respiratory chain, there is impaired mitochondrial energy production with subsequent lactic acidosis, especially in situations with increased stress. Due to the high risk of metabolic derailment MELAS syndrome is a great challenge with respect to the perioperative management of anesthesia. OBJECTIVE: This article gives a general overview of the special features of anesthesia management in patients with MELAS syndrome. A case report is presented in order to demonstrate how intraoperative parenteral nutrition can possibly be used to counteract the formation of lactic acidosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed. As only very few reports on MELAS syndrome are available, a case report was also integrated into this overview article for illustration purposes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Patients with MELAS syndrome represent a challenging cohort with respect to management of anesthesia and an intensive monitoring of the metabolic status is crucial. In cases of increasing lactate values, the administration of intraoperative parenteral nutrition seems to be a suitable approach to avoid lactic acidosis and to improve the perioperative treatment of patients with MELAS syndrome in the future.
23834081	Novel mutations m.3959G>A and m.3995A>G in mitochondrial gene MT-ND1 associated with MELAS. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with polygenetic, maternally inherited mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Approximately 80% of MELAS cases are caused by the mutation m.3243A>G of the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu (UUR)) gene (MT-TL1). We reported two probands with MELAS features. Muscle biopsy identified ragged-red fibers (RRF) in Gomori Trichrome staining. A respiratory chain function study showed decreased activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I in both probands. Sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA revealed two novel MT-ND1 gene missense mutations, m.3959G>A and m.3995A>G, which are highly conserved among species. Protein secondary structure predictions demonstrated that these mutations may alter the peptide structure and may lead to decreased ND1 gene stability. Our findings suggest that these two novel mutations may contribute to the MELAS phenotypes of the patients in our study.
28050007	Adult-onset Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke (MELAS)-like Encephalopathy Diagnosed Based on the Complete Sequencing of Mitochondrial DNA Extracted from Biopsied Muscle without any Myopathic Changes. The clinical features of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are not uniform. We herein report a male patient with unusual MELAS-like encephalopathy who had been experiencing isolated recurrent stroke-like episodes since he was 33 years old without any particular family history. Despite an extensive investigation, he had no other signs suggestive of MELAS. Although the muscle pathology showed a normal appearance, a mitochondrial genome sequence analysis of the biopsied muscle revealed a heteroplasmic m.10158T>C mutation in the mitochondrial complex I subunit gene, MT-ND3. To prevented further deterioration of the higher brain function, the early diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial stroke-like episodes is important.

33596430	Major cerebral vessels involvement in patients with MELAS syndrome: Worth a scan? A systematic review. Major cerebral vessels have been proposed as a target of defective mitochondrial metabolism in patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS). Cerebral angiographic techniques are not routinely performed in MELAS patients. A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies describing major vessel caliber alterations in MELAS. Twenty-three studies reporting on 46 MELAS patients were included. Alterations in major caliber vessels were present in 59% (27/46) of patients. Dilation occurred in 37% (17/46) of patients, and in 88% (15/17) of them during a stroke-like episode (SLE). Stenosis was reported in 24% (11/46) of patients: 36% (4/11) related to an SLE and 64% (7/11) to dissections or degenerative changes. During an SLE, identification of intracranial vessels dilation or stenosis could be a selection tool for new treatment protocols. Outside SLE, identification of major cerebral vessels dissections and degenerative changes may help to prevent subsequent complications.
12372990	Clinical phenotype, prognosis and mitochondrial DNA mutation load in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. We studied 42 individuals, including 8 patients with either complete or partial syndrome of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), 8 patients with either complete or partial syndrome of myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) and 26 maternal family members who carried either the A3243G or A8344G mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Clinical manifestations and prognosis were followed up in the patients harboring the A3243G or A8344G mutation. The relationship between clinical features and proportions of mutant mtDNAs in muscle biopsies, blood cells and/or hair follicles was studied. In the 8 regularly followed patients with the A3243G mutation, 4 died within 1 month to 7 years due to status epilepticus and/or recurrent stroke-like episodes. Two patients developed marked mental deterioration and 2 remained stationary. All of the patients harboring the A8344G mutation were stable or deteriorated slightly, except for 1 patient who died due to brain herniation after putaminal hemorrhage. The A3243G and A8344G mtDNA mutations were heteroplasmic in the muscle biopsies, blood cells and hair follicles of both the probands and their maternal family members. The mean proportion of A3243G mutant mtDNA in the muscle biopsies of the patients with MELAS syndrome (68.5 +/- 21.3%, range 33-92%) was significantly higher than that of the asymptomatic family members (37.1 +/- 12.6%, range 0-51%). The average proportions of A8344G mutant mtDNA in the muscle biopsies (90.1 +/- 3.9%, range 89-95%) and hair follicles (93.9 +/- 6.4%, range 84-99%) of the patients with MERRF syndrome were also significantly higher than those of the asymptomatic family members (muscle: 40.3 +/- 39.5%, range 1-80%; hair follicles: 51.0 +/- 44.5%, range 0.1-82%). We concluded that measurement of the proportion of mutant mtDNA in muscle biopsies may provide useful information in the identification of symptomatic patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. For patients with the A3243G mutation, the prognosis was related to status epilepticus and the number of recurrent stroke-like episodes and was much worse than for patients with the A8344G mutation of mtDNA, who had stable or slowly deteriorating clinical courses.
11310272	[Analysis of complex segregation in a large family with hereditary cerebrovascular disease in Antioquia, Colombia]. INTRODUCTION: Among different kinds of cerebrovascular diseases, few of them are caused by genetic disturbances, such as CADASIL (caused by Notch3 mutations), CARASIL, mitochondrial encephalopathy, MELAS and dementia typed Binswanger. However, to describe these type of cerebrovascular diseases related with genetic mutations could permit to determinate the causes of both hereditary and sporadic cerebrovascular diseases and then lead solutions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the genetic, environmental and cohort factors that determinate the presence of many affected people by a several cerebrovascular diseases in the pedigree of a large family from Antioquia (Colombia). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed one pedigree (268 individuals), through singular recruit and then complex segregation analysis with POINTER program. RESULTS: The model that more close to data is autosomal dominant mayor locus without influence of environmental factors. Frequency of allele of susceptibility to develop stroke or subcortical vascular dementia was 0.0006. Mayor gene is over epistatic effects or interactions with other gene. CONCLUSIONS: Described an autosomal dominant hereditary model through complex segregation analysis in a pedigree of patients with hereditary cerebral vascular diseases characterized by recurrent strokes, early onset subcortical dementia, hearing loss, antecedent of migraine and MRI signal abnormalities, subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. In this family the parameter calculated, autosomal dominant model, and clinical feature strongly support the diagnostic of CADASIL, linkage analysis and sequentiation will be performed to determinate if mutant gene is Notch3.
22115768	Initial experience in the treatment of inherited mitochondrial disease with EPI-743. Inherited mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders are progressive, life-threatening conditions for which there are limited supportive treatment options and no approved drugs. Because of this unmet medical need, as well as the implication of mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to more common age-related and neurodegenerative disorders, mitochondrial diseases represent an important therapeutic target. Thirteen children and one adult with genetically-confirmed mitochondrial disease (polymerase gamma deficiency, n=4; Leigh syndrome, n=4; MELAS, n=3; mtDNA deletion syndrome, n=2; Friedreich ataxia, n=1) at risk for progressing to end-of-life care within 90 days were treated with EPI-743, a novel para-benzoquinone therapeutic, in a subject controlled, open-label study. Serial measures of safety and efficacy were obtained that included biochemical, neurological, quality-of-life, and brain redox assessments using technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radionuclide imaging. Twelve patients treated with EPI-743 have survived; one polymerase gamma deficiency patient died after developing pneumonia and one patient with Surf-1 deficiency died after completion of the protocol. Of the 12 survivors, 11 demonstrated clinical improvement, with 3 showing partial relapse, and 10 of the survivors also had an improvement in quality-of-life scores at the end of the 13-week emergency treatment protocol. HMPAO SPECT scans correlated with clinical response; increased regional and whole brain HMPAO uptake was noted in the clinical responders and the one subject who did not respond clinically had decreased regional and whole brain HMPAO uptake. EPI-743 has modified disease progression in >90% of patients in this open-label study as assessed by clinical, quality-of-life, and non-invasive brain imaging parameters. Data obtained herein suggest that EPI-743 may represent a new drug for the treatment of inherited mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders. Prospective controlled trials will be undertaken to substantiate these initial promising observations. Furthermore, HMPAO SPECT imaging may be a valuable tool for the detection of central nervous system redox defects and for monitoring response to treatments directed at modulating abnormal redox.
21174521	Central retinal vein occlusion as the initial manifestation of LHON / MELAS overlap syndrome with mitochondrial DNA G13513A mutation--case report and literature review. BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to describe the clinical features and molecular findings of a unique case of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)/mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) overlap syndrome presenting as nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). METHODS: An 11-year-old Chinese girl presented with sudden onset of bilateral blurred vision. The clinical history, imaging studies, and molecular analysis results were reviewed. The PubMed and OVID databases were used for literature review. RESULTS: Nonischemic CRVO in the subject's right eye and tortuosity of small and medium-sized retinal arterioles in the left eye were found at initial presentation. Bilateral optic disc pallor was then noted with recovery of CRVO. Severe headache and several stroke-like episodes occurred subsequently, with elevated lactate levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome was diagnosed, and mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed G13513A heteroplasmic mutation. Vision was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/800 in the left eye at the last visit. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial DNA G13513A mutation can cause LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. Nonischemic CRVO is a rare manifestation of LHON/MELAS. Atypical findings in cases of LHON should raise the suspicion of overlap syndrome or other mitochondrial diseases.
24063851	A new mutation in MT-ND1 m.3928G>C p.V208L causes Leigh disease with infantile spasms. New mutations in mitochondrial DNA encoded genes of complex I are rarely reported. An infant developed Leigh disease with infantile spasms. Complex I enzyme activity was deficient and response to increasing coenzyme Q concentrations was reduced. Complex I assembly was intact. A new mutation in MT-ND1 m.3928G>C p.V208L, affecting a conserved amino acid in a critical domain, part of the coenzyme Q binding pocket, was present at high heteroplasmy. The unaffected mother did not carry measurable mutant mitochondrial DNA, but concern remained for gonadal mosaicism. Prenatal testing was possible for a subsequent sibling. The ND1 p.V208L mutation causes Leigh disease. 
11335700	Mitochondrial DNA transfer RNA gene sequence variations in patients with mitochondrial disorders. Many different pathogenic mutations in the mitochondrial (mt) transfer RNA (tRNA) genes have been reported for patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Although some of them are recurrent, most have only been described once and appear to be restricted to one patient or to one family. The incidence of mt tRNA gene alterations is not known, even though the frequency of some recurrent mutations has been analysed both in patients and in the general population. In this study, we describe the results of stepwise screening for sequence variations in the mt tRNA genes of 166 patients selected according to several criteria. Extensive sequence analysis of the tRNA genes was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. A total of 31 patients (19%) were found to harbour significant levels of a pathogenic mutation, thus confirming the importance of mt tRNA mutations in human pathology. Forty-three different sequence variations were found, illustrating the great diversity of the mtDNA sequence in humans. The functional assessment of all these sequence variations represented a difficult task; it was mostly based on indirect data, such as the phylogenetic conservation of modified nucleotides and the proportions of variant species in different tissues of the index case or in blood of maternal relatives. Direct demonstration of a correlation between the proportion of heteroplasmic sequence variations and the cytochrome c oxidase defect was performed at the single muscle-fibre level. Eleven heteroplasmic sequence variations were found, six of which are new mutations. One is a known Caucasian polymorphism but the other 10 are pathogenic. Two of them are the well-known pathogenic MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) (A3243G) and MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibres) (A8344G) point mutations. They were found in 23 patients. The eight other mutations were restricted to one patient. The pathogenic nature of these mutations was demonstrated directly for five of them and hypothesized from indirect arguments for the other three. Thirty-two homoplasmic sequence variations were found. Twenty-nine were considered to be polymorphisms, even though 15 of these were found for the first time in our patients and two others had been reported previously as pathogenic. The pathogenic nature of three homoplasmic variants remains questionable.
15351081	Dichloroacetate treatment for mitochondrial cytopathy: long-term effects in MELAS. The long-term effects of the sodium salt of dichloroacetic acid (DCA) were evaluated in four patients with mitochondrial encephalomyelopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) carrying A3243G mutation. Oral administration of DCA in MELAS patients was followed for an average of 5 years 4 months. Serum levels of lactate and pyruvate were maintained at around 10 and 0.6 mg/dl, respectively. Serum levels of DCA were 40-136 microg/ml. Symptoms responding to treatment included persistent headache, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, and stroke-like episodes. In contrast, no improvements in mental status, deafness, short stature, or neuroelectrophysiological findings were observed. Adverse effects included mild liver dysfunction in all patients, hypocalcemia in three and peripheral neuropathy in one. None of these adverse events was severe enough to require discontinuation of treatment. To determine suitable indications for DCA therapy, analysis of many more patients who have undergone DCA administration is required.
16364883	Heart transplantation for progressive cardiomyopathy as a manifestation of MELAS syndrome. Mitochondrial diseases represent a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with a wide array of clinical manifestations. The presentation of patients with mitochondrial pathology largely depends upon the dysfunction of organ systems with large metabolic/energy requirements, including cardiac, neurologic, and musculoskeletal. In particular, mitochondrial myocardial disease can be progressive resulting in congestive heart failure and end-stage heart disease. This article reviews the role of heart transplantation for a particular variant of mitochondrial disorder, mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, and discusses perioperative management issues related to transplantation for mitochondrial cardiomyopathies.
23290211	[Audiologic features of mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation and its correlation with mutation rate]. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical audiologic features of patients with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) A3243G mutation and explore the lesion location of hearing loss so as to examine its correlation with the related syndrome. METHODS: A total of 44 patients with mtDNA A3243G mutation from 2009-2011 were studied. Audiological evaluations consisted of measurements of pure-tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response. We investigated a possible correlation between the degree of hearing loss and gender, age and mutation rate. RESULTS: (1) Pure tone test was performed in 41 patients and showed normal hearing or symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss. Pure tone audiogram (PTA) showed high-frequency loss and descending curve in a majority of patients. There were 75 ears with hearing loss in 82 ears (91.46%), 22 ears with abnormal speech audiometry in 26 ears, 77 ears with abnormal distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE)testing in 86 ears, including 5 ears with normal PTA, 31 ears with abnormal electrocochleography in 75 ears, 25 ears with abnormal auditory brainstem response (ABR) in 82 ears. The abnormal ABR showed elevated threshold in 10 ears, delayed interpeak latencies of wave I-V in 2 ears and disappearance of wave V before wave I in 1 ear. In addition, there were 2 ears with speech audiometry abnormal but with normal ABR. (2) The correlation between the severity of hearing and gender did not reach statistical significance, nor the severity of hearing and mutation ratio. Age could influence the hearing of A3243G-induced MELAS. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant lesions of mtDNA A3243G is at cochlea and retrocochlear sites. Significant variations in clinical manifestation of hearing are the prominent features in patient with A3243G mutation. There was no correlation between the degree of hearing loss and mutation load. However, hearing impairment is the most common symptom of A3243G mutation.
19536585	Brain anomalies in maternally inherited diabetes and deafness syndrome. Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) and myoencephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndromes are characterized by the same A3243G mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Should there be a link between these two clinical entities, one could expect to observe minor signs of MELAS in MIDD patients. To examine this issue, extensive evaluations of brain function and imaging in patients with mitochondrial diabetes and in age-matched type 1 diabetic patients were conducted and compared. MIDD patients (nine A3243G, two T14709G) and nine age-matched type 1 diabetic patients (T1D) were submitted for evaluation of cognitive functions, brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and 1H-MR spectroscopy. Three MIDD patients exhibited cerebellar ataxia. The MIDD group exhibited poorer performances in sustained attention, verbal memory working, and abstract reasoning procedures, in comparison with the T1D group. MR imaging showed cerebellar atrophy in seven out of ten MIDD patients (versus 3 mild/8 in T1D controls) and basal ganglia calcifications in one MIDD patient. No evidence of (sub)acute stroke was detected. White-matter anomalies were observed in both groups (50%). 1H-MR spectroscopy revealed a significant decrease of N-acetyl aspartate only in vermis in the MIDD group, suggesting functional defect and/or neuronal loss. Lactate was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in two MIDD and one T1D patient. Typical manifestations of MELAS are rare in MIDD syndrome, suggesting two different clinical entities. However, cerebellum involvement as assessed by imaging and 1H-MR spectroscopy is shared by both phenotypes.
25365795	Intravoxel incoherent motion magnetic resonance imaging findings in the acute phase of MELAS: a case report. OBJECTIVE: We report the clinical application of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to diagnose a case of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in the acute phase. RESULTS: On IVIM MR Images of this patient, higher perfusion (f) and diffusion (D) values in the left occipital and temporal lobes were found compared to the contralateral areas. CONCLUSION: These findings imply a breakdown of autoregulation with hyperperfusion and vasogenic edema during the acute phase of MELAS, as described in previous reports. IVIM imaging is a valuable, noninvasive tool that simultaneously quantifies perfusion and diffusion parameters.
14607297	Distinguishing ischemic stroke from the stroke-like lesions of MELAS using apparent diffusion coefficient mapping. We report two patients with migraine, acute visual field defects and other neurological symptoms who were found to have high T(2) signal and FLAIR abnormalities on brain MRI in temporal and parieto-occipital regions. In these patients, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of their lesions was increased, distinguishing these lesions from those of ischemic stroke. Both were ultimately diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We conclude that conventional MRI when used with diffusion-weighted MR imaging may be invaluable in detecting mitochondrial-related CNS dysfunction.
15032978	Cerebellar ataxia as atypical manifestation of the 3243A>G MELAS mutation. 
19502062	Association of the MELAS m.3243A>G mutation with myositis and the superiority of urine over muscle, blood and hair for mutation detection. A patient with a known family history of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) due to the MT-TL1 m.3243A>G mutation presented with mild myalgia and very minor upper limb proximal muscle weakness. Muscle histology revealed low levels of cytochrome oxidase-negative fibres and non-specific myositis. Using the last "hot cycle" polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), the MELAS MT-TL1 m.3243A>G mutation was only detected in urine, and not in hair, blood or skeletal muscle. This report highlights the need to screen various tissues to achieve an accurate mitochondrial genetic diagnosis and suggests the likelihood of myositis arising secondary to the MELAS MT-TL1 m.3243A>G mutation.
17825324	Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome with stroke-like imaging presentation: clinical, biochemical and molecular analysis. Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in ORNT1 gene that encodes a mitochondrial ornithine transporter. It has variable clinical presentations with episodic hyperammonemia, liver dysfunction, and chronic neurological manifestations. In this work, we report the findings of HHH syndrome in 3 Saudi siblings. The 4-year-old proband presented with recurrent Reye-like episodes, hypotonia, and multiple stroke-like lesions on brain MRI. Biochemical and molecular analysis confirmed that she had HHH syndrome. She significantly improved on protein restriction and sodium benzoate. Her two older siblings have milder phenotypes with protein intolerance and learning problems. In comparison to their sister, their homocitrulline and orotic acid were only mildly elevated even before treatment. The three patients were homozygous for a novel mutation in ORNT1 with a Gly220Arg change. In view of the CNS lesions, which initially were felt to be suggestive of MELAS, we sequenced the entire mtDNA genome and no potential pathogenic mutations were detected. Analysis of ORNT2 did not provide explanation of the clinical and biochemical variability. This work presents a yet unreported CNS involvement pattern, notably multiple supratentorial stroke-like lesions in association with HHH syndrome. Moreover, it illustrates considerable clinical/biochemical correlation, and describes a novel mutation. We suggest including HHH syndrome in the differential diagnosis of patients found to have stroke-like lesions on brain MRI.

26261593	Mitochondrial genetic analysis in a Chinese family suffering from both mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes and diabetes. To investigate the mitochondrial mutations in patients suffering from both mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and maternally inherited diabetes. MELAS was confirmed by muscle biopsy performed from the biceps muscle of the proband. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The significant mtDNA loci of other 14 family members were further detected according to the sequencing results of the proband. Direct sequencing of PCR products was used to identify the mitochondrial mutations. The proband (III 1) and her brother (III 3) both harbored the tRNALeu (UUR) A3243G mutation, with heteroplasmic levels of 50% and 33% respectively. Moreover, another two mitochondrial variants, A8860G and A15326G, were also detected in the samples of all the family members. MELAS and diabetes can coexist in one patient, and the main cause for these diseases is the tRNALeu (UUR) A3243G mutation. However, other gene variants may contribute to its pathogenesis. This case also supports the concept that both syndromes can be regarded as two phenotypes of the same disease.
26894521	Unique presentation of LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome caused by m.13046T>C in MTND5. BACKGROUND: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and mitochondrial encephalopathy, myopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndromes are mitochondrially inherited disorders characterized by acute visual failure and variable multiorgan system presentation, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 12-year-old girl with otherwise unremarkable medical history presented with abrupt, painless loss of vision. Over the next few months, she developed moderate sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, migraines, anhedonia and thyroiditis. Ocular examination confirmed bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Metabolic workup documented elevated cerebrospinal fluid lactate. Initial genetic analyses excluded the three most common LHON mutations. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing of the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome was performed. RESULTS: Whole mtDNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic heteroplasmic mutation m.13046T>C in MTND5 encoding the ND5 subunit of complex I. This particular variant has previously been described in a single case report of MELAS/Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy). Based on the constellation of clinical symptoms in our patient, we diagnose the condition as LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a unique presentation of LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome resulting from a m.13046T>C mutation in a 12-year-old girl. In patients with sudden vision loss in which three of the most prevalent LHON mitochondrial mutations have been ruled out, molecular genetic examination should be extended to other mtDNA-encoded subunits of MTND5 complex I. Furthermore, atypical clinical presentations must be considered, even in well-described phenotypes.
24708134	The mitochondrial DNA 10197 G > A mutation causes MELAS/Leigh overlap syndrome presenting with acute auditory agnosia. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes/Leigh (MELAS/LS) overlap syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder subtype with clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features that are characteristic of both MELAS and Leigh syndrome (LS). Here, we report an MELAS/LS case presenting with cortical deafness and seizures. Cranial MRI revealed multiple lesions involving bilateral temporal lobes, the basal ganglia and the brainstem, which conformed to neuroimaging features of both MELAS and LS. Whole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and PCR-RFLP revealed a de novo heteroplasmic m.10197 G > A mutation in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 gene (ND3), which was predicted to cause an alanine to threonine substitution at amino acid 47. Although the mtDNA m.10197 G > A mutation has been reported in association with LS, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and dystonia, it has never been linked with MELAS/LS overlap syndrome. Our patient therefore expands the phenotypic spectrum of the mtDNA m.10197 G > A mutation.
32659360	A novel m.11406 T > A mutation in mitochondrial ND4 gene causes MELAS syndrome. Pathogenic point mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with a large number of heterogeneous diseases involving multiple systems with which patients may present with a wide range of clinical phenotypes. In this study, we describe a novel heteroplasmic missense mutation, m.11406 T > A, of the ND4 gene encoding the subunit 4 of mitochondrial complex I in a 32-year-old woman with recurrent epileptic seizure, headache and bilateral hearing loss. Skeletal muscle histochemistry demonstrated that approximately 20% of fibers were cytochrome C oxidase (COX) deficient with increased activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Further investigations in muscle specimens showed significantly reduced level of ND4 protein. It is interesting that the subunits of complex I (ND1 and NDFUB8) and complex IV(CO1) were also remarkably decreased. These findings indicate that ND1, NDFUB8 and CO1 are more susceptible than other subunits to mutations in the mitochondrial ND4 gene.
24674659	High cytochrome c oxidase expression links to severe skeletal energy failure by (31)P-MRS spectroscopy in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the energy metabolism and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle from patients with Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) or chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS), to determine whether abnormally increasing cytochrome c oxidase (COX), as detected in muscle biopsy, could be a cause for MELAS. METHODS: (31)P-MRS was performed on the quadriceps femoris muscle of 12 healthy volunteers and 11 patients diagnosed as MELAS or CPEO by muscle biopsy and genetic analysis. All subjects experienced a state of rest, 5-min exercise, and 5-min recovery protocol in a supine position. RESULTS: Compared to CPEO, MELAS patients typically exhibited COX-positive ragged-red fibers (RRFs) as well as strongly SDH-positive blood vessels (SSVs). However, based on (31)P-MRS results, MELAS showed a higher inorganic phosphate (Pi)/phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio and lower ATP/PCr ratio during exercise and delayed Pi/PCr and ATP/PCr recovery to normal. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that high COX expression contributes to severe skeletal energy failure by (31)P-MRS spectroscopy in MELAS.
19406752	MELAS with A3243G mutation presenting with occipital status epilepticus. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial disorder commonly caused by the A3243G mutation. We report a patient who initially presented with visual hallucinations, headaches, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus originating in left occipital lobe who subsequently progressed to have multifocal seizures. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed subtle T2 hyperintensity at first presentation that subsequently fully resolved. He then had more typical diffusion restriction not conforming to vascular territories. Evolution of his neuroimaging and electroencephalogram (EEG) is discussed with a brief review of literature. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes should be suspected early with occipital lobe seizures.
25038129	Phenotypic analysis of epilepsy in the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes-associated mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. The A to G mitochondrial DNA point mutation at position 3243 (A3243G) is the most common cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS), a systemic multiorgan disease. Epilepsy is a common finding but there is wide phenotypic variation that has not been thoroughly explored. We report the epilepsy phenotypes of 7 patients with the A3243G mutation. Most presented with typical MELAS and epilepsy characterized by infrequent prolonged focal seizures, including epilepsia partialis continua, hemiclonic status epilepticus, nonconvulsive status, and occipital status epilepticus. Seizures usually occurred during the acute phase of a strokelike episode. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges may be seen electrographically. Some patients with this mutation are completely asymptomatic or have mild symptoms typical for mitochondrial diseases. Slow spike-wave activity consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and electrographic status epilepticus was seen in 1 patient who responded to ethosuximide. 
21704194	New mitochondrial tRNA HIS mutation in a family with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We report a new mutation in m.12146 A>G in the mt-tRNA(His) in a family with a remarkable clinical history having different degrees of lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Biochemical measurements of a muscle biopsy established an isolated complex IV deficiency, while similar analysis of fibroblasts showed a combined complex I,III and IV deficiency. Transmitochondrial cybrid analysis proved that this tRNA(His) mutation causes the enzymatic deficiency. This family illustrates the complexity of the clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics of a novel mtDNA encoded disorder, as well as the challenge to prove its pathogenicity.
27179223	Application of molecular imaging combined with genetic screening in diagnosing MELAS, diabetes and recurrent pancreatitis. AIM: We report molecular imaging combined with gene diagnosis in a family with 7 members who carried an A3243G mutation in mitochondrial tRNA and p.Thr 137 Met in cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) gene presented with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), diabetes, and recurrent pancreatitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DNA sequencing was used to detect and validate mitochondrial DNA and PRSS1. We also verified that mitochondrial heterozygous mutations and c.410 C>T mutation causing p.Thr 137 Met could be detected in oral epithelial cells or in urine sediment cells. In addition, molecular imaging was carried out in the affected family members. RESULTS: In this pedigree, MELAS syndrome accompanied by pancreatitis was an important clinical feature, followed by diabetes. Heteroplasmy of the mtDNA A3243G and c.410 C>T mutation of PRSS1 was found in all tissue samples of these patients, but no mutations were found in 520 normal control and normal individuals of the family. However, based on molecular imaging observations, patients with relatively higher lactate/pyruvate levels had more typical and more severe symptoms, particularly those of pancreatic disease (diabetes or pancreatitis). CONCLUSIONS: MELAS syndrome may be associated with pancreatitis. For the diagnosis, it is more reasonable to perform molecular imaging combined with gene diagnosis.
15199381	Noninvasive diagnosis of the 3243A > G mitochondrial DNA mutation using urinary epithelial cells. The 3243A > G mutation is one of the most frequently observed mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and is associated with numerous clinical presentations including mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and diabetes and deafness. The routine diagnosis of the 3243A > G mutation in blood is difficult as mutation levels are known to decrease in this tissue over time, while in some patients it may be absent. We have directly compared the levels of the 3243A > G mutation in skeletal muscle, blood and urinary epithelial cells in 18 patients and observed a striking correlation between the mutation load in postmitotic muscle and urinary epithelium, a mitotic tissue. These data strongly support the use of urinary epithelial cells as the tissue of choice in the noninvasive diagnosis of the 3243A > G mutation.

11309465	Reversible brain dysfunction in MELAS: MEG, and (1)H MRS analysis. This case report describes a follow up investigation of a patient with impaired word discrimination due to mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) and auditory evoked magnetic fields (AEFs). The initial (1)H MRS showed no N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and marked accumulation of lactate (Lac) in the stroke-like lesion of MELAS, which was silent in neural activity according to AEFs. The follow up investigations, however, demonstrated that NAA reappeared, that the formerly increased Lac signal was significantly reduced, and that the magnitude of AEFs of the lesion was markedly increased. Metabolic and functional changes in (1)H MRS and AEFs reflected the neurological recovery very well. The stroke-like lesion was shown, using AEFs and (1)H MRS, to be able to function properly, although brain tissue of the lesion initially had severe damage due to mitochondrial dysfunction.
29190634	Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis Associated with Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia and Mitochondrial DNA A3243G Mutation. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is caused by various etiologies, with mitochondrial dysfunction being one of the causes. FSGS is known to be associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), which is a subclass of mitochondrial disease. However, it has rarely been reported in other mitochondrial disease subclasses. Here, we reported a 20-year-old man diagnosed with FSGS associated with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 3243A>G mutation. He presented with left ptosis, short stature, mild sensorineural deafness, and cardiac conduction block. A renal biopsy sample showed segmental sclerosis and adhesions between capillaries and Bowman's capsule, indicating FSGS. Electron microscopy demonstrated abnormal aggregated mitochondria in podocytes, and the basement membrane and epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule. Skeletal muscle biopsy also showed accumulation of abnormal mitochondria. mtDNA analysis identified heteroplasmic mtDNA 3243A>G mutation with no large-scale deletions. From these findings, we diagnosed the case as CPEO with multi-organ involvement including FSGS. Our report demonstrates that CPEO, as well as MELAS, can be associated with FSGS. Because mitochondrial disease presents with a variety of clinical symptoms, atypical cases with non-classical manifestations are observed. Thus, mitochondrial disease should be considered as an underlying cause of FSGS with systemic manifestations even with atypical phenotypes.
19520270	Rolandic mitochondrial encephalomyelopathy and MT-ND3 mutations. Mitochondrial encephalopathies may be caused by mutations in the respiratory chain complex I subunit genes. Described here are the cases of two pediatric patients who presented with MELAS-like calcarine lesions in addition to novel, bilateral rolandic lesions and epilepsia partialis continua, secondary to MT-ND3 mutations. Data were collected included neurologic symptoms, serial brain imaging, metabolic evaluations, skeletal muscle biopsies, mitochondrial biochemical and molecular testing. Permission for publication was given by the families. Muscle histology revealed nonspecific changes, with no ragged red or blue or COX-negative fibers. Sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA indicated patient 2 to be homoplasmic in muscle for the mt.10158T>C mutation in the ND3 subunit and Patient 1 to be 75% heteroplasmic for the mt.10191T>C mutation, also in ND3. Bilateral rolandic lesions and epilepsia partialis continua accompanied by suspicion of mitochondrial disease are indications to search for an underlying mutation in the MT-ND3 gene.
22638077	A novel mutation in the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene (MTCYB) in a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes syndrome. Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene (MTCYB) have been commonly associated with isolated mitochondrial myopathy and exercise intolerance, rarely with multisystem disorders, and only once with a parkinsonism/mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) overlap syndrome. Here, we describe a novel mutation (m.14864 T>C) in MTCYB in a 15-year-old girl with a clinical history of migraines, epilepsy, sensorimotor neuropathy, and strokelike episodes, a clinical picture reminiscent of MELAS.  The mutation, which changes a highly conserved cysteine to arginine at amino acid position 40 of cytochrome b, was heteroplasmic in muscle, blood, fibroblasts, and urinary sediment from the patient but absent in accessible tissues from her asymptomatic mother. This case demonstrates that MTCYB must be included in the already long list of mitochondrial DNA genes that have been associated with the MELAS phenotype.
30269300	Therapeutic regimen of L-arginine for MELAS: 9-year, prospective, multicenter, clinical research. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of the therapeutic regimen using oral and intravenous L-arginine for pediatric and adult patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). METHODS: In the presence and absence of an ictus of stroke-like episodes within 6 h prior to efficacy assessment, we correspondingly conducted the systematic administration of oral and intravenous L-arginine to 15 and 10 patients with MELAS in two, 2-year, prospective, multicenter clinical trials at 10 medical institutions in Japan. Subsequently, patients were followed up for 7 years. The primary endpoint in the clinical trial of oral L-arginine was the MELAS scale, while that for intravenous L-arginine was the improvement rates of headache and nausea/vomiting at 2 h after completion of the initial intravenous administration. The relationships between the ictuses of stroke-like episodes and plasma arginine concentrations were examined. RESULTS: Oral L-arginine extended the interictal phase (p = 0.0625) and decreased the incidence and severity of ictuses. Intravenous L-arginine improved the rates of four major symptoms-headache, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, and visual disturbance. The maximal plasma arginine concentration was 167 mumol/L when an ictus developed. Neither death nor bedriddenness occurred during the 2-year clinical trials, and the latter did not develop during the 7-year follow-up despite the progressively neurodegenerative and eventually life-threatening nature of MELAS. No treatment-related adverse events occurred, and the formulations of L-arginine were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic administration of oral and intravenous L-arginine may be therapeutically beneficial and clinically useful for patients with MELAS.
30554496	The Usefulness of Muscle Biopsy in Initial Diagnostic Evaluation of Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-Like Episodes. PURPOSE: The disease entity mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is characterized by an early onset of stroke-like episodes. MELAS is the most dominant subtype of mitochondrial disease. Molecular genetic testing is important in the diagnosis of MELAS. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 3243A>G mutation is found in 80% of MELAS patients. Nevertheless, molecular analysis alone may be insufficient to diagnose MELAS because of mtDNA heteroplasmy. This study aimed to evaluate whether muscle biopsy is useful in MELAS patients as an initial diagnostic evaluation method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients who were diagnosed with MELAS at the Department of Pediatrics of Gangnam Severance Hospital between January 2006 and January 2017 were reviewed. The study population included 12 patients. They were divided into two subgroups according to whether the results of muscle pathology were in accordance with mitochondrial diseases. Clinical variables, diagnostic evaluations, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients, seven were muscle pathology-positive for mitochondrial disease. No statistically significant difference in clinical data was observed between the groups that were muscle pathology-positive and muscle pathology-negative for mtDNA 3243A>G mutation. Additionally, the patients with weakness as the initial symptom were all muscle pathology-positive. CONCLUSION: The usefulness of muscle biopsy appears to be limited to an initial confirmative diagnostic evaluation of MELAS. Muscle biopsy can provide some information in MELAS patients with weakness not confirmed by genetic testing.

29289801	Cognitive impairment, clinical severity and MRI changes in MELAS syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine clinical severity, cognitive impairment, and MRI changes in patients with MELAS syndrome. METHODS: Cognitive-mnestic functions, brain MRI (lesion load, cella media index) and clinical severity of ten patients with MELAS syndrome were examined. All patients carried the m.3243A>G mutation. RESULTS: The detailed neuropsychological assessment revealed cognitive deficits in attention, executive function, visuoperception, and -construction. There were significant correlations between these cognitive changes, lesion load in MRI, disturbances in everyday life (clinical scale), and high scores in NMDAS. CONCLUSION: Patients with MELAS syndrome showed no global neuropsychological deficit, but rather distinct cognitive deficits.

9822126	Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) syndrome: an autopsy report. Autopsy reports of patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episode (MELAS) are rare. This report documents the clinical and autopsy findings of a 47-year-old woman with MELAS syndrome. The diagnosis was corroborated by documenting a mitochondrial DNA mutation tRNA-Leu (UUR) at position 3243. The patient's clinical history was marked by schizophrenia, peptic ulcer disease, constipation requiring hemicolectomy, migraine headaches, deafness, and a left temporal lobe infarct. At autopsy, a muscle biopsy demonstrated numerous ragged red fibers and a partial cytochrome C oxidase deficiency. By electron microscopy, increased numbers of slightly hypertrophic mitochondria were observed focally within myocytes and vessel walls; paracrystalline mitochondrial inclusions were not seen. The brain at autopsy showed mild cerebral atrophy and diffuse cortical gliosis. Prominent bilateral basal ganglia calcifications and vascular sclerosis were present, and a small remote left temporal lobe infarct was seen.
28893805	MELAS syndrome associated with a new mitochondrial tRNA-Val gene mutation (m.1616A>G). We describe the case of a 40-year-old-man with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, with cardiomyopathy and severe heart failure. He had a mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) mutation (m.1616A>G) of the (tRNA-Val) gene, and it was not found in MELAS syndrome ever before. The presence of this newly observed tRNA-Val mutation (m.1616A>G) may induce multiple respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies and contribute to MELAS syndrome symptoms that are associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. We report that the pathognomonic symptom in MELAS syndrome caused by this newly observed mtDNA mutation may be rapid progression of cardiomyopathy and severe heart failure.
18955627	Acute blindness. A 15-year-old man presenting with cortical blindness as the initial symptom of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is reported. He showed fluctuating consciousness and severe occipital headache with nausea and vomiting. T2 and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed high signal intensity in the occipital lobes. Electroencephalography showed diffuse sharp waves with focal epileptic discharges over the posterior region. The nature of stroke-like episodes and seizure mechanisms is unexplained in MELAS. Consequently, the possible mechanisms of the cortical blindness in this case are discussed.
17664050	Inappropriate intracranial hemodynamics in the natural course of MELAS. The abnormalities of intracranial hemodynamics associated with strokelike episodes in MELAS are variable depend on the time phase from the onset of strokelike episodes and on the progression of the dementia state. To clarify the regional cerebral blood flows (rCBF) in the natural course of MELAS is very important to understand the pathogenic mechanism of this disorder, either cytopathy, angiopathy or both. We analyzed the serial studies of brain statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 99 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 5 MELAS patients in maximum 10 years interval, who fulfilled the clinical, pathological and genetic criteria of MELAS, and have an A3243G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene. SPM is a proven and effective method for the voxel-by-voxel analysis of functional images which show the advantage in its promise of fully automated neurophysiological imaging analysis throughout the whole brain using various statistical analyses. SPECT acquisition was initiated and was reconstructed by iterative algorithm and were processed and analyzed with SPM 99 for Windows software. Statistics were displayed as Z scores (threshold: P < 0.01). The inappropriate intracranial hemodynamics was found not only at the acute but at the interictal phase, and was getting worse as the disease progress. Hypoperfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex was always observed (corrected P < 0.01) in MELAS patients, which is the typical finding reported in Alzheimer's disease. The inappropriate intracranial hemodynamics is a common feature and may be related with mitochondrial angiopathy in the natural course of MELAS.
30709774	The nuclear background influences the penetrance of the near-homoplasmic m.1630 A > G MELAS variant in a symptomatic proband and asymptomatic mother. In this study, we report the metabolic consequences of the m.1630 A > G variant in fibroblasts from the symptomatic proband affected with the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episode Syndrome and her asymptomatic mother. By long-range PCR followed by massively parallel sequencing of the mitochondrial genome, we accurately measured heteroplasmy in fibroblasts from the proband (89.6%) and her mother (94.8%). Using complementary experimental approaches, we show a functional correlation between manifestation of clinical symptoms and bioenergetic potential. Our mitochondrial morphometric analysis reveals a link between defects of mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure and symptomatic status. Despite near-homoplasmic level of the m.1630A > G variant, the mother's fibroblasts have a normal OXPHOS metabolism, which stands in contrast to the severely impaired OXPHOS response of the proband's fibroblasts. The proband's fibroblasts also exhibit glycolysis at near constitutive levels resulting in a stunted compensatory glycolytic response to offset the severe OXPHOS defect. Whole exome sequencing reveals the presence of a heterozygous nonsense VARS2 variant (p.R334X) exclusively in the proband, which removes two thirds of the VARS2 protein containing key domains interacting with the mt-tRNAval and may play a role in modulating the penetrance of the m.1630A > G variant despite similar near homoplasmic levels. Our transmission electron microscopy study also shows unexpected ultrastructural changes of chromatin suggestive of differential epigenomic regulation between the proband and her mother that may explain the differential OXPHOS response between the proband and her mother. Future study will decipher by which molecular mechanisms the nuclear background influences the penetrance of the m.1630 A > G variant causing MELAS.

Since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary, there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families. The specific features of mitochondrial genetics, however, hamper straightforward definition of recurrence risks as in Mendelian diseases. Empirical risks were recently provided for MELAS and MERRF syndromes and for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. In MELAS and MERFF, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring. As Leigh syndrome is found with maternal, autosomal recessive or X chromosomal transmission, the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling. Prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far, and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant DNA in chorionic villi and in clinically relevant tissues such as brain.
10100521	Successful cochlear implantation in a patient with MELAS syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To describe methods of assessing cochlear implant candidacy in patients with potentially significant peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) degeneration. STUDY DESIGN: A patient with a degenerative CNS disease (MELAS syndrome) undergoing evaluation for cochlear implantation is described. SETTING: This study took place at a tertiary care center. PATIENT: A patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who had cortical blindness and profound sensorineural hearing loss was evaluated and rehabilitated with cochlear implantation. INTERVENTIONS: Pure-tone audiogram, behavioral responses to promontory stimulation electrical auditory brainstem response, and electrically evoked middle-latency responses (MLRs) were used to assess eighth nerve, auditory brainstem, and cortical auditory pathways. Cochlear implantation with Cochlear Corporation mini 22 implant was performed. RESULTS: Repeatable electrically evoked MLRs and behavioral responses to promontory stimulation documented the presence of auditory cortical responses. Successful implantation resulted in open set speech recognition and communication using the auditory/oral mode. CONCLUSION: This report describes successful implantation in a patient with MELAS syndrome and demonstrates the ability to preoperatively confirm the integrity of brainstem and cortical auditory pathways despite significant CNS degeneration.

14983231	Platelet function in mitochondriopathy with stroke and stroke-like episodes. Stroke and stroke-like episodes are frequent complications in mitochondriopathy, particularly in MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes) which is a disorder of the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in diverse cell types. To clarify a possible pathological aspect of stroke in these patients, we investigated platelet function before and after physical exercise. Ten patients with mitochondriopathy and stroke and ten healthy sex and age matched controls were investigated in an analyst blinded, prospective cross-sectional trial. Exercise decreased intraplatelet adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations by -22% from baseline in patients with mitochondriopathy (p<0.01 between groups) while exercise increased ATP-levels by 28% healthy controls (p=0.01 vs baseline). Thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) stimulated P-selectin expression increased up to 50% (p<0.05) in healthy subjects following exercise compared to 39% (p>0.05) in patients with mitochondriopathy. Exercise trendwise decreased platelet plug formation under shear stress by 24% in patients as measured by the platelet function analyzer PFA-100(R). Tromboelastography showed firm thrombus formation and delayed lysis in patients following exercise. In conclusion, this trial has shown that ATP depletion during and after exercise probably accounts for a defective oxidative metabolism in platelets of patients with mitochondriopathy and stroke. This might induce decreased platelet function in these patients but fails to explain the increased stroke rate. Therefore other mechanisms seem to be etiologically involved in the pathogenesis of stroke in patients with mitochondriopathy.
19664878	Laminar cortical necrosis in mitochondrial disorders. OBJECTIVES: Laminar cortical necrosis, defined as focal or diffuse necrosis of one or more cortical lamina, represents an increasingly recognized neuropathological endpoint of vascular, endocrine, immunologic, metabolic, or toxic conditions, of which mitochondrial disorders (MIDs) are the third most frequent after cerebral ischemia and hypoxia. AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of laminar cortical necrosis in MIDs, types of MIDs associated with laminar cortical necrosis, and the morphological characteristics on imaging and autopsy. METHODS: Medline literature review for the terms "laminar cortical necrosis", "cortical signal change", "mitochondrial" and all acronyms of syndromatic MIDs. RESULTS: Among 139 hits for "laminar cortical necrosis", 10 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria (7%). Among the ten hits five were case series and the other five single case reports. The syndromic MID most frequently associated with laminar cortical necrosis is the MELAS syndrome, but was also described in a single patient each with Leigh syndrome, mitochondrial depletion syndrome, and mitochondrial spinocerebellar ataxia. The morphological and pathohistological features of laminar cortical necrosis in MIDs were not at variance from those in non-mitochondrial disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In MIDs laminar cortical necrosis represents the histopathological and imaging endpoint of a stroke-like lesion. Though laminar cortical necrosis may have a wide pathophysiological background the histological and imaging characteristics do not vary between the different underlying conditions.
34605558	"Disappearing Infarct" Is Late-Onset MELAS. 
22549360	Steroid responsive A3243G mutation MELAS: clinical and radiographic evidence for regional hyperperfusion leading to neuronal loss. INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a multisystem disorder caused by systemic cellular metabolic derangement that is characterized predominantly by rapidly progressive deterioration of the central nervous system. CASE REPORT: We describe a patient with an abrupt onset of rapidly recurring episodes of aphasia, hemianopsia, and parietal pseudocerebellar ataxia, leading to the diagnosis of A3243G mutation MELAS. These stroke-like episodes appeared to be initiated by metabolic derangement, as evidenced by lactic-acid elevation in the cerebral spinal fluid and lactate peaks observed on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging further revealed that neuronal loss during the acute episodes occurred in regions of paradoxically increased cerebral blood flow. Diffusion-tensor and arterial-spin-labeled perfusion imaging showed that the volume of tissue loss after the stroke-like episodes greatly exceeded the limits of the cortical areas affected by the initial metabolic insult. The patient was consented to a trial of compassionate use, high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, resulting in marked and sustained clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of neurons lost in an acute episode are injured not by a primary failure to meet metabolic demand, but by a poorly regulated compensatory hyperperfusion response. Regional hyperperfusion leads to apoptotic cell death through a progression from vasogenic to cytotoxic edema. The efficacy of corticosteroids in our study patient demonstrates that inflammatory mediators and blood-brain barrier dysfunction may play a role in the pathophysiological cascade that leads to the regional hyperperfusion in MELAS.
29376197	Mitochondrial A3243G mutation results in corneal endothelial polymegathism. PURPOSE: The mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G leads to a spectrum of syndromes ranging from MIDD to MELAS. Ocular manifestations include pattern macular dystrophy and concentric perifoveal atrophy. Given the high metabolic demand of corneal endothelial cells, we performed specular biomicroscopy analysis in patients harboring the mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G to assess for the associated presence of corneal endothelial abnormalities. METHODS: We present a case series with participants from two institutions. Patients diagnosed with macular dystrophy associated with MIDD or MELAS, and the mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G were recruited. Exclusion criteria included a prior diagnosis, or a positive family history, of endothelial corneal dystrophy. Slit-lamp corneal examination and specular biomicroscopy were performed. Corneal endothelial cell count, cell size and polymegathism, and central corneal thickness were assessed. Patients diagnosed with MIDD or MELAS based on clinical history and examination were genetically tested for the mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G using pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Five patients (two male and three female participants) from five different families, and with different ethnic backgrounds, met the inclusion criteria. Their ages ranged from 41 to 60 years. Corneal endothelial changes observed using slit-lamp examination were primarily mild to rare guttata. Specular biomicroscopy displayed mainly polymegathism associated with guttata. The average endothelial cell count was 2358 +- 456 cells per mm2, the average endothelial cell size was 442 +- 103 mum2 and the average central corneal thickness (CCT) was 551 +- 33 mum. These values were similar to that of the average population. The average coefficient of variation (COV), an index of heterogeneity in cell size, was 42.0 +- 4.1%. When compared to the average population, the average COV was significantly higher than predicted for the patients' age. None of the patients had signs of corneal edema. One patient had a pre-Descemet's opacity. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with the mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G, corneal endothelial polymegathism is present. This is mainly associated with mild guttata. The findings of corneal endothelial cell polymegathism may be a biomarker of mitochondrial disease, specifically in patients with the mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation.
34436748	Knowledge about the characteristics of stroke-like lesions is expandable. Stroke-like episodes (SLEs) are a common phenotypic feature of various syndromic and non-syndromic mitochondrial disorders (MIDs), particularly of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode syndrome (MELAS). The morphological equivalent of a SLE is the stroke-like lesion (SLE), a dynamic lesion, which initially expands to regress after weeks or months. SLLs present with typical morphological and structural abnormalities on multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and FDG-PET. It is crucial to clearly delineate SLLs from ischemic stroke, as treatment and outcome vary significantly between the two.
15111665	Cerebral lactic acidosis correlates with neurological impairment in MELAS. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of chronic cerebral lactic acidosis in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). METHODS: The authors studied 91 individuals from 34 families with MELAS and the A3243G point mutation and 15 individuals from two families with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF) and the A8344G mutation. Subjects were divided into four groups. Paternal relatives were studied as controls (Group 1). The maternally related subjects were divided clinically into three groups: asymptomatic (no clinical evidence of neurologic disease) (Group 2), oligosymptomatic (neurologic symptoms but without the full clinical picture of MELAS or MERRF) (Group 3), and symptomatic (fulfilling MELAS or MERRF criteria) (Group 4). The authors performed a standardized neurologic examination, neuropsychological testing, MRS, and leukocyte DNA analysis in all subjects. RESULTS: The symptomatic and oligosymptomatic MELAS subjects had significantly higher ventricular lactate than the other groups. There was a significant correlation between degree of neuropsychological and neurologic impairment and cerebral lactic acidosis as estimated by ventricular MRS lactate levels. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of ventricular lactate, the brain spectroscopic signature of MELAS, are associated with more severe neurologic impairment.
19011735	Acute auditory agnosia as the presenting hearing disorder in MELAS. MELAS is commonly associated with peripheral hearing loss. Auditory agnosia is a rare cortical auditory impairment, usually due to bilateral temporal damage. We document, for the first time, auditory agnosia as the presenting hearing disorder in MELAS. A young woman with MELAS (A3243G mtDNA mutation) suffered from acute cortical hearing damage following a single stroke-like episode, in the absence of previous hearing deficits. Audiometric testing showed marked central hearing impairment and very mild sensorineural hearing loss. MRI documented bilateral, acute lesions to superior temporal regions. Neuropsychological tests demonstrated auditory agnosia without aphasia. Our data and a review of published reports show that cortical auditory disorders are relatively frequent in MELAS, probably due to the strikingly high incidence of bilateral and symmetric damage following stroke-like episodes. Acute auditory agnosia can be the presenting hearing deficit in MELAS and, conversely, MELAS should be suspected in young adults with sudden hearing loss.
9808277	Metabolic causes of recurrent rhabdomyolysis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the biochemical causes of recurrent rhabdomyolysis in Finland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 22 patients with recurrent rhabdomyolysis, and 26 patients with one episode of rhabdomyolysis or other symptoms compatible with metabolic myopathy. Muscle histopathology and activities of phosphorylase (PHRL) (total and active), phosphofructokinase (PFK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) and myoadenylate deaminase (MAD) were studied. The limit of enzyme deficiency was defined as enzyme activity less than 5% of the mean of the control subjects. RESULTS: We found 4 patients with muscle PHRL deficiency, 1 patient with PFK deficiency and 1 patient with evidence of phosphorylase kinase deficiency. One patient had Becker's muscle dystrophy, 2 patients had unspecified dystrophies, 1 patient had Miyoshi myopathy, and 1 patient had a form of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (MELAS). CONCLUSION: Enzyme defects were found in 23% of the patients with recurrent rhabdomyolysis. Other muscle diseases, muscular dystrophies or myopathies, were detected in 18% of these patients, emphasizing the value of clinical and histopathological examination of patients with previous rhabdomyolysis.
30693531	Focal cerebellar infarction as an initial sign of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a type of mitochondrial disorder and stroke-like lesions are observed prominently in the brain magnetic resonance imaging. Those stroke-like lesions of MELAS patients are usually located in the posterior quadrants and do not correspond to typical vascular territories. This case illustrates that focal cerebellar infarction can be the sole initial sign of MELAS.
12944725	Rhabdomyolysis in a patient with MELAS syndrome. 
20740354	Successful left hemihepatectomy and perioperative management of a patient with biliary cystadenocarcinoma, complicated with MELAS syndrome: report of a case. Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) is a rare, fetal disease caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA that leads to impaired oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle, the central nervous system, and liver function. This report presents the case of a 50-year-old woman with biliary cystadenocarcinoma complicated by MELAS who underwent a successful left hemihepatectomy. In this case, the diagnostic key for the malignant tumor was an (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography study, which was useful even in a patient with MELAS, which causes abnormal glucose metabolism. The perioperative management of such patients includes special precautions to prevent lactic acidosis and deterioration of the reserved liver function after a hepatectomy, since the mitochondrial function in MELAS patients is abnormal. The patient in this report has remained free of liver dysfunctions and cancer recurrence for 2 years following the hepatectomy. This is the first report of a successful major hepatectomy for a patient with MELAS.
11393411	An 80-year-old mitochondrial disease patient with A3243G tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene presenting cardiac dysfunction as the main symptom. MELAS is characterized by mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes, but cardiac involvement also frequently occurs. An 80-year-old female patient had been suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and neurosensory hearing loss. At the age of 79 she suffered metabolic acidosis with persistent drowsiness and was subsequently found to have severe cardiac dysfunction. Muscle biopsy disclosed the presence of abnormal mitochondria, and the MELAS gene mutation (A3243G of the tRNA(Leu(UUR))) was demonstrated. It is noteworthy that this mitochondrial disease patient has survived until a great age, which shows the wide clinical spectrum of MELAS, especially in the age of onset.
25766436	Macular pattern dystrophy and homonymous hemianopia in MELAS syndrome. We report an unusual association of a pattern dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and homonymous hemianopia in a woman diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome.

12364623	A polytene chromosome analysis of the Anopheles gambiae species complex. Field-collected specimens of all known taxa in the Anopheles gambiae complex were analyzed on the basis of chromosome inversions with reference to a standard polytene chromosome map. The phylogenetic relationships among the seven described species in the complex could be inferred from the distribution of fixed inversions. Nonrandom patterns of inversion distribution were observed and, particularly on chromosome arm 2R, provided evidence for genetically distinct populations in A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, and A. melas. In A. gambiae from Mali, stable genetic differentiation was observed even in populations living in the same region, suggesting a process of incipient speciation which is being confirmed by studies with molecular markers. The possible role of chromosome differentiation in speciation of the A. gambiae complex and in the emergence of distinct chromosomal forms within the nominal species is discussed in relation to human malaria.
30643957	[Mitochondrial diseases]. Mitochondrial diseases (MD) are caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA. The clinical manifestation is often most severe in tissues with high energy demands. The most common MDs are Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Therapeutic approaches for MD include bridging of respiratory chain defects, pharmacological stimulation of mitochondrial metabolism, supplementation of deficient factors and symptomatic treatment. Initial gene therapeutic approaches for causal treatment have already reached the clinical development stage. This article provides an introduction to MD, a summary of the most important syndromes and an overview over established and innovative therapeutic approaches.
17272912	Pregnancy-precipitated status epilepticus: a rare presentation of MELAS syndrome. 
24003133	Tissue- and cell-type-specific manifestations of heteroplasmic mtDNA 3243A>G mutation in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived disease model. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations manifest with vast clinical heterogeneity. The molecular basis of this variability is mostly unknown because the lack of model systems has hampered mechanistic studies. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells from patients carrying the most common human disease mutation in mtDNA, m.3243A>G, underlying mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. During reprogramming, heteroplasmic mtDNA showed bimodal segregation toward homoplasmy, with concomitant changes in mtDNA organization, mimicking mtDNA bottleneck during epiblast specification. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and various tissues derived from teratomas manifested cell-type specific respiratory chain (RC) deficiency patterns. Similar to MELAS patient tissues, complex I defect predominated. Upon neuronal differentiation, complex I specifically was sequestered in perinuclear PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin-positive autophagosomes, suggesting active degradation through mitophagy. Other RC enzymes showed normal mitochondrial network distribution. Our data show that cellular context actively modifies RC deficiency manifestation in MELAS and that autophagy is a significant component of neuronal MELAS pathogenesis. 
23196335	Neuroimaging characteristics in mitochondrial encephalopathies associated with the m.3243A>G MTTL1 mutation. Stroke-like lesions (SLL) are common radiological findings in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (SLE; MELAS) harboring the m.3243A>G MTTL1 mutation. Imaging patterns in the m.3243A>G mutation carriers with encephalopathies lacking SLE have not been systematically examined to date. The aim of this study was to analyze brain imaging findings in encephalopathies associated with the m.3243A>G mutation irrespective of the presence or absence of SLE. Brain MRI and cranial CT scans from 11 m.3243A>G mutation carriers with encephalopathies were analyzed by two neuroradiologists in consensus. We evaluated stroke-like lesions (SLL), deep grey matter (DGM) changes on T1- and T2-weighted MR images, calcification on CT, brain atrophy, and white matter (WM) changes. SLL were present in all patients showing the full MELAS phenotype with SLE (4/11). Seven patients did not show SLE. DGM changes with T1 hyperintensity and T2 hypointensity were a distinctive finding in most patients (7/11) and present in the majority of m.3243A>G mutation carriers lacking SLE (5/7). DGM changes were also seen in half of our MELAS patients with SLL (2/4), though less pronounced. Brain atrophy was a prominent finding in general and accentuated in the cerebellum. In contrast, WM changes were rather mild and more prevalent and pronounced in MELAS. Our data stress that the distinction between MELAS with SLE and m.3243A>G mutation carriers lacking SLE is rather artificial. In clinical practice, mitochondrial disorders associated with the m.3243A>G mutation should be taken into consideration in encephalopathies with DGM changes, even when SLE and SLL are lacking.
16525920	[Characteristics of status epilepticus in MELAS. Analysis of four cases]. INTRODUCTION: Clinical characteristics of status epilepticus (SE) as a first manifestation in patients with MELAS who had not previously epileptic episode has been studied little in the literature. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to analyse precipitating factors, clinical characteristics, EEG and difficulties in the treatment of SE in MELAS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied four cases with ages between 27 an 41 years who began with SE and they had been diagnosed with MELAS during the episode. Case 3 was confirmed by autopsy. Cases 1, 2 and 4 showed a 3243 mtDNA mutation in the lymphocytes. Epileptic seizures had not been present in any previous status case. The precipitating factor in cases 1 and 3 was fever and in case 2 and 4 stress by headache. Moreover in case 2 second status was caused by stress in hyperglycaemic ketoacidosis. All cases were studied with EEG and a brain CT or MRI. RESULTS: All patients started with epilepsia partialis continua that began with partial motor simple seizures, but sometimes progressed to partial complex seizures or secondary tonic clonic seizures. In two cases the initial symptom was migraine with aura, in two cases fever with cephalalgia and in one case diabetes mellitus decompensation. The EEG during a seizure presented a complex pseudoperiodic complex in the temporal-occipital contralateral region that spread to all hemisphere when myoclonus was increased. CONCLUSIONS: SE in MELAS appears in cell stress situation precipitated by hypermetabolic conditions and it provokes claudication in ill mitochondria. In fact, events such as fever, glycemic alterations, hypoxemia or headache that could change the normal mechanism of sequester mitochondrial calcium in the neuron are able to trigger SE. Optimal evolution depends on an improvement of basal metabolic conditions that could precipitate the status. Supplementary folic acid, riboflavin and coenzyme Q 10 can be useful.
18358970	Cardiac tamponade: a new complication in a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes. We report the first case of cardiac tamponade in a 14-year-old female patient with an underlying illness of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The patient underwent a subxiphoid pericardiocentesis and pericardiotomy smoothly and was discharged with no sequelae. The coexistence of massive pericardial effusion and MELAS has never been mentioned in any literature. This case report attempts to exemplify the possibility of this connection.
30946993	Mitochondrial metabolic stroke: Phenotype and genetics of stroke-like episodes. Stroke-like episodes (SLEs) are the hallmark of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episode (MELAS) syndrome but rarely occur also in other specific or nonspecific mitochondrial disorders. Pathophysiologically, SLLs are most likely due to a regional disruption of the blood-brain barrier triggered by the underlying metabolic defect, epileptic activity, drugs, or other factors. SLEs manifest clinically with a plethora of cerebral manifestations, which not only include features typically seen in ischemic stroke, but also headache, epilepsy, ataxia, visual impairment, vomiting, and psychiatric abnormalities. The morphological correlate of a SLE is the stroke-like lesion (SLL), best visualised on multimodal MRI. In the acute stages, a SLL presents as vasogenic edema but may be mixed up with cytotoxic components. Additionally, SLLs are characterized by hyperperfusion on perfusion studies. In the chronic stage, SLLs present with a colorful picture before they completely disappear, or end up as white matter lesion, cyst, laminar cortical necrosis, focal atrophy, or as toenail sign. Treatment of SLLs is symptomatic and relies on recommendations by experts. Beneficial effects have been reported with nitric-oxide precursors, antiepileptic drugs, antioxidants, the ketogenic diet, and steroids. Lot of research is still needed to uncover the enigma SLE/SLL.
11043434	A MELAS phenotype and a paternal inherited inversion of chromosome 10 in a female patient. A MELAS phenotype and a paternal inherited inversion of chromosome 10 in a female patient: We describe a patient suffering from encephalomyopathy with overlapping symptoms, including MELAS and Kearn-Sayre syndrome features. Mutations in tRNA LEU (UUR) were not found in mtDNA of blood cells, suggesting a different genetic defect. Cytogenetic studies revealed a paternal inherited pericentric inversion of chromosome 10 (p13;q22) pat. Although the presence of the same inversion in the father and in the apparently asymptomatic sister does rather suggest that the concurrence of the mitochondrial disease in the patient was due to chance, some alternative explanations to associate both events might be proposed.

30471880	mTOR inhibitors may benefit kidney transplant recipients with mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial diseases represent a significant clinical challenge. Substantial efforts have been devoted to identifying therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial disorders, but effective interventions have remained elusive. Recently, we reported attenuation of disease in a mouse model of the human mitochondrial disease Leigh syndrome through pharmacological inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). The human mitochondrial disorder MELAS/MIDD (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like Episodes/Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness) shares many phenotypic characteristics with Leigh syndrome. MELAS/MIDD often leads to organ failure and transplantation and there are currently no effective treatments. To examine the therapeutic potential of mTOR inhibition in human mitochondrial disease, four kidney transplant recipients with MELAS/MIDD were switched from calcineurin inhibitors to mTOR inhibitors for immunosuppression. Primary fibroblast lines were generated from patient dermal biopsies and the impact of rapamycin was studied using cell-based end points. Metabolomic profiles of the four patients were obtained before and after the switch. pS6, a measure of mTOR signaling, was significantly increased in MELAS/MIDD cells compared to controls in the absence of treatment, demonstrating mTOR overactivation. Rapamycin rescued multiple deficits in cultured cells including mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, and replicative capacity. Clinical measures of health and mitochondrial disease progression were improved in all four patients following the switch to an mTOR inhibitor. Metabolomic analysis was consistent with mitochondrial function improvement in all patients.
21085000	Intraventricular conduction disturbances and paroxysmal atrioventricular block in a young patient with MELAS. We present the case of a 36-year-old male patient with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) who developed intraventricular conduction disturbances and syncopal episodes due to a paroxysmal atrioventricular block. This case suggests that in MELAS, as well as in other mithochondriopathies, intraventricular conduction disturbances and atrioventricular block can be features of the disease. In our case, progression toward atrioventricular block was rapid, suggesting that in MELAS patients presenting with worsening conduction system anomalies, pacemaker implantation has to be considered without delay, irrespective of age.

A 36-year-old man with a 15-year history of psychosis, seizures, and sensorineural hearing loss and a family history of diabetes mellitus and heart disease presented to our hospital without a unifying diagnosis. Physiologic, biochemical, and genetic testing revealed deficient aerobic metabolism, a defect in mitochondrial electron transport, and the presence of an A-to-G point mutation at position 3243 of the mitochondrial leucine-transfer RNA gene, establishing the diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike syndrome (MELAS). Diagnosing mtDNA disorders requires a careful integration of clinical signs and symptoms with pedigree analysis and multidisciplinary testing. Diagnosis is important to provide genetic counseling, avoid unnecessary evaluation, and facilitate therapy for symptomatic relief.
12939448	Response to sumatriptan in headache of MELAS syndrome. 
11997068	External ophthalmoplegia with severe progressive multiorgan involvement associated with the mtDNA A3243G mutation. BACKGROUND: Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) may be related to primary nuclear DNA or mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations. The A3243G mtDNA point mutation most frequently causes mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, but also has been associated with other phenotypes including CPEO, migraine, seizure, diabetes, and sensorineural hearing loss. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 38-year-old white man with seizures and progressive difficulties of infantile origin including CPEO, sensorineural hearing loss, cataracts, migraines, multiple endocrinopathy, myopathy, and cardiomyopathy. Moderate hearing loss in association with CPEO, diabetes mellitus, or migraines were noted in the proband's maternal grandmother, great aunt, mother, and three sisters, suggesting either an autosomal dominant or maternal inheritance. Detailed histological and biochemical analysis of the proband's biopsied muscle specimen revealed severe abnormalities compatible with a mitochondrial disease. MtDNA analysis excluded large-scale deletions, but revealed a heteroplasmic A to G transition at nt3243 in 56.4% and 27.4% of molecules in muscle and white blood cells, respectively. CONCLUSION: We discuss possible causes of this intrafamilial heterogeneity of phenotypes associated with the A3243G mtDNA mutation.
32833489	MELAS Syndrome and MIDD Unmasked by Metformin Use: A Case Report. 
28639102	The clinical and genetic characteristics in children with mitochondrial disease in China. Mitochondrial disease was a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases, thus the diagnosis was very difficult to clinicians. Our objective was to analyze clinical and genetic characteristics of children with mitochondrial disease in China. We tested 141 candidate patients who have been suspected of mitochondrial disorders by using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), and summarized the clinical and genetic data of gene confirmed cases from Neurology Department, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2012 to January 2015. In our study, 40 cases of gene confirmed mitochondrial disease including eight kinds of mitochondrial disease, among which Leigh syndrome was identified to be the most common type, followed by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The age-of-onset varies among mitochondrial disease, but early onset was common. All of 40 cases were gene confirmed, among which 25 cases (62.5%) with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation, and 15 cases (37.5%) with nuclear DNA (nDNA) mutation. M.3243A>G (n=7) accounts for a large proportion of mtDNA mutation. The nDNA mutations include SURF1 (n=7), PDHA1 (n=2), and NDUFV1, NDUFAF6, SUCLA2, SUCLG1, RRM2B, and C12orf65, respectively.
14618718	Surface properties of the skin of the pilot whale Globicephala melas. On the skin surface of delphinids small biofoulers are challenged to high shear water flow and liquid-vapor interfaces of air-bubbles during jumping. This state of self-cleaning is supported by the even, nano-rough gel-coated epidermal surface of the skin. The present study focussed on the intercellular evolution of gel formation and the chemical composition of the gel smoothing the skin surface of the pilot whale, Globicephala melas, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in combination with cryo-scanning electron microscopy (CSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the superficial layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, intercellular material was shown by electron optical methods to assemble from smaller into larger covalently cross-linked aggregates during the transit of the corneocytes towards the skin surface. XPS measurements showed that the surface of the skin and the intercellular gel included approximately the same amounts of polar groups (especially, free amines and amides) and non-polar groups, corresponding to the presence of lipid droplets dispersed within the jelly material. It was concluded from the results that the gel-coat of the skin surface is a chemically heterogeneous skin product. The advantages of chemically heterogeneous patches contributing to the ablation of traces of the biofouling process are discussed.

Long-finned pilot whales are highly social odontocetes found in temperate and subpolar regions. This species is particularly known for its interaction with fisheries as well as its mass strandings. Recent tagging work has provided some information about pilot whales in the wild but, even though they have been successfully kept in captivity, little is known about their sensory capabilities. This study investigates the hearing abilities of a rehabilitated 2 year old male long-finned pilot whale. A complete audiogram was collected using auditory evoked potential techniques that included measurements of nine frequencies from 4 to 100 kHz presented as sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones. The results indicated that the region of best hearing was between 11.2 and 50 kHz and the subject had relatively poor high frequency hearing compared with other odontocete species. This study emphasizes the importance of collecting basic hearing measurements from new species, understanding diagnostic life histories as well as continuously increasing the sample size of audiometry measurements within and between odontocete species as animals become available.
15347257	Diagnosis and management of MELAS. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is the most common maternally inherited mitochondrial disease. An A-->G mutation in the transfer RNA(Leu(UUR)) gene at position 3243 of the mitochondrial DNA accounts for most MELAS cases. The transient nature of the stroke-like episodes is reflected in abnormalities on neuroimaging. The cardinal laboratory abnormalities include elevated serum lactate during the acute episodes and respiratory enzyme defects in skeletal muscle. Muscle biopsy also helps confirm the diagnosis by identifying abnormal proliferation of mitochondria. Although current treatment options for MELAS are largely supportive, several therapeutic approaches have been attempted with limited success. Genetic counseling is an important component of patient management in MELAS. Newer reproductive technologies hold promise for reducing the recurrence of MELAS in subsequent generations. Advances in research into gene therapy offer hope of treatment for the future.
15576053	Focused proteomics: towards a high throughput monoclonal antibody-based resolution of proteins for diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases. The availability of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation chain (OXPHOS) and other mitochondrial components facilitates the analysis and ultimately the diagnosis of mitochondrially related diseases. mAbs against each of the five complexes and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) are the basis of a rapid and simple immunocytochemical approach [Hanson, B.J., Capaldi, R.A., Marusich, M.F. and Sherwood, S.W., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 50 (2002) 1281-1288]. This approach can be used to detect if complexes have altered assembly in mitochondrial disease due to mutations in nuclear encoded genes, such as in Leigh's disease, or in mitochondrially encoded genes, e.g., MELAS. Other mAbs have recently been obtained that can immunocapture each of the five OXPHOS complexes, PDH and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) from very small amounts of tissue such as that obtained from cell culture or needle biopsies from patients. When adapted to a 96-well plate format, these mAbs allow measurement of the specific activity of each of the mitochondrial components individually and analysis of their subunit composition and state of posttranslational modification. The immunocapture protocol should be useful not only in the analysis of genetic mitochondrial diseases but also in evaluating and ultimately diagnosing late-onset mitochondrial disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and late-onset diabetes, which are thought to result from accumulated oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins such as the OXPHOS chain.
16213527	Detection of 14-3-3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid in mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. We describe a 13-year-old boy with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who experienced a stroke-like episode resulting in severe mental regression and quadriplegia. We tested 14-3-3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patient four times around a stroke-like episode in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Detection of the protein in the CSF was well correlated with the clinical course and range of damage of the brain lesion on MRI. Interestingly, 14-3-3 CSF protein was detected at the beginning of mitochondrial encephalopathy without new MRI abnormalities, suggesting that it is a sensitive brain marker. We conclude that 14-3-3 CSF protein is a useful biological marker of brain disruption in MELAS as well as other neurological disorders.
32641653	A MELAS Patient Developing Fatal Acute Renal Failure with Lactic Acidosis and Rhabdomyolysis. We herein present a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), who developed serious acute renal failure with lactic acidosis, followed by rhabdomyolysis. Despite receiving intensive care, he suffered multiple cardiopulmonary arrests and died 10 days after presentation due to a sudden deterioration of his symptoms. Renal pathology revealed diffuse tubular necrosis with interstitial edema and tubular dilatation on light microscopy, and a severe degeneration of intracellular organelles on electron microscopy. These pathological findings could have resulted from multiple cardiopulmonary arrests; however, we must be aware of the extremely rare but sudden occurrence of these fatal conditions in MELAS patients.

17966248	CT and MRI appearance of mitochondrial encephalopathy. A case is reported of a 20-year-old female presenting with confusion and progressive sensory aphasia. CT and MRI showed bilateral and symmetric acute necrosis of the basal ganglia and of the left temporal and occipital lobe, besides chronic spinocerebellar degeneration. The imaging findings suggested a mitochrondrial encephalopathy. Genetic examination confirmed a MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactate acidosis and stroke like episodes).
29272804	Outcome of epilepsy in patients with mitochondrial disorders: Phenotype genotype and magnetic resonance imaging correlations. OBJECTIVES: Studies exploring the outcome of epilepsy in patients with mitochondrial disorders are limited. This study examined the outcome of epilepsy in patients with mitochondrial disorders and its relation with the clinical phenotype, genotype and magnetic resonance imaging findings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort was derived from the database of 67 patients with definite genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders evaluated over a period of 11years (2006-2016). Among this, 27 had epilepsy and were included in final analysis. Data were analyzed with special reference to clinical phenotypes, genotypes, epilepsy characteristics, EEG findings, anti epileptic drugs used, therapeutic response, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Patients were divided into three groups according to the seizure frequency at the time of last follow up: Group I- Seizure free; Group II- Infrequent seizures; Group III- uncontrolled seizures. For each group the clinical phenotype, genotype, magnetic resonance imaging and duration of epilepsy were compared. RESULTS: The phenotypes & genotypes included Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke like episodes (MELAS) & m.3243A>G mutation (n = 10), Myoclonic Epilepsy Ragged Red Fiber syndrome (MERRF) & m.8344A>G mutation (n = 4), Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia plus &POLG1 mutation (CPEO, n = 6), episodic neuroregression due to nuclear mutations (n = 6; NDUFV1 (n = 3), NDUFA1, NDUFS2, MPV17-1 one each), and one patient with infantile basal ganglia stroke syndrome, mineralizing angiopathy &MT-ND5 mutations. Seven patients (25.9%) were seizure free; seven had infrequent seizures (25.9%), while thirteen (48.1%) had frequent uncontrolled seizures. Majority of the subjects in seizure free group had episodic neuroregression & leukoencephalopathy due to nuclear mutations (85.7%). Patients in group II with infrequent seizures had CPEO, POLG1 mutation and a normal MRI (71%) while 62% of the subjects in group III had MELAS, m.3243A>G mutation and stroke like lesions on MRI. CONCLUSIONS: A fair correlation exists between the outcome of epilepsy, clinical phenotypes, genotypes and magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The recognition of these patterns is important clinically because of the therapeutic and prognostic implications.

15351086	Beneficial effect of L-arginine for stroke-like episode in MELAS. We here reported the clinical course and therapeutic details of a 16-year-old girl with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who had had five stroke-like episodes (two episodes were clinically mild, while the three subsequent episodes were severe). Among the three episodes, the symptoms improved earliest and magnetic resonance spectroscopy abnormality was minimal when given L-arginine in addition to prednisolone, glycerol and edalavone. L-arginine administration during the acute phase of MELAS might be a potential therapy to reduce brain damage due to mitochondrial dysfunction.
21518340	Expanding the clinical phenotype of the mitochondrial m.13513G>A mutation with the first report of a fatal neonatal presentation. Diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is often a challenge because of the extreme heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype and the variety of underlying gene defects. Insight into the range of clinical phenotypes associated with a particular mitochondrial DNA mutation will facilitate better recognition of patients at risk by focused gene testing. We present a family affected by the mitochondrial m.13513G>A (p.D393N, ND5) mutation, illustrating a previously unreported degree of clinical heterogeneity, varying from mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in a 10-year-old female, to a fatal neonatal course with metabolic acidosis and hypotonia in a younger sister, to absence of medical problems in the mother. The mutation loads ranging from 66% in the deceased neonate to 30% in the female with MELAS and 7% in the asymptomatic mother, correlated with severity of the clinical phenotype. The importance of proactive collection and storage of appropriate samples during the diagnostic work-up of an acutely ill or deceased neonate, allowing subsequent mitochondrial investigations, is hereby illustrated.
28478596	Deciphering the causes of sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias: a prospective study with implications for diagnostic work. The management of sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias represents a very heterogeneous group of patients and remains a challenge for neurologist in clinical practice. We aimed at describing the different causes of sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias that were diagnosed following standardized, exhaustive investigations and the population characteristics according to the aetiologies as well as at evaluating the relevance of these investigations. All patients consecutively referred to our centre due to sporadic, progressive cerebellar ataxia occurring after 40 years of age were included in the prospective, observational study. 80 patients were included over a 2 year period. A diagnosis was established for 52 patients (65%) corresponding to 18 distinct causes, the most frequent being cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy (n = 29). The second most frequent cause was inherited diseases (including spinocerebellar ataxias, late-onset Friedreich's disease, SLC20A2 mutations, FXTAS, MELAS, and other mitochondrial diseases) (n = 9), followed by immune-mediated or other acquired causes. The group of patient without diagnosis showed a slower worsening of ataxia (p < 0.05) than patients with multiple system atrophy. Patients with later age at onset experienced faster progression of ataxia (p = 0.001) and more frequently parkinsonism (p < 0.05) than patients with earlier onset. Brain MRI, DaT scan, genetic analysis and to some extent muscle biopsy, thoracic-abdominal-pelvic tomodensitometry, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were the most relevant investigations to explore sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxia. Sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias should be exhaustively investigated to identify the underlying causes that are numerous, including inherited causes, but dominated by multiple system atrophy.
15270114	Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in wild dolphins from the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Although Toxoplasma gondii infection has been found occasionally in cetaceans, little is known of the prevalence of antibodies to T. gondii in wild dolphins. Antibodies to T. gondii were determined in serum samples from 58 dolphins stranded in the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Modified agglutination test was used to determine T. gondii antibodies, and a titer of 1:25 was considered indicative of T. gondii infection. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 4 of 36 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), in 2 of 4 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), in 4 of 7 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and in 1 harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Antibodies were not found in 9 Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) and in 1 long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas) surveyed. The results indicate that T. gondii infection is frequent in at least 3 dolphin species from the Mediterranean Sea.

19198147	[L-arginine therapy on MELAS]. MELAS is the most dominant clinical features among mitochondrial disorders. However the natural course of MELAS has not been clarified yet. In order to elucidate the natural course of MELAS, we have done the Japanese Cohort study on MELAS. By the age of onset, we divided MELAS into two subgroups, a juvenile form (onset is less than 18 years of age) and an adult form (onset is more than 18 years of age). Juvenile form is significantly different from adult form not only in the mean age of onset, but the mean age of death and survival rate (juvenile has 3.2 times higher chance of death than adult). Our date indicate that juvenile form of MELAS is more severe and poor prognosis than those seen in adult form. Based on the hypothesis that MELAS is caused by impaired vasodilation in an intracerebral artery, we evaluated the effects of administering L-arginine, a nitric oxide precursor. Patients were administered L-arginine intravenously at acute phase, or per orally at interictal phase. L-arginine infusions significantly improved all stroke-like symptoms suggesting stroke within 30 min, and oral administration significantly decreased frequency and severity of stroke-like episodes. L-arginine therapy showed promise in treating stroke-like episodes in MELAS.
15794176	Episodic hyponatremia in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). Various organ involvements and endocrinologic abnormalities associated with electrolyte imbalance, including hyponatremia, are seen in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS); however, the clinical significance of hyponatremia in these patients is rarely reported. We analyzed the serum sodium concentration profiles and clinical and laboratory data of seven patients with MELAS. We found that hyponatremia occurred episodically in four of the seven patients from an early stage of the disease. We identified excessive sodium loss in urine to be associated with the hyponatremic episodes and the causes of hyponatremia in two patients as relative adrenal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and serious paralytic ileus. However, even extensive examinations failed to reveal the cause in other patients. Because severe hyponatremia can cause serious complications, clinicians should pay attention to serum sodium levels and maintain them properly in patients with MELAS.
30900428	Genetic Data Are a Prerequisite for Interpreting Clinical and Muscle Biopsy Findings in MELAS. 
22283595	Mitochondrial disease and epilepsy. Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders are relatively common inborn errors of energy metabolism, with a combined prevalence of one in 5000. These disorders typically affect tissues with high energy requirements, and cerebral involvement occurs frequently in childhood, often manifesting in seizures. Mitochondrial diseases are genetically heterogeneous; to date, mutations have been reported in all 37 mitochondrially encoded genes and more than 80 nuclear genes. The major genetic causes of mitochondrial epilepsy are mitochondrial DNA mutations (including those typically associated with the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes [MELAS] and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres [MERRF] syndromes); mutations in POLG (classically associated with Alpers syndrome but also presenting as the mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome [MIRAS], spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy [SCAE], and myoclonus, epilepsy, myopathy, sensory ataxia [MEMSA] syndromes in older individuals) and other disorders of mitochondrial DNA maintenance; complex I deficiency; disorders of coenzyme Q(10)  biosynthesis; and disorders of mitochondrial translation such as RARS2 mutations. It is not clear why some genetic defects, but not others, are particularly associated with seizures. Epilepsy may be the presenting feature of mitochondrial disease but is often part of a multisystem clinical presentation. Mitochondrial epilepsy may be very difficult to manage, and is often a poor prognostic feature. At present there are no curative treatments for mitochondrial disease. Individuals with mitochondrial epilepsy are frequently prescribed multiple anticonvulsants, and the role of vitamins and other nutritional supplements and the ketogenic diet remain unproven.
32696575	Optimal Estimate for Energy Requirements in Adult Patients With the m.3243A>G Mutation in Mitochondrial DNA. AIM: We aimed to identify the optimal method to estimate total energy expenditure (TEE) in mitochondrial disease (MD) patients. METHODS: Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured in MD patients carrying the m3243A>G mutation using indirect calorimetry (IC) and compared with results of 21 predictive equations (PEs) for REE and with REE-IC measurements in healthy controls. Physical activity level (PAL) was measured using accelerometery (SenseWear) and compared with a fixed average PAL (1.4) as well as patients' self-estimated activity levels. TEE was calculated as REE-IC x PAL SenseWear and compared with usual care and energy recommendations for healthy adults. RESULTS: Thirty-eight MD patients (age: 48 +- 13 years; body mass index 24 +- 4 kg/m2 ; male 20%) and 25 matched controls were included. The accuracy of most PEs was between 63% and 76%. The difference in REE-IC in healthy controls (1532 +- 182 kcal) and MD patients (1430 +- 221) was borderline not significant (P = .052). Patients' estimations PAL were 18%-34% accurate at the individual level. The fixed activity factor was 53% accurate. Patients overestimated their PAL. Usual care predicted TEE accurately in only 32% of patients. CONCLUSION: TEE is lower in these MD patients than the recommendations for healthy adults because of their lower physical activity. In MD patients, 6 PEs for REE provide a reliable alternative for IC, with an accuracy of 71%-76%. As PAL is highly variable and not reliably estimated by patients, measurement of PAL using accelerometery is recommended in this population.
36813312	Neuroimaging in mitochondrial disease. The anatomic complexity of the brain in combination with its high energy demands makes this organ specifically vulnerable to defects of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, neurodegeneration is a hallmark of mitochondrial diseases. The nervous system of affected individuals typically shows selective regional vulnerability leading to distinct patterns of tissue damage. A classic example is Leigh syndrome, which causes symmetric alterations of basal ganglia and brain stem. Leigh syndrome can be caused by different genetic defects (>75 known disease genes) with variable disease onset ranging from infancy to adulthood. Other mitochondrial diseases are characterized by focal brain lesions, which is a core feature of MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). Apart from gray matter, also white matter can be affected by mitochondrial dysfunction. White matter lesions vary depending on the underlying genetic defect and may progress into cystic cavities. In view of the recognizable patterns of brain damage in mitochondrial diseases, neuroimaging techniques play a key role in diagnostic work-up. In the clinical setting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) are the mainstay of diagnostic work-up. Apart from visualization of brain anatomy, MRS allows the detection of metabolites such as lactate, which is of specific interest in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction. However, it is important to note that findings like symmetric basal ganglia lesions on MRI or a lactate peak on MRS are not specific, and that there is a broad range of disorders that can mimic mitochondrial diseases on neuroimaging. In this chapter, we will review the spectrum of neuroimaging findings in mitochondrial diseases and discuss important differential diagnoses. Moreover, we will give an outlook on novel biomedical imaging tools that may provide interesting insights into mitochondrial disease pathophysiology.
14673554	Comparison of conventional and diffusion-weighted MRI and proton MR spectroscopy in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like events. The mechanism of neurological disturbances in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is controversial. We studied 12 patients with MELAS using conventional and diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS), to look at the physiopathology of the stroke-like events. Although conventional MRI showed lesions in all patients, DWI was more sensitive. One patient did not show high signal on DWI 48 h after a from stroke-like episode, but MRS demonstrated a lactate peak in left occipital lobe; 2 weeks after the attack, high signal was demonstrated on the right frontal lobe where MRS had shown a lactate peak. Our findings suggest a possible predictive ability of (1)H-MRS, in showing early MELAS lesions and supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction may precedes abnormalities on DWI.

34664704	First Case of MELAS Syndrome Presenting with Local Brain Edema Requiring Decompressive Craniectomy. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and recurrent stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a rare but one of the most common maternally inherited multisystem disorder. Although patients with MELAS present a variable clinical profile, strokelike lesions have been detected in 90% of cases, with stroke being the first presenting symptom in 25% of cases. However, cases of local brain edema requiring decompressive craniectomy has not been reported. A 12-year-old male patient was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit with altered mental status, seizures, and vision loss. The patient was stuporous and presented neck stiffness. Complete blood count, serum electrolytes, biochemistry (including lactate level), acute phase reactants, and repeated blood gas analysis were unremarkable. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an edematous stroke-like lesion in the right occipital lobe accompanied by brain swelling. Intravenous ceftriaxone, acyclovir, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and pulse steroid therapy were started for possible diagnosis of viral/bacterial/autoimmune encephalitis; levetiracetam, phenytoin, and an infusion of sodium thiopental were started for refractory status epilepticus; and a 3% NaCl infusion was started for local brain edema. The results of serum autoimmune encephalitis panel were negative. Further investigations for rheumatic, vascular, and metabolic disorders were unremarkable. Despite these supportive treatments, the patient was clinically decompensated due to brain swelling that progressed to the left midline shift, and he underwent decompressive craniectomy. Histologic examination of brain biopsy specimen revealed non-specific encephalitis findings. A pathogenic variant of the MT-TL1 gene (m.3243A > T), responsible for MELAS, was detected. The patient?s condition dramatically improved after specific treatment for MELAS. If the diagnosis and treatment are delayed, MELAS syndrome can cause serious brain edema, which may ultimately require decompressive craniectomy.
15629304	MELAS A3243G mitochondrial DNA mutation and age related maculopathy. PURPOSE: To determine whether mitochondrial DNA mutations play a role in the development of age related maculopathy (ARM). DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: Hair follicles were collected from 3557 persons aged 49 years or older during the Blue Mountains Eye Study. General health measures were assessed and a detailed eye examination was performed, including stereo retinal photography of the macula, and other retinal fields. ARM was graded according to international classification. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed to detect the MELAS A3243G mutation in 570 subjects identified to have signs of Early or Late ARM, as well as in age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: Only one participant with Early ARM, mild hearing loss, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and asthma was found to have the MELAS A3243G mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The MELAS A3243G mutation appears to be a very rare cause of typical ARM in the general population.
31726383	Patients with MELAS with negative myopathology for characteristic ragged-red fibers. BACKGROUND: Muscle pathology usually contributes to mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode (MELAS), even in patients without prominent muscle symptoms. We report a series of patients with MELAS without significant myopathic changes. METHODS: Twelve patients without ragged-red fibers (RRFs) on muscle pathology (RRF-negative group) and 99 patients with MELAS and RRFs and/or cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibers (control RRF-positive group) were recruited. We analyzed clinical features, neuroimaging and pathological findings, gene mutation data, immunofluorescence assay of key respiratory chain subunits of complexes I and IV and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation load in biopsied muscle samples. RESULTS: None of the RRF-negative patients had RRF or COX-negative fibers, but four patients had strongly succinate dehydrogenase-stained vessels (SSVs). There was a lower proportion of m.3243A>G and higher proportion of mitochondria-encoded ND gene mutations in RRF-negative than RRF-positive patients. The proportion of aphasia was relatively higher, while complex I and IV subunit abundance in muscle and mutation load were lower in RRF-negative than in RRF-positive patients. CONCLUSION: RRF-negative patients had a similar disease course, clinical symptoms, and neuroimaging results to RRF-positive patients with MELAS. SSV is a valuable diagnostic indicator for MELAS. For highly suspected MELAS yet without positive myopathological findings, combined immunofluorescence and genetic studies should be used to achieve final diagnosis.
36792807	Clinical score for early diagnosis and treatment of stroke-like episodes in MELAS syndrome. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stroke-like episodes (SLEs) in patients with MELAS syndrome are often initially misdiagnosed as acute ischemic stroke (AIS), resulting in treatment delay. We aimed to determine clinical features that may distinguish SLEs from AISs and explore the benefit of early L-arginine treatment on patient outcomes. METHODS: We looked retrospectively for MELAS patients admitted between January 2005 and January 2022 and compared them to an AIS cohort with similar lesion topography. MELAS patients who received L-arginine within 40 days of their first SLE were defined as the early treatment group and the remaining as late or no treatment group. RESULTS: Twenty-three SLEs in 10 MELAS patients and 21 AISs were included. SLE patients had significantly different features: they were younger, more commonly reported hearing loss, lower body mass index, had more commonly a combination of headache and/or seizures at presentation, serum lactate was higher, and hemiparesis was less common. An SLE Early Clinical Score (SLEECS) was constructed by designating one point to each above features. SLEECS >= 4 had 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for SLE diagnosis. Compared to late or no treatment, early treatment group patients (n = 5) had less recurrent SLEs (total 2 vs. 11), less seizures (14% vs. 25%, p = 0.048), lower degree of disability at first and last follow-up (modified ranking scale, mRS 2 +- 0.7 vs. 4.2 +- 1, p = 0.005; 2 +- 0.7 vs. 5.8 +- 0.5, p < 0.001, respectively), and a lower mortality (0% vs. 80% p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: The SLEECS model may aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of SLEs and lead to improved clinical outcomes.
10451412	Intracellular pH regulation in hepatocytes isolated from three teleost species. The mechanisms of intracellular pH (pH(i)) regulation were studied in hepatocytes isolated from three species of teleost: rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), black bullhead (Ameiurus melas) and American eel (Anguilla rostrata). Intracellular pH was monitored over time using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF in response to acid loading under control conditions and in different experimental media containing either low Na(+) or Cl(-) concentrations, the Na(+)-H(+) exchanger blocker amiloride or the blocker of the V-type H(+)-ATPase, bafilomycin A(1). In trout and bullhead hepatocytes, recovery to an intracellular acid load occurred principally by way of a Na(+)-dependent amiloride-sensitive Na(+)-H(+) exchanger. In eel hepatocytes, the Na(+)-H(+) exchanger did not contribute to recovery to an acid load though evidence suggests that it is present on the cell membrane and participates in the maintenance of steady-state pH(i). The V-type H(+)-ATPase did not participate in recovery to an acid load in any species. A Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchanger may play a role in recovery to an acid load in eel hepatocytes by switching off and retaining base that would normally be tonically extruded. Thus, it is clear that hepatocytes isolated from the three species are capable of regulating pH(i), principally by way of a Na(+)-H(+) exchanger and a Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchanger, but do not exploit identical mechanisms for pH(i) recovery.

32642802	Intracranial calcifications in childhood: Part 2. This article is the second of a two-part series on intracranial calcification in childhood. In Part 1, the authors discussed the main differences between physiological and pathological intracranial calcification. They also outlined histological intracranial calcification characteristics and how these can be detected across different neuroimaging modalities. Part 1 emphasized the importance of age at presentation and intracranial calcification location and proposed a comprehensive neuroimaging approach toward the differential diagnosis of the causes of intracranial calcification. Pathological intracranial calcification can be divided into infectious, congenital, endocrine/metabolic, vascular, and neoplastic. In Part 2, the chief focus is on discussing endocrine/metabolic, vascular, and neoplastic intracranial calcification etiologies of intracranial calcification. Endocrine/metabolic diseases causing intracranial calcification are mainly from parathyroid and thyroid dysfunction and inborn errors of metabolism, such as mitochondrial disorders (MELAS, or mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes; Kearns-Sayre; and Cockayne syndromes), interferonopathies (Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome), and lysosomal disorders (Krabbe disease). Specific noninfectious causes of intracranial calcification that mimic TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other [syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19], rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes) infections are known as pseudo-TORCH. Cavernous malformations, arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, and chronic venous hypertension are also known causes of intracranial calcification. Other vascular-related causes of intracranial calcification include early atherosclerosis presentation (children with risk factors such as hyperhomocysteinemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, and others), healed hematoma, radiotherapy treatment, old infarct, and disorders of the microvasculature such as COL4A1- and COL4A2-related diseases. Intracranial calcification is also seen in several pediatric brain tumors. Clinical and familial information such as age at presentation, maternal exposure to teratogens including viruses, and association with chromosomal abnormalities, pathogenic genes, and postnatal infections facilitates narrowing the differential diagnosis of the multiple causes of intracranial calcification.
17249198	Evaluation of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes with magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of spectra on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and its value in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). METHODS: Seven clinically diagnosed patients with MELAS underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 1H-MRS examinations. The 1H-MRS techniques, characteristics of the spectra, and its correlation with the laboratory tests were analyzed. RESULTS: Cerebral abnormalities were revealed in all 7 patients on conventional MR images, and most abnormal signals were observed in bilateral occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes. We found 4 cases with basal ganglia involvement, 2 cases with mild frontal lobe lesions, and 1 case with involvement of lateral cerebral peduncles and thalami. Additionally, 1 patient was involved with left insular lobe. Spectra from prominent lesions in brain parenchyma showed lactate doublet peak in 6 patients, 3 of whom were also noted lactate peak in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CONCLUSION: 1H-MRS may provide more direct information about the metabolism changes, which aids to affirm the diagnosis, and may replace the conventional invasive method of quantifying lactate in CSF.
17154655	Detection of low levels of the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) 3243A>G mutation in blood derived from patients with diabetes. BACKGROUND: Mutations in the human mitochondrial genome have been suspected to play a significant role in the etiological development of mitochondrial diabetes. Detection of the 3243A>G mutation in the mitochondrial transfer RNALeu(UUR) gene (MTTL1), especially at low heteroplasmy levels, is highly desirable since it facilitates the diagnosis and subsequent management of the disease. The proportions of mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can vary between tissues and are usually significantly higher in muscle than in blood, but muscle biopsies from patients with diabetes are rarely available. METHODS: Here, we describe a technique that can not only determine the presence of MTTL1 3243A>G, but can also estimate the percentage of mutant DNA. The technique is based on the use of the WAVE system for the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mediated analysis of mutation-specific restriction fragments derived from mutant PCR amplicons. PCR amplicon restriction fragment analysis by HPLC (PARFAH) can also be used for the detection of other mutations. RESULTS: This PARFAH analytical approach led to the discovery of the 3243A>G mutation in blood samples from a series of patients who had initially been reported to lack the mutation, even though matrilineal relatives had been shown to harbor the mutation associated with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) or mitochondrial myopathy encephalopathy lactic acidosis stroke-like episodes (MELAS) phenotypes. We have established that the PARFAH method can reliably detect as little as 1% mutant DNA in a sample, which would normally be missed by commonly used gel electrophoresis or sequencing methods. CONCLUSIONS: The PARFAH method not only provides a sensitive, high-throughput, and cost-effective strategy for the detection of low levels of mtDNA mutations in peripheral tissues, but also facilitates the estimation of the percentage of mutant DNA in the sample. The fact that samples can be readily obtained from peripheral tissues in many cases will avoid the need for invasive muscle biopsies. Our ability to detect low levels of mtDNA mutations in blood samples of carriers will allow us to reassess the prevalence of the MTTL1 3243A>G mutation in patients with diabetes.
34257060	Mitochondrial Retinopathy. PURPOSE: To report the retinal phenotype and the associated genetic and systemic findings in patients with mitochondrial disease. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three patients with retinopathy and mitochondrial disease, including chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), Kearns-Sayre syndrome, neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome, and other systemic manifestations. METHODS: Review of case notes, retinal imaging, electrophysiologic assessment, molecular genetic testing including protein modeling, and histologic analysis of muscle biopsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Phenotypic characteristics of mitochondrial retinopathy. RESULTS: Genetic testing identified sporadic large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions and variants in MT-TL1, MT-ATP6, MT-TK, MT-RNR1, or RRM2B. Based on retinal imaging, 3 phenotypes could be differentiated: type 1 with mild, focal pigmentary abnormalities; type 2 characterized by multifocal white-yellowish subretinal deposits and pigment changes limited to the posterior pole; and type 3 with widespread granular pigment alterations. Advanced type 2 and 3 retinopathy presented with chorioretinal atrophy that typically started in the peripapillary and paracentral areas with foveal sparing. Two patients exhibited a different phenotype: 1 revealed an occult retinopathy, and the patient with RRM2B-associated retinopathy showed no foveal sparing, no severe peripapillary involvement, and substantial photoreceptor atrophy before loss of the retinal pigment epithelium. Two patients with type 1 disease showed additional characteristics of mild macular telangiectasia type 2. Patients with type 1 and mild type 2 or 3 disease demonstrated good visual acuity and no symptoms associated with the retinopathy. In contrast, patients with advanced type 2 or 3 disease often reported vision problems in dim light conditions, reduced visual acuity, or both. Short-wavelength autofluorescence usually revealed a distinct pattern, and near-infrared autofluorescence may be severely reduced in type 3 disease. The retinal phenotype was key to suspecting mitochondrial disease in 11 patients, whereas 12 patients were diagnosed before retinal examination. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of mitochondrial retinopathy show characteristic features. Even in absence of visual symptoms, their recognition may facilitate the often challenging and delayed diagnosis of mitochondrial disease, in particular in patients with mild or nebulous multisystem disease.
11352553	Glucose tolerance and peripheral glucose utilization in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and black bullhead catfish (Ameiurus melas). This study tests the hypothesis that glucose tolerance in fish is related to nutrient preference and is correlated with white muscle glucose transporter and phosphorylation (hexokinase) activities. Glucose clearance was investigated in the carnivorous rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and American eel (Anguilla rostrata) (feeding and fasting) and the omnivorous black bullhead catfish (Ameiurus melas). Glucose tolerance was assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test, injecting 250 mg glucose/kg body weight and tracking blood glucose concentrations over 24 h. Both feeding eel and feeding catfish returned plasma glucose levels to baseline within 60 min of glucose injection. Glucose values remained elevated for more than 360 min in both the food-deprived eel and the feeding rainbow trout. Glucose transport studies in white muscle membrane vesicles provided evidence for the presence of a stereospecific, saturable glucose transporter in all three species. Affinity constants (K(m)) ranged from 8 to 14 mM while V(max) values ranged from 75 to 150 pmol/s/mg protein. Neither kinetic parameter differed significantly between species. Cytochalasin B and phloretin did not significantly inhibit glucose transport, implying that these transporters are unlike the mammalian muscle glucose transporters (GLUT). In fact, Northern and Western blot analyses of mRNA and protein from white and red muscles and heart did not detect a mammalian-type GLUT-1 or -4 in any of the species examined. Glucose phosphorylation indicated the presence of a hexokinase activity (low K(m) enzyme) but again there were no differences in kinetic parameters between species. These studies demonstrate that glucose tolerance in fish is species-dependent but none of the parameters examined clearly differentiate between the species examined. Certainly a stereospecific glucose transporter exists in white skeletal muscle of the fish studied but no molecular or kinetic similarities to the mammalian GLUTs were found. Whether these transporters are insulin-sensitive or contribute to glucose tolerance requires further molecular characterization.

14515943	A3243G mitochondrial mutation associated with polymicrogyria. The mitochondrial transfer ribonucleic acid for leucine is encoded by nucleotides 3230-3304. A-to-G transition at nucleotide 3243 can cause maternally transmitted diabetes mellitus-deafness syndrome, and MELAS syndrome. MELAS syndrome is a rare disorder of mitochondrial energy production, and is an acronym for myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Cortical malformations are heterogeneous and result from abnormal cell proliferation/apoptosis, migration, and/or differentiation of neuroepithelial cells. They are an important and relatively common cause of intractable epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. The association between these A3243G mutations and cortical malformation has never before been reported. Here a 14-year-old female with A3243G mutation and polymicrogyria is described and possible aetiologies of this association are discussed.

19860506	Craniofacial morphology in children of mothers with the m.3243A>G mutation in mitochondrial DNA. OBJECTIVE: To describe craniofacial morphology in children from families with the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. DESIGN: Transversal prospective case-control study from a tertiary center. SUBJECTS: Nine children (five girls, four boys; aged 7.5 to 15.3 years) of mothers with m.3243A>G mutation in mitochondrial DNA and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy children as controls. METHODS: Seventy-three cephalometric variables representing craniofacial and dental features were analyzed in lateral radiographs. The statistical dependence caused by intrafamilial correlation was taken into account by using a two-level analysis of variance model that was fitted to the data using SAS procedure MIXED. RESULTS: The frontal bone was thicker and the frontal sinus, mandibular symphysis width, and lower posterior face height were larger in the subjects than in the controls. Upper incisors were more labially inclined, and the interincisal angle was smaller in subjects than in the control children. CONCLUSIONS: Differences were found in craniofacial structures between the children of mothers with m.3243A>G and unaffected children. Differences in the upper incisor inclination, mandibular symphysis width, and lower posterior face height suggest an altered mandibular growth pattern in the subjects. In addition, the children had cranial aberrations such as larger frontal sinuses and the thicker frontal bone.
25420561	[Effectiveness of midazolam for L-arginine-resistant headaches during stroke-like episodes in MELAS: a case report]. A 14-year-old girl was referred to us with severe migraine-like headaches associated with vomiting and right homonymous hemianopsia. On admission, MRI examination showed high signals in the left occipital cortex and subcortex on T2-weighted images, without reduction of apparent diffusion coefficient suggestive of cerebral infarction. Her EEG demonstrated periodic sharp waves in the left posterior region, and laboratory tests revealed she had increased levels of lactic and pyruvic acid both in blood plasma and CSF. Gene analysis confirmed mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. Based on this data, we diagnosed her as having mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and a stroke-like episode (MELAS). L-arginine infusion was unsuccessful for her severe headaches, which remained prolonged. She received a low dose (0.05 mg/kg/h) midazolam infusion, resulting in immediate improvement and the disappearance of headaches and abnormal EEG findings. By the age of 18, she had been readmitted eight times for stroke-like episodes accompanied by headaches. While L-arginine infusions alleviated her headaches when administered on day 1 of her episodes, they were not effective when started on or after day 2. Her L-arginine-resistant headaches were relieved by midazolam. Although the pathogenesis of headaches in MELAS is still unknown, neuronal hyperexcitability and trigeminovascular activation are considered important. Midazolam may play a role in suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability and trigeminovascular activation. Treatment with midazolam is advisable for headaches in patients with MELAS, in the event that L-arginine therapy is unsuccessful. 
20385529	Ophthalmological findings in children and young adults with genetically verified mitochondrial disease. AIM: To describe ophthalmological phenotypes in patients with mitochondrial disease and known genotypes. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 59 patients (29 male, 30 female) with a mean age of 11.8 years who had mitochondrial disease with known DNA mutations. Fifty-seven of the 59 subjects underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination including visual acuity (VA), eye motility, refraction, slit-lamp examination, ophthalmoscopy and, in almost one-half of the cases, a full-field electroretinogram (ERG). RESULTS: Forty-six (81%) of the patients had one or more ophthalmological findings such as ptosis (n = 16), reduced eye motility (n = 22) including severe external ophthalmoplegia (n = 9), strabismus (n = 4), nystagmus (n = 9), low VA (n = 21), refractive errors (n = 26), photophobia (n = 4), and partial or total optic atrophy (n = 25). Pigmentation in the macula and/or periphery was noted in 16 patients. In 10/27 investigated individuals with full field ERG, retinal dystrophy was recorded in six different genotypes representing Kearns-Sayre syndrome (n = 5), Leigh syndrome (n = 1), Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (n = 1), Myoclonus epilepsy with red ragged fibres (MERRF) (n = 1), Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (n = 1) and mitochondrial myopathy (n = 1). CONCLUSION: The results show that a majority of patients with mitochondrial disorders have ophthalmological abnormalities. We recommend that an ophthalmological examination, including ERG, be performed on all children and adolescents who are suspected of having a mitochondrial disease.
16230801	Precipitation of stroke-like event by chickenpox in a child with MELAS syndrome. The mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) is a rare congenital disorder of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Herein we report a case of MELAS, whose second stroke-like episode was provoked by chickenpox. A point mutation at nucleotide (nt) 3243 in mtDNA supported the diagnosis of MELAS in this case. History of myopathy, the presence of lesions that did not conform to accepted distributions of vascular territories on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), normal result of cranial magnetic resonance angiography, hyperintensity on diffusion weighted MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping indicating the presence of vasogenic edema in the fresh stroke-like lesion, and mitochondrial DNA analysis helped to exclude the diagnosis of ischemic cerebral infarction which can also be induced by chickenpox.
27344355	Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders in the Old Order Amish population. The Old Order Amish populations in the US are one of the Plain People groups and are descendants of the Swiss Anabaptist immigrants who came to North America in the early eighteenth century. They live in numerous small endogamous demes that have resulted in reduced genetic diversity along with a high prevalence of specific genetic disorders, many of them autosomal recessive. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies arising from mitochondrial or nuclear DNA mutations have not previously been reported in the Plain populations. Here we present four different Amish families with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders. Mutations in two mitochondrial encoded genes leading to mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder were identified in two patients. In the first case, MELAS syndrome caused by a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation (m.3243A>G) was identified in an extended Amish pedigree following a presentation of metabolic strokes in the proband. Characterization of the extended family of the proband by a high resolution melting assay identified the same mutation in many previously undiagnosed family members with a wide range of clinical symptoms. A MELAS/Leigh syndrome phenotype caused by a mtDNA mutation [m.13513G>A; p.Asp393Asn] in the ND5 gene encoding the ND5 subunit of respiratory chain complex I was identified in a patient in a second family. Mutations in two nuclear encoded genes leading to mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder were also identified in two patients. One patient presented with Leigh syndrome and had a homozygous deletion in the NDUFAF2 gene, while the second patient had a homozygous mutation in the POLG gene, [c.1399G>A; p.Ala467Thr]. Our findings identify mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency as a cause of disease in the Old Order Amish that must be considered in the context of otherwise unexplained systemic disease, especially if neuromuscular symptoms are present.

22469682	Low-frequency photoparoxysmal response in adults:  an early clue to diagnosis. Intermittent photic stimulation is performed during an EEG to evoke photoparoxysmal response. When they appear triggered by low-frequency stimulation in children, they are suggestive of rare diagnosis, that is, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Among adults, their significance is less well understood. Low-frequency (<5 Hz) intermittent photic stimulation was performed over a period of 5 years during adult standard EEG. This retrospective study included all patients exhibiting low-frequency photoparoxysmal response. Five cases were identified. Three of them presented with active epilepsy (two progressive myoclonus epilepsy, one unclassifiable), two had visual deficiency, and three had dementia. The etiologies were MELAS (two), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (one), Kufs disease (one), and remained undetermined for one patient. In all patients, low-frequency photoparoxysmal response was observed years or months before the final diagnoses have been reached. Low-frequency photoparoxysmal response, classically associated with childhood progressive myoclonus epilepsy, seems to have a wider etiological spectrum in adult population. Moreover, this neurophysiological feature could be present before the final diagnosis in most cases. Systematically testing low frequencies during intermittent photic stimulation even during adult EEG seems warranted, particularly in a context of severe progressive neurologic deterioration.
30568433	Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes in an older adult mimicking cerebral infarction: a Chinese case report. Few cases of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with an onset older than 60 years have been reported. Herein, we report a 63-year-old Chinese female initially suspected of ischemic infarction but was ultimately diagnosed with MELAS. Therefore, even in the elderly, a diagnosis of MELAS should be considered when encountering patients with recurrent stroke-like episodes, cognitive dysfunction, and psychotic symptoms. In order to achieve the correct diagnosis and launch the appropriate management in time, a detailed medical history together with appropriate diagnostic laboratory investigations should therefore be collected.
19198146	[Pathogenesis and treatment of stroke-like episodes in MELAS]. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a distinct clinical syndrome caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Crucial molecular mechanism includes a lack of taurine modification at the wobble uridine of the mutant tRNA(Leu(UUR)), causing UUG condon-specific translational defect and mitochondrial protein synthesis failure. However, the pathogenesis of stroke-like episodes remains unknown. We previously reported that stroke-like episodes were more likely non-ischemic events, characterized by increased capillary permeability, hyperperfusion, neuronal vulnerability and neuronal hyperexcitability, in which neuronal hyperexcitability plays an important role in initiation of the cascades of stroke-like events by increasing energy demand. We also emphasized a role of prolonged epileptic activities in progressive spread of stroke-like lesions, and then proposed a non-ischemic neurovascular cellular mechanism. Once neuronal hyperexcitability developed in a localized region as a result from either mitochondrial dysfunction in capillary endothelial cells, or in neurons or astrocytes, epileptic activities depolarize adjacent neurons, leading to propagation of epileptic activities in surrounding cortex. Increased capillary permeability in the presence of mitochondrial capillary angiopathy may cause unique edematous lesions predominantly involving the cortex. As a consequence, most susceptible layers of the cortex may result in neuronal loss. Therapeutic targets include each ongoing process of the disease.

22406788	A study of familial MELAS: evaluation of A3243G mutation, clinical phenotype, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy-monitored progression. The clinical manifestations of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS syndrome) are nonspecific and can easily be misdiagnosed. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-based detection of lactate in the brain has been found to be of diagnostic help in MELAS syndrome, however, the issue of whether MRS features vary by stage remains unresolved. We assessed the causative mutation and radiological features of a family of MELAS. Four of the family members harbored the A3243G mutation, probably of maternal inheritance. However, the clinical phenotypic expression was different in these patients. MRS showed a lactate peak, decreased N-acetylaspartate, choline, and creatine, which became more pronounced with progression of the disease, demonstrating that brain-MRS-based detection of lactate may be a suitable way to monitor the progression and treatment of MELAS.
20609541	Neuroimaging of stroke-like episodes in MELAS. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) shows sudden neurological deficits that are called 'stroke-like episodes'. With regard to the pathophysiology of stroke-like episodes, so-called mitochondrial angiopathy and cytopathy theories have been proposed, but the subject is still controversial. To clarify this matter and to contribute to the development of a treatment for MELAS, we review here current neuroimaging research and consider the pathophysiology of stroke-like lesions. With regard to diffusion-weighted imaging findings, early reports often showed an elevated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in stroke-like lesions; this was considered to be mainly vasogenic edema in the acute phase and is a different pattern than that in stroke. However, there has recently been an increase in the number of reports of a decrease in ADC; these cases are considered to be cytotoxic edema in the acute phase, which is compatible with stroke. With regard to (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings in stroke-like lesions, a decrease in N-acetylaspartate and an increase in lactate have been reported. With regard to single photon emission computed tomography findings for stroke-like lesions in MELAS, an overall trend is hyperperfusion in the acute stage (within 1 month) of stroke-like episodes and hypoperfusion in the chronic stage (several months later). With regard to positron emission tomography, nearly all of these reports are consistent with the mitochondrial cytopathy theory. With regard to neuropathology in MELAS, the most common findings during the chronic stage of stroke-like episodes include foci of necrosis and peculiar vascular changes (abnormalities of mitochondria in small arteries). Concerning the pathology of the acute stage of stroke-like episodes, extensive petechial hemorrhage along the gyri of the cortex corresponding to acute stroke-like lesions has been reported. To clarify the true pathophysiology of stroke-like episodes, we offer three suggestions. First, we must define the precise onset of stroke-like episodes. Second, current studies are limited by the difficulty of imaging just before and just after (within a few minutes) the onset of stroke-like episodes. Third, we hope to establish an experimental animal model. We should conduct a simultaneous multimodal imaging and histological study just before and just after (within a few minutes) the onset of stroke-like episodes in an experimental animal model.
27585714	Severe biventricular hypertrophy in MELAS mitochondrial disease. 
33220496	Optical coherence tomography as a possible tool to monitor and predict disease progression in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to obtain three-dimensional information on the retina. In this article, we evaluated the structural neuro-retinal abnormalities, especially the thickness in the ganglion cell complex (GCC), in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The GCC thickness in MELAS patients was significantly thinner than that in normal controls even when they had no history of transient homonymous hemianopia. There was a negative correlation between GCC thickness and disease duration. In conclusion, OCT may be an effective tool to monitor and predict disease progression in MELAS patients.
22832341	MELAS-like encephalomyopathy caused by a new pathogenic mutation in the mitochondrial DNA encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. We report a 35-year-old woman presenting a stroke-like episode with transitory aphasia followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She had severe hearing loss and suffered from frequent episodes of migraine. Although a brain MRI disclosed a T2-hyperintense lesion in the left parietal lobe, she had hardly any long-term sequela. Exercise intolerance, myalgias and limb-girdle muscle weakness indicated a slowly progressive myopathy. Extra-neurological features included short stature, and secondary amenorrhea with low gonadotropin levels, indicating secondary hypogonadism. However, she had three mutation-free, healthy children by ovarian stimulation. A muscle biopsy showed ragged-red, cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers, and an isolated defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity in muscle mitochondria. Sequence analysis of muscle mtDNA revealed a previously unreported heteroplasmic m.6597C>A transversion in the MTCOI gene, encoding subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase, corresponding to p.Q232K aminoacid change. Analysis on transmitochondrial cybrids demonstrated that the mutation is indeed associated with COX deficiency, i.e. pathogenic.
19617458	Mutations in ND subunits of complex I are an important genetic cause of childhood mitochondrial encephalopathies. An increasing number of reports on mitochondrial DNA coding regions' mutations, especially in mitochondrial DNA- encoded NADH dehydrogenase (ND) subunit genes of the respiratory chain complex I, have been published recently, making it possible to improve the molecular diagnosis of many mitochondrial diseases in children with variable clinical features. This article describes 2 mitochondrial DNA mutations in the ND3 and ND5 genes in patients showing clinical features of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)/Leigh syndrome overlap syndrome and atypical Leigh syndrome. These cases add to the increasing number of reports stating that mitochondrial DNA-encoded protein-coding regions are mutation hot spots in pediatric patients with encephalopathies with variable clinical spectra.

19253345	Longitudinal changes of mtDNA A3243G mutation load and level of functioning in MELAS. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), one of the most common mitochondrial multisystemic diseases, is most commonly associated with an A-to-G transition at nucleotide position 3243 (A3243G) in mitochondrial DNA. We studied 34 individuals harboring the A3243G mutation for up to 7 years; 17 had the full MELAS phenotype and 17 who were classified as "carrier relatives" because they were either asymptomatic or had some symptoms suggestive of mitochondrial disease but no seizures or strokes. Using the sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction to quantify the A3243G mutation, we confirmed that the percent mutation decreases progressively in DNA isolated from blood: the average percent decrease was 0.5% per year for fully symptomatic patients and 0.2% per year for oligosymptomatic carrier relatives. We also correlated mutant loads with functional status estimated by the Karnofksky score: even though the mutation load decreases, the level of functioning worsens in fully symptomatic patients, whereas the level of functioning of carrier relatives remains largely unchanged. This study suggests that A3243G mutant load in DNA isolated from blood is neither useful for prognosis nor for functional assessment.
30972844	Autopsied case with MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome accompanied by stroke-like episodes localized to the precentral gyrus. We present an autopsied case with A8344G-mutated myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF)/mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) overlap syndrome accompanied by stroke-like episodes localized to the precentral gyrus. A 16-year-old Japanese woman suddenly experienced repetitive consciousness disturbances with increased serum lactate and creatine kinase levels. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal intensity of bilateral precentral gyrus. She was clinically diagnosed as having a mitochondrial disorder and the A8344G mutation was detected in mitochondrial DNA. At 17 years of age, she died from congestive heart failure secondary to a third episode of lactic acidosis. Neuropatho-logically, multifocal laminar necrosis, which is responsible for stroke-like episodes in MELAS, was seen in the frontal cortex including the precentral gyrus, but there was no neuronal loss and gliosis in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem, which were compatible with MERRF. Hypertrophy of the vascular smooth muscle and choroidal epithelium were seen, and were strongly visualized by an anti-mitochondrial antibody. Skeletal muscles showed uneven muscular diameters, increased central nuclei, and ragged red fibers (RRFs). Decreased cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and strongly succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-reactive blood vessels were also noted. Stroke-like episodes in MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome are thought to be rare in the frontal cortex including the precentral gyrus. Only two cases of MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome with A8344G mutation, including this case, have shown stroke-like episodes in the frontal lobes. Other than the A8344G mutation and frontal lobe involvement, they had a high degree of similarity in terms of presence of RRFs, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and lack of typical MERRF neuropathology. In conclusion, this is an important case describing the clinical spectrum associated with A8344G-mutated MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome.
30717788	Potential factors influencing lymphatic filariasis transmission in "hotspot" and "control" areas in Ghana: the importance of vectors. BACKGROUND: Mass drug administration (MDA) programmes for the control of lymphatic filariasis in Ghana, have been ongoing in some endemic districts for 16 years. The current study aimed to assess factors that govern the success of MDA programmes for breaking transmission of lymphatic filariasis in Ghana. METHODS: The study was undertaken in two "hotspot" districts (Ahanta West and Kassena Nankana West) and two control districts (Mpohor and Bongo) in Ghana. Mosquitoes were collected and identified using morphological and molecular tools. A proportion of the cibarial armatures of each species was examined. Dissections were performed on Anopheles gambiae for filarial worm detection. A questionnaire was administered to obtain information on MDA compliance and vector control activities. Data were compared between districts to determine factors that might explain persistent transmission of lymphatic filariasis. RESULTS: High numbers of mosquitoes were sampled in Ahanta West district compared to Mpohor district (F = 16.09, P = 0.002). There was no significant difference between the numbers of mosquitoes collected in Kassena Nankana West and Bongo districts (F = 2.16, P = 0.185). Mansonia species were predominant in Ahanta West district. An. coluzzii mosquitoes were prevalent in all districts. An. melas with infected and infective filarial worms was found only in Ahanta West district. No differences were found in cibarial teeth numbers and shape for mosquito species in the surveyed districts. Reported MDA coverage was high in all districts. The average use of bednet and indoor residual spraying was 82.4 and 66.2%, respectively. There was high compliance in the five preceding MDA rounds in Ahanta West and Kassena Nankana West districts, both considered hotspots of lymphatic filariasis transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The study on persistent transmission of lymphatic filariasis in the two areas in Ghana present information that shows the importance of local understanding of factors affecting control and elimination of lymphatic filariasis. Unlike Kassena Nankana West district where transmission dynamics could be explained by initial infection prevalence and low vector densities, ongoing lymphatic filariasis transmission in Ahanta West district might be explained by high biting rates of An. gambiae and initial infection prevalence, coupled with high densities of An. melas and Mansonia vector species that have low or no teeth and exhibiting limitation.
11071437	Serial diffusion-weighted imaging in MELAS. Clinical features of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) resemble those of cerebral infarcts, but the pathogenesis of infarct-like lesions is not fully understood. To characterise these infarct-like lesions, we studied two patients with MELAS using diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI before and after stroke-like episodes and measured the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the new infarct-like lesions. These gave high signal on DWI and had much higher ADC than normal-appearing regions. The ADC remained high even 30 days after a stroke-like episode then decreased in lesions, with or without abnormality as shown by conventional MRI. We speculate that early elevation of ADC in the acute or subacute phase reflects vasogenic rather than cytotoxic edema. The ADC of the lesions, which disappeared almost completely with clinical improvement, returned to normal levels, which may reflect tissue recovery without severe damage. To our knowledge, this is the first study of DWI in MELAS.
30837005	Chorea-ballism as a dominant clinical manifestation in heteroplasmic mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome with A3251G mutation in mitochondrial genome: a case report. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, the most common maternally inherited mitochondrial disease, can present with a wide range of neurological manifestations including both central and peripheral nervous system involvement. The most frequent genetic mutation reported in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome is A3243G in MT-TL1 gene. Stroke-like episodes, dementia, epilepsy, lactic acidemia, myopathy, recurrent headaches, hearing impairment, diabetes, and short stature constitute the known presentations in this syndrome. Among the abnormal involuntary movements in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome, myoclonus is the commonest. Other movement disorders, including chorea, are rarely reported in this disorder. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old South Asian boy from rural Bengal (India), born of a second degree consanguineous marriage, with normal birth and development history, presented with abnormal brief jerky movements involving his trunk and limbs, with recurrent falls for 10 months. We present here a case of heteroplasmic mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome with A3251G mutation, in which the clinical picture was dominated by a host of involuntary abnormal movements including chorea-ballism, myoclonus, and oromandibular dystonia in a backdrop of cognitive decline, seizure, and stroke-like episode. A final diagnosis was established by muscle biopsy and genetic study. Haloperidol was administered to control the involuntary movements along with introduction of co-enzyme Q, besides symptomatic management for his focal seizures. Six months into follow-up his seizures and abnormal movements were controlled significantly with slight improvement of cognitive abilities. CONCLUSION: The dominance of hyperkinetic movements in the clinical scenario and the finding of a point mutation A3251G in MT-TL1 gene make this a rare presentation.
16456160	Spondylitic changes in long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) stranded on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, between 1982 and 2000. The primary bone pathology diagnoses recognized in cetacea are osteomyelitis and spondylosis deformans. In this study, we determined the prevalence, type, and severity of vertebral pathology in 52 pilot whales, a mass stranding species that stranded on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, between 1982 and 2000. Eleven whales (21%) had hyperostosis and ossification of tendon insertion points on and between vertebrae, chevron bones, and costovertebral joints, with multiple fused blocks of vertebrae. These lesions are typical of a group of interrelated diseases described in humans as spondyloarthropathies, specifically ankylosing spondylitis, which has not been fully described in cetacea. In severe cases, ankylosing spondylitis in humans can inhibit mobility. If the lesions described here negatively affect the overall health of the whale, these lesions may be a contributing factor in stranding of this highly sociable species.

The rheological properties of the stratum corneum of the pilot whale (Globicephala melas) were investigated with emphasis on their significance to the self-cleaning abilities of the skin surface smoothed by a jelly material enriched with various hydrolytic enzymes. The gel formation of the collected fluid was monitored by applying periodic-harmonic oscillating loads using a stress-controlled rheometer. In the mechanical spectrum of the gel, the plateau region of the storage modulus G' (<1200 Pa) and the loss modulus G" (>120 Pa) were independent of frequency (omega = 43.98 to 0.13 rad x s(-1), tau = 15 Pa, T = 20 degrees C), indicating high elastic performance of a covalently cross-linked viscoelastic solid. In addition, multi-angle laser light scattering experiments (MALLS) were performed to analyse the potential time-dependent changes in the weight-average molar mass of the samples. The observed increase showed that the gel formation is based on the assembly of covalently cross-linked aggregates. The viscoelastic properties and the shear resistance of the gel assure that the enzyme-containing jelly material smoothing the skin surface is not removed from the stratum corneum by shear regimes during dolphin jumping. The even skin surface is considered to be most important for the self-cleaning abilities of the dolphin skin against biofouling.

22325939	Restoration of impaired nitric oxide production in MELAS syndrome with citrulline and arginine supplementation. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is one of the most common mitochondrial disorders. Although the pathogenesis of stroke-like episodes remains unclear, it has been suggested that mitochondrial proliferation may result in endothelial dysfunction and decreased nitric oxide (NO) availability leading to cerebral ischemic events. This study aimed to assess NO production in subjects with MELAS syndrome and the effect of the NO precursors arginine and citrulline. Using stable isotope infusion techniques, we assessed arginine, citrulline, and NO metabolism in control subjects and subjects with MELAS syndrome before and after arginine or citrulline supplementation. The results showed that subjects with MELAS had lower NO synthesis rate associated with reduced citrulline flux, de novo arginine synthesis rate, and plasma arginine and citrulline concentrations, and higher plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentration and arginine clearance. We conclude that the observed impaired NO production is due to multiple factors including elevated ADMA, higher arginine clearance, and, most importantly, decreased de novo arginine synthesis secondary to decreased citrulline availability. Arginine and, to a greater extent, citrulline supplementation increased the de novo arginine synthesis rate, the plasma concentrations and flux of arginine and citrulline, and NO production. De novo arginine synthesis increased markedly with citrulline supplementation, explaining the superior efficacy of citrulline in increasing NO production. The improvement in NO production with arginine or citrulline supplementation supports their use in MELAS and suggests that citrulline may have a better therapeutic effect than arginine. These findings can have a broader relevance for other disorders marked by perturbations in NO metabolism.
21187165	Fibroblast immuno-diagnosis of cytochrome oxidase (COX) deficiency in mitochondrial disease. We studied cytochrome c oxidase (COX) expression patterns in nuclear and mtDNA gene defects. Using quantitative immunocytochemical assay for COX, heteroplasmic staining was seen in MELAS patients with mtDNA mutations but similar staining variability was seen in control cell lines and nuclear gene defects. All fibroblast lines showed a wide variability in cell-to-cell COX I staining intensity. All 8 patient fibroblast lines had reduced COX staining on immunocytochemistry. In 6 lines reduced protein amount was seen on Western blotting and 7 had low COX activity. This study demonstrates that nuclear gene defects can produce a heteroplasmic appearance on immunocytochemistry.
18314141	A novel tRNA(Val) mitochondrial DNA mutation causing MELAS. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is the most common mitochondrial disease due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. At least 15 distinct mtDNA mutations have been associated with MELAS, and about 80% of the cases are caused by the A3243G tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene mutation. We report here a novel tRNA(Val) mutation in a 37-year-old woman with manifestations of MELAS, and compare her clinicopathological phenotype with other rare cases associated tRNA(Val) mutations.
27245348	Clinical Pregenetic Screening for Stroke Monogenic Diseases: Results From Lombardia GENS Registry. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lombardia GENS is a multicentre prospective study aimed at diagnosing 5 single-gene disorders associated with stroke (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, Fabry disease, MELAS [mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes], hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and Marfan syndrome) by applying diagnostic algorithms specific for each clinically suspected disease METHODS: We enrolled a consecutive series of patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack admitted in stroke units in the Lombardia region participating in the project. Patients were defined as probable when presenting with stroke or transient ischemic attack of unknown etiopathogenic causes, or in the presence of <3 conventional vascular risk factors or young age at onset, or positive familial history or of specific clinical features. Patients fulfilling diagnostic algorithms specific for each monogenic disease (suspected) were referred for genetic analysis. RESULTS: In 209 patients (57.4+-14.7 years), the application of the disease-specific algorithm identified 227 patients with possible monogenic disease. Genetic testing identified pathogenic mutations in 7% of these cases. Familial history of stroke was the only significant specific feature that distinguished mutated patients from nonmutated ones. The presence of cerebrovascular risk factors did not exclude a genetic disease. CONCLUSIONS: In patients prescreened using a clinical algorithm for monogenic disorders, we identified monogenic causes of events in 7% of patients in comparison to the 1% to 5% prevalence reported in previous series.
15965044	Brain single photon emission computed tomography in patients with A3243G mutation in mitochondrial DNA tRNA. Brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies were conducted in three patients with A3243G mutation of the mitochondrial (mt) DNA tRNA. All were born to mothers suffering from chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) with the same A3243G point mutation of the mtDNA tRNA. The first case manifested clinically with MELAS, the second case manifested with CPEO, and third case was characterized by recurrent migraine-like headache, tremor, and epilepsy. Brain SPECT of all patients, regardless of whether they had or had not suffered from stroke-like episodes, showed multiple areas of asymmetrical decreased perfusion, particularly in the posterior and lateral head regions, especially the temporal lobes. Crossed-cerebellar diaschisis may occur. Conventional brain magnetic resonance images failed to show some of the lesions. Decreased regional cerebral blood flow, rather than previously proposed hyperemia, is likely to be the cause. We conclude that mitochondrial vasculopathy with regional cerebral hypoperfusion may be seen on brain SPECT in patients with mitochondrial disorders and A3243G mutations, regardless of whether they have or have not suffered from stroke-like episodes.
11765577	[Clinical case of the month. MELAS syndrome]. A patient, born in 1961, was first examined for autoimmune hyperthyroid at the age of 25. Then, several episodes of serious dehydration and alteration of general condition were followed by a severe encephalopathy with a symptomatology of stroke-like episodes, and during a hospitalization, a volvulus of the colon. Epilepsy developed also. A MELAS syndrome was diagnosed when she was 32 years old, based on her clinical metabolic history of the presence of Ragged-Red-Fibers at muscular biopsy and of the genetical analysis. At the age of 37, after a new episode of encephalopathy, the patient fell into a rapidly evolving coma and deces.
36892301	Characteristics of stroke-like lesions on cerebral imaging. <p><strong>Objective</strong> &ndash; Stroke-like lesions (SLLs) are pathognomonic for mitochondrial ence&shy;pha&shy;lopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome but occur in other mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial disorders as well. This mini-review aims at summarising and discussing recent findings to open up future perspectives how to manage this fleeting phenomenon.<br><strong>Results </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Typically, SLLs are dynamic lesions, which increase in size and intensity to regress after a nadir. SLLs are incongruent with a vascular territory, originate frequently from the cortex to spread subcortically, can be monofocal or multifocal, run through an acute (attack) and chronic (remission) stage, and may either completely disappear or end up as laminar cortical necrosis, white matter lesion, subcortical atrophy, cyst, or the toenail sign. On cerebral CT, SLLs are hypodense. SLLs can be best visualized on multimodal MRI showing up as hyperintensity on T2, FLAIR, DWI, and PWI, and as hypointensity on OEF-MRI. On MR-spectroscopy, SLLs typically present with a decreased N-acetyl-aspartate peak and an increased lactate peak. DTI in acute SLLs reveals reduced connectivity, increased global efficiency, and reduced focal efficiency. Tc-HMPAO SPECT of SLLs indicates hyperperfusion and L-iomazenil SPECT reduced tracer uptake. FDG-PET typically shows hypometabolism within a SLL.<br><strong>Conclusion</strong> &ndash; SLLs present with typical findings on various imaging modalities but the combination of cerebral CT, multimodal MRI, MRS, and PET clearly delineate a SLL from other acute or chronic cerebral lesions.&nbsp;</p>.
31648942	Resolving complexity in mitochondrial disease: Towards precision medicine. Mitochondrial diseases, caused by mutations in either the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA), are the most common form of inherited neurometabolic disorders. They are remarkably heterogeneous, both in their clinical presentation and genetic etiology, presenting challenges for diagnosis, clinical management and elucidation of molecular mechanism. The multifaceted nature of these diseases, compounded by the unique characteristics of mitochondrial genetics, cement their space in the field of complex disease. In this review we examine the m.3243A>G variant, one of the most prevalent mitochondrial DNA mutations, using it as an exemplar to demonstrate the challenges presented by these complex disorders. Disease caused by m.3243A>G is one of the most phenotypically diverse of all mitochondrial diseases; we outline known causes of this heterogeneity including mtDNA heteroplasmy, mtDNA copy number and nuclear genetic factors. We consider the impact that this has in the clinic, discussing the personalized management of common manifestations attributed to this pathogenic mtDNA variant, including hearing impairment, diabetes mellitus, myopathy, cardiac disease, stroke-like episodes and gastrointestinal disturbances. Future research into this complex disorder must account for this heterogeneity, benefitting from the use of large patient cohorts to build upon current clinical expertise. Through multi-disciplinary collaboration, the complexities of this mitochondrial disease can be addressed with the variety of diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment approaches that are moulded to best fit the needs of each individual patient.

12624137	The mitochondrial DNA G13513A MELAS mutation in the NADH dehydrogenase 5 gene is a frequent cause of Leigh-like syndrome with isolated complex I deficiency. Leigh syndrome is a subacute necrotising encephalomyopathy frequently ascribed to mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency. This condition is genetically heterogeneous, as mutations in both mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear genes have been reported. Here, we report the G13513A transition in the ND5 mtDNA gene in three unrelated children with complex I deficiency and a peculiar MRI aspect distinct from typical Leigh syndrome. Brain MRI consistently showed a specific involvement of the substantia nigra and medulla oblongata sparing the basal ganglia. Variable degrees of heteroplasmy were found in all tissues tested and a high percentage of mutant mtDNA was observed in muscle. The asymptomatic mothers presented low levels of mutant mtDNA in blood leucocytes. This mutation, which affects an evolutionary conserved amino acid (D393N), has been previously reported in adult patients with MELAS or LHON/MELAS syndromes, emphasising the clinical heterogeneity of mitochondrial DNA mutations. Since the G13513A mutation was found in 21% of our patients with Leigh syndrome and complex I deficiency (3/14), it appears that this mutation represents a frequent cause of Leigh-like syndrome, which should be systematically tested for molecular diagnosis in affected children and for genetic counselling in their maternal relatives.
31347509	Audiological and Vestibular Findings in Subjects with MELAS Syndrome. OBJECTIVES: The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutation m.3243A>G is known to express the following two syndromes among others: maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) and mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most frequent symptom in individuals harboring the m.3243A>G mutation. However, dysfunction of the vestibular organs has been scarcely examined. Therefore, the present study aimed to study the impact of the m.3243A>G mutation on the inner ear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 8 subjects harboring the blood-verified m.3243A>G mutation underwent thorough audiological and vestibular examinations, including tone and speech audiometry, video head impulse test (vHIT), ocular and cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP and cVEMP), and full otoneurological examination. The subjects also answered a Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) questionnaire. RESULTS: SNHL was identified in all the 8 subjects, with a mean pure-tone average-4 (PTA-4) of 59 dB. Speech discrimination score (n=7) ranged from 24% to 100% (mean 74%), and vHIT (n=42) detected pathology in nine lateral semicircular canals (SCCs), five posterior SCCs, and one anterior SCC, whereas three measurements were inconclusive. All oVEMPs (n=14 ears) were absent, nine cVEMPs were absent, and two were inconclusive. Based on the DHI scores, 6 subjects reported none to mild dizziness, 1 reported moderate, and 1 reported severe dizziness. CONCLUSION: Our study population had pathological findings from every audiological and vestibular end organs. The results indicated that the pathological findings originated from within the end organs themselves and not within the superior and inferior vestibular or cochlear nerve.

22173633	An impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain increases retention of the hypoxia imaging agent diacetylbis(4-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copperII. Radiolabeled diacetylbis(4-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) [Cu(II)(atsm)] is an effective positron-emission tomography imaging agent for myocardial ischemia, hypoxic tumors, and brain disorders with regionalized oxidative stress, such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, and lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and Parkinson's disease. An excessively elevated reductive state is common to these conditions and has been proposed as an important mechanism affecting cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). However, data from whole-cell models to demonstrate this mechanism have not yet been provided. The present study used a unique cell culture model, mitochondrial xenocybrids, to provide whole-cell mechanistic data on cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). Genetic incompatibility between nuclear and mitochondrial encoded subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in xenocybrid cells compromises normal function of the ETC. As a consequence of this impairment to the ETC we show xenocybrid cells upregulate glycolytic ATP production and accumulate NADH. Compared to control cells the xenocybrid cells retained more Cu after being treated with Cu(II)(atsm). By transfecting the cells with a metal-responsive element reporter construct the increase in Cu retention was shown to involve a Cu(II)(atsm)-induced increase in intracellular bioavailable Cu specifically within the xenocybrid cells. Parallel experiments using cells grown under hypoxic conditions confirmed that a compromised ETC and elevated NADH levels contribute to increased cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). Using these cell culture models our data demonstrate that compromised ETC function, due to the absence of O(2) as the terminal electron acceptor or dysfunction of individual components of the ETC, is an important determinant in driving the intracellular dissociation of Cu(II)(atsm) that increases cellular retention of the Cu.
9875091	A follow up study of myocardial involvement in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). OBJECTIVE: To investigate cardiac function in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and clarify the clinical features of cardiomyopathy in MELAS. PATIENTS: 11 consecutive patients with MELAS (mean age at initial examination 11.3 years, range 4 to 16 years) were enrolled in the study. Six were followed for more than five years. RESULTS: On echocardiographic examination, three patients showed increased left ventricular end diastolic posterior wall thickness (LVPWTd), exceeding 140% of the normal value. Four patients, including these three, had an ejection fraction of less than 50%, and two also had increased left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) exceeding 140% of the normal value (%N). The LVPWTd%N was correlated positively with the LVEDV%N (R = 0.669, p < 0.05) and negatively with the ejection fraction (R = -0.6701, p < 0.05). One patient died of heart failure aged 22 years. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiomyopathy in MELAS is characterised by an abnormally thick left ventricular wall with progressive dilatation and poor left ventricular contraction developing over several years, indicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy advancing to dilated cardiomyopathy.
16010549	Renal cell carcinoma in a pediatric patient with an inherited mitochondrial mutation. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare pediatric renal cancer. Recent molecular genetic studies discovered a tumor-specific mutation involving translocation of a transcription factor TFE3 in a subset of pediatric RCC with distinct histopathology. We reported a case of a 2-year-old boy with RCC associated with TFE3 translocation resulting in a PRCC-TFE3 fusion gene. Interestingly, the case carried a maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alteration at the position which is usually found in MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes) syndrome (A3243G). Although evidence of somatic alterations in mtDNA existed in various cancers, association between inherited mtDNA mutation and pediatric renal cancer has not been reported. Our case provided the first evidence of a co-occurrence between a germ line mutation in mtDNA and the somatic mutation of pediatric RCC. With this information, we speculated a role of mitochondria mutation in the pathogenesis of this cancer.
25128282	Vasodilatation of multiple cerebral arteries in early stage of stroke-like episode with MELAS. We describe a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), with multiple cerebral vasodilatations in a stroke-like episode visualised by using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CT angiography (CTA). In the acute stroke-like episode stage, T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI showed high-intensity areas in the left occipital area. In addition, MRA and CTA revealed prominent dilatation of the left posterior cerebral artery and temporal branches of the middle cerebral artery with focal hyperperfusions using CT perfusion (CTP) that corresponded to the MRI. After 10 days, with the development of aphasia, MRI indicated the lesions had spread to the temporal and parietal regions, and this distribution was not confined to major vascular territories. The patient's symptoms gradually improved, accompanied by the attenuation of MRI, CTA, and CTP findings. These characteristic features along with the MRI changes that spread beyond vascular boundaries and the multiple cerebral vasodilatations prior to the development of clinical symptoms are not fully explained by the mitochondrial angiopathy or cytopathy theories. These findings provide further evidence supporting neuronal hyperexcitability in stroke-like episodes of MELAS.
21443929	MELAS: a nationwide prospective cohort study of 96 patients in Japan. BACKGROUND: MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) (OMIM 540000) is the most dominant subtype of mitochondrial myopathy. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, natural course, and severity of MELAS. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 96 Japanese patients with MELAS was followed between June 2003 and April 2008. Patients with MELAS were identified and enrolled based on questionnaires administered to neurologists in Japan. MELAS was defined using the Japanese diagnostic criteria for MELAS. Two follow-up questionnaires were administered to neurologists managing MELAS patients at an interval of 5years. RESULTS: A prevalence of at least 0.58 (95% confidential interval (CI), 0.54-0.62)/100,000 was calculated for mitochondrial myopathy, whereas the prevalence of MELAS was 0.18 (95%CI, 0.02-0.34)/100,000 in the total population. MELAS patients were divided into two sub-groups: juvenile form and adult form. Stroke-like episodes, seizure and headache were the most frequent symptoms seen in both forms of MELAS. Short stature was significantly more frequent in the juvenile form, whereas hearing loss, cortical blindness and diabetes mellitus were significantly more frequent in the adult form. According to the Japanese mitochondrial disease rating scale, MELAS patients showed rapidly increasing scores (mean+-standard deviation, 12.8+-8.7) within 5years from onset of the disease. According to a Kaplan-Meier analysis, the juvenile form was associated with a higher risk of death than the adult form (hazard ratio, 3.29; 95%CI, 1.32-8.20; p=0.0105). CONCLUSIONS AND GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: We confirmed that MELAS shows a rapid degenerative progression within a 5-year interval and that this occurs in both the juvenile and the adult forms of MELAS and follows different natural courses. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Biochemistry of Mitochondria.
11382201	Long-term treatment with idebenone and riboflavin in a patient with MELAS. We report a patient with MELAS treated for 24 months with idebenone and riboflavin, during which no stroke-like episodes occurred. Moreover neurological symptoms clearly improved, and a recovery of brain MRI and EEG abnormalities was observed. We conclude that the combined treatment with idebenone and riboflavin may restore the metabolic impairment in MELAS, possibly improving the long-term prognosis in these patients.
16799910	[Evolution until death of two members of a family with A3243G mutation and MELAS phenotype versus diabetes mellitus]. INTRODUCTION: The A3243G gene tRNALeu(UUR) mutation has different phenotypic expressions. The clinical outcome and survival of each phenotype are mostly unknown. We followed-up two of three family members, carriers of the A3243G mutation, until their death. CLINICAL CASE: The proband case had MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactacidosis, stroke) phenotype. Although he presented with a stroke-like episode, he developed recurrent generalized and partial epileptic seizures without associated stroke-like episodes over time as well as slowly progressive dementia. The cognitive performance greatly worsened after a complex partial epileptic status. He died from bronchopneumonia and septic shock eleven years after diagnosis. His sister remains asymptomatic. His mother was diagnosed of diabetes mellitus and deafness when she was 53. Seventeen years later she developed a single stroke-like episode. She died one year after from acute renal failure and cardiogenic shock following sympathectomy for ischemic angiopathy. In the MELAS case neither idebenone treatment nor valproate substitution by other anticonvulsants reduced seizure frequency nor the spreading of lesions evaluated by MRI. In the phenotype with diabetes and deafness the outcome diabetes mellitus was as expected. CONCLUSIONS: In this family with A3243G mutation, the phenotype with neurosensorial deafness and diabetes mellitus seems to have longer survival than the MELAS phenotype. The cause of death in both cases was closely related to medical complications prevalent in each patient at the time of death.
14745089	Therapeutic effect and [123I]IMP SPECT findings of sodium dichloroacetate in a patient with MELAS. 
16006433	A juvenile case of MELAS with T3271C mitochondrial DNA mutation. We present here a patient with muscle fatigue and poor growth since the age of 6 y. The diagnosis of a mitochondrial disease was based on the presence of ragged red fibers in the muscle biopsy and on a combined defect of mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory enzymes. Epilepsia partialis continua with stroke-like episodes appeared 2 mo before death at the age of 18 and prompted a search for mitochondrial DNA mutations associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Minisequencing of the patient's DNA samples revealed a heteroplasmic T3271C mutation with a 78-94% mutation load in her fibroblasts or autopsy-derived tissue samples. This is the ninth reported non-Japanese patient with T3271C mutation. Our patient shows that despite very high proportion of mutant mtDNA, the T3271C mutation can give rise to mild symptoms in childhood and to a rapid terminal phase that simulates encephalitis.
23300613	Pilot whales attracted to killer whale sounds: acoustically-mediated interspecific interactions in cetaceans. In cetaceans' communities, interactions between individuals of different species are often observed in the wild. Yet, due to methodological and technical challenges very little is known about the mediation of these interactions and their effect on cetaceans' behavior. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are a highly vocal species and can be both food competitors and potential predators of many other cetaceans. Thus, the interception of their vocalizations by unintended cetacean receivers may be particularly important in mediating interspecific interactions. To address this hypothesis, we conducted playbacks of killer whale vocalizations recorded during herring-feeding activity to free-ranging long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas). Using a multi-sensor tag, we were able to track the whales and to monitor changes of their movements and social behavior in response to the playbacks. We demonstrated that the playback of killer whale sounds to pilot whales induced a clear increase in group size and a strong attraction of the animals towards the sound source. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that the interception of heterospecific vocalizations can mediate interactions between different cetacean species in previously unrecognized ways.
16224730	[Mitochondrial respiratory chain diseases. Evaluation and variability in 52 patients]. INTRODUCTION: Clinical, electrophysiological, genetic and biochemical deficiencies variability were evaluated in 52 patients diagnosed of mitochondrial respiratory chain diseases (MRCD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 26 men and 26 women, aged 19 to 79 years, were tested by clinical examination, electrophysiological techniques, muscle biopsy and genetic and biochemical studies. RESULTS: The patients were classified into seven phenotypes: myopathy, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, progressive ophthalmoplegia plus ataxia, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke episodes (MELAS), myoclonic encephalopathy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), and encephalopathies. Each phenotype may begin by different ways. The electromiography showed myopathy in 39 cases and various types of neuropathy in 10. Ragged-red COX negative fibers or widespread electron microscopic abnormalities were found in 47 cases. Simple deletions, multiple deletions and three different point mutations were observed. Deficiency of complexes I, II, III and IV were found alone or in different associations. CONCLUSIONS: MRCD shows wide variations in clinical, genetic and biochemical studies. Some patients with nonspecific manifestations, mainly of central nervous system, need careful attention and to be on account of diagnostic suspicion.
20483008	Vascular involvement in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform perfusion CT imaging in the acute phase of myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), to assess whether these patients had cerebral perfusion abnormalities. Furthermore, the pathology of muscle vessel was evaluated, to explore the role of vasculopathy and ischemic events in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. METHODS: Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging was applied to the evaluation of brain perfusion during the symptomatic period of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Mitochondria structures in the blood vessels wall within muscle fibers were observed by light and electron microscopy analyses. RESULTS: Neuroimaging studies demonstrated uni- and bilateral lesions predominantly in the occipital and temporal-parietal lobes. Compared with the healthy control subjects, significant decreases in cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume were noted in affected brain areas of individuals with MELAS. In particular, mean transit time and the time to peak were prolonged both in lesion and non-lesion brain areas. Muscle pathology showed large granular deposits on vessel wall as demonstrated by succinic acid dehydrogenase staining. Electron microscopy of blood vessels revealed swelling of cristae and a striking increase in the number of mitochondria in the smooth muscle and endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Insufficient cerebral perfusion or vascular reserve and secondary metabolic dysfunction may represent an important feature of the pathogenesis of the stroke-like episodes in MELAS.
27418365	Progression of stroke-like lesions along the cortico-ponto-cerebellar tract. 
19576112	[A study on the expression of anti-mitochondrial antibody in the brain of patients with MELAS syndrome]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathological changes and pathogenesis of the MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis stroke-like episodes) by using the method of immunohistochemical staining in the brain biopsy specimens with anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA). METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical staining in 3 confirmed MELAS patients' paraffin-imbued brain biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Small vessel proliferation and the uneven thickness of the wall were found in the 3 MELAS patients. A lot of brown deposits was shown in the wall of small vessels and also noted in neurons. CONCLUSIONS: The main pathological change in the MELAS brain biopsy immunohistochemical staining with AMA was the small vessel proliferation, indicating that abnormal mitochondria accumulated in the vascular smooth muscle, endothelial cell and neurons of the lesion sites. This finding was consistent with the electron microscopic discovery and valuable for the diagnosis of MELAS.
22611618	A8344G mutation of the mitochondrial DNA with typical mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome. We report an unusual case of juvenile ischaemic stroke syndrome associated with the A8344G mutation in tRNA(Lys) gene of mitochondrial DNA. The clinical phenotype of patient was typical for MELAS (mitochondrial ecephalomyapathy with lactate acidosis and stroke like episodes). The MELAS has been related to mutation A3243G in most cases, but some other mitochondrial DNA mutations were described in the background of this syndrome as well. A 22-years-old man and his family were investigated. Throughout clinical investigation as well as Doppler sonography, neuroradiological, and immunserological examinations were performed. Molecular studies included the analysis of the Leiden, prothrombin G20210A and the most common mitochondrial DNA mutations. The DNA analysis of the proband revealed a heteroplasmic A8344G substitution in the T-loop of the tRNALYS gene. The mutation could not been detected in her mother blood. We can conclude that A8344G mutation of the mitochondrial DNA resulted in juvenile ischemic stroke, which is associated only rarely to this genetic alteration. In young age onset of a stroke-like episode with undetermined etiology the mtDNA alterations always have to be excluded.

22889777	Ictal and interictal 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT of a MELAS case presented with epilepsy-like visual hallucination. A 55-year-old woman was diagnosed with the syndrome of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). She was referred for Tc-HMPAO brain SPECT because of visual hallucinations, which were suspected to be related to epileptic seizures. Ictal SPECT images showed remarkable hyperperfusion in the left occipital cortex, which returned to near-normal status on the interictal SPECT images after treatment with anticonvulsants. It is very rare to see such an ictal SPECT image of epileptic or epilepsy-like disorders, especially in the setting of MELAS syndrome with visual hallucination.

11528158	Nail-patella syndrome associated with respiratory chain disorder. Nail-patella syndrome (NPS) has not been described to be associated with a respiratory chain disorder (RCD) before. In a 42-year-old man with the typical phenotype of an NPS, weakness and wasting of the shoulder girdle muscles, muscle cramps, fatigability, hyperhidrosis, chest pain and creatine kinase elevation were observed. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular hypertrabeculation. Needle electromyography was myopathic, lactate stress testing was abnormal, muscle biopsy showed typical features of an RCD and mtDNA analysis revealed the A3243G MELAS mutation. In conclusion, this case demonstrates that NPS may be randomly associated with RCD. NPS patients should undergo detailed cardiological and neurological investigations, in order not to overlook a double trouble partially mimicking NPS.
10482110	Mitochondrial maculopathy: geographic atrophy of the macula in the MELAS associated A to G 3243 mitochondrial DNA point mutation. PURPOSE: To report ocular findings in the mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome) in a family with the A to G 3243 mitochondrial (mt) DNA point mutation. METHODS: Case reports. Ocular findings are described from four family members with the MELAS associated A to G 3243 mt DNA point mutation. RESULTS: Findings included ophthalmoplegia, neurosensory deafness, reduction of photopic and scotopic electroretinogram b-wave amplitudes, and myopathy, as well as macular retinal pigment epithelial atrophy. No family members had nyctalopia, attenuation of retinal blood vessels, or retinal bone spicule pigmentation. CONCLUSION: The finding of slowly progressive macular retinal pigment epithelial atrophy expands the reported phenotypic diversity of patients with A3243G mt DNA mutations.
12436342	Accumulation of somatic mutation in mitochondrial DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells in diabetic patients. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: A point mutation of mitochondrial DNA at nucleotide number 3243 A to G is responsible for both the major genetic aetiologies of the MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and mitochondrial diabetes. Otherwise, this mutation is also reported to occur as an acquired somatic mutation, possibly due to oxidative stress. Since diabetes can cause severe oxidative stress, we hypothesize that the accumulation of the somatic 3243 A to G mutation in mitochondrial DNA can be accelerated by diabetes. METHODS: DNA was extracted from blood samples of 290 non-diabetic healthy subjects (age 20-60) including 98 newborn infants and from 383 patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (age 18-80). The extent of somatic 3243 A to G mutation to total mitochondrial DNA was detected by real-time PCR using the TaqMan Probe. RESULTS: Whereas the level of the 3243 A to G mutation was negligible in the newborn group, it was increased in healthy subjects who were 20 to 29 and 41 to 60 years of age, suggesting that this mutation was somatic. In the diabetic patients the mutation rate increased along with age and the duration of diabetes. In the middle-aged group (age 41-60), the 3243 A to G mutation accumulates fourfold higher in the diabetic patients than the healthy subjects. Moreover, multiple regression analysis showed that the most critical factor associated with this mutation in diabetic patients was the duration of diabetes. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Diabetes accelerates the accumulation of the somatic 3243 A to G mutation in mitochondrial DNA, which can accelerate the ageing process. This somatic mutation could possibly be a new marker for estimating the duration of diabetes.
15126311	Investigation of common mitochondrial point mutations in Korea. Between 1997 and 2002, 65 patients with suspected mitochondrial diseases were screened for the mitochondrial point mutations A3243G, T3271C, A8344G, and T8356C. Among these patients, 15 were found to have one of these mutations: 12 with A3243G and 3 with A8344G. The phenotypes of A3243G and A8344G mutations were MELAS and MERRF, respectively. Many asymptomatic family members had the same mutations. In this report, detailed clinical and laboratory findings are presented.
33479417	Neurofilament light is a novel biomarker for mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a complicated maternally inherited disorder lacking of sensitive and specific biomarkers. The objective of this study was to investigate the serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) as a novel biomarker of neurological dysfunction in MELAS. Patients with different status of MELAS were enrolled in this study. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was given to the participants to evaluate cognition status. Multiple functional MRI was performed on the participants. Blood samples were collected and the serum NfL concentrations were determined by the single-molecule array technology (Simoa). This study enrolled 23 patients with MELAS, 15 people in the acute attack phase of MELAS and 10 people in the remission phase, including 2 patients in both acute attack and remission phase. Sixteen healthy controls (HCs) were also enrolled. Serum NfL level increased significantly in patients with MELAS. Serum NfL level in the acute attack group (146.73 [120.91-411.31] pg/ml, median [IQR]) was higher than in the remission group (40.31 [19.54-151.05] pg/ml, median [IQR]) and HCs group (7.70 [6.13-9.78] pg/ml, median [IQR]) (p < 0.05). The level of NfL in the remission phase group was higher than in HCs group (p < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between the serum NfL level and MMSE (p = 0.006, r = -0.650). The NfL concentration correlated positively with stroke-like lesion volume in the brain (r = 0.740, p < 0.001). Serum NfL may serve as a novel biomarker for the neurological dysfunction in MELAS patients.
19393775	Accumulation of oxidative stress around the stroke-like lesions of MELAS patients. To investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and progressive spread of the stroke-like lesions in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with 3243A>G mutation, we retrospectively analyzed the spread frequency in patients with and without treatment with the radical scavenger edaravone. Oxidative damage and defensive enzymes were histologically evaluated. Spread was significantly less frequent in the patients treated with edaravone. Although 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, a marker for oxidative damage of DNA, was obviously accumulated in peri-lesional surviving neurons, manganese superoxide dismutase and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 were not up-regulated in those neurons. Increased oxidative stress and insufficient defense could be involved in the pathogenesis of the spreading lesions in MELAS.
26455989	Retinal nerve fibre layer defect associated with MELAS syndrome. 
11198278	A novel mtDNA mutation in the ND5 subunit of complex I in two MELAS patients. We identified a novel heteroplasmic mutation in the mitochodrial DNA gene encoding the ND5 subunit of complex I. This mutation (13514A-->G) hits the same codon affected by a previously reported mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS)-associated mutation (13513G-->A), but the amino acid replacement is different (D393G vs D393N). The 13514A-->G mutation was found in two unrelated MELAS-like patients. However, in contrast to typical MELAS, lactic acidosis was absent or mild and the muscle biopsy was morphologically normal. Strongly positive correlation between the percentage of heteroplasmy and defective activity of complex I was found in cybrids. We found an additional 13513G-->A-positive case, affected by a progressive mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Our results clearly demonstrate that the amino acid position D393 is crucial for the function of complex I. Search for D393 mutations should be part of the routine screening for mitochondrial disorders.
24026895	Effect of a single dose of propofol and lack of dextrose administration in a child with mitochondrial disease: a case report. Propofol infusion syndrome is a recognized complication of prolonged propofol use in the pediatric population, but little is reported on other metabolic effects of propofol, especially in children with mitochondrial disorders. We report on a child with metabolic encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome who received a single dose of propofol for procedural sedation. The patient's initial presentation was consistent with a mild exacerbation of her underlying disease. She received a single dose of propofol and non-dextrose-containing fluids during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study to rule out stroke and progressed to develop severe acidosis, neurologic deterioration, and cardiorespiratory compromise. This is the first case report of severe metabolic disturbances after a single dose of propofol administered for procedural sedation in a patient with metabolic encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome and it questions the safety of propofol and absence of dextrose infusions during an acute illness in patients with mitochondrial disorders. 
30581058	The "Toenail Sign" in MELAS May Be the End Stage of a Stroke-like Lesion. 
12444382	Diversity of clinical symptoms in A3243G mitochondrial DNA mutation (MELAS syndrome mutation). BACKGROUND: MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is one of the most common mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. MATERIAL/METHODS: We present four children with A3243G MELAS mtDNA mutation and give a summary of clinical MELAS symptoms reported in the literature. Serum lactate elevation, mosaic pattern of COX deficit and decreased activity of complex I and IV in the muscle biopsy were found in all cases. RRFs were recognized in three out of four. RESULTS: The main features seen in all our patients were poor growth and fatigability with muscle weakness. All presented epileptic jerks of various character, some deformation features (recurrent pretibial and peritarsal edema, large swollen-looking hands and feet, hypertelorism and protruding ears) and some cutaneous lesions (atopic dermatitis, local melanoderma, asymmetric vascular dilatation). Stroke-like episodes, multihormonal hypopituitarism, sensorineural hypoacusis, pigmentary retinal degeneration, intracranial calcification, heart involvement, recurrent vomiting or abdominal pain were seen only in individual cases. The homonymous hemianopia frequently reported in the literature was not a feature of our patients. One of them suffered from nonspecific sialoadenitis never mentioned in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Morphological, enzymatic and molecular investigations of a muscle biopsy sample should be undertaken to improve early MELAS detection in patients with any multiorgan disease associated with serum lactate elevation.
30741831	Late-onset mitochondrial disease in a patient with MELAS and mitochondrial DNA T14487C mutation. 
19012224	[MELAS syndrome as a differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke]. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactacidosis and stroke-like episode (MELAS) syndrome is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous mitochondrial disorder with a clinical onset between the first and third decade. The clinical hallmark is the stroke-like-episode, which mimicks ischemic stroke but is usually transient and non-disabling in nature. The morphological equivalent on MRI is a T2-hyperintensity, predominantly over the temporo-parieto-occipital region, not confined to a vascular territory, which is also hyperintense on diffusion weighted imaging and on apparent diffusion coefficient sequences (vasogenic edema, stroke-like lesion). Additional features include seizures, cognitive decline, psychosis, lactic acidosis, migraine, visual impairment, hearing loss, short stature, diabetes, or myopathy. Muscle biopsy typically shows ragged-red fibers, COX-negative fibers, SDH hyperreactivity, and abnormally shaped mitochondria with paracristalline inclusions. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a biochemical respiratory chain defect or one of the disease-causing mutations, of which 80 % affect the mitochondrial tRNALeu gene.
11571698	Infantile presentation of the mtDNA A3243G tRNA(Leu (UUR)) mutation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders are clinically very heterogeneous, ranging from single organ involvement to severe multisystem disease. One of the most frequently observed mtDNA mutations is the A-to-G transition at position 3243 of the tRNA(Leu (UUR)) gene. This mutation is often related to MELAS syndrome. However, not all patients with the A3243G mutation share the same clinical disease expression and, on the contrary, patients clinically exhibiting MELAS syndrome may have other mtDNA mutations. Here we describe two patients with a very early infantile presentation of disease associated with the A3243G mutation. Patient 1 presented with hypotonia, feeding difficulties and failure to thrive (FTT) at the age of 3 months. Laboratory investigations showed persistent hyperlactic acidemia, elevated lactate/pyruvate ratios and elevated alanine concentrations in blood. Developmental delay was progressive and he developed cardiomyopathy and seizures. Death occurred at the age of 3.5 years. Patient 2 was born prematurely and had persistent, severe lactic acidosis from birth on. Moderate biventricular hypertrophy was seen on ultrasound studies of the heart and, suffering from progressive lactic acidosis, he died at the age of 13 days. Because of the rarity of this very early presentation, we searched the literature for other infantile cases associated with the A3243G mutation and found 8 additional ones. In infants presenting with lactic acidosis/hyperlactic acidemia, failure to thrive, hypotonia, seizures and/or cardiomyopathy, mtDNA mutational analysis, also for the disease entities, usually only observed in juveniles or adults is warranted.
28181274	Hereditary myopathies with early respiratory insufficiency in adults. INTRODUCTION: Hereditary myopathies with early respiratory insufficiency as a predominant feature of the clinical phenotype are uncommon and underestimated in adults. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data of patients with hereditary myopathies who demonstrated early respiratory insufficiency before the need for ambulatory assistance. Only patients with disease-causing mutations or a specific histopathological diagnosis were included. Patients with cardiomyopathy were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 22 patients; half had isolated respiratory symptoms at onset. The diagnosis of the myopathy was often delayed, resulting in delayed ventilatory support. The most common myopathies were adult-onset Pompe disease, myofibrillar myopathy, multi-minicore disease, and myotonic dystrophy type 1. Single cases of laminopathy, MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike events), centronuclear myopathy, and cytoplasmic body myopathy were identified. CONCLUSION: We highlighted the most common hereditary myopathies associated with early respiratory insufficiency as the predominant clinical feature, and underscored the importance of a timely diagnosis for patient care. Muscle Nerve 56: 881-886, 2017.
22579150	The psychiatric manifestations of mitochondrial disorders: a case and review of the literature. OBJECTIVE: Mitochondrial disorders are caused by gene mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA and affect energy-dependent organs such as the brain. Patients with psychiatric illness, particularly those with medical comorbidities, may have primary mitochondrial disorders. To date, this issue has received little attention in the literature, and mitochondrial disorders are likely underdiagnosed in psychiatric patients. DATA SOURCES: This article describes a patient who presented with borderline personality disorder and treatment-resistant depression and was ultimately diagnosed with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) 3271. We also searched the literature for all case reports of patients with mitochondrial disorders who initially present with prominent psychiatric symptoms by using MEDLINE (from 1948-February 2011), Embase (from 1980-February 2011), PsycINFO (from 1806-February 2011), and the search terms mitochondrial disorder, mitochondria, psychiatry, mental disorders, major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and psychosis. STUDY SELECTION: Fifty cases of mitochondrial disorders with prominent psychiatric symptomatology were identified. DATA EXTRACTION: Information about the psychiatric presentation of the cases was extracted. This information was combined with our case, the most common psychiatric manifestations of mitochondrial disorders were identified, and the important diagnostic and treatment implications for patients with psychiatric illness were reviewed. RESULTS: The most common psychiatric presentations in the cases of mitochondrial disorders included mood disorder, cognitive deterioration, psychosis, and anxiety. The most common diagnosis (52% of cases) was a MELAS mutation. Other genetic mitochondrial diagnoses included polymerase gamma mutations, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, mitochondrial DNA deletions, point mutations, twinkle mutations, and novel mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mitochondrial disorders can present with primary psychiatric symptomatology, including mood disorder, cognitive impairment, psychosis, and anxiety. Psychiatrists need to be aware of the clinical features that are indicative of a mitochondrial disorder, investigate patients with suggestive presentations, and be knowledgeable about the treatment implications of the diagnosis.
27742419	Complex I deficiency related to T10158C mutation ND3 gene: A further definition of the clinical spectrum. BACKGROUND: Complex I deficiency is the most common energy generation disorder which may clinically present at any age with a wide spectrum of symptoms and signs. The T10158C mutation ND3 gene is rare and occurs in patients showing an early rapid neurological deterioration invariably leading to death after a few months. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 9year-old boy with a mtDNA T10158C mutation showing a mild MELAS-like phenotype and brain MRI features congruent with both MELAS and Leigh syndrome. Epilepsia partialis continua also occurred in the clinical course and related to a mild cortical atrophy of the left perisylvian area. DISCUSSION: The present case confirms that the clinical spectrum of Complex I deficiency related to T10158C mutation ND3 gene is wider than previously described. Our observation further suggests that testing mutation in the MT-ND3 gene should be included in the diagnostic work-up of patients presenting with epilepsia partialis continua accompanied by suspicion of mitochondrial disorder.
14610127	Slowly progressive spread of the stroke-like lesions in MELAS. BACKGROUND: Little is known about temporal and spatial progression of the stroke-like lesion during the acute stage of the stroke-like episode in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). METHODS: In four stroke-like episodes of MELAS observed in three patients, MRI, EEG, and SPECT were studied consecutively within the first month of the onset. RESULTS: The first presenting symptoms were headache in all four stroke-like episodes, followed by hemianopsia, psychosis, and aphasia. In three episodes, epileptic seizure developed subsequently in close association with a progression of stroke-like lesion. In all four episodes, serial MRI showed a slowly progressive spread of the stroke-like lesion evolving from the temporal cortex to the surrounding parietal or occipital cortex over a few weeks following the onset of initial symptoms. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps showed slightly decreased ADC values in the actively evolving brain lesions compared with those in nonaffected regions of the brain. EEG showed a pattern of focal periodic epileptiform discharges in three episodes. SPECT showed a focal hyperemia in all four stroke-like lesions, in two of which focal hyperemia persisted for the first month. A T1-weighted hyperintense cortical signal on MRI compatible with cortical laminar necrosis was seen during the subacute stage of all stroke-like lesions. CONCLUSION: Slowly and progressively spreading stroke-like lesions on MRI may reflect ongoing neuronal metabolic derangement associated with concomitant vasogenic edema provoked by prolonged epileptic seizure activities.
11033519	[Mitochondrial diabetes complicated by or associated with "MELAS" syndrome?]. We report the case of fifty-two year-old mentally deficient female who presented with diabetes mellitus, deafness, stroke-like episodes, cardiomyopathy, and macular pattern dystrophy of the retina. Her brain exhibited calcification within basal ganglia, lactacidaemia was not increased. Although her skeletal muscles had never been clinically impaired, a quadriceps biopsy led to the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease because it exhibited ragged red fibers and heteroplasmic point-mutation at position 3243 of the mitochondrial DNA, although not any detectable respiratory chain complex deficiency was found. The mutant percentage in muscle was 70 p.100 and 5 to 10 p.100 in leukocytes. The question of whether a diabetic microangiopathy may be responsible stroke-like episodes is discussed. We suggest it was rather a complicated form of diabetes-deafness than a incomplete MELAS syndrome associated with mitochondrial diabetes.
20552288	MELAS: a mitochondrial disorder in an adult patient with a renal transplant. Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of syndromes caused by genetic defects in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. They present with a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Myopathy may be the sole or main sign, or merely an incidental finding occurring in the late course of a multisystemic illness. Although mitochondrial disorders are increasingly being recognized, confirming a specific diagnosis remains a great challenge due to the clinical heterogeneity of the diseases. Several well-defined clinical syndromes associated with specific mutations have been described. Thus, suspicion of mitochondrial diseases among patients with multiple, seemingly unrelated neuromuscular and multisystem disorders should be confirmed by the finding of deleterious mutations in genes involving mitochondrial biogenesis and function. This case report describes a 58-year-old patient with a 40-year course of a multisystemic illness representing the diagnostic challenges of mitochondrial disease.
20036095	Adult-onset of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome presenting as acute meningoencephalitis: a case report. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a rare mitochondrial disorder with a wide range of multisystemic symptoms. Epileptic seizures are common features of both MELAS and meningoencephalitis and are typically treated with anticonvulsants. OBJECTIVES: To provide the reader with a better understanding of MELAS and the adverse effects of valproic acid. CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hearing loss, sinusitis, and otitis media was brought to our emergency department due to acute onset of fever, headache, generalized seizure, and agitation. Because acute meningoencephalitis was suspected, the patient was treated with antibiotics on an empirical basis. The seizure activity was aggravated by valproic acid and abated after its discontinuation. MELAS was suspected and the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of a nucleotide 3243 A G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA. CONCLUSION: Detailed history-taking and systematic review help emergency physicians differentiate MELAS from meningoencephalitis in patients with the common presentation of epileptic seizures. Use of valproic acid to treat epilepsy in patients suspected of having mitochondrial disease should be avoided. Underlying mitochondrial disease should be suspected if seizure activity worsens with valproic acid therapy.
12701227	[Complex partial status epilepticus and PSD in MELAS]. 
24620430	[Determination of the critical time point for efficacy of L-arginine infusion therapy in a case of MELAS with frequent stroke-like episodes]. MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) is the most representative subtype of mitochondrial diseases. Administration of L-arginine (L-Arg) or a precursor of nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed as a promising medication for MELAS because one of the pathophysiological mechanisms is supposedly a decreased capacity for NO-dependent vasodilation. We experienced a girl with MELAS and frequent stroke-like episodes who was treated with L-Arg infusion. We evaluated the efficacy of L-Arg infusion therapy based on whether her headache and nausea were disappeared and neurological symptoms were improved within 24 hours of L-Arg administration. L-Arg infusions were effective in all four episodes when the treatment was started within 4 hours of the onset of stroke-like episodes. On the other hand, the infusion was effective in only one out of five episodes when the medication was delayed by more than 4 hours after the onset. Furthermore, the early administration of L-Arg resulted in better outcomes regarding new lesions determined by brain MRI. Our data suggest that L-Arg infusion may be most effective when it is started within 4 hours of the onset of neurological symptoms in the acute phase of MELAS. The study of a large number of episodes in many patients will be needed to determine the critical time point of L-Arg administration after the onset of the acute phase of MELAS.
10025431	Adult-onset MELAS presenting as herpes encephalitis. OBJECTIVE: To report an unusual presentation of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) manifested in late life with a clinical picture of herpes simplex encephalitis. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Clinical neurology department in a tertiary care hospital. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old woman developed aphasia and delirium during ophthalmic herpes zoster infection treated with oral prednisone and ophthalmic steroids, which was followed by progressive cognitive decline without acute neurologic events for 5 years. At age 60, the patient presented with new onset of seizures, hemiparesis, and hemianopsia. Subsequently she developed cortical blindness, multiple traumatic soft tissue injuries from falls, acute psychosis, and severe dementia with periods of agitation. She died in a nursing home in March 1997, 6 years after initial presentation. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed hyperintensity on T2-weighted images involving temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes bilaterally as well as mild atrophy of brainstem and cerebellum. Single photon emission computed tomographic imaging showed hypoperfusion of temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Results of video electroencephalographic monitoring showed periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges in temporal and occipital areas. The serum lactate level was normal in May 1996 and elevated in October 1996. The creatine kinase level was elevated with a 100% MM fraction in August 1991 and normal in March 1996. Results of repeated cerebrospinal fluid analyses indicated elevated protein levels. Analysis of DNA was diagnostic of MELAS by mitochondrial DNA point mutation at position 3243. The results of autopsy showed moderate cerebral, cerebellar, and brainstem atrophy with signs of infarction in temporal and parietal lobes bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation as well as age at onset of MELAS are highly variable. Onset of mitochondrial disorders can be provoked by febrile illness when there is mismatch between energy requirements and availability. In the differential diagnosis of herpes encephalitides, MELAS syndrome should be considered.
17560506	Elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies with encephalopathy in MELAS syndrome. Both the syndrome of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome) and Hashimoto's encephalopathy can present with nonspecific encephalopathy. Hashimoto's encephalopathy is an association of steroid-responsive encephalopathy with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Steroid-responsive encephalopathy, however, is not characteristic of the MELAS syndrome, which typically presents with stroke-like episodes and lactic acidosis in cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Here, a patient is described with goiter, recurrent encephalopathy and elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies who apparently responded to steroid therapy; however, magnetic resonance imaging was atypical for Hashimoto's encephalopathy, and she was diagnosed with MELAS syndrome. This syndrome can present with apparent steroid-responsive encephalopathy and elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies, mimicking Hashimoto's encephalopathy, and should be suspected if lactic acidosis is present and typical features are detected on magnetic resonance imaging.
19830638	[Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia--symptom or syndrome?]. The term chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is not only a symptom but is also used as a syndrome within the group of mitochondrial diseases. However, the symptom CPEO might also occur in other well defined mitochondrial syndromes such as MELAS, MNGIE, SANDO. The molecular bases of the syndrome CPEO are mostly single or multiple deletions of the mtDNA, less frequently point mutations. Multiple deletions are caused by defects of nuclear encoded proteins. In this case, the mode of inheritance might be autosomal dominant or recessive. However, all these types of mtDNA mutations are not only associated with the symptom or syndrome of CPEO but might also cause other well defined mitochondrial syndromes. Thus, the diagnosis of CPEO either as a symptom or as a syndrome requires the subtle characterisation of the complete clinical phenotype as well as the precise genotype. Only on this basis a valid prognosis and information about the mode of inheritance are possible.
23549648	Neuromuscular and systemic presentations in adults: diagnoses beyond MERRF and MELAS. Mitochondrial diseases are a diverse group of inherited and acquired disorders that result in inadequate energy production. They can be caused by inheritable genetic mutations, acquired somatic mutations, and exposure to toxins (including some prescription medications). Normal mitochondrial physiology is responsible, in part, for the aging process itself, as free radical production within the mitochondria results in a lifetime burden of oxidative damage to DNA, especially the mitochondrial DNA that, in turn, replicate the mutational burden in future copies of itself, and lipid membranes. Primary mitochondrial diseases are those caused by mutations in genes that encode for mitochondrial structural and enzymatic proteins, and those proteins required for mitochondrial assembly and maintenance. A number of common adult maladies are associated with defective mitochondrial energy production and function, including diabetes, obesity, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been demonstrated in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and some cancers. Polymorphisms in mitochondrial DNA have been linked to disease susceptibility, including death from sepsis and survival after head injury. There is considerable overlap in symptoms caused by primary mitochondrial diseases and those illnesses that affect mitochondrial function, but are not caused by primary mutations, as well as disorders that mimic mitochondrial diseases, but are caused by other identified mutations. Evaluation of these disorders is complex, expensive, and not without false-negative and false-positive results that can mislead the physician. Most of the common heritable mitochondrial disorders have been well-described in the literature, but can be overlooked by many clinicians if they are uneducated about these disorders. In general, the evaluation of the classic mitochondrial disorders has become straightforward if the clinician recognized the phenotype and orders appropriate confirmatory testing. However, the majority of patients referred for a mitochondrial evaluation do not have a clear presentation that allows for rapid identification and testing. This article provides introductory comments on mitochondrial structure, physiology, and genetics, but will focus on the presentation and evaluation of adults with mitochondrial symptoms, but who may not have a primary mitochondrial disease.
10617127	In vitro expression of N-acetyl aspartate by oligodendrocytes: implications for proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy signal in vivo. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a noninvasive means of assessing in vivo tissue biochemistry. N-Acetyl aspartate (NAA) is a major brain metabolite, and its presence is used increasingly in clinical and experimental MRS studies as a putative neuronal marker. A reduction in NAA levels as assessed by in vivo 1H MRS has been suggested to be indicative of neuronal viability. However, temporal observations of brain pathologies such as multiple sclerosis, mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and hypothyroidism have shown reversibility in NAA levels, possibly reflecting recovery of neuronal function. A knowledge of the cellular localisation of NAA is critical in interpreting these findings. The assumption that NAA is specific to neurones is based on previous immunohistochemical studies on whole brain using NAA-specific antibodies. The neuronal localisation was further substantiated by cell culture experiments in which its presence in the oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte progenitors and immature oligodendrocytes, but not in the mature oligodendrocytes, was observed. More recently, studies on oligodendrocyte biology have revealed the requirement for trophic factors to promote the generation, maturation, and survival of oligodendrocytes in vitro. Here, we have used this new information to implement a more pertinent cell cultivation procedure and demonstrate that mature oligodendrocytes can express NAA in vitro. This observation brings into question whether the NAA changes observed in clinical in vivo 1H MRS studies reflect neuronal function alone. The data presented here support the hypothesis that oligodendrocytes may express NAA in vivo and contribute to the NAA signal observed by 1H MRS.
32318851	Heritable and non-heritable uncommon causes of stroke. Despite intensive investigations, about 30% of stroke cases remains of undetermined origin. After exclusion of common causes of stroke, there is a number of rare heritable and non-heritable conditions, which often remain misdiagnosed, that should be additionally considered in the diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke. The identification of these diseases requires a complex work up including detailed clinical evaluation for the detection of systemic symptoms and signs, an adequate neuroimaging assessment and a careful family history collection. The task becomes more complicated by phenotype heterogeneity since stroke could be the primary or unique manifestation of a syndrome or represent just a manifestation (sometimes minor) of a multisystem disorder. The aim of this review paper is to provide clinicians with an update on clinical and neuroradiological features and a set of practical suggestions for the diagnostic work up and management of these uncommon causes of stroke. The identification of these stroke causes is important to avoid inappropriate and expensive diagnostic tests, to establish appropriate management measures, including presymptomatic testing, genetic counseling, and, if available, therapy. Therefore, physicians should become familiar with these diseases to provide future risk assessment and family counseling.
18070866	MELAS presented with status epilepticus and Anton-Babinski syndrome; value of ADC mapping in MELAS. 
31996177	Multisystem mitochondrial diseases due to mutations in mtDNA-encoded subunits of complex I. BACKGROUND: Maternally inherited complex I deficiencies due to mutations in MT-ND genes represent a heterogeneous group of multisystem mitochondrial disorders (MD) with a unfavourable prognosis. The aim of the study was to characterize the impact of the mutations in MT-ND genes, including the novel m.13091 T > C variant, on the course of the disease, and to analyse the activities of respiratory chain complexes, the amount of protein subunits, and the mitochondrial energy-generating system (MEGS) in available muscle biopsies and cultivated fibroblasts. METHODS: The respiratory chain complex activities were measured by spectrophotometry, MEGS were analysed using radiolabelled substrates, and protein amount by SDS-PAGE or BN-PAGE in muscle or fibroblasts. RESULTS: In our cohort of 106 unrelated families carrying different mtDNA mutations, we found heteroplasmic mutations in the genes MT-ND1, MT-ND3, and MT-ND5, including the novel variant m.13091 T > C, in 13 patients with MD from 12 families. First symptoms developed between early childhood and adolescence and progressed to multisystem disease with a phenotype of Leigh or MELAS syndromes. MRI revealed bilateral symmetrical involvement of deep grey matter typical of Leigh syndrome in 6 children, cortical/white matter stroke-like lesions suggesting MELAS syndrome in 3 patients, and a combination of cortico-subcortical lesions and grey matter involvement in 4 patients. MEGS indicated mitochondrial disturbances in all available muscle samples, as well as a significantly decreased oxidation of [1-14C] pyruvate in fibroblasts. Spectrophotometric analyses revealed a low activity of complex I and/or complex I + III in all muscle samples except one, but the activities in fibroblasts were mostly normal. No correlation was found between complex I activities and mtDNA mutation load, but higher levels of heteroplasmy were generally found in more severely affected patients. CONCLUSIONS: Maternally inherited complex I deficiencies were found in 11% of families with mitochondrial diseases in our region. Six patients manifested with Leigh, three with MELAS. The remaining four patients presented with an overlap between these two syndromes. MEGS, especially the oxidation of [1-14C] pyruvate in fibroblasts might serve as a sensitive indicator of functional impairment due to MT-ND mutations. Early onset of the disease and higher level of mtDNA heteroplasmy were associated with a worse prognosis.
23769937	Body contact and synchronous diving in long-finned pilot whales. Synchronous behavior, as a form of social interaction, has been widely reported for odontocete cetaceans observed at the sea surface. However, few studies have quantified synchronous behavior underwater. Using data from an animal-borne data recorder and camera, we described how a pair of deep-diving odontocetes, long-finned pilot whales, coordinated diving behavior. Diving data during overlapping periods of 3.7 h were obtained from two whales within a stable trio. The tagged whales made highly synchronous movements, and their dive durations differed only slightly (3+-3 s). The pair of whales maintained a constant and narrow vertical separation (ca. 3 m) throughout synchronous dives. The overall fluking rate for the same travel speed during synchronous dives was virtually the same as that during asynchronous dives, suggesting that synchronous behavior did not affect locomotion effort. In addition, a possible affiliative behavior was recorded by the animal-borne camera: another individual appeared in 8% of the frames, both with and without body contact to the tagged whale. The primary type of body contact was flipper-to-body. Our study, the first on underwater synchronous behavior and body contact of pilot whales, highlights the utility of using animal-borne devices for enabling new insights into social interactions.
19131470	Impaired mitochondrial function and insulin resistance of skeletal muscle in mitochondrial diabetes. OBJECTIVE: Impaired muscular mitochondrial function is related to common insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial diseases frequently lead to diabetes, which is mostly attributed to defective beta-cell mitochondria and secretion. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed muscular mitochondrial function and lipid deposition in liver (hepatocellular lipids [HCLs]) and muscle (intramyocellular lipids [IMCLs]) using (31)P/(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and insulin sensitivity and endogenous glucose production (EGP) using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps combined with isotopic tracer dilution in one female patient suffering from MELAS (myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) syndrome and in six control subjects. RESULTS: The MELAS patient showed impaired insulin sensitivity (4.3 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.5 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and suppression of EGP (69 vs. 94 +/- 1%), and her baseline and insulin-stimulated ATP synthesis were reduced (7.3 and 8.9 vs. 10.6 +/- 1.0 and 12.8 +/- 1.3 micromol x l(-1) x min(-1)) compared with those of the control subjects. HCLs and IMCLs were comparable between the MELAS patient and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of muscle mitochondrial fitness promotes insulin resistance and could thereby contribute to the development of diabetes in some patients with the MELAS syndrome.
19685357	Quantitative cellular level analysis of mitochondrial DNA 3243A > G mutations in individual tissues from the archival temporal bones of a MELAS patient. CONCLUSION: We could represent the first quantitative analysis of the mutation rate at the cellular level in human inner ear of a patient with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) by combining laser capture microdissection (LCM) and quantitative real time PCR. OBJECTIVES: We previously reported combining LCM and PCR to isolate mtDNA from the cells of specific tissues within a human archival celloidin-embedded temporal bone section without known otological history. Using this method, we quantitatively analyzed the rate of mtDNA 3243A > G mutation in the inner ear of a MELAS patient, and examined the correlation of the mutation rate at the cellular level and their histopathological condition. METHODS: We extracted each inner ear organs using LCM from temporal bone sections of a MELAS patient, and studied the mutation rate, which was calculated as the ratio of the amount of mutant mtDNA to the total mtDNA. RESULTS: We found that the mtDNA mutation rate was high in spiral ganglion cells and the saccular macula, but was comparatively low in hair cells of the organ of Corti, the stria vascularis and the facial nerve. With the exception of the stria vascularis, there was a good correlation between the mutation rate and the histological findings.
16682545	Nerve conduction abnormalities in patients with MELAS and the A3243G mutation. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA point mutations are especially deleterious to tissues with high energy demand, including the peripheral nervous system. Neuropathy has been associated with several mitochondrial diseases, including MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nerve conduction in a genotypically and phenotypically homogeneous group of patients with MELAS and the A3243G mutation. DESIGN: We studied 30 patients with MELAS and the A3243G mutation using neurophysiological techniques, medical history questionnaires, laboratory tests, and a standardized neurological examination. RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects (77%) had abnormal nerve conduction measures. Symptoms suggestive of neuropathy were present in only half of the patients, but almost all had decreased reflexes or distal sensory findings on examination. Nerve conduction abnormalities were predominantly axonal and sensory and mainly present in the legs. Patients with nerve conduction abnormalities tended to be older and were more likely male. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral nerve impairment is common in those with MELAS and the A3243G mutation, and may be subclinical. Male sex and older age may add to the genetic disposition to develop neuropathy.
21631236	An autopsy case of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with intestinal bleeding in chronic renal failure. A 50-year-old man who underwent hemodialysis (HD) at local outpatient HD center due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was transferred to our hospital because of pneumonia. He had severe emaciation and past history of congestive heart failure. Presenting symptoms almost consistently involved difficulty in hearing and recurrent attacks of migraine-like headaches. He was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, showing diastolic mechanical dyssynchrony by tissue Doppler echocardiography. On the day of death, he had hematemesis and hemorrhagic shock. Autopsy revealed perforation of duodenum, and genetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA from cardiac muscle and iliopsoas muscle revealed a 3243A > G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene, which is related to mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Multiple organ failure due to the mutation of mitochondrial DNA with gastrointestinal bleeding is not a common.
23534790	Multicenter evaluation of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma in Turkey: MELAS study. BACKGROUND: Malignant melanoma is a cancer that demonstrates rapid progression and atypical clinically features with a poor prognosis. AIM: This study was performed to determine the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with malignant melanoma in Turkey. METHODS: The medical records of 98 patients between 2007- 2012 at our centers were retrieved from the patient registry. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In our study, with the median follow-up of all patients with cutaneous MM of 46.3 months, the median OS rate of all cases was 43.6 months and 5-year OS was 48.6%. However, five-year OS rates of patients with localized disease (stage I-II) and node involvement (stage III) were 60.3% and 39.6%, respectively. The median OS of stage IV patients was 8.7 months and 1-year OS rate was 26.2%. We showed that advanced stage, male gender, and advanced age in all patients with MM were significant prognostic factors of OS. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the results of current studies from Western countries, we found similar findings concerning demographical features, histological variables and survival analyses for our patients with cutaneous MM in Turkey.
21945173	Alternating hemiplegia of childhood: metabolic studies in the largest European series of patients. Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare disorder with diagnosis based on clinical criteria, as no laboratory, neuroradiological or genetic markers are currently available. The pathogenic mechanisms are still an enigma. Some hypotheses have been proposed such as hemiplegic migraine variant, epileptic mechanism, channelopathy and mitochondrial disorder, but none of these has been confirmed. Our aim was to analyze the results of metabolic studies performed on a series of 157 European patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for AHC. We tried to find a common metabolic abnormality, related with AHC. We did not find significant abnormalities in basic metabolic screening, at different ages. Neurotransmitters in cerebrospinal fluid (n = 26) were normal in all of the patients. Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities were analyzed in 19 muscle biopsies; in 4 cases, different MRC enzyme deficiencies were demonstrated, ranging from mild-unspecific deficiencies to more profound and probably primary defects. Although we did not find specific metabolic markers in our series, some metabolic disorders such as pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, MELAS, cerebral glucose transporter defect and neurotransmitter deficiency can exhibit symptoms similar to those of AHC and need to be ruled out before a diagnosis of AHC can be established. Further studies including high-throughput diagnostic technologies seem necessary to elucidate the etiology of this severe and enigmatic disorder.
10405450	Nonrandom tissue distribution of mutant mtDNA. Heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects are an important cause of inherited human disease. On a cellular level, the percentage of mutant mtDNA is the principal factor behind the expression of the genetic defect. Marked variation in the level of mutant mtDNA among tissues is thought to be responsible for the diverse clinical phenotypes associated with the same pathogenic mtDNA mutation. This study was designed to determine whether the percentage level of a pathogenic mtDNA molecule is determined by a purely random process. The tissue distribution of the A3243G MELAS point mutation was analyzed in five individuals who were members of a family with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness. The level of mutant mtDNA was measured in four tissues in three individuals and three tissues in two individuals. The highest level of mutant mtDNA occurred in skeletal muscle, followed by hair follicles, and then buccal mucosa, with the lowest levels in blood (leucocyte/platelet fraction). The probability of observing any strict hierarchy in family is 4.82 x 10(-5). These results indicate that the distribution of the A3243G mutation is not solely determined by random processes.
19451268	Depressive episode with catatonic features in a case of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Three months previously, a 17-year-old girl had complained of right-hand side hemiparesis, and her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a signal change in the left temporoparietooccipital area. The 3243A>G mutation was found in mitochondrial DNA. She was diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and was prescribed dichloroacetic acid to treat lactic acidosis. Her health improved. Two months later, she developed drowsiness and generalized weakness. A New lesion was not found on brain MRI, and electrodiagnostic findings were compatible with acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy. Her negative symptoms, such as depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, psychomotor retardation, and hypersomnia, were aggravated. She was prescribed antidepressants and psychostimulants by a psychiatrist after diagnosis of severe depression episode with catatonic features. One month later, her catatonic condition had improved with medication. Our experience shows that psychiatric diagnostic evaluation of abruptly regressed neurologic and clinical features is important, even in a patient with devastating underlying disease.

27899309	Repeated misdiagnosis of a relapsed atypical anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis without an associated ovarian teratoma. We present an atypical case of relapsed anti-NMDAR encephalitis in a young female patient without an associated ovarian teratoma. She presented with recurrent seizure attacks with muscle weakness, psychosis, dyskinesia, autonomic failure and insomnia. She was first misdiagnosed as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) then Hashimoto's encephalopathy due to diffuse cerebral lesions, elevated serum lactic acid concentration, increased amount of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies in serum and diffuse lesions of the thyroid gland. Her final diagnosis was delayed for 6 months with the detection of anti-NMDAR antibodies in her CSF. After treatment, she had poor recovery with serious sequelae at 10-month follow-up. Noteworthy, MELAS should be highlighted as a differential diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
27212224	Successful Glycemic Control Decreases the Elevated Serum FGF21 Level without Affecting Normal Serum GDF15 Levels in a Patient with Mitochondrial Diabetes. Mitochondrial diabetes mellitus is a subtype of diabetes linked to mutations in mitochondrial DNA. In patients with mitochondrial diabetes mellitus, the effect of glycemic control on the serum concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) has not been evaluated. FGF21 and GDF15 have been reported to be useful biomarkers for the diagnosis and severity assessment of mitochondrial diseases like mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Recent studies have shown FGF21 acts in an endocrine fashion to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus, while the exact biological functions of GDF15 remain unknown. Although mitochondrial diabetes mellitus is commonly found in cases with mitochondrial diseases, the comparison of FGF21 and GDF15 levels between those with and without diabetes has not been performed. Here, we report a 24-year-old woman with mitochondrial diabetes mellitus, who showed a high level of serum FGF21, but not serum GDF15, at diagnosis. In our case, liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, added to insulin glargine was effective for her glycemic control and showed no adverse effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms and hypoglycemia, during a 14-week observation. The successful glycemic control caused a decrease in the FGF21 level, without affecting the GDF15 level. Thus, we should consider patients' glycemic control levels in using FGF21 values for the diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases. In addition, sustained GDF15 levels during glycemic treatment in our case suggest the usefulness of GDF15 as a marker for clinical severity of muscle-manifested mitochondrial diseases. 
35804205	Successful catheter ablation of a left posterolateral accessory bypass tract and periinterventional management in a patient with MELAS syndrome. MELAS syndrome is defined as a combination of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes resulting from mutations in mitochondrial DNA. All medical interventions in these patients appear challenging due to a high risk of lactate acidosis or anesthesiological complications. Of note, previous reports suggest that these patients have a higher incidence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Here, a case of successful catheter ablation of a posteroseptal bypass tract using analgosedation in a patient with MELAS syndrome combined with WPW syndrome is presented.

11376185	Epileptic phenotypes associated with mitochondrial disorders. OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical and EEG features of the epileptic syndromes occurring in adult and infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies (ME). METHODS: Thirty-one patients with recurrent and apparently unprovoked seizures associated with primary ME were included in the study. Diagnosis of ME was based on the recognition of a morphologic, biochemical, or molecular defect. RESULTS: Epileptic seizures were the first recognized symptom in 53% of the patients. Many adults (43%) and most infants (70%) had nontypical ME phenotypes. Partial seizures, mainly with elementary motor symptoms, and focal or multifocal EEG epileptiform activities characterized the epileptic presentation in 71% of the patients. Generalized myoclonic seizures were an early and consistent symptom only in the five patients with an A8344G mitochondrial DNA point mutation with classic myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) syndrome or "overlapping" characteristics. Photoparoxysmal EEG responses were observed not only in patients with typical MERRF, but also in adult patients with ME with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS), or overlapping phenotypes, and in one child with Leigh syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Epilepsy is an important sign in the early presentation of ME and may be the most apparent neurologic sign of nontypical ME, often leading to the diagnostic workup. Except for those with an A8344G mitochondrial DNA point mutation, most of our patients had partial seizures or EEG signs indicating a focal origin.
11422897	Hypoxic ventilatory depression in a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. We describe a case of a 21-year-old man with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who presented with hypoxic ventilatory depression. He had chronic hypoventilation, which was not explained by weakness of respiratory muscles. His hypercapnic ventilatory response was not impaired. In contrast, hypoxic ventilatory depression was observed in the isocapnic progressive hypoxic response test. After exposure to hypoxic conditions, his respiratory frequency decreased and tidal volume was unchanged. The hypoxic ventilatory depression was partially blocked by pretreatment with aminophylline. In conclusion, we need to be careful with patients with MELAS who are hypoxaemic because a vicious circle of hypoxia and hypoventilation can occur.
23619127	Overexpression of TNF-alpha in mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mtDNA: evidence for signaling through its receptors on mitochondria. Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) are heterogeneous disorders due to impaired respiratory chain function causing defective ATP production. Although the disruption of oxidative phosphorylation is central to the MD pathophysiology, other factors may contribute to these disorders. We investigated the expression and the cellular localization of TNF-alpha and its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, in muscle biopsies from 15 patients with mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. Our data unambiguously demonstrate that TNF-alpha is expressed in muscle fibers with abnormal focal accumulations of mitochondria, so-called ragged red fibers, and is delivered to mitochondria where both receptors are localized. Moreover TNF receptors are differentially regulated in patients' muscle in which the expression levels of TNFR1 mRNA are decreased and those of TNFR2 mRNA are increased compared with controls. These findings suggest for the first time that TNF-alpha could exert a direct effect on mitochondria via its receptors. 
35421194	Retinal biomarkers of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: A systematic review. INTRODUCTION: Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), a progressive degenerative disorder of small caliber cerebral vessels, represents a major contributor to stroke and vascular dementia incidence worldwide. We sought to conduct a systematic review of the role of retinal biomarkers in diagnosis and characterization of CSVD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library Database, and Web of Science. We identified studies of sporadic CSVD (including CSVD not otherwise specified, Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy, and Hypertensive Arteriopathy) and the most common familial CSVD disorders (including CADASIL, Fabry disease, and MELAS). Included studies used one or more of the following tools: visual fields assessment, fundus photography, Optical Coherence Tomography and OCT Angiography, Fluorescein Angiography, Electroretinography, and Visual Evoked Potentials. RESULTS: We identified 48 studies of retinal biomarkers in CSVD, including 9147 cases and 12276 controls. Abnormalities in retinal vessel diameter (11 reports, n = 11391 participants), increased retinal vessel tortuosity (11 reports, n = 617 participants), decreased vessel fractal dimension (5 reports, n = 1597 participants) and decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (5 reports, n = 4509 participants) were the biomarkers most frequently associated with CSVD. We identified no reports conducting longitudinal retinal evaluations of CSVD, or systematically evaluating diagnostic performance. CONCLUSION: Multiple retinal biomarkers were associated with CSVD or its validated neuroimaging biomarkers. However, existing evidence is limited by several shortcomings, chiefly small sample size and unstandardized approaches to both biomarkers' capture and CSVD characterization. Additional larger studies will be required to definitively determine whether retinal biomarkers could be successfully incorporated in future research efforts and clinical practice.
26982751	Clinical manifestation of mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial disorders (MD) represent a clinically, biochemically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases associated with dysfunction of the oxidative phosphorylation system and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Our aim was to illustrate the most common clinical presentation of MD on the example of selected diseases and syndromes. The minimal prevalence of MD is estimated as 1 to 5,000. MD may manifest at any age since birth until late-adulthood with acute manifestation or as a chronic progressive disease. Virtually any organ may be impaired, but the organs with the highest energetic demands are most frequently involved, including brain, muscle, heart and liver. Some MD may manifest as a characteristic cluster of clinical features (e.g. MELAS syndrome, Kearns-Sayre syndrome). Diagnostics includes detailed history, the comprehensive clinical examination, results of specialized examinations (especially cardiology, visual fundus examination, brain imaging, EMG), laboratory testing of body fluids (lactate, aminoacids, organic acids), and analysis of bioptic samples of muscle, skin, and liver, eventually. Normal lactate level in blood does not exclude the possibility of MD. Although the aimed molecular genetic analyses may be indicated in some of mitochondrial diseases, the methods of next generation sequencing come into focus. Examples of treatment are arginine supplementation in MELAS syndrome, ketogenic diet in pyruvate oxidation disorders or quinone analogs in patients with LHON. Conclusion: The clinical suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder is often delayed, or the disease remains undiagnosed. The correct diagnosis and adequate treatment can improve prognosis of the patient. Access to genetic counseling is also of great importance.

32552696	Late-onset MELAS syndrome with mtDNA 14453G A mutation masquerading as an acute encephalitis: a case report. BACKGROUND: A unique patient with MELAS syndrome, who initially masqueraded as having acute encephalitis and was eventually diagnosed with MELAS syndrome harboring a mtDNA 14453G   A mutation, is described. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old Japanese man was admitted to another hospital due to acute onset of cognitive impairment and psychosis. After 7 days he was transferred to our hospital with seizures and deteriorating psychosis. The results of primary ancillary tests that included EEG, CSF findings, and brain MRI supported the diagnosis of an acute encephalitis. HSV-DNA and antibodies against neuronal surface antigens in the CSF were all negative. With the assistance of the lactate peak on the brain lesions in the magnetic resonance spectroscopy image and genetic analysis of the biopsied muscle, he was eventually diagnosed with MELAS syndrome harboring mtDNA 14453G   A mutation in the ND6 gene. CONCLUSIONS: This case provides a caveat that MELAS syndrome can manifest in the symptoms and ancillary tests masquerading as an acute encephalitis caused by infection or autoimmunity. This is the first adult patient seen to harbor the mtDNA14453G   A with a unique onset, which broadens the phenotypic spectrum of MELAS syndrome associated with ND6 gene mutation.
30578099	Functional impairments, fatigue and quality of life in RYR1-related myopathies: A questionnaire study. Mutations in RYR1 are a common genetic cause of non-dystrophic neuromuscular disorders. To obtain baseline data concerning the prevalence of fatigue, the psychological disease burden and quality of life associated with these common conditions, we performed a questionnaire study. Seventy-two patients were included in this study, 33 with a congenital myopathy and 39 with malignant hyperthermia or exertional rhabdomyolysis. Our results showed that patients with RYR1-related myopathies have more functional impairments and significant chronic fatigue compared to healthy controls, with almost half of patients being severely fatigued. Whilst fatigue, pain and associated physical and social difficulties were more pronounced in those with permanent phenotypes, individuals with intermittent phenotypes also scored higher in all relevant categories compared to healthy controls. These findings indicate that RYR1-related myopathies, despite being often considered relatively mild conditions, are nevertheless associated with severe fatigue and functional limitations, resulting in substantial loss of quality of life. Moreover, milder but in essence similar findings in patients with RYR1-related malignant hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis suggest that those phenotypes are not truly episodic but in fact associated with a substantial permanent disease burden. These preliminary data should help to design more comprehensive quality of life studies to inform standards of care.
10459125	Skin manifestations of a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS syndrome). Skin abnormalities in a patient with newly diagnosed MELAS syndrome are reported. He presented with scaly, pruritic, diffuse erythema with reticular pigmentation on his entire body. Moderate hypertrichosis was also noted on the lower extremities. Thickened arrector muscles with longitudinal and cross sections were seen in the dermis. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA in a biopsy specimen from the biceps brachii disclosed the presence of an A-to-G point mutation at nucleotide pair 3243. Electron microscopy revealed marked increase in the number of morphologically abnormal mitochondria in the arrector muscles of the involved skin. This is the first report of a MELAS syndrome patient with skin manifestations and evidence of morphologically abnormal mitochondria.
26214044	Analysis of Mitochondrial Network Morphology in Cultured Myoblasts from Patients with Mitochondrial Disorders. Mitochondrial morphology was studied in cultivated myoblasts obtained from patients with mitochondrial disorders, including CPEO, MELAS and TMEM70 deficiency. Mitochondrial networks and ultrastructure were visualized by fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. A heterogeneous picture of abnormally sized and shaped mitochondria with fragmentation, shortening, and aberrant cristae, lower density of mitochondria and an increased number of "megamitochondria" were found in patient myoblasts. Morphometric Fiji analyses revealed different mitochondrial network properties in myoblasts from patients and controls. The small number of cultivated myoblasts required for semiautomatic morphometric image analysis makes this tool useful for estimating mitochondrial disturbances in patients with mitochondrial disorders. 
11318493	The Finnish speech-in-noise test in MELAS mutation and other sensorineural hearing impairments. A computerized adaptive Finnish speech-in-noise test has recently been developed. The purpose of the present study was to measure speech recognition thresholds in noise (SRTN) in patients with sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) caused by mitochondrial mutation [mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)] and in patients with SNHI from other causes and to compare them with those in normal hearing controls. SRTN differed significantly between controls and the patients with SNHI from other causes and between controls and the MELAS group, but not between SNHI patients and the MELAS group. Hearing in a noisy environment seems to be as impaired in MELAS patients as in patients with SNHI from other causes, in spite of the possible coexisting defects in the central nervous system.
9868317	[Exercises on a bicycle ergometer in a family of diabetes mellitus associated with a mutation of mitochondrial DNA]. The serum pyruvate and lactate levels were studied after exercise on a bicycle ergometer in a family of diabetes mellitus (DM) associated with a mutation at nucleotide 3243 in the mitochondrial gene. A 56-year-old Japanese woman with the mutation at a percentage of 5% in the blood had insulin-dependent DM and sensory hearing loss without muscle symptoms. Her serum lactate and pyruvate levels increased markedly during and after exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Two of her sons were found to have the same mutation at a percentage of 17% and 18%, respectively. Her 26-year-old son was found to have borderline DM after oral glucose loading, although he showed no abnormalities of the metabolism of pyruvate and lactate. Her 31-year-old son showed no abnormalities after oral glucose loading and after exercise on a bicycle ergometer. Although the same mutation causes more severe MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes), little is known about whether these diabetic patients are subclinically involved with myopathy. The noninvasive ergometer exercise with determination of serum pyruvate and lactate may be useful in evaluating the severity of myopathy in these patients.
19460295	PET imaging of redox and energy states in stroke-like episodes of MELAS. In stroke-like episodes of patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), changes in oxidative stress and glucose metabolism and their sequence remain obscure. We developed a novel double imaging method using positron emission tomography (PET) with [(62)Cu]-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((62)Cu-ATSM) and [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)FDG) to visualize the regional oxidative stress, glucose metabolism and blood flow in brain lesions of stroke-like episodes non-invasively and rapidly. These PET imagings were performed on a MELAS patient with stroke-like lesions, and clearly demonstrated that oxidative stress following hyperemia along with increased glucose metabolism plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of MELAS stroke-like episodes.
16091539	MR diffusion tensor imaging, fiber tracking, and single-voxel spectroscopy findings in an unusual MELAS case. A 23-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit for respiratory failure, global lower and upper limb palsy, and higher cognitive function deterioration. Imaging, performed with a combination of the MR diffusion tensor imaging, fiber tracking, and MR spectroscopy, suggested the diagnosis of an acute severe unusual mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike event, which was confirmed by muscle biopsy, but fiber tracking showed unexpected unaltered white matter tracts.
22215554	Analysis of common mitochondrial DNA mutations by allele-specific oligonucleotide and Southern blot hybridization. Mitochondrial disorders are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. There are a set of recurrent point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that are responsible for common mitochondrial diseases, including MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes), MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers), LHON (Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy), NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa), and Leigh syndrome. Most of the pathogenic mtDNA point mutations are present in the heteroplasmic state, meaning that the wild-type and mutant-containing mtDNA molecules are coexisting. Clinical heterogeneity may be due to the degree of mutant load (heteroplasmy) and distribution of heteroplasmic mutations in affected tissues. Additionally, Kearns-Sayre syndrome and Pearson syndrome are caused by large mtDNA deletions. In this chapter, we describe a multiplex PCR/allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization method for the screening of 13 common point mutations. This method allows the detection of low percentage of mutant heteroplasmy. In addition, a nonradioactive Southern blot hybridization protocol for the analysis of mtDNA large deletions is also described.

10029259	Serial electroencephalographic findings in patients with MELAS. To clarify the electroencephalographic characteristics of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS), the medical records and electroencephalograms of six patients with MELAS and two of their relatives with MELA (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, and lactic acidosis, without strokelike episodes) were retrospectively reviewed. All have a point mutation in the mitochondrial DNA at nucleotide position 3243. The electroencephalograms (n = 79) were divided into four groups according to the time relation to the strokelike episode: (1) before the first strokelike episode, (2) within 5 days after the strokelike episode (acute stage), (3) between 6 days and 1 month after the strokelike episode (subacute stage), and (4) more than 1 month after the strokelike episode (chronic stage). In the acute stage, 10 of the 11 electroencephalograms (9 strokelike episodes in four patients) revealed focal high-voltage delta waves with polyspikes (FHDPS), which were recognized as ictal electroencephalogram. Ictal events during FHDPS included focal clonic or myoclonic seizure and migrainous headache. In the subacute and chronic stages, focal spikes or sharp waves and 14- and 6-Hz positive bursts were frequently recorded. The authors' results suggest that FHDPSs present a reliable and accurate indicator of a strokelike episode in patients with MELAS.
30248691	[Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches for Mitochondrial Diseases]. Mitochondrial diseases (MD) represent a heterogenous group of disorders and syndromes caused either by mutations of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or the nuclear DNA (nDNA). They belong to the most frequent neurogenetic diseases. The spectrum of clinical manifestations is very broad ranging from mild subclinical presentations to rapidly progressive debilitating conditions with reduced life expectancy. Mitochondrial dysfunction can affect any organ of the body; the clinical presentation is often most severe in tissues with high energy demands. The most common MD are Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS), Mitochondrial Myopathy (MM) and Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Strokelike episodes (MELAS). In the last couple of years, genetics have become more and more important for the diagnosis of MD. The majority of syndromes presents with a characteristic combination of clinical and laboratory findings which should guide the selection of tissues (blood cells, fibroblasts, urothelial cells or muscle) and methods for targeted genetic testing. Therapeutic approaches to MD include pharmacological stimulation of mitochondrial metabolism, supplementation, symptomatic treatment, assistive devices and physiotherapy. Moreover, strict anti-epileptic therapy and treatment or prevention of stroke-like episodes are very important to prevent complications. In contrast, some medication should be avoided for its direct or indirect depressing effect on mitochondrial function. This article provides an introduction to mitochondrial diseases, an overview of the most common syndromes and an update on established and new therapeutic approaches.
30138712	Different mitochondrial genetic defects exhibit the same protein signature of metabolism in skeletal muscle of PEO and MELAS patients: A role for oxidative stress. A major challenge in mitochondrial diseases (MDs) is the identification of biomarkers that could inform of the mechanisms involved in the phenotypic expression of genetic defects. Herein, we have investigated the protein signature of metabolism and of the antioxidant response in muscle biopsies of clinically and genetically diagnosed patients with Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia due to single large-scale (PEO-sD) or multiple (PEO-mD) deletions of mtDNA and Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episode (MELAS) syndrome, and healthy donors. A high-throughput immunoassay technique that quantitates the expression of relevant proteins of glycolysis, glycogenolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate and fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and the antioxidant response in two large independent and retrospectively collected cohorts of PEO-sD, PEO-mD and MELAS patients revealed that despite the heterogeneity of the genetic alterations, the three MDs showed the same metabolic signatures in both cohorts of patients, which were highly divergent from those of healthy individuals. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine classifier provided a minimum of four biomarkers to discriminate healthy from pathological samples. Regardless of the induction of a large number of enzymes involved in ameliorating oxidative stress, the down-regulation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and catalase expression favored the accumulation of oxidative damage in patients' proteins. Down-regulation of SOD2 and catalase expression in MD patients is not due to relevant changes in the availability of their mRNAs, suggesting that oxidative stress regulates the expression of the two enzymes post-transcriptionally. We suggest that SOD2 and catalase could provide specific targets to improve the detoxification of reactive oxygen species that affects muscle proteins in these patients.
38146643	The split apparent diffusion coefficient sign: A novel magnetic resonance imaging biomarker for cortical pathology with possible implications in autoimmune encephalitis. INTRODUCTION: MRI is the imaging modality of choice for assessing patients with encephalopathy. In this context, we discuss a novel biomarker, the "split ADC sign," where the cerebral cortex demonstrates restricted diffusion (high DWI signal and low ADC) and the underlying white matter demonstrates facilitated diffusion (high or low DWI signal and high ADC). We hypothesize that this sign can be used as a biomarker to suggest either acute encephalitis onset or to raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-text radiological information system search of radiological reports was performed for all entities known to produce restricted diffusion in the cortex excluding stroke between January 2012 and June 2022. Initial MRI studies performed upon onset of clinical symptoms were screened for the split ADC sign. RESULTS: 25 subjects were encountered with a positive split ADC sign (15 female; median age = 57 years, range 18-82). Diagnosis included six herpes simplex encephalitis, three peri-ictal MRI changes, eight PRES, two MELAS, and six autoimmune (3 anti-GABAAR, two seronegative, and one anti-Ma2/Ta). Subjects were imaged at a mean 1.8 days after the onset of symptoms (range 0-8). DISCUSSION: We present a novel visual MRI biomarker, the split ADC sign, and highlight its potential usefulness in subjects with encephalopathy to suggest acute disease onset or to raise the possibility of an autoimmune etiology when location-based criteria are applied. When positive, the sign was present on the initial MRI and can therefore be used to help focus further clinical and laboratory workup.

12832349	High degree of mitochondrial 3243 mutation in gastric biopsy specimen in a patient with MELAS and diabetes complicated by marked gastrointestinal abnormalities. 
23062409	MR evaluation of cerebral oxygen metabolism and blood flow in stroke-like episodes of MELAS. Metabolic information is essential in the investigation of the pathophysiology of stroke-like episodes in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Here, we used magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the dynamic metabolic changes before and after a stroke-like episode in two patients with MELAS caused by the mitochondrial DNA mutation A3243G. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging, including arterial spin labeling and oxygen extraction fraction imaging, and generated cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction maps. We recruited eight healthy volunteers to define the normal range of the oxygen extraction fraction. We detected a heterogeneous reduction in the oxygen extraction fraction in the brain in the interictal period as well as at the onset of a stroke-like attack. However, the oxygen extraction fraction in the stroke-like lesions normalized in the acute stage. The stroke-like lesions showed consistent hyperperfusion in the acute phase but hypoperfusion in the chronic phase. We have demonstrated the utility of using new magnetic resonance imaging techniques in the evaluation of the pathophysiology of stroke-like lesions. The increased utilization of oxygen in an acute lesion is a novel finding in our study, which might play a role in the oxidative stress.
30535308	Cardiomyopathy associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. 
17515762	FDG-PET imaging in the investigation of homonymous hemianopia in a patient with MELAS syndrome. 
12005255	MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome in a family with A3243G mtDNA mutation. Four members of a family were found to carry the A3243G mtDNA mutation. Clinical features varied from typical MELAS to myoclonic epilepsy to simple deafness without neurological signs. Several other members of the family had symptoms consistent with a mitochondrial disease. Muscle biopsy in 3 of the 4 patients showed the most prominent mitochondrial alterations with partial deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase in the case with the mildest phenotype. Mitochondrial DNA analysis detected a variable percentage of A3243G mutation, roughly correlating with the phenotype. The interesting feature of the family lies in the great intrafamilial variability of the severity of clinical expression, encompassing MELAS and MERRF features, associated with the A3243G mtDNA mutation. A search for the most common mtDNA mutations is recommended in all patients featuring incomplete MELAS or MERRF syndromes and in all familial cases presenting minimal clinical signs.
19780807	Management of mitochondrial stroke-like-episodes. Aim of this review is to discuss recent findings concerning the management of stroke-like episodes (SLEs) in patients with mitochondrial disorders (MIDs). Various databases were searched for appropriate literature. SLEs are a dominant feature of MIDs and occur most frequently in MELAS-syndrome, less frequently in MERRF-syndrome, Kearns-Sayre-syndrome, or Leigh-syndrome. SLEs occur at all ages and are frequently accompanied by other cerebral abnormalities. Clinically, SLEs mimic ischemic stroke but not on imaging studies and concerning the management. The morphological equivalent on MRI is the stroke-like-lesion, representing a vasogenic edema (hyperintensity on T2, diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient in the acute and subacute or chronic stage, most frequently in the parieto-occipital region, surpassing vascular territories). For diagnostic and therapeutic reasons SLEs need to be clearly delineated from ischemic stroke and cerebral bleeding. Though there is no causal therapy available, symptomatic and general measures can help to resolve the clinical manifestations. In conclusion this review shows that SLEs are a dominant feature of some syndromic or non-syndromic MIDs. The most effective strategy for the treatment of SLEs appears to be the application of L-arginine, coenzyme-Q, steroids, edaravone, creatine-monohydrate, or dichloracetate.
10995506	Single-fiber PCR in MELAS(3243) patients: correlations between intratissue distribution and phenotypic expression of the mtDNA(A3243G) genotype. We performed morphological, biochemical, and genetic studies, including single-fiber PCR (sf PCR), on muscle biopsies obtained from a mother and daughter with MELAS syndrome due to the A3243G transition of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The severity of muscle involvement appeared quite distinct, in spite of the fact that both patients segregated similar mutant mtDNA levels on total muscle DNA. The daughter did not show any clinical muscle involvement: muscle biopsy revealed many ragged red fibers (RRFs) mostly positive for cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) activity. In contrast, her mother had developed a generalized myopathy without progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), morphologically characterized by many COX-negative RRFs. Single-muscle fiber PCR demonstrated in both patients significantly higher percentages of wild-type mtDNA in normal fibers (daughter: 23.25 +/- 15.22; mother: 43.13 +/- 26.11) than in COX-positive RRFs (daughter: 11.25 +/- 5.22, P < 0.005; mother: 9.12 +/- 5.9, P < 0.001) and in COX-negative RRFs (daughter: 8.9 +/- 4.2, P < 0.001 mother: 4.8 +/- 2.8, P < 0.001). Wild-type mtDNA levels resulted higher also in COX-positive vs. COX-negative RRFs (daughter: P < 0.05; mother: P < 0.001). Our data confirm a direct correlation between A3243G levels and impairment of COX function at the single-muscle fiber level. Moreover, the evidence of a clinical myopathy in the patient with higher amounts of COX-negative RRFs bolsters the concept that a differential distribution of mutant mtDNAs at the cellular level may have effects on the clinical involvement of individual tissues. However, the occurrence of a similar morphological and biochemical muscle phenotype also in PEO(3243) patients suggests that other genetic factors involved in the interaction between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, rather than the stochastic distribution of mtDNA genomes during embryogenesis, are primarily implicated in determining the various clinical expressions of the A3243G of mtDNA.
24792485	Perspectives of drug-based neuroprotection targeting mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in most neurodegenerative diseases. These anomalies include bioenergetic defect, respiratory chain-induced oxidative stress, defects of mitochondrial dynamics, increase sensitivity to apoptosis, and accumulation of damaged mitochondria with instable mitochondrial DNA. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited mitochondrial disorders but most have no effective therapies. The development of new metabolic treatments will be useful not only for rare mitochondrial disorders but also for the wide spectrum of common age-related neurodegenerative diseases shown to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. A better understanding of the mitochondrial regulating pathways raised several promising perspectives of neuroprotection. This review focuses on the pharmacological approaches to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis, the removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy, scavenging free radicals and also dietary measures such as ketogenic diet.
22270878	Classical MERRF phenotype associated with mitochondrial tRNA(Leu) (m.3243A>G) mutation. Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres (MERRF) and mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are established phenotypes of mitochondrial encephalopathies. Nearly all patients affected by MERRF harbour a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) gene. We report a 13-year-old patient who presented with the classical phenotype of MERRF but was found with the typical mutation of MELAS. The patient presented with myoclonic epilepsy beginning at 10 years of age, a muscle biopsy with ragged red fibres and some COX negative fibres and progressive bilateral MRI hyperintensitivities in the basal ganglia constituting MERRF syndrome but lacked clinical characteristics of MELAS. In particular, stroke-like episodes or lactic acidosis were not present. None of the tRNA mutations described in MERRF were found. However, further analyses showed the tRNA(Leu) mutation m.3243A>G usually found in MELAS to be responsible for the condition in this patient. This report highlights the broad phenotypic variability of mitochondrial encephalopathies with juvenile onset. It shows that m.3243A>G mutations can cause classical MERRF and emphasises the significance of comprehensive genetic studies if mitochondrial disease is suspected clinically.
10071173	Tissue mosaicism in the skeletal muscle and sural nerve biopsies in the MELAS syndrome. We describe a clinically full-blown MELAS patient, who had an A3243G point mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in muscle and blood cells, and his family members. From the proband two muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were analysed; one had typical ragged red fibers and focal cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and the other was completely normal. He also had a peripheral neuropathy confirmed by nerve conduction velocity and sural nerve biopsy studies. Axonal degeneration, relative loss of large myelinated fibers and paracrystalline inclusion bodies in the Schwann cells were noted. Intriguingly, the A3243G mutation of mtDNA was not found in the sural nerve biopsy. Therefore, we conclude that tissue mosaicism is present in the muscle fibers and that the mtDNA mutation may not be detected in the nerve involved as proved by pathology. We also suggest that the involvement of specific tissues in patients with mitochondrial diseases should be further determined by single fiber mtDNA analysis.
24100263	Localization of exogenous DNA to mitochondria in skeletal muscle following hydrodynamic limb vein injection. Mitochondrial genetic disorders are a major cause of mitochondrial diseases. It is therefore likely that mitochondrial gene therapy will be useful for the treatment of such diseases. Here, we report on the possibility of mitochondrial gene delivery in skeletal muscle using hydrodynamic limb vein (HLV) injection. The HLV injection procedure, a useful method for transgene expression in skeletal muscle, involves the rapid injection of a large volume of naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) into the distal vein of a limb. We hypothesized that the technique could be used to deliver pDNA not only to nuclei but also to mitochondria, since cytosolic pDNA that is internalized by the method may be able to overcome mitochondrial membrane. We determined if pDNA could be delivered to myofibrillar mitochondria by HLV injection by PCR analysis. Mitochondrial toxicity assays showed that the HLV injection had no influence on mitochondrial function. These findings indicate that HLV injection promises to be a useful technique for in vivo mitochondrial gene delivery. 
27558483	Distinctive distribution of brain volume reductions in MELAS and mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation carriers: A voxel-based morphometric study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinically latent brain atrophy of patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) harboring a mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation (A3243G) and A3243G carriers without stroke-like episodes (SEs). METHODS: We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with magnetic resonance imaging to investigate gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume reductions in four MELAS patients and in five A3243G carriers compared to 16 healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the regions of previous SEs using conventional MRI. RESULTS: All four MELAS patients showed significant GM volume reductions in the left superior parietal lobule (SPL), right precuneus, right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and bilateral posterior lobes of the cerebellum. These areas of GM volume reduction were beyond the regions of previous SEs. As for A3243G carriers, GM volume reductions in the left SPL, right precuneus, right MTG, and bilateral posterior lobes of the cerebellum were detected in three, one, two, and five subjects, respectively. All four MELAS patients showed significant WM volume reductions in the bilateral or unilateral temporal sub-gyral regions, which were included in the regions of previous SEs. No A3243G carriers showed WM volume reductions. CONCLUSION: The distribution patterns of GM volume reductions in VBM may reflect a common vulnerability of the brains among MELAS patients and A3243G carriers.
31268275	Perioperative management of patients with genetic multisystem diseases associated with pre-excitation. Pre-excitation is associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. Apart from the well-known Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a number of rare diseases are associated with pre-excitation due to the existence of accessory pathways. The present review aims to focus on anaesthesia and perioperative care of patients with rare genetic diseases associated with pre-excitation due to the existence of a bundle of Kent or other accessory pathways. The Danon disease, Fabry disease and Pompe disease, tuberous sclerosis, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), and mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome are genetic multisystem disorders which may involve pre-excitation, usually combined with cardiomyopathy. The anaesthetic management of the above syndromes may become quite challenging. We conducted a PubMed and manual literature search for all types of relevant publications; we identified 58 articles suitable to be included in the present review. According to the literature, a high index of suspicion for the possibility of pre-excitation is required, and anaesthetic drugs and adjuvants should be chosen carefully, in order to prevent or at least not facilitate arrhythmias associated with accessory pathways. The perioperative management should be further tailored to the specific abnormalities of each condition. Multidisciplinary consultation and care, according to the affected organs, are mandatory for a safe outcome. The anaesthetic plan should be focused on preoperative clinical optimization and on case-specific management, tailored to the various systems involved.

12112133	Bite performance in clariid fishes with hypertrophied jaw adductors as deduced by bite modeling. Within clariid fishes several cranial morphologies can be discerned. Especially within anguilliform representatives an increase in the degree of hypertrophy of the jaw adductors occurs. The hypertrophy of the jaw adductors and skeletal modifications in the cranial elements have been linked to increased bite force. The functional significance of this supposed increase in bite force remains obscure. In this study, biomechanical modeling of the cranial apparatus in four clariid representatives showing a gradual increase in the hypertrophy of the jaw adductors (Clarias gariepinus, Clariallabes melas, Channallabes apus, and Gymnallabes typus) is used to investigate whether bite force actually increased. Static bite modeling shows that the apparent hypertrophy results in an increase in bite force. For a given head size, the largest bite forces are predicted for C. apus, the lowest ones for C. gariepinus, and intermediate values are calculated for the other species. In addition, also in absolute measures differences in bite force remain, with C. apus biting distinctly harder than C. gariepinus despite its smaller head size. This indicates that the hypertrophy of the jaw adductors is more than just a correlated response to the decrease in absolute head size. Further studies investigating the ecological relevance of this performance difference are needed.
11496620	[Anesthesia in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies]. A 6-year-old boy with a rare mitochondrial disease (MELAS: mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes) was presented to undergo adenoid resection and bilateral paracentesis. ENT surgery was performed without complications under general anaesthesia using propofol, fentanyl, and ventilation with nitrous oxide and oxygen. Routine intraoperative monitoring (ECG, noninvasive blood pressure, oxymetry and capnometry) was supplemented by frequent body temperature measurements and repeated laboratory analysis of venous blood gases, lactate, and glucose. Clinically, the postoperative course was uneventful and the boy was discharged from hospital on the first postoperative day. Signs or symptoms of malignant hyperthermia never occurred. Laboratory analysis only showed a remarkable serum lactate elevation postoperatively (6 mmol/l) which decreased on the first postoperative day (3.7 mmol/l). The present anaesthesiologic experiences with MELAS-syndrome are limited, and recommendations are mainly based on case reports. Careful preoperative physical examination with special regard to all available medical records, and anaesthetic management comparable with that in malignant hyperthermia susceptible resulted in an uneventful course in our patient. Pathogenetic aspects of mitochondrial diseases focussing on anaesthetic considerations are briefly discussed.
10651025	MELAS with the mitochondrial DNA 3243 point mutation: a neuropathological study. We performed a neuropathological examination of the central nervous system from seven autopsied patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Five of the seven cases were confirmed to have the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 3243 point mutation. In addition to the changes reported previously, diffuse atrophy of the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, diffuse gliosis of cerebral and cerebellar white matter, and cactus formation of Purkinje cells were observed. Electron microscopy revealed accumulation of mitochondria in the cactus formations. These lesions are common in MELAS with the mtDNA 3243 point mutation, but cannot be explained solely by mitochondrial angiopathy, and suggest that intrinsic mitochondrial malfunction contributes to neuronal damage in MELAS pathology. Moreover, the pathological changes observed in the cerebellum suggest that cerebellar function should be evaluated more carefully at the clinical level.
33541179	Multimodal imaging analysis of macular dystrophy in patient with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) with m.3243A>G mutation. Purpose: Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) is caused by a heteroplasmic m.3243A>G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA. The main ocular feature in MIDD is macular dystrophy. The purpose of this study was to identify the phenotypical characteristics of a patient with MIDD by multimodal high-resolution imaging analyses.Methods: A detailed history and ophthalmic examination were performed on a 39-year-old patient with MIDD. Multi-modal imaging included fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, OCT-angiography, and adaptive optics imaging. The PCR-invader and whole exome sequencing (WES) methods were performed on the DNA of the patient.Results: A 39-year-old woman with sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus presented with atrophic perifoveal changes and MIDD was suspected. The PCR-invader and WES methods showed that the patient had a m.3243A>G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA with 29% and 16.7% of the heteroplasmy in the peripheral blood, respectively. Morphological analyses revealed that the areas of photoreceptor degeneration and chorioretinal atrophy were present mainly in the perifoveal region. Multifocal ERGs showed that the perifoveal responses were reduced. Goldmann visual field was significant for a cecocentral scotoma in the right eye and an enlarged blind spot in the left eye. The central isopter was constricted bilaterally. The results of high-resolution retinal imaging by AO revealed that the densities of the cone photoreceptor were significantly reduced in the fovea where no obvious atrophy of the RPE and choroid was observed.Conclusions: Our findings indicate that WES analysis can be used to detect the m.3243A>G mutation in the mtDNA. The results of multimodal imaging analyses indicated that the primary dysfunction of the photoreceptors in the fovea might precede the dysfunction of the RPE in patient with MIDD.
27088853	Comparative Chromosome Map and Heterochromatin Features of the Gray Whale Karyotype (Cetacea). Cetacean karyotypes possess exceptionally stable diploid numbers and highly conserved chromosomes. To date, only toothed whales (Odontoceti) have been analyzed by comparative chromosome painting. Here, we studied the karyotype of a representative of baleen whales, the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus, Mysticeti), by Zoo-FISH with dromedary camel and human chromosome-specific probes. We confirmed a high degree of karyotype conservation and found an identical order of syntenic segments in both branches of cetaceans. Yet, whale chromosomes harbor variable heterochromatic regions constituting up to a third of the genome due to the presence of several types of repeats. To investigate the cause of this variability, several classes of repeated DNA sequences were mapped onto chromosomes of whale species from both Mysticeti and Odontoceti. We uncovered extensive intrapopulation variability in the size of heterochromatic blocks present in homologous chromosomes among 3 individuals of the gray whale by 2-step differential chromosome staining. We show that some of the heteromorphisms observed in the gray whale karyotype are due to distinct amplification of a complex of common cetacean repeat and heavy satellite repeat on homologous autosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate localization of the telomeric repeat in the heterochromatin of both gray and pilot whale (Globicephala melas, Odontoceti). Heterochromatic blocks in the pilot whale represent a composite of telomeric and common repeats, while heavy satellite repeat is lacking in the toothed whale consistent with previous studies. 
23536165	MELAS syndrome diagnosed in ICU in a 56-year-old patient presenting with status epilepticus. 
11217487	[Eye diseases in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies]. Mitochondria are the principal site of generation of energy in form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). They contain the enzymes of the Krebs and fatty acid cycles and the respiratory pathway. Ocular tissues with high energy consumption and dependence on oxidative energy production like the optic nerve, the retina, and the pigment epithelium are often involved in mitochondrial diseases. This article reviews the genetic mitochondrial diseases involving the visual system. Their most important ocular findings include: acute or slowly progressive bilateral visual loss and visual field loss due to an optic neuropathy or retinal degeneration, bilateral progressive decreased ocular motility, and bilateral upper lid ptosis. The following diseases are discussed: Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON); Kearns-Sayre Syndrom (KSS); Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO); Autosomal Recessive Cardiomyopathy, Ophthalmoplegia (ARCO); Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, Stroke-Like Episodes (MELAS); Neuropathy, Ataxia, Retinitis Pigmentosa (NARP); Mitochondrial Neuropathy, Gastro-Intestinal Encephalomyopathy (MNGIE); Myoclonus Epilepsy, Ragged-Red-Fibers (MERRF); Wilson's disease; Friedreich's ataxia. Diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies is established by screening for mutations in blood or muscle biopsy samples. No specific therapies which influence the course of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are known. Drugs interacting with the mitochondria function, alcohol consumption and smoking should be avoided.
25656553	Immune challenges trigger cellular and humoral responses in adults of Pterostichus melas italicus (Coleoptera, Carabidae). The present study focuses on the ability of Pterostichus melas italicus Dejean to mount cellular and humoral immune responses against invading pathogens. Ultrastructural analyses revealed the presence of five morphologically distinct types of hemocytes: prohemocytes, plasmatocytes, granulocytes, oenocytoids and macrophage-like cells. Differential hemocyte counts showed that plasmatocytes and granulocytes were the most abundant circulating cell types and plasmatocytes exhibited phagocytic activity following the latex bead immune challenge. Macrophage-like cells were recruited after the immune challenge to remove exhausted phagocytizing cells, apoptotic cells and melanotic capsules formed to immobilize the latex beads. Total hemocyte counts showed a significant reduction of hemocytes after latex bead treatment. Phenoloxidase (PO) assays revealed an increase of total PO in hemolymph after immune system activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, the LPS-stimulated hemocytes showed increased protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, indicating that the cytotoxic action of nitric oxide was engaged in this antimicrobial collaborative response. These results provide a knowledge base for further studies on the sensitivity of the P. melas italicus immune system to the environmental perturbation in order to evaluate the effect of chemicals on non-target species in agroecosystems.
15660201	A pilot study of mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G in a sample of Croatian patients having type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with maternal inheritance. In this work, patients having type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic mothers were tested for the presence of mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G. This mutation is associated with the MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes), diabetes and deafness. Twenty-two diabetic persons were screened. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from swabs of oral mucosa. The mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G was detected using PCR-RFLP test. The mutation was detected in oral mucosal DNA of two patients (but not from lymphocyte DNA). One patient was a man with hearing and visual impairments and proteinuria; the other was a woman having proteinuria but no hearing impairment. The mutation was not detectable in oral mucosal DNA from the control persons: 20 diabetic patients having diabetic fathers and 22 healthy, nondiabetic volunteers. The incidence of mitochondrial DNA point mutation A3243G in this study of Croatian diabetic patients is in line with data in the literature.
28506302	Quantification of gait in mitochondrial m.3243A > G patients: a validation study. BACKGROUND: More than half of the patients harbouring the m.3243A > G mutation were found to have trouble maintaining balance when walking in a recent study by our group. Others demonstrated that these patients had an abnormal gait pattern, as quantified by gait analysis. Gait analysis is an emerging method to quantify subtle changes in walking pattern, also during therapeutic interventions. Therefore, we aimed to test the reliability and reproducibility of gait analysis and select the most suitable protocol for this group of patients using a GAITRite electronic walkway. Four different protocols were tested: normal walking, dual task, post exercise and after a ten minutes of rest. RESULTS: In total 36 patients with the m.3243A > G mutation and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Overall high intra class correlation coefficients were found in all experimental conditions for both patients and healthy controls indicating good reproducibility. Marked differences in gait between patients and controls were observed and were in line with the only available exploratory study performed. There was a good correlation between both the overall NMDAS score, NMDAS subscale scores, both markers for disease severity, and specific gait parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The observed reliability of the test makes GAITRite a suitable instrument for intervention studies in patients with mitochondrial disease.
24417855	MELAS syndrome presenting as an acute surgical abdomen. MELAS (mitochondrial cytopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a syndrome in which signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal disease are uncommon if not rare. We describe the case of a young woman who presented as an acute surgical emergency, diagnosed as toxic megacolon necessitating an emergency total colectomy. MELAS syndrome was suspected postoperatively owing to persistent lactic acidosis and neurological symptoms. The diagnosis was later confirmed with histological and genetic studies. This case highlights the difficulties in diagnosing MELAS because of its unpredictable presentation and clinical course. We therefore recommend a high index of suspicion in cases of an acute surgical abdomen with additional neurological features or raised lactate. 
12012084	Apoptosis is suspended in muscle of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Over the past few years, many studies have been done on the apoptotic involvement in muscle fiber degeneration in various myopathies, but the occurrence of apoptosis in muscles of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies is still controversial. To confirm whether apoptotic processes are truly related to muscle fiber degeneration in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, we performed the TUNEL method not only at the light microscopic (LM) but also at the electron microscopic (EM) level for muscles of five MELAS, five CPEO and five MERRF patients and five control muscles. Immunohistochemical studies of Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome c, Apaf-1, activated caspase-3 and human inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP, and immunoblotting of Apaf-1 and XIAP were also carried out. In LM-TUNEL, MELAS, CPEO and MERRF patients had only very small numbers of TUNEL-positive myonuclei: 0.13+/-0.10%, 0.15+/-0.14% and 0.04+/-0.09%, respectively. Almost all of them were seen in ragged-red fibers (RRFs). EM-TUNEL showed no significant increase of DNA fragmentation in RRFs despite mild peripheral chromatin condensation. However, Bax and Apaf-1 expression and cytochrome c release from mitochondria were seen in RRFs. Caspase-3 activation was confirmed in 9.0+/-3.7%, 12.0+/-4.4% and 12.4+/-3.8% of RRFs in MELAS, CPEO and MERRF, respectively, but not in control muscles. Almost all RRFs showed sarcoplasmic expression of XIAP. Thus, there is a possibility that, although apoptotic reactions started in muscles of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, their execution is rarely completed. Sarcoplasmic expression of XIAP probably leads to the suspension of the apoptotic process in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.
18289816	Serial brain imaging analysis of stroke-like episodes in MELAS. We report 2 patients of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and consider the pathophysiology of stroke-like lesions, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on MRI, perfusion imaging on MRI, and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). In Patient 1, T2-weighted imaging (T2-WI) on MRI at onset and even at 44 days after onset of the stroke-like episode showed high intensity in left parietal, temporal, and occipital lobe lesions. In the temporal lobe lesion, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at 44 days after onset was higher (average: 1.219x10(-3)mm2/s) than that in a normal region (average: 0.796x10(-3)mm2/s). (1)H-MRS of the left parietal lobe lesion at the same day showed a decrease in N-acetylaspartate/(creatine+phosphocreatine) (NAA/Cr) (0.43) and a peak in lactate. 1H-MRS of the contralateral side at the same day showed NAA/Cr (1.57) and no peak in lactate. Thereafter, ADC gradually decreased and NAA/Cr gradually increased, and the peak in lactate disappeared in the lesion. In Patient 2, T2-WI at onset showed high intensity in bilateral occipital lobe lesions. In the left occipital lobe lesion, ADC at the same day was higher (1.082x10(-3)mm2/s) than that in a normal region (average: 0.841x10(-3)mm2/s). (1)H-MRS of the left occipital lobe lesion at the same day showed a decrease of NAA (3.0mM) and a peak in lactate (13.1mM) (measured by LCModel). In 1H-MRS of the normal left parietooccipital lobe at 4 months before onset, NAA was 7.6mM and there was no peak in lactate (0mM). Perfusion imaging at onset showed high intensity in bilateral occipital lobes, which indicated hyperperfusion in stroke-like lesions. Thereafter, ADC gradually decreased and the peak in lactate partially decreased, and the low concentration of NAA persisted (regardless of the partial recovery) in the lesion. These results suggest that the stroke-like episodes is related to vasogenic edema, hyperperfusion, and neuronal damage. Acute oxidative phosphorylation defect may have a crucial role in the pathophysiology of stroke-like episodes.
12240969	Changes in the olfactory mucosa of the black bullhead Ictalurus melas induced by exposure to sublethal concentrations of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate. The effects of exposure to sublethal concentrations (1.5 and 3 mg l(-1)) of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate on the olfactory epithelium of Ictalurus melas Rafinesque were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. The detergent affected the superficial part of each olfactory lamella and different morphological alterations, depending on dose and duration of treatment, were observed. The histology and surface morphology of sensory and non-sensory areas of the epithelium of fish treated with 1.5 mg l(-1) for 5 and 10 d were not affected by the treatment, while only an incipient thinning-out of the long cilia of non-sensory epithelium was seen in fish treated for 15 d. Treatment with 3 mg l(-1) caused morphological alterations, related to the time of exposure, in the non-sensory and sensory epithelium, consisting of progressive thinning of cellular projections; this treatment also increased mucus production. These observed histopathological changes in the olfactory mucosa may modify the olfactory perception of the fish, and could thereby impair important physiological functions such as feeding, social interactions or migration.
23177587	[Conventional and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and proton spectroscopy in MELAS]. INTRODUCTION: MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) is a mitochondrial hereditary dysfunction in which the physiopathological mechanism of cerebral lesions is not totally understood as yet. Typically, these lesions are described as having normal to increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and this has been used to distinguish stroke-like lesions from ischemic lesions. Notwithstanding this, within the last few years, there have been reports of diffusion restriction in stroke-like episodes. OBJECTIVES: Analysis of the diffusion characteristics on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over a 16 month period, on a patient with MELAS and stroke-like lesions, to investigate the controversial changes of the ADC, reported in the last years. Evaluation of the proton spectroscopy changes in stroke-like lesions and apparently spared brain. METHODS: We performed four serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including two stroke-like episodes, in a 28-year-old man with MELAS (mitochondrial DNA mutation A3243G). Qualitative analysis of the magnetic resonance images, including the single voxel spectroscopy and ADC maps, with analysis of evolution patterns of the last ones. RESULTS: Both MRI that were performed during those episodes of stroke-like lesion revealed areas of diffusion restriction, coexisting areas of high ADC. During the chronic phase, there was a regression of those changes. Proton spectroscopy showed the presence of lactate and reduction of N-acetyl aspartate peak in stroke-like lesion and the presence of lactate in apparently spared brain. CONCLUSIONS: All alterations that were recorded strengthen the view that cytotoxic oedema can occur in stroke-like lesions. Thus, their presence should not weaken the possibility of MELAS, especially if those lesions affect the temporal, parietal and/or occipital lobes, or if they predominantly involve the cortical gray matter, spanning vascular borders and if proton spectroscopy reveals lactate peak in the apparently spared brain.
35684429	Personalized Medicine in Mitochondrial Health and Disease: Molecular Basis of Therapeutic Approaches Based on Nutritional Supplements and Their Analogs. Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) may result from mutations affecting nuclear or mitochondrial genes, encoding mitochondrial proteins, or non-protein-coding mitochondrial RNA. Despite the great variability of affected genes, in the most severe cases, a neuromuscular and neurodegenerative phenotype is observed, and no specific therapy exists for a complete recovery from the disease. The most used treatments are symptomatic and based on the administration of antioxidant cocktails combined with antiepileptic/antipsychotic drugs and supportive therapy for multiorgan involvement. Nevertheless, the real utility of antioxidant cocktail treatments for patients affected by MDs still needs to be scientifically demonstrated. Unfortunately, clinical trials for antioxidant therapies using alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate, glutathione, riboflavin, niacin, acetyl-carnitine and coenzyme Q have met a limited success. Indeed, it would be expected that the employed antioxidants can only be effective if they are able to target the specific mechanism, i.e., involving the central and peripheral nervous system, responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. Noteworthily, very often the phenotypes characterizing MD patients are associated with mutations in proteins whose function does not depend on specific cofactors. Conversely, the administration of the antioxidant cocktails might determine the suppression of endogenous oxidants resulting in deleterious effects on cell viability and/or toxicity for patients. In order to avoid toxicity effects and before administering the antioxidant therapy, it might be useful to ascertain the blood serum levels of antioxidants and cofactors to be administered in MD patients. It would be also worthwhile to check the localization of mutations affecting proteins whose function should depend (less or more directly) on the cofactors to be administered, for estimating the real need and predicting the success of the proposed cofactor/antioxidant-based therapy.
22143423	Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) reveals characteristic pattern of myocardial damage in patients with mitochondrial myopathy. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial myopathy comprises various clinical subforms of neuromuscular disorders that are characterised by impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism due to dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. No comprehensive and targeted cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) studies have been performed so far in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The present study aimed at characterising cardiac disease manifestations in patients with mitochondrial myopathy and elucidating the in vivo cardiac damage pattern of patients with different subforms of mitochondrial disease by CMR studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective study, 37 patients with mitochondrial myopathy underwent comprehensive neurological and cardiac evaluations including physical examination, resting ECG and CMR. The CMR studies comprised cine-CMR, T2-weighted "edema" imaging and T1-weighted late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging. Various patterns and degrees of skeletal myopathy were present in the participants of this study, whereas clinical symptoms such as chest pain symptoms (in eight (22%) patients) and various degrees of dyspnea (in 16 (43%) patients) were less frequent. Pathological ECG findings were documented in eight (22%) patients. T2-weighted "edema" imaging was positive in one (3%) patient with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) only. LGE imaging demonstrated the presence of non-ischemic LGE in 12 (32%) patients: 10 out of 24 (42%) patients with CPEO (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia) or KSS (Kearns-Sayre syndrome) and 2 of 3 (67%) patients with MELAS were LGE positive. All 10 LGE-positive patients with CPEO or KSS demonstrated a potentially typical pattern of diffuse intramural LGE in the left-ventricular (LV) inferolateral segments. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac involvement is a frequent finding in patients with mitochondrial myopathy. A potentially characteristic pattern of diffuse intramural LGE in the LV inferolateral segments was identified in patients suffering from the subforms CPEO or KSS.
36905963	Genetic aberration analysis of mitochondrial respiratory complex I implications in the development of neurological disorders and their clinical significance. Growing neurological diseases pose difficult challenges for modern medicine to diagnose and manage them effectively. Many neurological disorders mainly occur due to genetic alteration in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, mitochondrial genes exhibit a higher rate of mutation due to the generation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative phosphorylation operating in their vicinity. Among the different complexes of Electron transport chain (ETC), NADH: Ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Mitochondrial complex I) is the most important. This multimeric enzyme, composed of 44 subunits, is encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. It often exhibits mutations resulting in development of various neurological diseases. The most prominent diseases include leigh syndrome (LS), leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), myoclonic epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preliminary data suggest that mitochondrial complex I subunit genes mutated are frequently of nuclear origin; however, most of the mtDNA gene encoding subunits are also primarily involved. In this review, we have discussed the genetic origins of neurological disorders involving mitochondrial complex I and signified recent approaches to unravel the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials and their management.

32464279	Mitochondrial migraine; a prevalence, impact and treatment efficacy cohort study. Mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction may be predisposing for the development of migraine, reflected in high migraine prevalence in patients with mitochondrial disease. Prevalence and impact of migraine in patients with proven mitochondrial disease and the current treatment efficacy were studied using online questionnaires. Patients were selected at the Internal Medicine Department. Headache was reported by 34 (55%) out of 62 patients. Migraine-criteria were met by 85% of them. Efficacy of migraine treatment was achieved in 4 patients. Given the high prevalence of migraine and current treatment insufficiency, migraine is a major threat of quality of life patients with mitochondrial disease.

29868447	Anatomic & metabolic brain markers of the m.3243A>G mutation: A multi-parametric 7T MRI study. One of the most common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, the A to G transition at base pair 3243, has been linked to changes in the brain, in addition to commonly observed hearing problems, diabetes and myopathy. However, a detailed quantitative description of m.3243A>G patients' brains has not been provided so far. In this study, ultra-high field MRI at 7T and volume- and surface-based data analyses approaches were used to highlight morphology (i.e. atrophy)-, microstructure (i.e. myelin and iron concentration)- and metabolism (i.e. cerebral blood flow)-related differences between patients (N = 22) and healthy controls (N = 15). The use of quantitative MRI at 7T allowed us to detect subtle changes of biophysical processes in the brain with high accuracy and sensitivity, in addition to typically assessed lesions and atrophy. Furthermore, the effect of m.3243A>G mutation load in blood and urine epithelial cells on these MRI measures was assessed within the patient population and revealed that blood levels were most indicative of the brain's state and disease severity, based on MRI as well as on neuropsychological data. Morphometry MRI data showed a wide-spread reduction of cortical, subcortical and cerebellar gray matter volume, in addition to significantly enlarged ventricles. Moreover, surface-based analyses revealed brain area-specific changes in cortical thickness (e.g. of the auditory cortex), and in T1, T2* and cerebral blood flow as a function of mutation load, which can be linked to typically m.3243A>G-related clinical symptoms (e.g. hearing impairment). In addition, several regions linked to attentional control (e.g. middle frontal gyrus), the sensorimotor network (e.g. banks of central sulcus) and the default mode network (e.g. precuneus) were characterized by alterations in cortical thickness, T1, T2* and/or cerebral blood flow, which has not been described in previous MRI studies. Finally, several hypotheses, based either on vascular, metabolic or astroglial implications of the m.3243A>G mutation, are discussed that potentially explain the underlying pathobiology. To conclude, this is the first 7T and also the largest MRI study on this patient population that provides macroscopic brain correlates of the m.3243A>G mutation indicating potential MRI biomarkers of mitochondrial diseases and might guide future (longitudinal) studies to extensively track neuropathological and clinical changes.
24069936	Childhood mitochondrial encephalomyopathies: clinical course, diagnosis, neuroimaging findings, mtDNA mutations and outcome in six children. Mitochondrial dysfunction manifests in many forms during childhood. There is no effective therapy for the condition; hence symptomatic therapy is the only option. The effect of symptomatic therapy are not well known. We present clinical course, diagnosis and effect of current treatments for six children suffering from mitochondrial encephalomyopathy identified by clinical demonstrations, brain MRI findings and DNA mutations. Two were male and four were female. Their age ranged between 2 and 17 years. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained in three and one showed misshaped and enlarged mitochondria under electron microscope. mtDNA mutation frequency was >30%. Five children were diagnosed with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) and one with Leigh's syndrome (LS). All were given cocktail and symptomatic treatments. One of the five MELAS children died from severe complications. The other four MELAS children remain alive; four showed improvement, and one remained unresponsive. Of the four who showed improvement, two do not have any abnormal signs and the other two have some degree of motor developmental delay and myotrophy. The LS child is doing well except for ataxia. Until better therapy such as mitochondrial gene therapy is available, cocktail and symptomatic treatments could at least stabilize these children.
20924741	[Metabolic disorders with typical alterations in MRI]. The classification of metabolic disorders according to the etiology is not practical for neuroradiological purposes because the underlying defect does not uniformly transform into morphological characteristics. Therefore typical MR and clinical features of some easily identifiable metabolic disorders are presented. Canavan disease, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Alexander disease, X-chromosomal adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy, mitochondrial disorders, such as MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) and Leigh syndrome as well as L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria are presented.
12910360	MELAS: clinical phenotype and morphological brain abnormalities. We describe the clinical and neuropathological findings of three unrelated autopsy cases of MELAS harboring the A3243G transition in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Using immunohistochemical techniques, we studied the expression of several subunits of the respiratory chain in various brain regions from the same cases. In all three cases there was a reduced immunocytochemical staining for mtDNA-encoded subunits of the respiratory chain, confirming the presence of a defective mitochondrial protein synthesis in this disease. Mitochondrial abnormalities were mostly confined to multiple areas of different size and shape, in agreement with the focal character of the brain pathology in MELAS, and were most prominent in the cerebral cortex, providing a morphological contribution to the explanation of the cognitive regression of the patients. Immunoreactivity for mtDNA-encoded subunits was reduced in the walls of many pial and intracerebral arterioles of different brain regions but there was no clear correlation between territories of affected vessels and distribution of the histological and immunohistochemical lesions. Cerebral focal lesions in MELAS might have a metabolic nature and several pathogenetic mechanisms might be involved in the genesis of stroke-like episodes when there is a local increased ATP demand.

18810316	Sporadic hemiplegic migraine: report of a case with clinical and radiological features. A case of visual hallucination, headache and left hemiparesis is reported. The patient had a history of recurrent attacks of similar semiology for the previous 15 years. MRI brain revealed a cortical hyperintensity on T2W, FLAIR and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in the right cerebral hemisphere with a normal ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) map and MR angiogram. Detailed workup for MELAS was negative. A diagnosis of sporadic hemiplegic migraine was made and he was managed conservatively. He made a gradual complete recovery over 2 weeks. He was discharged on flunarizine for prophylaxis and has remained asymptomatic over the ensuing 4 months. This interesting condition is reviewed and discussed herein.
15728662	Skeletal muscle gene expression profiling in mitochondrial disorders. Extremely variable clinic and genetic features characterize mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (MEM). Pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects can be divided into large-scale rearrangements and single point mutations. Clinical manifestations become evident when a threshold percentage of the total mtDNA is mutated. In some MEM, the "mutant load" in an affected tissue is directly related to the severity of the phenotype. However, the clinical phenotype is not simply a direct consequence of the relative abundance of mutated mtDNA. Other factors, such as nuclear background, can contribute to the disease process, resulting in a wide range of phenotypes caused by the same mutation. Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide cDNA microarrays (HG-U133A), we studied the gene expression profile of muscle tissue biopsies obtained from 12 MEM patients [4 common 4977 bp deleted mtDNA and 8 A3243G: 4 progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and 4 mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic cidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) phenotypes] compared with age-matched healthy individuals. We found several differentially expressed genes: 35 were markedly up-regulated in the mtDNA macro-deletion group (vs. the control group) and 4 decreased; 56 genes were dysregulated in A3243G-related disorders (53 down-regulated in PEO and 3 up-regulated in MELAS). Finally, 12 genes were similarly regulated in the majority of the MEM patients under study. Amongst these, we identified an increased expression of genes related to the metabolism of the amino groups, as well as of several genes involved in genetic information processing. Moreover, few genes were similarly decreased in MEM patients vs. the control group. Real-time PCR demonstrated excellent reproducibility of the microarray-based findings. The observed expression changes are likely to represent a molecular signature for mitochondrial disorders. Furthermore, the differential expression profile of MELAS(A3243G) vs. PEO(A3243G) may support a role of nuclear background in contributing to these different clinical phenotypes. MEM microarray data are available from GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with the accession number: GSE1462.
17400793	Mutations in the ND5 subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial DNA are a frequent cause of oxidative phosphorylation disease. BACKGROUND: Detection of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is usually limited to common mutations and the transfer RNA genes. However, mutations in other mtDNA regions can be an important cause of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disease as well. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether regions in the mtDNA are preferentially mutated in patients with OXPHOS disease. METHODS: Screening of the mtDNA for heteroplasmic mutations was performed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of 116 patients with OXPHOS disease but without the common mtDNA mutations. RESULTS: An mtDNA sequence variant was detected in 15 patients, 5 of which were present in the ND5 gene. One sequence variant was new and three were known, one of which was found twice. The novel sequence variant m.13511A-->T occurred in a patient with a Leigh-like syndrome. The known mutation m.13513G-->A, associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) and MELAS/Leigh/Leber hereditary optic neuropathy overlap syndrome, was found in a relatively low percentage in two patients from two different families, one with a MELAS/Leigh phenotype and one with a MELAS/chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia phenotype. The known mutation m.13042G-->A, detected previously in a patient with a MELAS/myoclonic epilepsy, ragged red fibres phenotype and in a family with a prevalent ocular phenotype, was now found in a patient with a Leigh-like phenotype. The sequence variant m.12622G-->A was reported once in a control database as a polymorphism, but is reported in this paper as heteroplasmic in three brothers, all with infantile encephalopathy (Leigh syndrome) fatal within the first 15 days of life. Therefore, a causal relationship between the presence of this sequence variant and the onset of mitochondrial disease cannot be entirely excluded at this moment. CONCLUSIONS: Mutation screening of the ND5 gene is advised for routine diagnostics of patients with OXPHOS disease, especially for those with MELAS- and Leigh-like syndrome with a complex I deficiency.
25416369	MR OEF imaging in MELAS. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is defined as the ratio of blood oxygen that a tissue takes from the blood flow to maintain function and morphological integrity. OEF reflects the efficiency of oxygen utilization by the tissue and, therefore, is a hemodynamic measure in brain ischemia. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a common mitochondrial disorder. It is characterized by neurological remissions and relapses and associated with progressive neurocognitive deficits. Because of abnormalities of mitochondrial function in MELAS, defects in the oxidative metabolic pathways of energy production decrease the cerebral oxygen utilization and lead to the reduction of OEF. Quantification of OEF can reflect the functional status of cerebral mitochondria and provide insight into the pathophysiological changes in the brain in MELAS. In light of recent advances in MRI, the discovery of the blood-oxygen level-dependent signal has allowed development of MRI methods targeted toward quantitative OEF imaging. A new MR sequence, termed the gradient-echo sampling of spin echo, was successfully developed to enable quantitative assessment of the OEF in the brain tissue. MR OEF imaging in patients with MELAS detects extensive OEF reduction in the stroke-like lesions, as well as in the normal-appearing brain regions. More severe dysfunction of the mitochondria in the stroke-like lesions was implied at the onset of the stroke-like episode. Determination of OEF throughout the episode demonstrated a chronological change in mitochondrial function in individual cases. Such neuroimaging findings might provide some clues in the investigation of the underlying mechanisms of stroke-like episodes. 
10657827	Cerebral white matter disease in children may be caused by mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency. Several mitochondrial diseases are known to occasionally involve the cerebral white matter, namely Leigh syndrome, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and MELAS syndrome, but in these cases the major finding is alteration in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Here we report on severe diffuse white matter involvement and respiratory chain enzyme deficiency or mitochondrial DNA rearrangement in 5 unrelated families. It is interesting that white matter lesions were the only abnormal neuroradiologic feature in 3 of the 5 families, and multiple small cyst-like white matter lesions were found in 2 of 5 probands. Respiratory chain deficiency should be considered in the diagnosis of severe white matter involvement in childhood.
26741293	Visual, Ocular Motor, and Cochleo-Vestibular Loss in Patients With Heteroplasmic, Maternally-Inherited Diabetes Mellitus and Deafness (MIDD), 3243 Transfer RNA Mutation. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like symptoms (MELAS) and MIDD (maternally-inherited diabetes mellitus and deafness) are caused by A3243G transfer RNA mutations that affect mitochondrial function. Hearing loss and early onset diabetes mellitus constitute the main MIDD phenotype. Regarding the ophthalmologic manifestations of MIDD, we hypothesized that decreased vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain in patients with MIDD may contribute to impaired dynamic visual acuity. METHODS: Neuro-ophthalmologic, neuroimaging, and neuro-otologic evaluations were performed in 2 nonrelated patients with MIDD who complained of oscillopsia with head movement. We obtained quantitative recording of the horizontal and the vertical VOR, using the video head impulse test device. RESULTS: In the 2 patients, we detected visual, ocular motor, and vestibular abnormalities. Decreased VOR gain in the planes of all 3 semicircular canals and impaired dynamic visual acuity was demonstrated in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: MIDD patients are primarily recognized by their advanced hearing loss or deafness, early onset diabetes mellitus, and lactic acidosis. Decreased vision in these patients relates primarily to peri-macular retinal atrophy. In addition, loss of vestibular function causes poor dynamic visual acuity. Both patients, in their late fifties, had evidence of progressive central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction.
22516515	Perfusion status of the stroke-like lesion at the hyperacute stage in MELAS. Hypoperfusion on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the stroke-like lesion (SLL) at the hyperacute stage of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is considered to be a supportive evidence of the mitochondrial angiopathy theory. Our objectives were to examine whether other neuroimages, especially transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS), done at the hyperacute stage of stroke-like episode (SLE) is consistent with hypoperfusion of the SLL. We reviewed the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), SPECT, cerebral angiography, and TCCS of a patient with MELAS syndrome, all of which were performed at the hyperacute stage of one SLE. MRI on the 1st day post SLE showed right temporoparietal lesion with vasogenic edema. SPECT on the 2nd day showed focal decreased uptake of technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime ((99m)Tc-HMPAO) in the same region, but cerebral angiography and TCCS on the 3rd day showed increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and distal arteriole dilation in the same region. TCCS can delineate increased rCBF of the SLL at the hyperacute stage of SLE. We propose that the discrepancy between the decreased (99m)Tc-HMPAO uptake and increased rCBF might be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. The phenomenon of "hypoperfusion" on SPECT might be caused by cell dysfunction but not decreased rCBF. We suggest that SPECT can be complemented by angiography and TCCS in future studies to delineate the perfusion status of SLLs.
28458318	Familial Pernicious Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction with a Mitochondrial DNA A3243G Mutation. We report the case of a mother and two children who shared a mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. The mother had diabetes mellitus, neurogenic bladder, bradykinesia, dystonia, and slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. Her two daughters were diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes at adolescence. They all presented with gastrointestinal symptoms at an advanced clinical stage. They were diagnosed with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and they were resistant to therapy. The mother and her youngest daughter died from aspiration pneumonia because of vomiting. The determination of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is an important prognostic factor in patients with the mitochondrial DNA A3243G variant.
31665838	[Clinical and genetic characteristics of 62 children with mitochondrial epilepsy]. Objective: To summarize the clinical and genetic characteristics of children with mitochondrial epilepsy. Methods: Clinical data of 62 children who were clinically and genetically diagnosed with mitochondrial epilepsy by the Department of Neurology, Beijing Children's Hospital from October 2011 to December 2018 were analyzed retrospectively, and the control of epilepsy was followed up. T test or chi(2) test were used to analyze the related factors affecting the prognosis of epilepsy between the effective group and the ineffective group. Results: Of the 62 patients, 33 were male and 29 were female. The age of onset was 3.38 (0-12.00) years; for the type of seizures, 68% (42/62) of the patients had focal seizures, generalized or secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures were seen in 32% (20/62), myoclonic seizures in 23% (14/62), spastic seizures in 7 cases, tonic seizures in 4 cases, absence seizure, atonic seizure and clonic seizure in 1 case each; 16 cases (26%) had status epilepticus, of whom 6 cases had epilepsia partialis continua; 52% (32/62) had 2 or more types of seizures. The clinical phenotypes were mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in 29 cases, Leigh syndrome (LS) in 11 cases, combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency in 6 cases, myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers in 5 cases, Alpers syndrome in 4 cases, pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 and mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 9 in 2 cases each, mitochondrial complex I deficiency nuclear type 20, progressive cavitating leukoencephalopathy, and biotinidase deficiency in 1 case each. Of the 62 cases, 40 cases (65%) had mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations, of which 26 cases had m.3243A>G variants, 6 cases had m.8344A>G variants, and 3 cases had m.8993T>G/C variants, m.3271T>C, m.3481G>A, m.3946G>A, m.13094T>C, m.14487T>C variant was in 1 case each; nuclear DNA (nDNA) variations were identified in 22 cases (35%), of which 7 cases carrying variations in mitochondrial ammonia acyl tRNA synthetase coding gene, mutations in POLG and the gene encoding complex I were in 4 cases each, variations in SUCLG1 and SDHA genes were in 2 cases each, and variations in PDHA1, BTD and TRIT1 genes were in 1 case each. Forty-three patients were followed up, and the follow-up time was 20 (3-84) months. According to the follow-up results, the anti-epilepsy treatment was effective in 19 cases (44%) and ineffective in other 24 cases (56%). The onset age of the effective group was 3.42 (0-11.50) years and that of the ineffective group was 0.92 (0-9.50) years. The onset duration of the effective group was 0 (0-7.00) years and that of the ineffective group was 0 (0-4.83) years. There was no significant difference between the effective group and the ineffective group (t=1.662, 0.860; P=0.104, 0.395). In the effective group and the ineffective group, 12 cases and 9 cases used less than 2 kinds of antiepileptic drugs, 7 cases and 15 cases used more than or equal to 2 kinds of antiepileptic drugs, 13 and 15 cases had first epilepsy, 6 and 9 cases had non-first epilepsy, 14 and 11 cases had mtDNA variation, 5 and 13 cases had nDNA variation, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups (chi(2)=2.794, 0.164, 3.380; P=0.095, 0.686, 0.066). Conclusions: The types of seizures with mitochondrial epilepsy in children varied, with focal motor seizures being the most common, followed by generalized or secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Most children have more than two types of seizures. MELAS is the most common clinical phenotype, followed by LS; mtDNA variation is the dominant gene variation, of which m.3243A>G variation is the most common hotspot variation, followed by gene variation encoding mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthase.
10064171	Effect of coenzyme Q10 in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS): evaluation by noninvasive tissue oximetry. We evaluated the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation to two patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) by using noninvasive tissue oximetry with near-infrared spectra of hemoglobin from the quadriceps muscle during bicycle ergometer exercise. Patients showed distinct oxygen consumption patterns reflecting the defect in oxidative phosphorylation and the impairment in oxygen utilization during exercise. Based on the oxygen consumption pattern, we considered one patient as having severe mitochondrial disorder and another patient as having mild one. After coenzyme Q10 supplementation, the oxygen consumption pattern of the patient with the severe form shifted to the mild one, while that of the patient with mild form remained unchanged. The shift of the pattern to the mild form correlated well with reduction of the sum of the serum lactate and pyruvate content during exercise. Noninvasive tissue oximetry may be useful to evaluate the effect of coenzyme Q10 supplementation to patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy including MELAS.
10899447	Neuromuscular syndrome associated with the 3291T-->C mutation of mitochondrial DNA: a second case. A mutation was found in an Italian child affecting the gene encoding the mitochondrial transfer RNA for leucine (codon UUR). This mutation (3291T-->C) had previously been reported in a single Japanese patient. In contrast with the original patient, who suffered from early-onset mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), our patient presented an apparently isolated mild myopathy. Mutational analysis in the proband and her family showed that the mutation was heteroplasmic, and that its relative amount was positively correlated with the severity of the phenotype. These findings lead to the definitive confirmation that the 3291T-->C is indeed pathogenic. As commonly found in mitochondrial-DNA related disorders, also for this mutation different clinical manifestations can be associated with the same genetic abnormality.
29189965	Cerebral arterial and venous MRI abnormalities in MELAS. 
12796552	A missense mutation in the mitochondrial ND5 gene associated with a Leigh-MELAS overlap syndrome. A 13084 A->T missense mutation in the mitochondrial ND5 gene was identified in a 16-year-old boy affected with a progressive neurodegenerative disorder combining features of Leigh and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) syndromes. Muscle biopsy analysis revealed partial complex I deficiency. The mutation presented a variable degree of heteroplasmy in the patient's tissues. This finding underlines the contribution of mtDNA-encoded complex I subunits in the etiology of complex I deficiency associated with encephalopathy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose taurine supplementation for prevention of stroke-like episodes of MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes), a rare genetic disorder caused by point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA that lead to a taurine modification defect at the first anticodon nucleotide of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR), resulting in failure to decode codons accurately. METHODS: After the nationwide survey of MELAS, we conducted a multicentre, open-label, phase III trial in which 10 patients with recurrent stroke-like episodes received high-dose taurine (9 g or 12 g per day) for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the complete prevention of stroke-like episodes during the evaluation period. The taurine modification rate of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) was measured before and after the trial. RESULTS: The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint (100% responder rate) was 60% (95% CI 26.2% to 87.8%). The 50% responder rate, that is, the number of patients achieving a 50% or greater reduction in frequency of stroke-like episodes, was 80% (95% CI 44.4% to 97.5%). Taurine reduced the annual relapse rate of stroke-like episodes from 2.22 to 0.72 (P=0.001). Five patients showed a significant increase in the taurine modification of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) from peripheral blood leukocytes (P<0.05). No severe adverse events were associated with taurine. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that oral taurine supplementation can effectively reduce the recurrence of stroke-like episodes and increase taurine modification in mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) in MELAS.

14999465	Growth, fecundity and sex ratio of adult whaleworm (Anisakis simplex; Nematoda, Ascaridoidea, Anisakidae) in three whale species from the North-East Atlantic. The growth rate, fecundity, and sex ratio of Anisakis simplex in minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) was studied on the basis of material from the North Atlantic. A total of 8,135 mature A. simplex were collected from 24 minke whales, 11 porpoises and eight pilot whales. For both males and females, the prevalence was 100% for all three host species, with a mean intensity of 1,727, 262 and 139, respectively. The mean body length of adult female A. simplex was 126 mm in minke whales, 71 mm in the porpoises and 73 mm in pilot whales; and for males the averages were, respectively, 106 mm, 57 mm and 68 mm. Eggs from the uteri of 32 females of length 87-176 mm collected in minke whale stomachs were counted in a Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber. Total egg production was measured in 14 females cultivated at sea. The female growth period was estimated to be 30-60 days, and apparently all eggs were shed during the last week of life. A female of size 150 mm produces approximately 1.5 million eggs. In the cultivation experiment, about 85% of the total egg production was shed during the first 3 days after spawning started.
32000557	An analysis of the clinical and imaging features of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Objective: To investigate the clinical features and imaging characteristics of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).Methods: Seventeen patients with MELAS diagnosed in the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from July 2014 to August 2018 were enrolled in this study and their clinical manifestations, imaging and histopathological features were retrospectively analysed. We also discussed and summarised the related literature.Results: All of the 12 patients had seizures; stroke-like episodes in 12 cases; audio-visual impairment in 12 cases; headache in six cases; dysplasia in four cases; mental retardation in three cases; ataxia in two cases. On cranial magnetic resonance (MR) scans, the most common manifestations were in temporal-occipital-parietal lobe, cortical or subcortical areas as well as frontal lobe, thalamus, and basal ganglia showing long or equal T1 signals, long T2 signals, and hyperintense or iso-intense diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signals accompanied by ventricular enlargement and brain atrophy. MR spectroscopy showed that lactic acid peaks could be found in lesion sites, normal brain tissues, and cerebrospinal fluid. Muscle biopsy and genetic testing are the gold standard for diagnosing MELAS, muscle biopsy revealed COX-negative muscle fibres and SDH-stained red ragged fibres (RRF) under the sarcolemma. Mutations of mtDNA A3243G locus were common on gene testing. Improvement of mitochondrial function was observed after symptomatic and supportive treatment.Conclusion: MELAS should be considered for patients with epileptic seizures, headache, stroke-like episodes, extraocular palsy, cognitive decline and other clinical manifestations with the lesion located in the temporal-occipital-parietal lobe regardless of the distribution of blood vessels, and further examinations including muscle biopsy and gene testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
31344055	Appendicular skeletal muscle mass: A more sensitive biomarker of disease severity than BMI in adults with mitochondrial diseases. The study aimed to evaluate the body composition of patients with mitochondrial diseases (MD) and correlate it with disease severity. Overall, 89 patients (age >= 18 years) with MD were recruited, including 49 with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and 40 with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactate acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Body composition, including fat mass index (FMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), were examined using multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis. Clinical assessments, including muscle strength, usual gait speed, and disease severity determined by the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale score (NMDAS), were performed. The comparisons between patients group and age- and gender-matched healthy controls, as well as the correlations between anthropometric measurements, body composition, and disease severity were analyzed. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), FFMI, SMI, and ASMI were significantly lower in patients with MD than in healthy controls. Notably, low muscle mass was noted in 69.7% (62/89) of MD patients, with 22 patients also presenting with compromised physical performance as indicated by decreased gait speed, resulting in 24.7% satisfied the sarcopenia diagnostic criteria. Disease severity was more negatively correlated with ASMI than it was with height, weight, and BMI. Subgroup analysis showed that in the MELAS subgroup, disease severity was negatively correlated with height, weight, and ASMI; whereas in the CPEO subgroup, it was only negatively correlated with ASMI and SMI. Additionally, ASMI was positively associated with muscle strength. Altogether, compared with BMI, ASMI is a more sensitive biomarker predicting disease severity of MD, both in MELAS and CPEO patients.

30718445	[Positron Emission Tomography Imaging for Oxidative Stress in Mitochondrial and Neurodegenerative Diseases]. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are assumed to be the pathogenic molecular mechanisms underlying various neurodegenerative diseases. We applied positron emission tomography (PET) with [62Cu] diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (62Cu-ATSM) to image cerebral oxidative stress based on mitochondrial dysfunction in living patients. In our previous study, we observed an increased retention of Cu-ATSM in in vitro cell lines with mitochondrial respiratory failure, suggesting that 62Cu-ATSM uptake can be a promising biomarker for evaluating oxidative stress in patients with mitochondrial or neurodegenerative diseases. PET imaging with 62Cu-ATSM successfully demonstrated the increased uptake in brain lesions of a patient with mitochondrial disease (MELAS), in the striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease, and in the motor cortex and motor-related cortices of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The uptake for these disease-related brain regions strongly correlated with disease severity, indicating that oxidative stress based on mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with the neurodegenerative process in these diseases. 62Cu-ATSM PET imaging for oxidative stress has improved our insights into the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and may be a promising tool for monitoring further antioxidant and mitochondrial therapies.
18817095	A stroke-like episode in a young patient with MELAS syndrome. 
30888501	A cluster of disseminated small cortical lesions in MELAS: its distinctive clinical and neuroimaging features. OBJECTIVES: To investigate a diversity of stroke-like episodes (SLEs) in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and report a disseminated form of SLEs (D-SLEs) attributed to a cluster of disseminated small cortical lesions. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical information of 27 MELAS patients seen at Kitasato University Hospital between January 1990 and April 2018. Among those, we selected 13 patients with m.3243A>G mutation [median age at onset, 35 years (11-68 years), two pediatric onset < 17 years] who had at least one SLE. SLEs were classified into classic or non-classic based on characteristic features of stroke-like lesions. RESULTS: 44 SLEs were identified during a median observational period of 119 months (3-240 months). Among those, 29 (65.9%) were classic SLEs (C-SLEs) mainly attributed to a single continuous lobular lesion incongruent to vascular territory and occasionally accompanied by a gradual spread associated with hyperperfusion and persistent seizure activity. The remaining 15 were non-classic attributed to sparsely distributed (n = 10), disseminated (n = 4) or cerebellar lesions (n = 1). C-SLEs developed in all patients but non-classic SLEs in 5; D-SLEs developed in 4 patients accounting for 4 of 44 SLEs (9.1%). Non-classic SLEs developed more frequently in pediatric-onset than in adult-onset patients (12/15 vs. 3/29, p < 0.0001). SLEs began with acute onset of symptoms in 42 SLEs (95.5%), but D-SLEs of 2 adult-onset patients began with ill-defined subacute-onset fluctuating encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a diversity of SLEs in patients with m.3243A>G mutation. Further studies are required to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of non-classic SLEs including D-SLEs.

32950272	Mitochondrial DNA m.3243A>G mutation rarely causes CADASIL-like phenotype. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) are 2 monogenic cerebral small vessel diseases sharing several common clinical features including young stroke, migraine, and cognitive dysfunction. The aim of this study was to understand the role of MELAS in patients with CADASIL-like manifestations. We screened 429 unrelated patients with genetically unassigned CADASIL-like syndrome for mitochondrial DNA m.3243A>G mutation. None of them were found to have the mutation. Our finding suggests that m.3243A>G rarely causes CADASIL-like phenotype. It may be not necessary to consider MELAS as a differential diagnosis of CADASIL. Screening m.3243A>G in patients with CADASIL-like phenotype is of limited value.
11108510	Endocrine disorders in two sisters affected by MELAS syndrome. A variety of endocrine and metabolic defects, including hypothalamopituitary hypofunction and diabetes mellitus, has been reported in association with mitochondrial disorders. We describe two sisters affected by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) syndrome in whom DNA analysis showed an A-->G transition at the 3243rd nucleotide position on the transfer RNALeu(UUR) gene with 65% and 45% of mutant-type mitochondrial DNA present in the blood cells of the younger and the older sister, respectively. The younger sister had severe involvement of the central nervous system with mental retardation, epilepsia partialis continua, and strokelike episodes. Endocrine investigations showed an extensive neuroendocrine dysfunction with growth hormone deficiency, hypothalamopituitary hypothyroidism, prepubertal gonadotropin levels, and absence of any secondary sexual characteristics at the age of 12 6/12 years. The neurologically normal older sister was affected by diabetes mellitus and had normal hypothalamopituitary function. Our report confirms that the endocrine system can be affected differently by the same mitochondrial DNA mutation, depending on the heteroplasmia phenomenon. A complete endocrine evaluation must be performed in patients affected by mitochondrial disease and the existence of a mitochondrial disorder should be taken into account in patients with endocrine abnormalities, even if neuromuscular signs are lacking.
26314741	[Characteristics of anesthesia in patients with MELAS syndrome: Case report of anesthesia in video-assisted thoracoscopy]. The mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a disease triggered by a disorder in energy production within mitochondria. The cause of this syndrome is a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA where in 80% of cases an A-to-G mutation is present at nucleotide 3243 and with a prevalence of 18.4/100,000 in the population. Predominantly affected are organ systems with a high energy metabolism, such as the heart, brain and musculature. During the premedication visit a thorough patient history and examination with respect to neurological impairments must be carried out. Epilepsy and the appropriate permanent medication lead to possible alterations in effectiveness of anesthetics and muscle relaxants which are difficult to predict. An extensive patient cardiac history and a preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) for an appraisal of possible disorders in the cardiac conduction system and when necessary extended cardiac diagnostics, are recommended. The monitoring must be adapted depending on the functional limitations and the forthcoming intervention and when necessary a postoperative surveillance in an intensive care unit should be initiated. Knowledge of the special features of MELAS syndrome in association with a consideration of the characteristics of anesthesia in MELAS patients and an individually adapted intensified perioperative surveillance, can contribute to a reduction in perioperative morbidity in patients suffering from MELAS syndrome.
21996807	MERRF and Kearns-Sayre overlap syndrome due to the mitochondrial DNA m.3291T>C mutation. A 48-year-old man presented with a complex phenotype of myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), which included progressive myoclonus epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, hearing loss, myopathic weakness, ophthalmoparesis, pigmentary retinopathy, bifascicular heart block, and ragged-red fibers. The m.3291T>C mutation in the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene was found with 92% heteroplasmy in muscle. This mutation has been reported with MELAS, myopathy, and deafness with cognitive impairment. This is the first description with a MERRF/KSS syndrome.
18226864	Intestinal pseudo-obstruction in a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) associated with phenytoin therapy. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is most commonly associated with a mitochondrial DNA A to G point mutation at nucleotide 3243 (A3243G) and individuals with the disorder present a wide range of multisystemic symptoms. Seizures in MELAS patients are often intractable and require multiple antiepileptic drugs. Here we report a MELAS patient who presented with acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction following the administration of phenytoin (PHT) as an antiepileptic treatment. She presented with the first stroke-like episode at the age of 6 years and mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed A3243G with 94% mutation load in skeletal muscle. Despite treatment with phenobarbital and clobazam at the age of 16 years, she developed status epilepticus which ceased following PHT infusion. Thereafter, she was started on PHT treatment. One month later, however, she was readmitted because of remarkable abdominal distention. Although abdominal CT showed acute ileus with hepatic portal venous gas mimicking surgical emergency, the abdominal distention gradually recovered over several days following the discontinuation of PHT. Our clinical observations suggest the possibility that intestinal pseudo-obstruction in this patient related to PHT therapy. Careful clinical observation including gastrointestinal symptoms is required in the management of epilepsy in MELAS patients.
18381020	[MELAS: diagnostic keys and treatment in the Intensive Care Unit]. Cerebrovascular accident in young adults is not rare and the most common causes are: cardiac embolism, arterial dissection and migraine. The unknown etiology, in spite of extensive studies, is described in the literature in about one third of patients under 45 years of age. The mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) may occur with symptoms that simulate a stroke. The <<stroke-like>> episodes generally affect the posterior part of the brain and the basic insult mechanisms may be metabolic more than ischemic. We describe the case of an 18-year old patient who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit due to a sudden picture of blindness. The ophthalmologic study was normal and the neuroimaging studies showed infarction in both occipital lobules. We explain the different clinical features, diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic methods of the disease.
12972383	Late onset of stroke-like episode associated with a 3256C-->T point mutation of mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are usually associated with the common 3243A-->G mutation of mtDNA. Onset of stroke-like episodes usually occurs before age 30. We report a patient with late onset MELAS harboring a rare 3256C-->T mutation in the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene of mtDNA. The patient presented with a stroke-like episode at age 36. MRI showed a stroke-like lesion in the right parietooccipital brain region. Proton MR spectroscopy showed elevated lactate concentrations in the lesion (8.4 mmol/l), and in the mid-occipital region (2.3-3.2 mmol/l) that appeared normal on MRI. Further tests revealed evidence of a severe oxidative defect of muscle metabolism as well.
9889270	Search for differences in post-transcriptional modification patterns of mitochondrial DNA-encoded wild-type and mutant human tRNALys and tRNALeu(UUR). Post-transcriptional modifications are characteristic features of tRNAs and have been shown in a number of cases to influence both their structural and functional properties, including structure stabilization, amino-acylation and codon recognition. We have developed an approach which allows the investigation of the post-transcriptional modification patterns of human mitochondrial wild-type and mutant tRNAs at both the qualitative and the quantitative levels. Specific tRNA species are long-term labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, isolated in a highly selective way, enzymatically digested to mononucleotides and then subjected to two-dimensional thin layer chromatographic analysis. The wild-type tRNALysand the corresponding tRNALyscarrying the A8344G mutation associated with the MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers) syndrome exhibit the same modified nucleotides at the same molar concentrations. By contrast, a quantitatively different modification pattern was observed between the wild-type tRNALeu(UUR)and its counterpart carrying the A3243G mutation associated with the MELAS (Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes) syndrome, the latter exhibiting a 50% decrease in m2G content. Complementary sequencing of tRNALeu(UUR)has allowed the localization of this modification at position 10 within the D-stem of the tRNA. The decreased level of this modification may have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the MELAS-associated mitochondrial dysfunction.

19682606	The m.3243A>G mtDNA mutation is pathogenic in an in vitro model of the human blood brain barrier. MELAS is a common mitochondrial disease frequently associated with the m.3243A>G point mutation in the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) of mitochondrial DNA and characterized by stroke-like episodes with vasogenic edema and lactic acidosis. The pathogenic mechanism of stroke and brain edema is not known. Alterations in the blood brain barrier (BBB) caused by respiratory chain defects in the cortical microvessels could explain the pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis we developed a tissue culture model of the human BBB. The MELAS mutation was introduced into immortalized brain capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes. Respiratory chain activity and transendothelial electrical resistance, TEER was measured. Severe defects of respiratory chain complex I and IV activities, and a moderate deficiency of complex II activity in cells harboring the MELAS mutation were associated with low TEER, indicating that the integrity of the BBB was compromised. These data support our hypothesis that respiratory chain defects in the components of the BBB cause changes in permeability.
31806591	Acute Cortical Lesions in MELAS Syndrome: Anatomic Distribution, Symmetry, and Evolution. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a rare mitochondrial disorder affecting children and young adults. Stroke-like episodes are often associated with acute cortical lesions in the posterior cerebral cortex and are classically described as asymmetric and transient. In this study we assessed the anatomic distribution of acute cortical lesions, the incidence of symmetry, and the temporal evolution of lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who had a confirmed genetic diagnosis of a pathogenic variant associated with MELAS and MR imaging performed at our center (2006-2018). Each MR imaging study was assessed for new lesions using T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, ADC, and SWI. The anatomic location, symmetry, and temporal evolution of lesions were analyzed. RESULTS: Eight patients with the same pathogenic variant of MELAS (MT-TL1 m.3243A>G) with 31 MR imaging studies were included. Forty-one new lesions were identified in 17 of the studies (5 deep, 36 cortical). Cortical lesions most commonly affected the primary visual cortex, the middle-third of the primary somatosensory cortex, and the primary auditory cortex. Thirty of 36 cortical lesions had acute cortical diffusion restriction, of which 21 developed cortical laminar necrosis on subacute imaging. Six of 11 studies with multiple lesions showed symmetric cortical involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Acute cortical lesions in MELAS most commonly affect the primary visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortices, all regions of high neuronal density and metabolic demand. The most common pattern of temporal evolution is acute cortical diffusion restriction with subacute cortical laminar necrosis and chronic volume loss. Symmetric involvement is more common than previously described.
23084792	Brain uptake of Tc99m-HMPAO correlates with clinical response to the novel redox modulating agent EPI-743 in patients with mitochondrial disease. While decreased ATP production and redox imbalance are central to mitochondrial disease pathogenesis, efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by the lack of imaging markers of oxidative stress. In this study we wished to determine if Tc99m-HMPAO, a SPECT imaging marker of cerebral blood flow and glutathione/protein thiol content, could be used to monitor the effect(s) of EPI-743, an oral redox modulating, para-benzoquinone based therapeutic for mitochondrial disease. We hypothesized that treatment changes in HMPAO uptake would be inversely proportional to changes in oxidative stress within the brain and directly correlate to clinical response to EPI-743 therapy. Twenty-two patients with mitochondrial disease were treated with EPI-743. Each underwent baseline and 3-month Tc99m-HMPAO SPECT scanning along with clinical/neurologic evaluations. Diseases treated were: Leigh syndrome (n=7), polymerase gamma deficiency (n=5), MELAS (n=5), Friedreich ataxia (n=2), Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and mtDNA depletion syndrome. Neuro-anatomic uptake analyses of HMPAO were performed with NeuroGam  (Segami Corp.) statistical software and clinical response was assessed by the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale or Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale depending on patient age. For all 22 patients there was a significant linear correlation between the change in cerebellar uptake of HMPAO and the improvement in Newcastle score (r=0.623, **p=0.00161). The MELAS subgroup showed a significant relationship of whole brain uptake (n=5, r=0.917, *p=0.028) to improvement in Newcastle score. We conclude that Tc99m-HMPAO SPECT scanning has promise as a general marker of the oxidative state of the brain and its response to redox modulating therapies. Further studies will be needed to confirm these findings in a more homogenous study population.
18727811	Melasma: successful treatment with pidobenzone 4% (K5lipogel). Melasma (a term derived from the Greek word "melas" meaning black) is an acquired blotchy, irregularly patterned, brown or sometimes gray brown hypermelanosis of the face and occasionally the neck. Its etiology is poorly understood but mainly related to sunlight and genetic predisposition. Melasma seems to be more frequent in darker skinned people, especially women. Its treatment is always difficult and the condition usually relapses. The treatment with pidobenzone 4% (K5 lipogel), twice per day for 16 weeks has proved to be safe and effective. Pidobenzone 4% lipogel, according to the present study, seems also to represent a useful, reliable, and safe treatment of the different types of melasma.

37474167	Efficacy of high-intensity versus low-intensity psychoanalytically oriented long-term treatments and determinants of outcome: individual participant data Meta-analysis of Long-term Analytic treatment Studies (MeLAS). INTRODUCTION: Long-term psychodynamic/psychoanalytic psychotherapy (LTPP) is a prevalent treatment option for complex mental disorders. Yet, little is known about the role of treatment intensity in LTPP. We present a study protocol for a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis aggregating and analysing individual data from randomised and quasi-experimental trials by meta-analysis. The purpose is to (1) determine the treatment effectiveness of LTPP with low versus high intensity (up to 2 weekly sessions vs three or more), (2) compare their joint effectiveness to shorter therapies and treatments as usual, (3) identify predictors and moderators of treatment outcomes and (4) determine reciprocal relationships between different outcome domains (symptomatic and structural/personality change) over the courses of LTPP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We include studies from (randomised controlled trial, RCT) and quasi-experimental trials, where at least one condition was LTPP of high or low frequency. Long-term treatment is defined as >=1 year or >=50 sessions. To be eligible studies must include a standardised outcome measure of symptoms (global or disorder specific) with at least one proof of reliability. The primary outcome is symptom reduction (global or specific), secondary outcome criteria are reliable change, remission, functional capacities, personality, personality functioning and interpersonal pathology. Relevant studies will mainly be identified by searching relevant databases: PubMed, PsycINFO (via EBSCO), Web of Science (via Elsevier), Chochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Wiley). Risk of bias will be evaluated in line with the Cochrane assessments tools for quasi-experimental trials and RCTs, respectively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Aggregation of data from primary trials collected based on ethics votes. Dissemination into clinical practice via open access publications of findings.

33038720	Aphasic status epilepticus in a tertiary referral center in Turkey: Clinical features, etiology, and outcome. OBJECTIVE: Aphasic status epilepticus (ASE), although rare, may often remain underdiagnosed. We aimed to report the patients diagnosed with ASE and describe their clinical presentation, etiology, electrophysiological findings, neuroimaging, treatment options, and outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a series of 28 patients diagnosed with ASE between January 2010 and August 2019 in our tertiary referral center. We reviewed medical files, patient charts, and short- and long-term intermittent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Demographical, historical, clinical, neuroimaging, electrophysiological parameters, administered antiseizure medications, and prognosis of all patients were recorded. Furthermore, EEGs were re-evaluated according to Salzburg criteria. RESULTS: Most patients presented with tumors (n = 11) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (n = 11), while the rest were diagnosed with hyperglycemia (n = 2), autoimmune encephalitis (n = 1), remote intracranial abscess (n = 1), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) attack (n = 1), or unknown cause (n = 1). Seventy-one percent of patients had prior history of epilepsy. The most common EEG findings were rhythmic delta activity with fluctuation and epileptiform discharges <= 2.5 Hz with spatiotemporal evolution (66 %). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and EEG findings indicated dominant hemisphere involvement in all patients. No casualties occurred; 71 % patients exhibited total recovery, while 29 % had mild-moderate sequela aphasia. None of the patients received aggressive treatment for ASE. SIGNIFICANCE: A relatively higher number of ASE patients could be contributed to the literature through this study. ASE should be considered in patients with prolonged unexplained aphasia, especially with pre-existing risk factors, such as prior history of epilepsy, structural lesion, and metabolic disorders accompanied by concordant EEG findings. Although the underlying cause is a determining prognostic factor, this study shows a significant number of patients with complete remission; thus, the prognosis of ASE may be considered more favorable than other types of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
35914170	High conductivity Sepia melanin ink films for environmentally benign printed electronics. Melanins (from the Greek muepsilonlambdaalphasigma, melas, black) are bio-pigments ubiquitous in flora and fauna. Eumelanin is an insoluble brown-black type of melanin, found in vertebrates and invertebrates alike, among which Sepia (cuttlefish) is noteworthy. Sepia melanin is a type of bio-sourced eumelanin that can readily be extracted from the ink sac of cuttlefish. Eumelanin features broadband optical absorption, metal-binding affinity and antioxidative and radical-scavenging properties. It is a prototype of benign material for sustainable organic electronics technologies. Here, we report on an electronic conductivity as high as 10-3 S cm-1 in flexographically printed Sepia melanin films; such values for the conductivity are typical for well-established high-performance organic electronic polymers but quite uncommon for bio-sourced organic materials. Our studies show the potential of bio-sourced materials for emerging electronic technologies with low human- and eco-toxicity.
29911364	Ocular findings in MELAS syndrome - a case report. We present a case of a child with MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalo-myopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes), discussing clinical manifestation, ocular findings and diagnostic challenges. Predominant ocular symptom was a transient complete visual loss, while the predominant ocular sign was a visual field defect. The diagnosia was based on clinical manifestation, laboratory tests, brain scans and genetic testing which confirmed the pathognomonic mutation in the MTTL1 gene encoding the mitochondrial tRNA for leucine 3243> G. Ocular examination demonstrated decreased visual acuity (with bilateral best corrected visual acuity of .1). Periodical, transient visual loss and visual field defects were clinically predominant. Specialist investigations were carried out, which demonstrated homonymous hemianopia (kinetic perimetry), bilateral partial optic nerve atrophy (RetCam). Funduscopy and electrophysiology mfERG study did not confirm features of retinitis pigmentosa. The brain scans revealed numerous small cortical ischemic lesions within the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, post-stroke focal areas within the occipital lobes and diffuse calcifications of the basal ganglia. During several years of follow-up, visual field defects showed progressive concentric narrowing. The patient received a long-term treatment with arginine, coenzyme Q and vitamin D, both oral and intravenous, but no beneficial effect for the improvement of ophthalmic condition was observed. As it is the case in severe MELAS syndrome, the course of disease was fatal and the patientdied at the age of 14.
16551459	A boy with muscle weakness, hypercarbia, and the mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. The point mutation in the mitochondrial genome tRNA(Leu_ (A3243G) is associated with the syndrome of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). We report a boy presenting with respiratory compromise and hypercarbia owing to severe muscle weakness. Historically, he demonstrated idiopathic growth hormone deficiency, retarded bone age, and exercise avoidance. Owing to severe respiratory compromise out of proportion to expected recovery, a metabolic work-up was performed. Muscle biopsy demonstrated abnormal mitochondria structure and heteroplasmic A3243G mutation. Idiopathic growth hormone deficiency and retarded bone age have not been previously reported in MELAS, and these findings delayed testing for mitochondrial disease. This case demonstrates that isolated muscle weakness in the context of other organ system abnormalities should make the investigator consider MELAS. (J Child Neurol 2006;21:77-79).

PURPOSE: To investigate the cerebral macrovascular changes as well as the relationship of large vessels and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MR imaging (MRI). METHODS: A total of 20 patients diagnosed with MELAS (12 males, 8 females; mean age, 23.3 years) underwent conventional MRI, time-of-flight (TOF) MRA and three dimensional ASL. Follow-up scans were performed in 10 patients. The changes of cerebral arteries and branches on MRA images from both acute and recovery patients were independently evaluated by two radiologists. Lesion distribution and CBF were observed on the integrated maps of MRA and ASL. RESULTS: In 14 patients with clinical onsets, increased CBF was observed in all stroke-like lesions. Dilations of a single artery (four middle cerebral arteries, two posterior cerebral arteries) were found in six patients. Dilations of multiple arteries (two anterior cerebral arteries, seven middle cerebral arteries, six posterior cerebral arteries) were found in seven patients. Normal angiography was shown in one acute patient. Cortical terminal branches feeding the lesion areas were more obviously dilated than the main trunks. The dilated vessels returned to normal on follow-up scans concurrently with decreased CBF in nine patients who were resuscitated from episode attacks. Vasodilation was even seen in one preclinical patient who suffered a recurrent episode 50 days later. CONCLUSION: Reversible dilation of cerebral macrovascular changes could be a new feature of MELAS and a presumed reason for fluctuant CBF. It would shed new light on the mitochondrial angiopathy.
19460298	The study of mitochondrial A3243G mutation in different samples. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) is the most frequent syndromic manifestation of A3243G mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Detection of A3243G mutation in blood is less helpful for the diagnosis of MELAS and the carriers, and the mutation ratio in blood correlates only in a limited extent with the severity of the disease. Here we compared the ratio of A3243G mutation in four easily available samples (blood, urine, hair follicle and saliva) in patients with MELAS carrying A3243G mutation as well as their maternal relatives from 32 families, to find out the samples appropriate for the detection of the patients and carriers and useful for the evaluation of clinical severity from their mutation ratio. In MELAS patients and the carriers with minor symptoms or normal phenotype, A3243G mutation ratio was significantly higher in urine than in blood. A close correlation between A3243G mutation ratio in blood and that in urine, hair follicles and saliva was found in the probands and their relatives. Clinical features closely correlated with the mutation ratio in urine. Measurement of A3243G mutation ratio in urine is a non-invasive, convenient and rapid method with its diagnostic meaning superior to blood testing.
15180033	Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS): a mitochondrial disorder presents as fibromyalgia. This case report describes a patient who presented with symptoms and signs of longstanding fibromyalgia. Routine laboratory tests revealed an elevated anion gap. Evaluation of the elevated anion gap demonstrated elevated lactate and pyruvate levels and a lactate-to-pyruvate ratio greater than 20:1. A muscle biopsy was performed, exhibiting red ragged fibers, pathognomonic for a mitochondrial disorder. The patient was diagnosed with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS). This is the first report describing fibromyalgia as the initial presentation of MELAS. This article outlines the diagnostic process that can assist the physician in distinguishing mitochondrial disorders from other muscular diseases, particularly fibromyalgia.

12581339	Mitochondrial dysfunction in myofibrillar myopathy. 'Myofibrillar myopathy' defines a myopathic condition with focal myofibrillar destruction and accumulation of degraded myofibrillar elements. Despite the fact that a number of mutations in different genes as well as cytotoxic agents lead to the disease, abnormal accumulation of desmin is a typical, common feature. Pathological changes of mitochondrial morphology and function have been observed in animal models with intermediate filament pathology. Therefore, in the present study we tested for mitochondrial pathology in skeletal muscle of five patients with the pathohistological diagnosis of myofibrillar myopathy. Screening for large-scale mtDNA deletions and the frequent MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy; ragged red fibres) and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy; lactic acidosis; stroke) point mutations was negative in all patients. Histologically, all muscle biopsies showed nonspecific abnormalities of the oxidative/mitochondrial enzyme stainings (histochemistry for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, succinic dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase), only one of them had ragged red fibres and a significant number of cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibres. Upon biochemical investigation, four of our patients showed pathologically low respiratory chain complex I activities. Only one of our patients had a pathologically low complex IV activity, while the measurements of the others were within low normal range. The single patient with pathological values for both complex I and IV was the one with the clear histological hallmarks (ragged red and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibres) of mitochondrial pathology. She also was the only patient with clinical signs hinting at a mitochondrial disorder. Together with data from observations in desmin- and plectin-deficient mice, our results support the view that desmin intermediate filament pathology in these cases is closely linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle.
23527980	[Clinical, pathological and molecular biological characteristics of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episode in children]. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the characteristics of the clinical manifestation, pathology of skeletal muscle and gene mutations of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episode (MELAS) in children. METHOD: The clinical manifestation, laboratorial data, brain images, muscle pathology and mitochondrial gene mutations were analyzed in 24 patients with MELAS who were diagnosed in Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital. Their prognosis was evaluated by following up. RESULT: Symptoms of central nervous system such as stroke-like episodes, vomiting, convulsion and headache were present in all the 24 cases. Nine cases had the symptoms of myopathy. Twenty cases had developmental delay. Short stature, being thin and hairy was very common in these cases. Serum lactate level increased in all the cases, pyruvate increased in 17 cases. Elevated CSF lactate was found in 2 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 24 cases, out of them 23 were abnormal. The lesions mainly involved cerebral lobes. Occipital lobe was the most common site of lesions. Computed tomography (CT) was performed on 13 cases, low density lesions were present in 10 cases, basal ganglia calcifications in 5 cases. Muscle biopsy was performed on 8 cases, ragged-red fibers (RRF) were found in 4/8 cases, and abnormal accumulation of mitochondria were found in 3/8 cases. The mtDNA gene mutational analysis showed A3243G mutation in these patients. The mutation rates varied from 11.6% to 75.0%. The same mutation were found in 4/5 mothers who had the genetic tests, and the mutation rates of the mothers varied from 15.0% to 23.6%. The clinical information of 11 cases was available through recent following up. Three cases died, the others had some degrees of mental retardation. CONCLUSION: Children with MELAS had various clinical manifestations. Central nervous system and skeletal muscle were usually involved. Short stature and hypertrichosis were common signs. The prognosis of this disease was disappointing. mtDNA A3243G was the most common mutation in MELAS. Fully understanding the characteristics of its clinical manifestation, laboratory tests, brain image, muscle pathology and molecular features can be helpful to the early diagnosis and treatment.
10416093	Acute or subacute cranial computed tomography findings in patients with congenital lactic acidemia. Two patients with congenital lactic acidemia of unknown etiology developed striking and extensive cranial computed tomography abnormalities of acute or subacute onset. In addition to Leigh syndrome and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), other lactic acidemia disorders may produce evolving cerebral radiographic abnormalities. An aggressive effort should be made in such patients to obtain a specific diagnosis through biochemical and molecular genetic studies.
31693521	Arginine therapy in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We would like to inform clinicians that the systematic administration of oral and intravenous L-arginine is therapeutically beneficial and clinically useful for patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), when they maintain plasma arginine concentration at least 168 mumol/l. RECENT FINDINGS: MELAS is associated with endothelial dysfunction by decreased plasma L-arginine, nitric oxide (NO), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Endothelial dysfunction is also evident using flow-mediated vasodilation measurement by high-resolution Doppler echocardiography in the forearm artery in patients with MELAS. L-arginine is known to be an important precursor of NO to normalize the endothelial function in MELAS. In our clinical trial followed by 7 years follow-up study, the systematic administration of L-arginine to patients with MELAS significantly improved the survival curve of patients compared with natural history. Maintaining plasma arginine concentration at least 168 mumol/l may prevent the ictuses through the putative pathophysiologic mechanism and optimal normalization of endothelial dysfunction. SUMMARY: Neither death nor bedriddenness occurred during the 2-year clinical trials, and the latter did not develop during the 7-year follow-up despite the progressively neurodegenerative and eventually life-threatening nature of MELAS. Therapeutic regimen of L-arginine on MELAS may be beneficial and clinically useful for patient care with MELAS.
29460913	[Migraine 'masks': differential diagnosis of acute headache]. Differential diagnosis of migraine, can be difficult, especially of migraine with aura. On the one hand, some diseases can produce symptoms similar to migraine (cerebral aneurysm before rupture, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome). On the other hand, migraine with aura and some other disorders are conditions that have common pathophysiological mechanisms (e.g., CADASIL and MELAS syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome). Thirdly, clinical presentations of migraine are often difficult to distinguish from features of other headache conditions (migraine with aura - transient ischemic attack, migraine with visual aura - occipital epilepsy). The author discusses the differential diagnosis of acute headache, especially thunderclap headache, and main strategies of effective treatment of migraine attacks.
21600268	In vivo functional brain imaging and a therapeutic trial of L-arginine in MELAS patients. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is the most common type of mitochondrial disease and is characterized by stroke-like episodes (SEs), myopathy, lactic acidosis, diabetes mellitus, hearing-loss and cardiomyopathy. The causal hypotheses for SEs in MELAS presented to date are angiopathy, cytopathy and neuronal hyperexcitability. L-arginine (Arg) has been applied for the therapy in MELAS patients. SCOPE OF REVIEW: We will introduce novel in vivo functional brain imaging techniques such as MRI and PET, and discuss the pathogenesis of SEs in MELAS patients. We will further describe here our clinical experience with L-arg therapy and discuss the dual pharmaceutical effects of this drug on MELAS. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Administration of L-arg to MELAS patients has been successful in reducing neurological symptoms due to acute strokes and preventing recurrences of SEs in the chronic phase. L-Arg has dual pharmaceutical effects on both angiopathy and cytopathy in MELAS. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: In vivo functional brain imaging promotes a better understanding of the pathogenesis and potential therapies for MELAS patients. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Biochemistry of Mitochondria, Life and Intervention 2010.
16353243	Mitochondrial mutation in a child with distal arthrogryposis. A 15-year-old girl presented with stroke and was found to have a mitochondrial mutation MELAS T3271C. As an infant, she had required casting and surgery for clubbed feet as well as physical therapy for camptodactyly and adducted thumbs. Despite some residual deformities, psychomotor development was normal, but she was extremely small for her age with height, weight, and head circumference below the third centile. A younger brother had similar distal arthrogryposis, but normal height and weight and no history of stroke though he had been diagnosed with attention deficit. The parents and another brother were clinically normal. While the observation of MELAS in a child with distal arthrogryposis could be co-incidental, it raises concern about the possible role of mitochondrial myopathy or neuropathy in causation of distal arthrogryposis.
27760656	[Analysis on clinical features and functional MRI of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes]. Objective: To explore the clinical and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) characteristics of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in order to improve the early diagnosis rate. Methods: Clinical and imaging data of 46 patients with final diagnosis of MELAS treated in Henan Province People's Hospital from January 2012 to June 2016 were collected. Results: Patients presented with symptoms of epilepsy, hemiplegia, language disorders, and decreased visual acuity and so on. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the lesion area showed a high signal, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) chart with the course of disease development can be a high signal, low signal, high and low signal. Vascular stenosis was not seen in all the patients by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). PWI perfusion increased in acute phase and was normal or decreased in the chronic phase. Conclusions: The clinical manifestations of MELAS patients are complex and various, and lack of specificity. Routine MRI examination is of great significance for the screening of the lesion, which has a characteristic performance and is helpful to improve the early diagnosis rate of the disease.
12200746	Effects of oral creatine supplementation in a patient with MELAS phenotype and associated nephropathy. An 18-year-old male patient with MELAS phenotype and 2 previous episodes of cerebral stroke, recurrent seizures and nephropathy, was treated with creatine monohydrate after the acute onset of psychomental regression and changing states of somnolence and aggressive and agitated behaviour. These symptoms disappeared completely after 4 weeks of treatment with creatine after which the patient regained all his previous mental abilites. Brain (white matter) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (chemical shift imaging) performed at 6 and 12 months of treatment showed lactic acid (Lac) accumulation and high creatine (Cr) levels in relation to choline-containing compounds (Cho). Urinary creatinine excretion as an indicator of the muscle and brain creatine pool increased upon short-term (12 days) high-dosage creatine supplementation (20 g per day) while plasma creatinine concentrations as possible indicators both of increasing creatine pool and of renal insufficiency increased during the course (28 months) of low-dosage creatine supplementation (5 g per day). Deterioration of renal function was finally indicated by urea retention and by impairment of renal creatinine clearance. These observations suggest that creatine supplementation may have a neuroprotective effect in patients with MELAS and episodes of acute mental deterioration. Adverse effects of creatine supplementation on renal function must be considered especially in patients with preexisting nephropathy.
21327397	Cerebellar hematoma in a carrier of the A3243G MELAS mutation. 
11078225	Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS) with prominent degeneration of the intestinal wall and cactus-like cerebellar pathology. A 67-year-old woman had frequent subacute ileus, hearing difficulty, muscle atrophy and stroke-like episodes. Computed tomography revealed multiple low-density areas, which did not correlate with the vascular supply, in the cerebral cortex. She had metabolic disturbance comprising lactic acidosis and elevated pyruvate level. Her skeletal muscle biopsy specimen showed ragged-red fibers, and mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed a point mutation at position 3243, findings consistent with MELAS. Examination of her small intestine revealed a necrotic zone and numerous abnormal large mitochondria in the smooth muscle cells, vascular media and endothelium, and intestinal ganglion cells. The cerebral cortex showed multiple microcystic necrotic foci in cerebral cortex. Cactus-like pathology resembling the changes associated with Menkes' kinky hair disease and torpedoes were observed in the cerebellar Purkinje cells. The intestinal dysmotility due to MELAS and cerebellar changes were presumed to be associated with a disturbance of copper metabolism.
22969229	Characteristics of intestinal pseudo-obstruction in patients with mitochondrial diseases. AIM: To reveal the frequency, characteristics and prognosis of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP) in mitochondrial disease patients. METHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2010, 31 patients (13 males and 18 females) were diagnosed with mitochondrial diseases at our hospital. We conducted a retrospective review of the patients' sex, subclass of mitochondrial disease, age at onset of mitochondrial disease, frequency of CIP and the age at its onset, and the duration of survival. The age at onset or at the first diagnosis of the disorder that led to the clinical suspicion of mitochondrial disease was also examined. RESULTS: Twenty patients were sub-classified with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), 8 with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), and 3 with myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibers (MERRF). Nine patients were diagnosed with CIP, 8 of the 20 (40.0%) patients with MELAS, 0 of the 8 (0.0%) patients with CPEO, and 1 of the 3 (33.3%) patients with MERRF. The median age (range) at the diagnosis and the median age at onset of mitochondrial disease were 40 (17-69) and 25 (12-63) years in patients with CIP, and 49 (17-81) and 40 (11-71) years in patients without CIP. During the survey period, 5 patients (4 patients with MELAS and 1 with CPEO) died. The cause of death was cardiomyopathy in 2 patients with MELAS, cerebral infarction in 1 patient with MELAS, epilepsy and aspiration pneumonia in 1 patient with MELAS, and multiple metastases from gastric cancer and aspiration pneumonia in 1 patient with CPEO. CONCLUSION: Patients with CIP tend to have disorders that are suspected to be related to mitochondrial diseases at younger ages than are patients without CIP.
18266755	Mitochondrial respiratory chain defects: underlying etiology in various epileptic conditions. PURPOSE: To determine if defects in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes (MRCs) contribute to the etiology of childhood epilepsy. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and laboratory features of 48 epileptic patients (23 male, 25 female) with MRC defects that were confirmed by biochemical assays using muscle biopsies. RESULTS: (1) Thirty-five cases (72.9%) were MRC I deficient, one case (2.1%) was MRC II deficient, 11 cases (22.9%) were MRC IV deficient, and one case (2.1%) had combined MRC I and IV deficiencies. (2) In our clinical diagnosis, there were 10 cases (20.8%) with Leigh disease and one case each with myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS) or Alpers' disease (2.1%). Most of the remaining cases (75.0%) had uncategorized mitochondrial cytopathy with nonspecific encephalopathy. (3) For epileptic classification, there were two cases (4.2%) of Ohtahara syndrome, 10 cases (20.8%) of West syndrome, 12 cases (25.0%) of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, two cases (4.2%) of Landau-Kleffner syndrome, 14 cases (29.2%) of generalized epilepsy, and eight cases (16.7%) of partial epilepsy. (4) The mean age of seizure onset was 2.68 +/- 2.21 (range: 1 month - 5.5 years). (5) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse cortical atrophy in 34 cases (70.8%), basal ganglia signal changes in 18 cases (37.5%) and thalamus signal changes in 12 cases (25.0%). (6) A ketogenic diet produced clinical improvements, including seizure reduction and global functional improvement in 75% of 24 patients. CONCLUSIONS: MRC defects are one of the important causes of probably symptomatic childhood epilepsy. A ketogenic diet should be carefully considered for treatment of intractable epilepsy related to MRC defects.
29428506	8-year retrospective analysis of intravenous arginine therapy for acute metabolic strokes in pediatric mitochondrial disease. BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) arginine has been reported to ameliorate acute metabolic stroke symptoms in adult patients with Mitochondrial Encephalopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS) syndrome, where its therapeutic benefit is postulated to result from arginine acting as a nitric oxide donor to reverse vasospasm. Further, reduced plasma arginine may occur in mitochondrial disease since the biosynthesis of arginine's precursor, citrulline, requires ATP. Metabolic strokes occur across a wide array of primary mitochondrial diseases having diverse molecular etiologies that are likely to share similar pathophysiologic mechanisms. Therefore, IV arginine has been increasingly used for the acute clinical treatment of metabolic stroke across a broad mitochondrial disease population. METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of a large cohort of subjects who were under 18 years of age at IRB #08-6177 study enrollment and had molecularly-confirmed primary mitochondrial disease (n = 71, excluding the common MELAS m.3243A>G mutation). 9 unrelated subjects in this cohort received acute arginine IV treatment for one or more stroke-like episodes (n = 17 total episodes) between 2009 and 2016 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Retrospectively reviewed data included subject genotype, clinical symptoms, age, arginine dosing, neuroimaging (if performed), prophylactic therapies, and adverse events. RESULTS: Genetic etiologies of subjects who presented with acute metabolic strokes included 4 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) pathogenic point mutations, 1 mtDNA deletion, and 4 nuclear gene disorders. Subject age ranged from 19 months to 23 years at the time of any metabolic stroke episode (median, 8 years). 3 subjects had recurrent stroke episodes. 70% of subjects were on prophylactic arginine or citrulline therapy at the time of a stroke-like episode. IV arginine was initiated on initial presentation in 65% of cases. IV arginine was given for 1-7 days (median, 1 day). A positive clinical response to IV arginine occurred in 47% of stroke-like episodes; an additional 6% of episodes showed clinical benefit from multiple simultaneous treatments that included arginine, confounding sole interpretation of arginine effect. All IV arginine-responsive stroke-like episodes (n = 8) received treatment immediately on presentation (p = .003). Interestingly, the presence of unilateral symptoms strongly predicted arginine response (p = .02, Chi-Square); however, almost all of these cases immediately received IV arginine, confounding interpretation of causality direction. Suggestive trends toward increased IV arginine response were seen in subjects with mtDNA relative to nDNA mutations and in older pediatric subjects, although statistical significance was not reached possibly due to small sample size. No adverse events, including hypotensive episodes, from IV arginine therapy were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Single-center retrospective analysis suggests that IV arginine therapy yields significant therapeutic benefit with little risk in pediatric mitochondrial disease stroke subjects across a wide range of genetic etiologies beyond classical MELAS. Acute hemiplegic stroke, in particular, was highly responsive to IV arginine treatment. Prospective studies with consistent arginine dosing, and pre- and post-neuroimaging, will further inform the clinical utility of IV arginine therapy for acute metabolic stroke in pediatric mitochondrial disease.
12371926	MELAS: a neuropsychological and radiological follow-up study. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke. We report on a patient with long standing, full-blown mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). In contrast to earlier publications, detailed neuropsychological assessment revealed no dementia but a pattern of distinct cognitive deficits with marked impairment of visuo-constructive and executive functions. Focal lesions and progressing atrophy mainly of the basal ganglia and the temporo-parieto-occipital area with preservation of hippocampal and entorhinal structures were present. Furthermore, a 4-year follow-up assessment revealed an increasing deterioration of distinct cognitive functions, including phasic alertness, tactile functions and the discrimination of tone pitch and rhythm. This may be because of chronic regional metabolic disturbances, as there was no further stroke-like episode in that period of time.
21784818	Vision-threatening retinal abnormalities in chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Retinal abnormalities are common in inherited and acquired renal disease. This study determined the prevalence of retinal abnormalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 to 5. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: One hundred fifty patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 and 150 age- and gender-matched hospital patients with CKD stages 1 to 2 underwent bilateral retinal photography. These images were reviewed for incidental abnormalities, microvascular (Wong and Mitchell classification) and diabetic retinopathy (Airlie House criteria), and macular degeneration (Seddon classification). RESULTS: Three (2%) patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 had retinal features characteristic of inherited renal disease (atrophy in Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, Stroke-like episodes [MELAS] syndrome; and 2 with drusen in dense deposit disease). Fifty-nine (39%) patients had moderate-severe microvascular retinopathy (hemorrhages, exudates, etc.) compared with 19 (13%) with CKD stages 1 to 2. Forty-one (28%) had moderate-severe diabetic retinopathy (microaneurysms, exudates, etc.) compared with 16 (11%) with CKD stages 1 to 2. Ten (7%) had severe macular degeneration (geographic atrophy, hemorrhage, exudates, membranes) compared with one (1%) with CKD stages 1 to 2. Renal failure was an independent risk factor for microvascular retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. Eleven (7.3%) patients with renal failure and one (0.7%) with CKD stages 1 to 2 had previously unrecognized vision-threatening retinal abnormalities that required immediate ophthalmologic attention. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal abnormalities are common in CKD stages 3 to 5, and are more severe and more likely to threaten vision than in hospital patients with CKD stages 1 to 2.
17389800	Statins provoking MELAS syndrome. A case report. BACKGROUND: Statins inhibit the production of 2,3-dimethoxy,5-methyl,6-polyisoprene parabenzoquinone also known as ubiquinone or coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which is required for mitochondrial electron transport. Idiopathic or primary CoQ10 deficiencies have been known to cause mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. METHODS: We present the case of a patient with mitochondrial syndrome, consisting of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), whose symptoms were temporally related to statin therapy. CONCLUSION: Statins may provoke symptoms related to MELAS in susceptible individuals.
19722047	MELAS: clinical features, muscle biopsy and molecular genetics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze a series of Brazilian patients suffering from MELAS. METHOD: Ten patients with MELAS were studied with correlation between clinical findings, laboratorial data, electrophysiology, histochemical and molecular features. RESULTS: Blood lactate was increased in eight patients. Brain image studies revealed a stroke-like pattern in all patients. Muscle biopsy showed ralled-red fibers (RRF) in 90% of patients on modified Gomori-trichrome and in 100% on succinate dehydrogenase stains. Cytochrome c oxidase stain analysis indicated deficient activity in one patient and subsarcolemmal accumulation in seven patients. Strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels (SSV) occurred in six patients. The molecular analysis of tRNA (Leu(UUR)) gene by PCR/RLFP and direct sequencing showed the A3243G mutation on mtDNA in 4 patients. CONCLUSION: The muscle biopsy often confirmed the MELAS diagnosis by presence of RRF and SSV. Molecular analysis of tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene should not be the only diagnostic criteria for MELAS.
15760631	Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with MELAS. Localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) yields sensitive metabolic markers to provide insight into the pathophysiology of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in vivo. Findings in full MELAS syndrome at 1H MRS of the brain typically include severely elevated lactate and reduced N-acetylaspartate, glutamate, myo-inositol, and total creatine concentrations in stroke-like lesions. Similar but less extreme alterations are also common in gray matter (GM) regions that appear normal at magnetic resonance imaging. Phosphorus spectroscopy of peripheral muscle permits investigation of the bioenergetic status. A decline of the phosphorylation potential indicates a low energy reserve at rest. Phosphocreatine resynthesis during post-exercise recovery is delayed pointing to reduced mitochondrial capacity. As MRS is inherently non-invasive, follow-up studies can be performed to assess treatment response quantitatively.
18977334	Identification of novel mutations in five patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. MELAS, MERRF, LHON and NARP, are well-established mitochondrial syndromes associated with specific point mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). However, these recurrent mtDNA mutations account for only a minority of mitochondrial disease cases. To evaluate the impact of novel mtDNA mutations, we performed mtDNA sequence analysis in muscle and other tissues of 240 patients with different mitochondrial neuromuscular syndromes. We identified a total of 33 subjects with novel, private or uncommon mutations. Among these, five novel mutations were found in both paediatric and adult cases. We here report on the clinical description of these patients, as well as the biochemical and molecular genetic characterization of the corresponding mutations. Patients 1 and 2 showed changes in ND genes, patient 3 carried a heteroplasmic deletion in the COI gene, patients 4 and 5 carried heteroplasmic mutations in tRNA(Trp) and tRNA(Phe), respectively. Altogether, these data indicate that mtDNA analysis must become part of the routine screening for mitochondrial disorders.
14529468	Medicinal and genetic approaches to the treatment of mitochondrial disease. Although great progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular bases of mitochondrial disorders due to defects in the respiratory chain, little exists in the way of rational therapy. Possible therapeutic approaches include: palliative therapy; removal of noxious metabolites; administration of artificial electron acceptors, metabolites, and free radical scavengers; genetic counseling; and gene therapy. There has been progress with each of these approaches, although much work remains to be done. Finally, a novel approach to treating a specific mitochondrial disorder, MELAS, is presented.
32541454	Mitochondrial DNA 10158T>C mutation in a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome: A case-report and literature review (CARE-complaint). RATIONALE: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke- like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is caused by mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation disorder. It is a rare clinical metabolic disease involved with multiple systems. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 22-year-old patient presented with limb convulsion accompanied by loss of consciousness, headache, partial blindness, blurred vision, and so on. DIAGNOSES: Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a high-intensity area in bilateral occipital cortex, left parietal lobe and cerebellum on diffusion-weighted imaging. These focus did not distribute as vascular territory. The pathological examination of skeletal muscle revealed several succinate dehydrogenase reactive vessels with overreaction and increased content of lipid droplets in some muscle fibers. Genetic testing showed that the patient carried m.10158T>C mutation. INTERVENTIONS: She was provided with traditional arginine hydrochloride therapy and orally medication of coenzyme Q (10 mg). OUTCOMES: Mitochondrial DNA of blood and hair follicle of patient carried m.10158T>C mutation LESSONS:: For the suspected patients of MELAS syndrome, if the hot-spot mutation test is negative, more detection sites should be selected.
11156767	Diffusion-weighted MR imaging in a case of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes. In a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS), both T2- and diffusion-weighted MR imaging revealed lesions as hyperintense areas in the occipital lobes early after strokelike episodes. In these lesions, no significant reduction in apparent diffusion coefficient was noted. Apparent diffusion coefficient mapping may help to differentiate strokelike episodes in MELAS from acute ischemic stroke. The strokelike episodes may be related to vasogenic edema and hyperperfusion, which were suggested by our single-photon emission CT and MR imaging studies.
25403068	[A case of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episode/Leigh overlap syndrome]. We experienced a case in which mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) was identified as complications following the onset of Leigh syndrome along with a 10191 T>C mutation of the mitochondrial gene. The case pertains to a 26-year-old woman. The disease appeared when she was 11 years old due to divergent strabismus, at which point a diagnosis of juvenile Leigh syndrome was made. Many infraction images not conforming to the vessel region were observed upon a brain MRI which was performed at 26 years of age, thus leading to her being diagnosed with MELAS as a complication. Upoon bibliographical consideration, it was speculated that the clinical features of MELAS/Leigh overlap syndrome clearly differ from Leigh syndrome in terms of age of onset, symptoms, and prognosis. Pleiotropic genetic factors including heteroplasmy were presumed to be involved in the diverse phenotype of overlap syndrome.
11800289	Laboratory approach to mitochondrial diseases. Dysfunction in mitochondrial processes has been related to several pathologies. In these disorders, the cell suffers oxidative imbalance that is mostly due to defects in pyruvate metabolism, mitochondrial fatty acids oxidation, the citric acid cycle or electron transport by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These metabolic alterations produce mitochondrial diseases that have been related to inherited syndromes, such as MERRF or MELAS. The main affected organs are brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, heart and liver, because of the high energetic demand and the oxidative metabolism. Moreover, the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative processes, such as Parkinson disease or Alzheimer disease, as well as ageing, has been shown. Because mitochondrias are the target of several xenobiotics, such as aspirin, AZT or alcohol consumption, mitochondrial impairment has also been proposed as a mechanism of toxicity. Most laboratory tests that are available in the diagnosis of mitochondrial illness are assayed in tissue biopsies and are usually difficult to interpret. Recently, it has been shown that non-invasive techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance or the 2-keto[1-(13)C]isocaproic acid breath test, may be useful to assess mitochondrial function. This article attempts to show the laboratory approach to mitochondrial diseases, reviewing new techniques that could be of great value in the research of mitochondrial function, such as the 2-keto[1-(13)C]isocaproic breath test.
23493219	Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome mimicking herpes simplex encephalitis on imaging studies. We present a case in which mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome mimicked the clinical and radiological signs of herpes simplex encephalitis. In a patient with subacute encephalopathy, on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, lesions were present in both temporal lobes extending to both insular regions with sparing of the lentiform nuclei and in both posterior straight and cingulate gyri. Final diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome was based on biochemical investigations on cerebrospinal fluid, electromyogram, muscle biopsy, and genetic analysis. On diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion restriction was present in some parts of the lesions but not throughout the entire lesions. We suggest that this could be an important sign in the differential diagnosis with herpes simplex encephalitis.
19091329	Progressive carotid artery stenosis with a novel tRNA phenylalanine mitochondrial DNA mutation. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a distinct clinical syndrome caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. The pathogenesis of stroke-like episodes remains unknown but major vessels stenosis is not a cause of stroke-like episodes. We describe a novel heteroplasmic G617A transition in the mitochondrial transfer RNA phenylalanine gene in a patient with encephalomyopathy who presented with recurrent embolic ischemic strokes accompanied by transient occlusion of middle cerebral, anterior cerebral and internal carotid arteries. These ischemic strokes were presumed to be artery-to artery embolisms associated with carotid artery stenosis. Single muscle fiber analysis revealed the pathogenicity of the mutation although its causative role on carotid artery stenosis remains to be elucidated. This case expands phenotypic spectrum of mitochondrial disorders in terms of macroangiopathy, but macroangiopathy-related ischemic strokes should be distinguished from classic stroke-like episodes of MELAS that are speculated to be microangioapthy-related or non-ischemic neurovascular events.
23150108	An unusual case of paralytic ileus. A 26-year-old female patient presented with the clinical picture of an acute ileus. Since childhood the patient has been diagnosed as having a MELAS syndrome, a mitochondriopathy. A subtotal colectomy was performed some years ago because of a similar ileus episode. The further diagnostic work-up revealed an expanded small intestine in abdominal radiography. Laboratory analysis showed increased levels of serum lactate with a consecutive respiratory compensated metabolic acidosis. A conservative treatment regime with nasogastric tube, fluid therapy, parental nutrition via peripheral veins and peristalsis inducing drugs was initiated, but did not resolve ileus symptoms. Under the hypothesis that in MELAS syndrome the ileus-related catabolic state aggravates the ileus symptoms in terms of a circulus vitiosus, we started high-caloric parenteral nutrition by using a central venous catheter. A few hours after this intervention, a clear clinical improvement could be observed. Since this initial presentation, the patient was admitted to our hospital several times with the same ileus symptoms. Each of the episodes was successfully and rapidly treated by this high-caloric parenteral nutrition therapy. The reproducible rapid clinical improvement after starting parenteral nutrition supports the hypothesis that an optimal energy supply is the key therapy not only for cerebral but also for gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with MELAS syndrome.
10377830	[Neuroradiologic and pathologic approaches to the diagnosis of dementia syndrome]. "Dementia" is the general term used to describe the symptom complex of intellectual deterioration in adult. Interest in accurately diagnosing dementia is a relatively recent phenomenon. This is reflected in both the development of neuroradiologic examinations, including MRI and SPECT as well as PET, and marked increase in both the incidence and prevalence of dementia associated with increase of the elderly population. The clinical evaluation remains the key to the differential diagnosis. Most cases of "typical dementia" can be diagnosed accurately by clinical criteria. However, the definitive diagnosis of "atypical dementia" still requires intensive neuroradiologic studies and histologic examination of brain to identify characteristic structural changes. In this study, we presented both neuroradiologic and neuropathologic information, which is important in diagnosing diseases that present atypical dementia syndrome. These diseases are as follows; AIDS, isolated CNS angiitis, CO intoxication. Wernicke encephalopathy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Nasu disease, CADASIL, CARASIL, glioblastoma, primary CNS lymphoma, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, mitochondrial encephalopathy (MELAS), and subcortical vascular dementias.
33762456	[Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes(MELAS)]. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes(MELAS)is the most dominant form of mitochondrial diseases, presenting with headaches, seizures, and stroke-like episodes. Stroke-like episodes is a distinguishing feature of MELAS. Symptoms appear before the age of 20 years in 65-76% of patients. For the clinical diagnosis of MELAS, evidence of lactate accumulation in the central nervous system is important. The radiographic features of MELAS are stroke-like lesions in the affected brain areas, primarily the occipito-parietal or posterior temporal lobe. MRI shows high signal intensities on T2-weighted or FLAIR images. The cerebral blood flow in lesions can be increased in the acute phase. MR spectroscopy(MRS)shows a lactate peak in the brain lesions, which is important evidence of lactate accumulation. In pediatric or young adult patients with occipito-parietal stroke-like lesions, a prominent lactate peak in MRS is the key radiographic sign that supports the diagnosis of MELAS.
18849057	[l-arginine efficiency in MELAS syndrome. A case report]. INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stoke-like episodes (MELAS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations of mitochondrial DNA. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 12-year-old child with MELAS syndrome who presented with recurrent migraine-like headache and sudden blindness suggesting stroke-like episodes. Furthermore, he developed progressive muscular impairment with bilateral hearing loss. Serum lactate and pyruvate levels were elevated and the muscle biopsy showed an aspect of red-ragged fibers with Gomori trichrome. Brain imaging showed calcifications of basal ganglia on the CT scan and a parieto-occipital high signal on diffusion-weighted MRI. A genetic analysis was not performed but the presence of hearing loss in the patient's mother was suggestive of maternal transmission. Stroke-like episodes in the form of migraine-like headache and blindness were the patient's major complaint and did not improve despite analgesic drugs. After oral administration of l-arginine at the dose of 0.4mg/kg per day, stroke-like symptoms totally and rapidly disappeared. DISCUSSION: The efficiency of l-arginine in stroke-like episodes was initially reported then confirmed in a controlled study. The pathophysiology of stoke-like episodes and the mechanisms underlying the action of l-arginine are discussed.
30968563	Case study of an inborn error manifested in the elderly: A woman with adult-onset mitochondrial disease mimicking systemic vasculitis. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders presenting mainly during infancy due to pathological dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. We report a case of mitochondrial disease in an elderly woman complaining of generalized myalgia. A 69-year-old woman was admitted due to fatigue, general weakness, and a drowsy mental status. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated multifocal lesions of increased T2 signal intensity, and laboratory findings were consistent with Fanconi syndrome. During her hospital course, she developed seizures, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure. A muscle biopsy demonstrated ragged-red fibers in the muscle tissues seen in mitochondrial myopathy. We confirmed an 8 kb deletion in her mitochondrial DNA. Following treatment with l-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and supportive measures, brain lesions on MRI scans disappeared, and the general symptoms gradually improved.
32881886	L-arginine effects on cerebrovascular reactivity, perfusion and neurovascular coupling in MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) syndrome. OBJECTIVE: We previously showed that MELAS patients have decreased cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) (p<= 0.002) and increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) (p<0.0026); changes correlated with disease severity and % mutant mtDNA (inversely for CVR; directly for CBF). We ran a prospective pilot in 3 MELAS sibs (m.3243A>G tRNALeu(UUR)) with variable % mutant blood mtDNA to assess effects of L-Arginine (L-Arg) (single dose and 6-wk steady-state trial) on regional CBF, arterial CVR and neurovascular coupling. METHODS: Patients were studied with 3T MRI using arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure CBF and changes in % Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal to changes in arterial partial pressure of CO2 to measure CVR. Task fMRI consisted of an alternating black and white checkerboard to evaluate visual cortex response in MELAS and controls. RESULTS: Following L-Arg, there was restoration of serum Arg (76-230 muM) in MELAS sibs and a trend towards increasing CVR in frontal and corresponding decrease in occipital cortex; CVR was unchanged globally. There was a 29-37% reduction in baseline CBF in one patient following 6 wks of L-Arg. Pre-treatment fMRI activation in response to visual cortex stimulus was markedly decreased in the same patient compared to controls in primary visual striate cortex V1 and extrastriate regions V2 to V5 with a marked increase toward control values following a single dose and 6 wks of L-Arg. CONCLUSION: Proposed "healing" effect may be due to more efficient utilization of energy substrates with increased cellular energy balances and ensuing reduction in signalling pathways that augment flow in the untreated state. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This prospective pilot study provides Class III evidence that oral L-Arginine (100 mg/kg single dose or 100 mg/kg three times daily po X 6 weeks) normalizes resting blood flow from elevated pre-treatment levels in patients with MELAS syndrome, selectively increases their CVR from reduced pre-treatment levels in regions most impaired at the expense of less abnormal regions, and normalizes reduced BOLD fMRI activation in response to visual cortex stimulus.

14581687	Aggressive confusional state as a clinical manifestation of status epilepticus in MELAS. 
34106496	Work-up of MERRF and MELAS fatalities requires autopsy of the brain and revision of intra-vitam investigations. 
15351082	Clinical features of A3243G mitochondrial tRNA mutation. Mitochondrial cytopathy is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a wide range of clinical features. To evaluate the incidence and clinical heterogeneity of A3243G mitochondrial tRNA mutation in the Korean population, we evaluated patients who were clinically suggestive of having mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Eighty-five patients were included in this study. All showed clinical features of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and had three or more of the following clinical manifestations: (1) psychomotor regression, (2) hyperlacticacidemia, (3) recurrent stoke-like episodes, (4) idiopathic cardiomyopathy, (5) sensoryneural hearing loss, (6) diabetes mellitus, (7) myopathy, (8) renal disease and (9) relatives with known mitochondrial disease. The patients were clinically classified as MELAS, MERRF, Leigh syndrome, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and uncertain. Of the 85 patients, 19 had the A3243G mutation (22.3%). Thirty-one patients showed typical clinical characteristics of MELAS. Fourteen of those 31 patients had A3243G mutation (45.1%). Four patients harboring A3243G mutations showed atypical and heterogeneous clinical features, unlike MELAS. This study revealed the frequent occurrence of A3243G mutation in Korean patients with mitochondrial disorders and their clinical features can be heterogeneous. It will be helpful to screen the presence of A3243G mutation for the genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy in Korea.
20408961	Phenotypic patterns of MELAS/LS overlap syndrome associated with m.13513G>A mutation, and neuropathological findings in one autopsy case. The 13513G>A mutation in the ND5 gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is usually associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactate acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), or Leigh syndrome (LS). In this study, we describe three young Chinese patients with MELAS/LS overlap syndrome who carried the m.13513G>A mutation. Clinical and MRI features were characteristic of both MELAS and LS. Interestingly, the clinical presentation of this overlap syndrome could be variable depending on the degree of relative contribution of MELAS and LS, that is, MELAS as the initial presenting syndrome, LS as the predominant syndrome, or both MELAS and LS appearing at the same time. The final brain MRI showed findings characteristic of both MELAS and LS, with asymmetrical lesions in the cortex and subcortical white matter of the occipital, temporal, and frontal lobes (MELAS), and bilateral and symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem (LS). Brain autopsy in one case revealed infarct-like lesions in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and brainstem, providing further insight into the distribution of the pathological lesions in MELAS/LS overlap syndrome. This is the first report of the brain pathological changes in a patient with m.13513G>A mutation. The spatial distribution of infarct-like lesions in the brain could explain the symptoms in MELAS/LS overlap syndrome.
17664998	Screening for MELAS mutations in young patients with stroke of undetermined origin. PURPOSE: It has been suggested that mitochondrial disease may be responsible for a substantial proportion of strokes of indetermined origin. We have preliminarily screened for MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) mutations in young patients with cryptogenic strokes. METHOD: The mitochondrial mutations A3243G and T3271C were investigated in 38 subjects aged less than 46 years. Group 1: 15 patients with cryptogenic strokes; Group 2: 3 patients with diagnosis of MELAS syndrome, including stroke-like episodes; Group 3: 20 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The A3243G mutation was absent in all subjects in Groups 1 and 3 but was present in all subjects in Group 2. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support screening for these mutations to diagnose oligosymptomatic forms of MELAS in cryptogenic strokes in the absence of other features of the syndrome. We suggest that clinical findings should guide mitochondrial genetic testing.
30955266	[Ultrastructural and clinical findings of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy:report of 27 cases]. Objective: To investigate the ultrastructural features of muscle in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy for its diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Methods: The clinical data of 27 mitochondrial encephalomyopathy patients who underwent left or right biceps brachii muscle biopsy at Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University from July 2006 to August 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The muscle biopsy specimens were examined underlight microscope and transmission electron microscope. Results: There were 27 patients (17 males, 10 females) with an age range of 12 to 62 years (mean 29 years). The age of onset ranged from 3 to 38 years. The course of disease ranged from 1 month to 24 years. Twenty-two cases presented with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, four with myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) syndrome, and one with chronic progressive paralysis of extraocular muscle (CPEO) syndrome. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed abundant ragged red fibers and strongly SDH-reactive vessel. Genetic studies showed 17 of 22 cases of MELAS syndrome had A3243G mutation, and the other 5 cases had no abnormality. A8344G mutation was found in 3 of 4 cases of MERRF syndrome. No single or multiple mtDNA mutations were found in the single case of CPEO. Transmission electron microscopy of all 27 cases showed diffuse proliferation of mitochondria between the myofibrils and beneath the sarcolemma, with increased spacing between muscle cells. Seven cases showed numerous glycogen and four showed subsarcolemmal lipid droplets, 13 cases showed unusual mitochondrial morphology, including mitochondrial electron-dense substances and paracrystal line inclusions ("parking lot" change)in eight cases. Conclusions: Transmission electron microscopy shows significant differences in ultrastructural pathological changes among different patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Some patients with mild clinical symptoms have increased mitochondrial number, increased metabolism of glycogen and lipid droplets, while others with severe clinical symptoms have abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Typical crystalloid inclusions are found in mitochondria, which are of great value in the diagnosis of this disease.
12898076	Serial diffusion-weighted imaging in a patient with MELAS and presumed cytotoxic oedema. A patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) was studied with serial diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) after stroke-like episodes and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured in an infarct-like lesion. In the acute and subacute stages, the affected area gave high signal on DWI and its ADC was much lower than that in a normal control region. In the chronic stage, the ADC became higher than that in normal brain. We therefore suggest that the stroke-like episodes did not cause vasogenic oedema but were related to energy failure and cytotoxic oedema.
27562097	Stroke-like episodes, peri-episodic seizures, and MELAS mutations. PURPOSE: Stroke-like episodes (SLEs) are a hallmark of various mitochondrial disorders, in particular MELAS syndrome. SLEs manifest with vasogenic oedema (DWI and ADC hyperintensity) or partial cytotoxic oedema (DWI hyperintensity, ADC hypointensity) in the acute and subacute stage, and with gyriform T1-hyperintensity (cortical necrosis) in the chronic stage. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: SLEs must be clearly distinguished from ischaemic stroke, since management of these two entities is different. SLEs may go along with or without seizures or epileptiform discharges on EEG. However, in MELAS syndrome seizures may also occur in the absence of SLEs. Focal and generalised seizures have been reported but it is currently unknown if the one or the other prevail. SLEs with and without seizures may respond to NO-precursors l-arginine, succinate, or citrulline. As a supportive measure a ketogenic diet should be initiated. Seizures prior to or during a SLE or paroxysmal EEG-activity during a SLE should be initially treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with low mitochondrion-toxicity. Only in case these AEDs are ineffective, AEDs with higher mitochondrion-toxicity should be added. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: All patients with SLEs need to have an EEG recorded irrespective if they have manifesting seizures or not. There are no mtDNA or nDNA mutations which predispose for SLEs with seizures.
20818727	The use of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. Mutations in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA impacting mitochondrial function result in disease manifestations ranging from early death to abnormalities in all major organ systems and to symptoms that can be largely confined to muscle fatigue. The definitive diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder can be difficult to establish. When the constellation of symptoms is suggestive of mitochondrial disease, neuroimaging features may be diagnostic and suggestive, can help direct further workup, and can help to further characterize the underlying brain abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging changes may be nonspecific, such as atrophy (both general and involving specific structures, such as cerebellum), more suggestive of particular disorders such as focal and often bilateral lesions confined to deep brain nuclei, or clearly characteristic of a given disorder such as stroke-like lesions that do not respect vascular boundaries in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode (MELAS). White matter hyperintensities with or without associated gray matter involvement may also be observed. Across patients and discrete disease subtypes (e.g., MELAS, Leigh syndrome, etc.), patterns of these features are helpful for diagnosis. However, it is also true that marked variability in expression occurs in all mitochondrial disease subtypes, illustrative of the complexity of the disease process. The present review summarizes the role of neuroimaging in the diagnosis and characterization of patients with suspected mitochondrial disease.
11293491	Diffusion-weighted image and MR spectroscopic analysis of a case of MELAS with repeated attacks. We report the clinical and MR manifestations of an 18 year-old girl with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. Recurrent status epilepticus caused reversible cytotoxic edema on diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Initial and one month follow-up MR spectroscopy, after seizure control, showed some discrepancies in the ratio of metabolites. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) partially recovered (NAA/creatine (Cr) ratio: 1.27-->1.84). This was because of a normalization of decreased NAA due to cellular dysfunction as a result of status epilepticus. A low ratio of NAA/Cr due to abnormal mitochondria remained in the decreased state. Reversible NAA/Cr ratios in the acute lesion suggested that NAA reflects the neuronal function as well as the level of neuronal structural damage. The altered NAA/Cr ratio better correlated with the abnormal signal intensity area of T2-weighted images (T2WI) and DWI than the lactate (Lac)/Cr ratio. With conservative treatment with anti-epileptics not accompanied by coenzyme Q or sodium dichloroacetate, lactate persistently increased (Lac/Cr ratio: 1.01-->1.21) because of the continued production of lactate in cells with respiratory deficiency, which is the main pathology of MELAS.
23243073	High risk of severe cardiac adverse events in patients with mitochondrial m.3243A>G mutation. OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term incidence of cardiac life-threatening complications and death in patients with the m.3243A>G mutation, and to identify cardiac prognostic factors. METHODS: We retrospectively included patients carrying the m.3243A>G mutation who were admitted to the Neuromuscular Disease Clinic of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital between January 1992 and December 2010. We collected information relative to their yearly neurologic and cardiac investigations, their mutation load in blood, urine, and muscle at initial admission, and the occurrence of cardiac life-threatening adverse events and death during follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (median age = 47 years [36-55 years], men = 13) were included, of whom 38 had clinical manifestations of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and 3 were asymptomatic. One patient had a personal history of cardiac transplantation. Cardiac investigations displayed left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular dysfunction, or both abnormalities in 18 patients, along with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in 7, conduction system disease in 4, and atrial fibrillation in 1. Over a median 5-year (3-9 years) follow-up period, 11 patients died, including 3 due to heart failure; 7 had life-threatening adverse events, including 6 hospitalizations for severe heart failure and 1 resuscitated cardiac arrest. By multivariate analysis, left ventricular hypertrophy was the only parameter independently associated with occurrence of cardiac adverse events. CONCLUSION: Patients with the m.3243A>G mutation have a high incidence of cardiac death and life-threatening adverse events. Left ventricular hypertrophy was the only parameter independently associated with occurrence of these events.
10637870	[Coma associated with migraine]. INTRODUCTION: Basilar migraine is a particular form of migraine with an aura in which crises of headache are accompanied by symptoms of dysfunction in the vertebro-basilar territory, including alteration of consciousness in the form of stupor or coma. CLINICAL CASES: We report four patients, three men of 14, 17 and 83 years of age and one woman of 21. All had previous histories of migraine and presented with transitory episodes of coma. During the coma, the woman woke up spontaneously with intense bulimia. In the three men, it was seen, on injecting flumazenil, that the state of consciousness and the EEG returned to normal transiently. Neuroimaging studies (CT and MR) were normal in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine-coma is an exceptional, emergency condition in which structural, infectious, toxic and metabolic pathology of the Central Nervous System should be ruled out. As well as in patients with basilar migraine, the association of migraine and coma may also be seen in patients with familial hemiplegic migraine and CADASIL and MELAS syndromes. It may be that gabaergic mechanisms are involved in the theoretical dysfunction of the ascending reticular activating system causing alteration of consciousness, since in the three patients in whom flumazenil was injected, there was a response.
27009201	Reactive oxygen species stimulate mitochondrial allele segregation toward homoplasmy in human cells. Mitochondria that contain a mixture of mutant and wild-type mitochondrial (mt) DNA copies are heteroplasmic. In humans, homoplasmy is restored during early oogenesis and reprogramming of somatic cells, but the mechanism of mt-allele segregation remains unknown. In budding yeast, homoplasmy is restored by head-to-tail concatemer formation in mother cells by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced rolling-circle replication and selective transmission of concatemers to daughter cells, but this mechanism is not obvious in higher eukaryotes. Here, using heteroplasmic m.3243A > G primary fibroblast cells derived from MELAS patients treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), we show that an optimal ROS level promotes mt-allele segregation toward wild-type and mutant mtDNA homoplasmy. Enhanced ROS level reduced the amount of intact mtDNA replication templates but increased linear tandem multimers linked by head-to-tail unit-sized mtDNA (mtDNA concatemers). ROS-triggered mt-allele segregation correlated with mtDNA-concatemer production and enabled transmission of multiple identical mt-genome copies as a single unit. Our results support a mechanism by which mt-allele segregation toward mt-homoplasmy is mediated by concatemers.
12013954	[MELAS sudden death due to paroxysmal arrhythmia]. 
24338029	MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome due to the m.3291T>C mutation. We report the case of a 19-year-old Chinese female harboring the m.3291T>C mutation in the MT-TL1 gene encoding the mitochondrial transfer RNA for leucine. She presented with a complex phenotype characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, frequent myoclonus seizures, recurrent stroke-like episodes, migraine-like headaches with nausea and vomiting, and elevated resting lactate blood level. It is known that the myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and myoclonus epilepsy, while that the mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is characterized by recurrent stroke-like episodes, migraine-like headaches, and elevated resting lactate blood level. So the patient's clinical manifestations suggest the presence of a MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome. Muscle biopsy of the patient showed the presence of numerous scattered ragged-red fibers, some cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibers, and several strongly succinate dehygrogenase-reactive vessels, suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. Direct sequencing of the complete mitochondrial genome of the proband revealed no mutations other than the T-to-C transition at nucleotide position 3291. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the proband and her family revealed maternal inheritance of the mutation in a heteroplasmic manner. The analysis of aerobic respiration and glycolysis demonstrated that the fibroblasts from the patient had mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest that the m.3291T>C is pathogenic. This study is the first to describe the m.3291T>C mutation in association with the MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome. 
30701423	Retinal dystrophy associated with a single-base deletion mutation in mitochondrial DNA 3271 in patient with MELAS syndrome. PURPOSE: Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acid and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Approximately 80% of MELAS patients have an A > G transition mutation at nucleotide pair 3243 in the mitochondrial DNA, m.3243A > G. There are also MELAS patients with a one-base deletion at nucleotide pair 3271 in the mitochondrial DNA, m.3271delT, but these cases are very rare. We report a case of MELAS with the m.3271delT and describe the retinal structure and electrophysiological alterations. METHODS: The retinal structure and function of a 37-year-old woman who was referred to our clinic for of nyctalopia were studied. Standard ophthalmological examinations including the medical history, measurements of the best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressures, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein angiography, fundus autofluorescence, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), full-field electroretinography (ERG), and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) were performed. RESULTS: Fundus examination showed bilateral hypopigmentary changes of the retinal pigment epithelium which extended from the posterior pole to the equator. Fluorescein angiography showed patchy hyperfluorescence due to window defects at the atrophic areas. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrated mild hyperfluorescent lesions in both eyes. SD-OCT showed that the interdigitation zone was indistinct in both eyes, and the inner nuclear layer was slightly thinner. The amplitudes of the rod, cone, and 30-Hz flicker ERGs were severely reduced, and the implicit times were prolonged. The a- and b-waves of the bright-flash mixed rod-cone ERGs were also reduced. The dark-adapted oscillatory potentials were reduced. The amplitudes of the mfERGs were severely depressed except at the fovea in both eyes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the RPE atrophy was wider and the rod dysfunction was more severe affected than that of previously reported MELAS cases with the m.3243A > G mutation.
17508156	The role of the clinician in interpreting conventional neuroimaging findings in migraine patients. Changes in cerebral white matter at CT or MRI have been reported in patients with migraine, especially in those with migraine with aura. Similar pictures may be present in asymptomatic subjects, and their nature is not completely understood, but their infarct-like nature is strongly suggested. Clinicians play an important role in the evaluation of those migraine patients in whom these nonspecific abnormalities are present. We suggest ruling out specific syndromes in which migraine attacks are associated with white matter changes (CADASIL, MELAS, multiple sclerosis and central nervous system vasculitis), as well as evaluating the presence of different vascular risk factors (genetic prothrombotic factors, patent foramen ovale, use of oral contraceptives, etc.). Their possible causative role in MRI lesions and in enhancing the risk of a negative clinical evolution must be considered in each individual case.
16866982	Molecular neuropathology of MELAS: level of heteroplasmy in individual neurones and evidence of extensive vascular involvement. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disease is an important genetic cause of neurological disability. A variety of different clinical features are observed and one of the most common phenotypes is MELAS (Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes). The majority of patients with MELAS have the 3243A>G mtDNA mutation. The neuropathology is dominated by multifocal infarct-like lesions in the posterior cortex, thought to underlie the stroke-like episodes seen in patients. To investigate the relationship between mtDNA mutation load, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuropathological features in MELAS, we studied individual neurones from several brain regions of two individuals with the 3243A>G mutation using dual cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) histochemistry, and Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Lenght Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. We found a low number of COX-deficient neurones in all brain regions. There appeared to be no correlation between the threshold level for the 3243A>G mutation to cause COX deficiency within single neurones and the degree of pathology in affected brain regions. The most severe COX deficiency associated with the highest proportion of mutated mtDNA was present in the walls of the leptomeningeal and cortical blood vessels in all brain regions. We conclude that vascular mitochondrial dysfunction is important in the pathogenesis of the stroke-like episodes in MELAS patients. As migraine is a commonly encountered feature in MELAS, we propose that coupling of the vascular mitochondrial dysfunction with cortical spreading depression (CSD) might underlie the selective distribution of ischaemic lesions in the posterior cortex in these patients.
25993630	L-Arginine Affects Aerobic Capacity and Muscle Metabolism in MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-Like Episodes) Syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of L-arginine (L-Arg) on total body aerobic capacity and muscle metabolism as assessed by (31)Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) in patients with MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes) syndrome. METHODS: We performed a case control study in 3 MELAS siblings (m.3243A>G tRNA(leu(UUR)) in MTTL1 gene) with different % blood mutant mtDNA to evaluate total body maximal aerobic capacity (VO(2peak)) using graded cycle ergometry and muscle metabolism using 31P-MRS. We then ran a clinical trial pilot study in MELAS sibs to assess response of these parameters to single dose and a 6-week steady-state trial of oral L-Arginine. RESULTS: At baseline (no L-Arg), MELAS had lower serum Arg (p = 0.001). On 3(1)P-MRS muscle at rest, MELAS subjects had increased phosphocreatine (PCr) (p = 0.05), decreased ATP (p = 0.018), and decreased intracellular Mg(2+) (p = 0.0002) when compared to matched controls. With L-arginine therapy, the following trends were noted in MELAS siblings on cycle ergometry: (1) increase in mean % maximum work at anaerobic threshold (AT) (2) increase in % maximum heart rate at AT (3) small increase in VO(2peak). On (31)P-MRS the following mean trends were noted: (1) A blunted decrease in pH after exercise (less acidosis) (2) increase in Pi/PCr ratio (ADP) suggesting increased work capacity (3) a faster half time of PCr recovery (marker of mitochondrial activity) following 5 minutes of moderate intensity exercise (4) increase in torque. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest an improvement in aerobic capacity and muscle metabolism in MELAS subjects in response to supplementation with L-Arg. Intramyocellular hypomagnesemia is a novel finding that warrants further study. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: Class III evidence that L-arginine improves aerobic capacity and muscle metabolism in MELAS subjects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01603446.

24906873	Macular dystrophy associated with the mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation: pericentral pigment deposits or atrophy? Report of two cases and review of the literature. BACKGROUND: The A3243G point mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is associated with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and MIDD syndromes (maternally inherited diabetes and deafness). Both MELAS and MIDD patients can present with visual symptoms due to a retinopathy, sometimes before the genetic diagnosis is made. CASE PRESENTATION: Patient 1: 46 year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and hearing loss was referred for an unspecified maculopathy detected during screening evaluation for diabetic retinopathy. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Fundus examination showed bilateral macular and peripapillary hyperpigmented/depigmented areas.Patient 2: 45 year-old woman was referred for recent vision loss in her left eye. History was remarkable for chronic fatigue, migraine and diffuse muscular pain. Visual acuity was 20/20 in her right eye and 20/30 in her left eye. Fundus exhibited several nummular perifoveal islands of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy and adjacent pale deposits in both eyes.Retinal anatomy was investigated with autofluorescence, retinal angiography and optical coherence tomography. Retinal function was assessed with automated static perimetry, full-field and multifocal electroretinography and electro-oculography. Genetic testing of mtDNA identified a point mutation at the locus 3243. CONCLUSION: Observation of RPE abnormalities in the context of suggestive systemic findings should prompt mtDNA testing.
35659503	Screening and prevalence of cardiac abnormalities on electro- and echocardiography in a large cohort of patients with mitochondrial disease. BACKGROUND: In patients with primary mitochondrial disease (MD), screening with electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is warranted according to current guidelines as structural cardiac abnormalities are frequent. This study aims to evaluate the cardiac phenotype of a large Dutch cohort of patients with MD and investigates whether ECG alone is sufficient for predicting structural cardiac abnormalities on TTE. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, genetically confirmed MD patients >18 years old with an available ECG and TTE were included. Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Scale for Adults (NMDAS) scores were assessed. ECG's were evaluated for rhythm and conduction disorders, voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and repolarization disorders. Echocardiographic evaluation included left and right ventricular volumes and function, and presence of LVH or concentric remodeling. RESULTS: In total, 200 MD patients were included with a median age of 45 years (IQR; 37-57) of whom 36% were male. Of all MD patients, 35% had abnormalities on ECG and 61% on TTE. Most frequent structural cardiac abnormalities on TTE were: global longitudinal strain > - 18% (54%), concentric remodeling (27%) and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction <52% (14%). Patients with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) had the highest prevalence of ECG abnormalities (50% and 47%). TTE abnormalities were most prevalent in patients with MIDD (75%), followed by mitochondrial myopathy (MM) (55%), MELAS (47%) and Mitochondrial Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF) (47%). MD patients with a high disease severity (NMDAS >=21) had a higher prevalence of ECG abnormalities (44%, p = 0.039) and structural cardiac abnormalities (72%, p = 0.004) compared to patients with a NMDAS score of 11-20 and <= 10 (ECG: 34% and 19%; TTE: 63% and 39%). ECG abnormalities had a positive predictive value of 74% and a negative predictive value of 53% for structural cardiac abnormalities on TTE. CONCLUSION: MD patients frequently have cardiac involvement especially patients with MIDD, MELAS or high NMDAS score. ECG as sole screening parameter is insufficient to detect structural cardiac abnormalities.
22418087	Pursuit-paretic and epileptic nystagmus in MELAS. A 27-year-old man with MELAS 3243 mutation developed a right homonymous hemianopia, left beating nystagmus, and impaired smooth pursuit (SP) to the left. Intermittently, the left beating nystagmus changed to right beating with rightward eye and head deviation and associated altered mental status. Each episode lasted several minutes. MRI revealed restricted diffusion in left parieto-temporo-occipital cortices. During the ictus, electroencephalogram showed epileptic discharges in the left temporo-occipital region, and single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated hyperperfusion in the same area. The interictal left beating nystagmus may be ascribed to contralesional bias of SP imbalance since the parieto-temporo-occipital region is involved in the generation of SP. The ictal right beating nystagmus and rightward head and eye deviation indicate coactivation of the SP areas and parietal eye field. This report documents the novel co-occurrence of pursuit-paretic and epileptic nystagmus.
10935234	[Aspects of neuropathy in mitochondrial diseases]. INTRODUCTION: The existence of neuropathy has been described in mitochondrial disorders such as MELAS, MERRF, Leigh's syndrome, the Kearns-Saye syndrome, myoneurogastro-intestinal encephalopathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia and constitutes a basic component of the NARP (neuropathy, ataxia and retinosis pigmentosa). However, the general prevalence of the neuropathy and its characteristics within the mitochondrial encephalopathies is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the neuropathy and try to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within study guidelines, we made a retrospective study of 27 patients, diagnosed as having mitochondrial disease, who had had neurophysiological studies (EMG-ENG). In those in whom neuropathy had been found we analysed the clinical, neurophysiological and genetic characteristics. RESULTS: Neuropathy was present in 37% of the patients who had an average age of 13 years, ranging from 1 to 25 years. Syndromic diagnoses were: 7 encephalomyopathies, one MELAS, one MERRF and one NARP. Four of the patients were classified genetically. In all but two of the patients the neuropathy was asymptomatic. The biochemical alterations seen were: deficit of Complex 1 in 3 patients, of complex III in 3 patients, of complex IV in 2 and of pyruvate dehydrogenase in one patient. The type of neuropathy found was varied, with predominance of axonal-type motor neuropathy but no correlation with either biochemical defects or genetic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathy is a common finding in mitochondrial disorders and probably is under-diagnosed. The axonal form predominates. We have not been able to establish correlations between phenotypes and genotypes.
11241464	Barth's syndrome-like disorder: a new phenotype with a maternally inherited A3243G substitution of mitochondrial DNA (MELAS mutation). An Argentine male child died at 4.5 years of age of a lethal mitochondrial disease associated with a MELAS mutation and a Barth syndrome-like presentation. The child had severe failure to thrive from the early months and for approximately two years thereafter. In addition, the patient had severely delayed gross motor milestones, marked muscle weakness, and dilated cardiomyopathy that progressed to congestive heart failure. He also had persistently elevated urinary levels of 3-methylglutaconic and 2-ethylhydracrylic acids and low blood levels of cholesterol. Detailed histopathologic evaluation of the skeletal muscle biopsy showed high activity of succinate dehydrogenase, a generalized decrease of COX activity, and abundant ragged-red fibers. Electron microscopic studies revealed multiple mitochondrial abnormalities in lymphocytes and monocytes, in the striated muscle, and in the postmortem samples (muscle, heart, liver, and brain). Biochemical analysis showed a pronounced and constant lactic acidosis, and abnormal urinary organic acid excretion (unchanged in the fasting and postprandial states). In addition, in CSF there was a marked increase of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HOB) and also a high systemic ratio beta-HOB/acetoacetate. Enzymatic assay of the respiratory chain in biopsied muscle showed 10% of complex I activity and 24% of complex IV activity compared with controls. Molecular studies of the mitochondrial genome revealed an A to G mutation at nucleotide pair 3243 in mitochondrial DNA, a well-known pathogenetic mutation (MELAS mutation) in all the patient's tissues and also in the blood specimens of the probands mother and sibs (4 of 5). The diagnosis of MELAS mutation was reinforced by the absence of an identifiable mutation in the X-linked G4.5 gene of the propositus. The present observation gives additional evidence of the variable clinical expression of mtDNA mutations in humans and demonstrates that all clinical variants deserve adequate investigation to establish a primary defect. It also suggests adding Barth-like syndrome to the list of phenotypes with the MELAS mutation.

24605851	Seizure semiology and EEG findings in mitochondrial diseases. OBJECTIVE: Seizures constitute a frequent yet under-described manifestation of mitochondrial disorders (MDs). The aim of this study was to describe electroencephalography (EEG) findings and clinical seizure types in a population of children and adults with mitochondrial disease. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 165 records of children and adults with mitochondrial disease seen in the University of Texas Houston Mitochondrial Center between 2007 and 2012 was performed; all subjects were diagnosed with confirmed mitochondrial disease. EEG findings and clinical data, including seizure semiology and response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), were analyzed and categorized. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent (109/165) of subjects had a routine EEG performed. Sixty-one percent (67/109) of EEG studies were abnormal and 85% (56/67) had epileptiform discharges. The most common EEG finding was generalized slowing (40/67, 60%). The most frequent category of epileptiform activity seen was multifocal discharges (41%), followed by focal (39%) and generalized (39%) discharges. Clinical seizures were seen in 55% of subjects and the most common types of seizures observed were complex partial (37%) and generalized tonic-clonic (GTC; 37%). The most common seizure type in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) was GTC (33%), with generalized or focal discharges seen on EEG. In Leigh syndrome GTC (11%) and complex partial (11%) seizures were the most frequent types. Of 60 subjects with clinical seizures, 28% were intractable to medical treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Mitochondrial disorder should be included in the list of differential diagnosis in any child that presents with encephalopathy, seizures, and a fluctuating clinical course. Given the relatively high prevalence of EEG abnormalities in patients with MD, EEG should be performed during initial evaluation in all patients with MD, not only upon clinical suspicion of epilepsy.

16037668	A case of MELAS: hyperperfused lesions detected by non-invasive perfusion-weighted MR imaging. We report a case of MELAS in which lesions were detected by perfusion-weighted MR imaging. Perfusion-weighted MRI using contrast media (PWI) and FAIR (flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery), an arterial spin labeling method, clearly showed these lesions as hyperperfused areas. One of these lesions, diminished after steroid therapy, could also be detected by FAIR.
15728297	L-arginine improves the symptoms of strokelike episodes in MELAS. Based on the hypothesis that mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) are caused by impaired vasodilation in an intracerebral artery, the authors evaluated the effects of administering l-arginine, a nitric oxide precursor. Patients were administered L-arginine intravenously at the acute phase or orally at the interictal phase. L-arginine infusions significantly improved all strokelike symptoms, suggesting that oral administration within 30 minutes of a stroke significantly decreased frequency and severity of strokelike episodes.
12574954	Peripheral neuropathy in patients with the 3243A>G mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Peripheral neuropathy is one of the clinical manifestations of the MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) syndrome, but its frequency and phenotypic variability have not been properly characterised. We therefore studied the clinical and electrophysiological features of peripheral neuropathy in 32 patients with the 3243A > G mutation in mitochondrial DNA by using clinical examination, assessment of Neuropathy Symptom Score, Neuropathy Disability Score, and electrophysiological examinations. Seven patients (22 %; 95 % confidence interval, 9-40 %) fulfilled the electrodiagnostic criteria for polyneuropathy. Mixed axon loss and demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy was the most common type of polyneuropathy, while one patient presented with uniform demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Sensory more than motor neuropathy was diagnosed in four patients. Clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) occurred in three patients (9.4 %), suggesting a higher prevalence than in the general population. Patients with neuropathy were in general more severely affected than those without neuropathy, although no correlation was found between the presence of neuropathy and the degree of mutant heteroplasmy in muscle. Higher age and male gender were associated with an increased risk of neuropathy. Our results show that peripheral neuropathy is not uncommon in patients with the 3243A > G mutation, and they also may have an increased risk of CTS.

12504210	Atypical MELAS associated with mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) gene A8296G mutation. We report on a unique patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) presenting optic atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and bilateral striatal necrosis before stoke-like episodes became apparent. Skeletal muscle total mitochondrial DNA analysis identified a heteroplasmic A to G point mutation in the tRNA(Lys) gene at position 8296. Skeletal muscle pathology revealed typical MELAS findings, including ragged-red fibers cytochrome c oxidase positive strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels. Recent reports describe the 8296 mutation identified in patients with diabetes mellitus or myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers, not MELAS. We conclude that the 8296 mutation is likely to be pathogenic and that it may be not only a mutation responsible for diabetes mellitus or myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers but also for MELAS.
26711613	[G14453A mutation in mitochondrial myopathy encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes]. OBJECTIVE: To analyz mitochondrial DNA mutation in one case of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). METHODS: The patient, a 10-years-old boy,clinically diagnosed as MELAS. The clinical information was collected, and the normal mitochondrial mutations (such as A3243G, A8344G, T8993G/C, G13513A etc) were excluded. PCR-sequencing was used to analyz the whole-mitochondrial genome (16.6 kb), and PCR-RFLP was used to confirm the mutations. RESULTS: m.G14453A mutation was detected from the patient's peripheral blood and urine, but it was not found in his parents and 100 normal controls. The m.G14453A mutation was confirmed by PCR-RFLP, and mutation ratio of in blood was 56.8% and urine was 72.5%. The activity of complex I was decreased (67.6 nmol min-1 mg-1). This was the first report that m.G14453A mutation could lead to MELAS in China according www.mitomap.org web and NCBI. CONCLUSION: m.G14453A mutation is one of the causative mutations in MELAS, but the mechanism of the mutation should be studied in future.

12911055	Systemic herpes-like virus in catfish Ictalurus melas (Italy) differs from Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 (North America). A herpesvirus was isolated during 2 occurrences of mass mortality among adult catfish Ictalurus melas raised in different farms in northern Italy. The agent replicated in the channel catfish ovary (CCO) cell line from channel catfish I. punctatus, inducing a cytopathic effect similar to that caused by Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 (also referred to as channel catfish herpesvirus, CCV). The new herpesvirus, designated I. melas herpesvirus (IcmHV) did not react with polyclonal rabbit or monoclonal antibodies directed to CCV in either neutralization or indirect immunofluorescence assays. The virions of IcmHV possessed a hexagonal nucleocapsid of 107 nm in diameter surrounded by an envelope with a diameter of 227 nm (n = 20) typical for members of the family Herpesviridae. Virions of IcmHV purified from infected CCO cells contained 17 polypeptides ranging in size from 17.5 to 175 kDa and most differed in molecular weight from those found for CCV. The IcmHV was also distinct from CCV when compared by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of genomic DNA following digestions with the endonucleases Kpn I and Sac I. Lastly, the virulence of IcmHV for channel catfish fry and juveniles, respectively, was demonstrated by experimental infections induced by bath exposure or intraperitoneal injection that resulted in 78 to 96% cumulative mortality in groups of exposed fish. Preventing the introduction of this agent into geographic regions where significant channel catfish production occurs should be a high priority.
16518165	Pitfalls in the diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. We describe a patient with genetically- and biochemically-proven mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who was initially misdiagnosed as having had multiple ischemic strokes in part because the clinical presentation appeared to be acute, the MRI of lesions showed restricted diffusion, and the brain biopsy showed features suggestive of stroke. This report emphasizes the pitfalls in the diagnosis of MELAS and points out the similarities and differences between MELAS and ischemic stroke.
14967777	Revelation of a new mitochondrial DNA mutation (G12147A) in a MELAS/MERFF phenotype. BACKGROUND: A 26-year-old man presented at onset with the syndrome of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) and later with a phenotype for MELAS and myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fiber disease (MELAS/MERRF). OBJECTIVE: To identify the possible defects in the mitochondrial genome in blood and muscle samples of the patient. DESIGN: Case study of a patient clinically exhibiting strokelike episodes and then epilepsy with myoclonic features, ataxia, and dementia. SETTING: Research unit of a university hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Electromyographic, morphologic, and biochemical studies of muscle and molecular analysis of blood and muscle to investigate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) size and quantity. RESULTS: Morphologically, we found abnormal mitochondrial proliferation with several cytochrome-c oxidase (COX)-negative fibers in muscle biopsy specimens; the analysis of serial sections showed a decreased immunoreactivity for the mtDNA-encoded subunits COXII and, partially, COXI. Biochemically, we found a partial and isolated COX deficiency. The complete mtDNA sequence analysis identified 3 sequence changes, 2 of which were reported polymorphisms. The remaining change, a G12147A transition in the transfer RNA(His) gene, appeared to be the likely pathogenic mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data propose that the G12147A change, the first mutation in the transfer RNA(His) gene associated with an overlapped MELAS/MERFF phenotype, is the cause of the encephalomyopathy in this patient interfering with the overall mitochondrial protein synthesis.
10598894	Cardiac abnormalities in diabetic patients with mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene. An A-to-G transition at position 3243 of the mitochondrial DNA is known to be a pathogenic factor for mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), diabetes and cardiomyopathy. This mutation causes dysfunction of the central nervous system in MELAS. Because the heart, as well as the brain and nervous system, is highly dependent on the energy produced by mitochondrial oxidation, these tissues are more vulnerable to mitochondrial defects. Cardiac abnormalities were assessed in 10 diabetic patients associated with this mutation using echocardiography and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, and compared with 19 diabetic patients without the mutation. Duration of diabetes, therapy, control of blood glucose and diabetic complications, such as diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, were not different between the 2 groups. Diabetic patients with the mutation had a significantly thicker interventricular septum (16.8+/-3.7 vs 11.0+/-1.6mm, p<0.001) than those without the mutation. Fractional shortening was lower in diabetic patients with the mutation than those without it (30.7+/-7.0 vs 42.5+/-6.6, p<0.001). MIBG uptake on the delayed MIBG image was significantly lower in diabetic patients with the mutation than in those without the mutation (mean value of the heart to mediastinum ratio: 1.6+/-0.2 vs 2.0+/-0.4, p>0.05). In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy with or without abnormal wall motion and severely reduced MIBG uptake may be characteristic in diabetic patients with a mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene.

25330715	The spectrum of clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of mitochondrial forms of diabetes. Primary mitochondrial diseases refer to a group of heterogeneous and complex genetic disorders affecting 1:5000 people. The true prevalence is anticipated to be even higher because of the complexity of achieving a diagnosis in many patients who present with multisystemic complaints ranging from infancy to adulthood. Diabetes is a prominent feature of several of these disorders which might be overlooked by the endocrinologist. We here review mitochondrial disorders and describe the phenotypic and pathogenetic differences between mitochondrial diabetes mellitus (mDM) and other more common forms of diabetes mellitus. 
28169007	Identification of the first in Poland CACNA1A gene mutation in familial hemiplegic migraine. Case report. INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a particular phenotype, complex pathophysiology and a heterogeneous genetic background. Among several heritable forms, familial hemiplegic migraine is the best described one. In the majority of cases it is caused by mutations in one of three different genes. CASE REPORT: Clinical symptoms of a 47 year old proband (and independently described in his 20 year old son) as well as differential diagnosis are discussed in the presented report. The most characteristic were recurrent attacks of blurred vision, paresthesias and hemiparesis often accompanied by speech disturbances and followed by severe headache with vomiting. Advanced morphological and genetic procedures were required to exclude MELAS, CADASIL and Call-Fleming syndrome. Finally, the definite diagnosis was possible after the application of the whole exome sequencing technique. It confirmed, for the first time in the Polish population, a heterozygous T666M mutation (c.1997C>T; p.Thr666Met) in the CACNA1A gene in the proband, the proband's son and in several other family members. CONCLUSION: The presented report provides clinical and genetic insight into familial hemiplegic migraine 1 resulting from a mutation in the CACNA1A gene.
11783410	[Pathomechanism and clinical presentation of neurobehavioral disturbances in a patient with MELAS syndrome]. The authors present the results of a longitudinal study of the neurobehavioral disturbances seen in K.S., a 22-year-old female patient with a mitochondrial cytopathy (MELAS) caused by the novel mutation C8293T. K.S. became ill in 1994 at the age of 16. She was referred for diagnosis to several different clinics. Four years after onset, the clinical diagnosis was established in the Department of Medical Rehabilitation at the Cracow Rehabilitation Center; the diagnosis was not confirmed until six years after onset, following the discovery of the mutation in the patient's mtDNA at Columbia University. Since 1996 the patient has presented with progressive dementia and periodic stroke-like episodes that produced fluctuating neurological symptoms. The essential pathomechanism of the neurobehavioral disturbances consists in the fragmentation of complex cerebral processes into their constituent elements; individual functions are frequently correctly executed on a lower level of cerebral organization, but the patient is unable to combine them into a sensible whole. The authors discuss the theoretical and clinical significance of the results presented here.
17269531	Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS): a case report, presentation, and management. Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder frequently complicated by diabetes mellitus and sensory neuronal hearing loss. This syndrome tends to present initially with stroke-like symptoms. These strokes are nonvascular in nature and are linked to mitochondrial defect such as transient oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction, which in turn results in encephalopathy. The combination of lactic acidosis, multiple nonvascular strokes, encephalopathic psychosis, diabetes, and sensory neuronal hearing loss causes severe dysfunction leading to increased mental disabilities, physical disabilities, and eventually, death.
28667360	Cortical venous disease severity in MELAS syndrome correlates with brain lesion development. PURPOSE: MELAS syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder typified by recurrent stroke-like episodes, seizures, and progressive brain injury. Abnormal mitochondria have been found in arterial walls implicating a vasculogenic etiology. We have observed abnormal cortical vein T2/FLAIR signal in MELAS patients, potentially representing wall thickening and sluggish flow. We sought to examine the relationship of hyperintense veins and brain lesions in MELAS. METHODS: Imaging databases at two children's hospitals were searched for brain MRIs from MELAS patients. Artifact, sedated exams, and lack of 2D-T2/FLAIR sequences were exclusion criteria. Each exam was assigned a venous score based on number of T2/FLAIR hyperintense veins: 1 = <10, 2 = 10 to 20, 3 = >20. Cumulative brain lesions and venous score in MELAS and aged-matched normal exams were compared by Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: A total of 106 exams from 14 unique MELAS patients (mean 16 +- 3 years) and 30 exams from normal aged-matched patients (mean 15 +- 3 years) were evaluated. Median venous score between MELAS and control patients significantly differed (3 versus 1; p < 0.001). In the MELAS group, venous score correlated with presence (median = 3) or absence (median = 1) of cumulative brain lesions. In all 8 MELAS patients who developed lesions, venous hyperintensity was present prior to, during, and after lesion onset. Venous score did not correlate with brain lesion acuity. CONCLUSION: Abnormal venous signal correlates with cumulative brain lesion severity in MELAS syndrome. Cortical venous stenosis, congestion, and venous ischemia may be mechanisms of brain injury. Identification of cortical venous pathology may aid in diagnosis and could be predictive of lesion development.
23557294	Morphological variability of black bullhead Ameiurus melas in four non-native European populations. External morphology in black bullhead Ameiurus melas, a fish species considered to have high invasive potential, was studied in its four non-native European populations (British, French, Italian and Slovak). The aim of this study was to examine this species' variability in external morphology, including ontogenetic context, and to evaluate its invasive potential. Specimens from all non-native populations reached smaller body size compared to individuals from native populations. Juvenile A. melas were found to have a relatively uniform body shape regardless of the population's origin, whereas adults developed different phenotypes depending upon location. Specimens from the U.K., Slovak and French populations appeared to be rather similar to each other, whereas the Italian population showed the most distant phenotype. This probably results from the different thermal regime in the Italian habitat. Ameiurus melas from non-native European populations examined in this study showed some potential to alter the body shape both within and between populations. The phenotypic plasticity of A. melas, however, was not found to be as significant as in other invasive fish species. The results suggest that morphological variability itself is not necessarily essential for invasive success. The invasiveness of A. melas is therefore probably favoured by variations in its life-history traits and reproduction variables, together with some behavioural traits (e.g. voracious feeding and parental care) rather than by phenotypic plasticity expressed in external morphology.
22033022	Radiolabeled Cu-ATSM as a novel indicator of overreduced intracellular state due to mitochondrial dysfunction: studies with mitochondrial DNA-less rho0 cells and cybrids carrying MELAS mitochondrial DNA mutation. OBJECTIVES: Radiolabeled Cu-diacetyl-bis (N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) (*Cu-ATSM), including (60/62/64)Cu-ATSM, is a potential imaging agent of hypoxic tumors for positron emission tomography (PET). We have reported that *Cu-ATSM is trapped in tumor cells under intracellular overreduced states, e.g., hypoxia. Here we evaluated *Cu-ATSM as an indicator of intracellular overreduced states in mitochondrial disorders using cell lines with mitochondrial dysfunction. METHODS: Mitochondrial DNA-less rho(0)206 cells; the parental 143B human osteosarcoma cells; the cybrids carrying mutated mitochondria from a patient of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (2SD); and that carrying wild-type one (2SA) were used. Cells were treated under normoxia or hypoxia, and (64)Cu-ATSM uptake was examined to compare it with levels of biological reductant NADH and NADPH. RESULTS: rho(0)206 cells showed higher (64)Cu-ATSM uptake than control 143B cells under normoxia, whereas (64)Cu-ATSM uptake was not significantly increased under hypoxia in rho(0)206 cells. Additionally, (64)Cu-ATSM uptake showed correlate change to the NADH and NADPH levels, but not oxygenic conditions. 2SD cells showed increased (64)Cu-ATSM uptake under normoxia as compared with the control 2SA, and (64)Cu-ATSM uptake followed NADH and NADPH levels, but not oxygenic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: (64)Cu-ATSM accumulated in cells with overreduced states due to mitochondrial dysfunction, even under normoxia. We recently reported that (62)Cu-ATSM-PET can visualize stroke-like episodes maintaining oxygen supply in MELAS patients. Taken together, our data indicate that *Cu-ATSM uptake reflects overreduced intracellular states, despite oxygenic conditions; thus, *Cu-ATSM would be a promising marker of intracellular overreduced states for disorders with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as MELAS, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
12524521	The yeast counterparts of human 'MELAS' mutations cause mitochondrial dysfunction that can be rescued by overexpression of the mitochondrial translation factor EF-Tu. We have taken advantage of the similarity between human and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mitochondrial tRNA(Leu)(UUR), and of the possibility of transforming yeast mitochondria, to construct yeast mitochondrial mutations in the gene encoding tRNA(Leu)(UUR) equivalent to the human A3243G, C3256T and T3291C mutations that have been found in patients with the neurodegenerative disease MELAS (for mitochondrial 'myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes'). The resulting yeast cells (bearing the equivalent mutations A14G, C26T and T69C) were defective for growth on respiratory substrates, exhibited an abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and accumulated mitochondrial DNA deletions at a very high rate, a trait characteristic of severe mitochondrial defects in protein synthesis. This effect was specific at least in the pathogenic mutation T69C, because when we introduced A or G instead of C, the respiratory defect was absent or very mild. All defective phenotypes returned to normal when the mutant cells were transformed by multicopy plasmids carrying the gene encoding the mitochondrial elongation factor EF-Tu. The ability to create and analyse such mutated strains and to select correcting genes should make yeast a good model for the study of tRNAs and their interacting partners and a practical tool for the study of pathological mutations and of tRNA sequence polymorphisms.

11168879	De novo mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene (A3243G) with rapid segregation resulting in MELAS in the offspring. A 14-year-old Chinese boy with a normal perinatal and early developmental history presented at 5 years of age with migraine, intractable epilepsy, ataxia, supraventricular tachycardia, paralytic ileus and progressive mental deterioration. Computerized tomography revealed multiple cerebral infarcts in the parieto-occipital region without basal ganglial calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging showed increased signal intensity in T2 weighted images in the same regions. A cerebral digital subtraction angiogram was normal. Venous lactate, pyruvate, lactate to pyruvate ratio and cerebrospinal fluid lactate were elevated. Muscle biopsy did not reveal any ragged red fibres; dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase activity was normal. Mitochondrial DNA analysis detected an adenine to guanine mutation at nucleotide position 3243 of tRNALeu(UUR). All four tissues analysed demonstrated heteroplasmy: leucocyte 56%, hair follicle 70%; buccal cell 64%; muscle 54%. The mother and brother of the proband, both asymptomatic, were also found to have a heteroplasmic A3243G mutation in the leucocytes, hair follicle and buccal cells. Other members of the maternal lineage, including the maternal grandmother, did not have the mutation. This report describes a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes, who presented with multisystem involvement. The absence of ragged red fibres in muscle biopsy did not preclude the diagnosis. Mutational analysis of mitochondrial DNA conveniently confirmed the diagnosis of the disorder. A de novo mutation is demonstrated in this family.
27453332	Acute encephalopathy of the temporal lobes leading to m.3243A>G. When MELAS is not always MELAS. MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a rare genetic condition whose differential diagnosis is often posed with juvenile stroke, but more rarely even with inflammatory/infectious encephalitis, causing diagnostic challenges. Here we report the case of a young man harbouring the m.3243A>G MELAS mutation presenting an acute onset mimicking the clinical and neuroimaging features of infective encephalitis. 
11889832	[A case of MELAS presenting complex partial status epilepticus]. We reported a 37-year-old man who presented complex partial status epilepticus as the initial symptom of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). He showed fluctuating consciousness disturbance, left homonymous hemianopsia, and paroxysmal conjugated eye deviation to the left. The lactic acid level was elevated in blood and CSF, and ragged-red fibers were observed in the biopsied muscle. MRI demonstrated T2-prolonged lesions in the right occipito-parieto-temporal lobes. Since a mutation of mitochondrial DNA (A3243G) was identified, he was diagnosed as having MELAS. On an ictal record, high amplitude, rhythmic sharp waves were observed at right parieto-temporo-occipital region. High amplitude slow waves were also observed on the right hemisphere, especially in the right frontal lobe. These ictal discharges gradually decreased at their amplitude and in frequency, and then ictal EEG turned to the interictal EEG. During an ictal period, conjugated eye deviation to the left side and consciousness loss were observed. These seizures were observed once every several minutes. During the interictal period, sharp waves and sharp-wave complexes were observed frequently at right parietal and posterior temporal lobes. The venous injection of diazepam (10 mg) normalized EEG quickly. When consciousness loss, especially fluctuating, was observed in the patients of MELAS, complex partial status epilepticus should be considered.
17407476	Early cardiac involvement in children carrying the A3243G mtDNA mutation. UNLABELLED: The phenotypic spectrum of the mitochondrial A3243G DKA mutation is highly variable, particularly when occuring in childhood. In contrast to the classical presentation in adulthood (MELAS syndrome; mitochondria! myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) children show a different pattern of symptoms, often without the typical encephalopathy or psychomotor regression. We present six children carrying the A3243G mtDNA mutation with a heteroplasmy above 50 % in muscle tissue. The age of diagnosis ranged from 2 weeks up to 14.5 years. The clinical presentation was rather non-specific including muscle weakness, developmental delay and epilepsy. In this small pediatric group we detected presymptomatic cardiac involvement in five out of six children already at an early stage of disease. The cardiac pathology included cardiomyopathy and biventricular hypertrophy with rhythm disturbances (for example long QT-syndrome). The observed cardiac changes do not always increase the risk of cardiac deterioration; however, two of our patients died early on. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that the A3243G mutation might be underdiagnosed, as patients could suffer from an unexplained cardiac death before the diagnosis is made. We advise performing regular repeated ECGs and echocardiography in all children carrying a A3243G mtDNA mutation independently from the presence of cardiac symptoms.
33358866	Molecular imaging for mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence from pathological and biochemical investigations suggests that mitochondrial metabolic impairment and oxidative stress play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases, such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, and various neurodegenerative disorders. Recent advances in molecular imaging technology with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have accomplished a direct and non-invasive evaluation of the pathophysiological changes in living patients. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this review, we focus on the latest achievements of molecular imaging for mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress in mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Molecular imaging with PET and MRI exhibited mitochondrial metabolic changes, such as enhanced glucose utilization with lactic acid fermentation, suppressed fatty acid metabolism, decreased TCA-cycle metabolism, impaired respiratory chain activity, and increased oxidative stress, in patients with MELAS syndrome. In addition, PET imaging clearly demonstrated enhanced cerebral oxidative stress in patients with Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The magnitude of oxidative stress correlated well with clinical severity in patients, indicating that oxidative stress based on mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with the neurodegenerative changes in these diseases. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Molecular imaging is a promising tool to improve our knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, and this would facilitate the development of potential antioxidants and mitochondrial therapies.
11127079	[Mitochondrial encephalomyelitis, lactic acidosis and cerebrovascular accidents (MELAS) in pediatric age with the A3243G mutation in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene of mitochondrial DNA]. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate three patients with the mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and cerebrovascular accident syndrome (MELAS) diagnosed in childhood, with particular reference to the initial symptoms and clinical evolution during the first stage at a pediatric age, and to compare them with other studies on the subject. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two boys and a girl of 10, 11 and 13 years had tests on lactate, pyruvate and aminoacids in biological fluids under basal conditions and also functional tests and enzyme activity assay of the mitochondrial respiratory chain of a muscle biopsy. We also analysed the particular DNA mutations related to MELAS in different tissues from these patients and in lymphocytes from members of the mothers' families who could be tested. RESULTS: The patients fulfilled the clinical criteria for the MELAS syndrome. Neuroimaging showed cerebrovascular accidents. Neurophysiological studies showed myopathy in one patient and neuroaxonal neuropathy in another. In two cases ophthalmological study showed retinitis pigmentaria and during cerebrovascular accidents transient phenomena of homonymous hemianopsia and cortical blindness were seen. In all patients muscle biopsy showed ragged red fibres and the biochemical study showed an enzyme deficit in the respiratory mitochondrial chain. On molecular genetic study of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) there was a particular mutation A3243G on the tRNA(Leu) in all patients and some members of the mothers' families. CONCLUSIONS: In children with frequent episodes of migraine headaches, vomiting, refractory epilepsy and fatigue the presence of a mitochondrial disease should be suspected. On detection of mtDNA mutations MELAS may be diagnosed even without all the clinical criteria which characterise this syndrome.
16471125	Auditory symptoms: a critical clue for diagnosis of MELAS. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a rare mitochondrial disorder that affects adults. MELAS syndrome can mimic cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis or toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. The authors reported two patients who presented with auditory symptoms before the onset of encephalopathy and stroke-like episodes. The first patient was a 28 year-old man, who presented with acute sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) followed by headache, left hemiparesis and generalized tonic-clonic seizure. CT scan of the brain showed hypodensity lesion at the tip of right temporooccipital region. Audiogram and brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) showed abnormal conduction of left brainstem auditory pathway. MRI of the brain showed a lesion involving gray and white matters of the right occipital, parietal and temporal lobes. The distribution of the lesions was not compatible with distribution of arterial supply. MRA was normal. The second patient was a 56 year-old woman with a one-year history of hearing loss. The audiogram revealed bilateral SNHL. A few days before admission, her hearing was acutely deteriorated She could not understand a conversation while she could communicate by writing. CT scan of the brain showed hypodensity in both temporal lobes and MRI revealed lesions in the same area. Pure tone audiogram showed moderate SNHL but BAEP was normal. One week later, she developed global dysphasia and generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Both patients had elevated cerebrospinal fluid and serum lactate: pyruvate ratio. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism disclosed A3243G mtDNA mutation in the blood in the first patient and in muscle biopsy in the second patient. Ubiquinone supplement was prescribed The auditory symptoms in combination with stroke-like episode in supratentorium are important clues to diagnose MELAS syndrome.
24846800	Detection rates and phenotypic spectrum of m.3243A>G in the MT-TL1 gene: a molecular diagnostic laboratory perspective. The nucleotide change A to G at position m.3243 in the mitochondrial tRNA leucine (UUR) gene (MT-TL1) is the most common point mutation reported in association with the Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. Since the original description of this disorder, factors including random mitochondrial segregation and consequent variable tissue heteroplasmy are recognised to contribute to a much broader phenotypic spectrum associated with the MT-TL1 m.3243A>G mutation, often rendering the process of making a diagnosis complex. Reliance on clinicians' referral patterns means that for most molecular diagnostic laboratories, their positive identification rates for the common pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, including MT-TL1 m.3243A>G, is often relatively low compared to those reported in clinically targeted research studies. Herein, we report our results of consecutive prospective screening of 745 patients with a clinically suspected mitochondrial syndrome encompassing features associated with MT-TL1 m.3243A>G mutation. 
17276742	Screening of common mitochondrial mutations in Chinese patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. To investigate the spectrum of common mitochondrial mutations in Northern China during the years of 2000-2005, 552 patients of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies clinically diagnosed as MELAS, MERRF or Leigh's syndrome, 14 cases of LHON and 46 cases of aminoglycoside induced deafness along with their family members, accepted routine point mutation tests at nucleotide positions 3243, 8344, 8993, 11778 or 1555 in mitochondrial genome. PCR-RFLP analysis, site-specific PCR and PCR-sequencing methods were used to identify the mutations. Fifty-seven cases with A3243G mutation, 4 cases with A8344G, 2 cases with T8993C and 1 case with T8993G were identified from the 552 encephalomyopathy patients. In addition, one case with G11778A was found from the 14 cases of LHON, and 5 cases with A1555G from the 46 cases of aminoglycoside ototoxicity patients. Additional screening for T8356G and T3271C merely had limited significance for the diagnosis of MERRF and MELAS. Differential diagnosis among mitochondrial encephalomyopathies was often complicated due to many similar clinical manifestations. For A3243G mutation, the proportion of mutant mtDNA was not related to severity of the disease but to the age of onset.
24052440	[Analysis of a series of cases with an initial diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis over the period 2000-2010]. INTRODUCTION: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating disease that essentially affects the white matter of the central nervous system. The diagnosis is based on clinical-imaging and developmental findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is the most useful diagnostic tool. The disease course is usually monophasic and the preferred initial treatment is with corticoids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 18 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of ADEM. Symptoms, imaging findings, progress and treatment were analysed. The definitive diagnosis was established in 12 patients, excluding one patient with positive polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus in cerebrospinal fluid, one with a clinical picture that was consistent but normal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and four with an onset that was similar to ADEM whose definitive diagnoses were: Rassmusen's syndrome, haemophagocytic syndrome, brain tumour, and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). RESULTS: The median age was 31 months with no predominance of either sex. Infection of the upper respiratory tract was the most frequent cause in children over 2 years of age and of the gastrointestinal tract in those under the age of 2. All of them presented altered levels of consciousness and multifocal neurological deficits. The most frequent imaging finding was multifocal alteration of the white matter in both hemispheres. Corticoids were the preferred treatment in most cases. Progression was favourable in nearly all patients except for two, who were left with important sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: ADEM may present at any age, including in infants. There are a number of conditions that can mimic ADEM in the early stages.
20649546	MELAS and L-arginine therapy: pathophysiology of stroke-like episodes. Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a maternally inherited multisystem mitochondrial disorder. Although many molecular and cellular mechanisms have been discovered leading to mitochondrial cytopathy, the pathogenic mechanism of stroke-like episodes seen in MELAS has not been clarified yet. According to the muscle and brain pathology and vascular physiology, mitochondrial angiopathy, or endothelial dysfunction, were proposed to play an important role for developing stroke-like episodes. Based on a hypothesis of mitochondrial angiopathy theory, we use L-arginine in MELAS patients and report its usefulness. This review aims to give a general idea on the actual knowledge about the possible pathogenic mechanism of stroke-like episodes, including clinical symptoms that lead to stroke-like episodes, muscle, or brain pathology, molecular cellular functions, neuroimagings including MRI, MRS, and SPECT, and the proposed site of action of L-arginine therapy on MELAS patients. Currently, L-arginine therapy may be the most promising for the treatment of stroke-like episodes in MELAS.

11462305	Discordance between cerebral oxygen and glucose metabolism, and hemodynamics in a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episode patient. A patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episode (MELAS) syndrome underwent serial measurement of cerebral blood flow with xenon computed tomography (Xe-CBF) while presenting with strokelike episodes accompanied by a cerebral lesion. He underwent positron emission tomography (PET) measurement of the regional cerebral blood flow (PET-CBF), metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and glucose (CMRGlu) after his symptoms and lesion disappeared. During the symptomatic period, Xe-CBF and the Xe-CBF response to acetazolamide loading were well preserved both in and outside the low-density lesion. In the PET study, decreased CMRO2 and increased PET-CBF and CMRGlu were noted in the entire brain. The strokelike episodes of patients with MELAS are more likely attributed to the failure of oxygen metabolism than to a vascular accident.
11932002	Occurrence of echinocytosis in circulating RBC of black bullhead, Ictalurus melas (Rafinesque), following exposure to an anionic detergent at sublethal concentrations. The shape of the erythrocytes can be altered by a great variety of chemical agents, such as many detergents due to their amphiphilic nature. The present study examines the effect of an anionic detergent on the shape of mature, circulating catfish red blood cells. Experimental exposure to sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate dissolved in the water of aquaria at two sublethal concentrations (1.5 and 3 ppm), for a maximum of 15 days, induced morphological changes of normal erythrocyte shape to echinocytic form. These changes were evaluated at 5, 10 and 15 days after the start of treatment, using scanning electron microscopy. The crenated erythrocytes from animals exposed to detergent appeared either with border irregularities or undulations, without distinct spicules, or with numerous short spikes. Statistical analysis, applied to the data obtained from counting altered cells in the various experimental groups, showed no significant difference between the 1.5 ppm-treated animals at the three times and the controls, whereas a significant difference was observed between 3 ppm-treated animals compared to the controls, showing significance of action of the higher dose employed at the three times. These data suggest latent erythrocyte damage. The results are discussed in the light of the extensive bibliography concerning evaginating amphiphilic compounds and the mechanisms involved in echinocyte formation, taking into account the marked differences existing between the nucleated red blood cells of fish and those biconcave, unnucleated of mammals.
28515163	Assessment of Nitric Oxide Production in Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-Like Episodes Syndrome with the Use of a Stable Isotope Tracer Infusion Technique. Mitochondrial disorders result from dysfunctional mitochondria that are unable to generate sufficient energy to meet the needs of various organs. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is one of the most frequent maternally inherited mitochondrial disorders. There is growing evidence that nitric oxide (NO) deficiency occurs in MELAS syndrome and results in impaired blood perfusion that contributes significantly to several complications in this disease. NO is synthesized from arginine by NO synthase, which catalyzes the conversion of arginine to NO and citrulline. Citrulline can be recycled into arginine, and therefore, both arginine and citrulline support NO synthesis. The use of 15N2-arginine and 13C-,2H4-citrulline stable isotope infusion allows measuring arginine flux; citrulline flux; citrulline-to-arginine flux, which represents the de novo arginine synthesis rate; and arginine-to-citrulline flux, which represents the NO production rate. The objective of this review is to highlight the utility of this method in providing additional evidence for NO deficiency in MELAS syndrome, adding more insight into the potential mechanisms of NO deficiency in this syndrome, and allowing for the assessment of the effects of supplementation with the NO donors, arginine and citrulline, on improving NO production in MELAS syndrome.

15164188	Muscle computed tomography patterns in patients with the mitochondrial DNA mutation 3243A>G. Computed tomography provides a sensitive method for investigating skeletal muscle changes in neuromuscular diseases, but this method has not been applied to mitochondrial myopathies. We characterized the pattern of muscle involvement in patients with the 3243A>G mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the common MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) mutation. Twenty-four patients, age 19-73 years, with 3243A>G were examined. Clinical evaluation included assessment of muscle strength and functional capacity. All the patients underwent muscle computed tomography, and muscle samples from 17 of them were examined for the presence of ragged red fibres and for the 3243A>G heteroplasmy. Venous blood lactate at rest and serum creatine kinase were determined. Clinical myopathy was found in six patients, while nine showed mild muscle weakness and nine had normal muscle function. The upper and lower limbs were equally affected, but the proximal muscles were more severely affected than the distal ones. CT revealed abnormalities in the muscles of 13 patients (54%; 95% confidence interval, 33-76%), including the six with clinical myopathy and seven without clinical myopathy. Myopathic changes were found most frequently in the pelvic muscles, with predominant involvement of the gluteus maximus. These data show that CT reveals frequent abnormal findings in the muscle of patients with the 3243A>G mtDNA mutation. Muscle CT is a useful adjunct to clinical evaluation in these patients.
17558251	The neuropsychologic deficits of MELAS: evidence of global impairment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the neuropsychologic profile of MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) and relate it to neuropathologic findings. BACKGROUND: MELAS is one of over 40 mitochondrial disorders. Symptoms include seizures, strokelike episodes, headaches, memory impairment, hemianopsia, hearing loss, short stature, diffuse limb weakness, exercise intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. Age of onset ranges from 2 to 40 years. A hallmark of MELAS is normal development until the first symptoms appear. METHOD: Because information regarding the neuropsychologic functioning of these individuals is sparse, we report findings from detailed neuropsychologic evaluations for a 13-year-old white male and a 33-year-old African-American male with MELAS. RESULTS: Results revealed global patterns of deterioration in executive function, attention, language, memory, visuospatial, and motor functioning. In both patients, brain scans revealed posterior pathology in the absence of frontal pathology. CONCLUSIONS: We compared our findings with other documented cases and concluded that MELAS is characterized by a pattern of global deterioration. This pattern differs from that observed in other mitochondrial disorders. The absence of identifiable frontal lobe pathology despite the presence of deficits in executive functioning may be related to the distribution patterns of deficient mitochondria and neuronal projection patterns.
20655066	MELAS syndrome associated with both A3243G-tRNALeu mutation and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. The syndrome of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode (MELAS) is characterized clinically by recurrent focal neurological deficits, epilepsy, and short stature. The phenotypic spectrum is extremely diverse, with multisystemic organ involvement leading to isolated diabetes, deafness, renal tubulopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. In 80% of cases, the syndrome is associated with an AG transmission mutation (A3243G) in the tRNALeu gene of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We describe a woman with a unique combination of the MELAS A3243G mutation and multiple mtDNA deletions with normal POLG sequence. The patient presented with diabetes mellitus, sensorineural deafness, short stature, and mental disorientation. All her three children died in early adolescence.
11794880	[Mitochondrial diseases in adults]. PURPOSE: Mitochondrial diseases have numerous phenotypic expression, and form an heterogeneous group of genetic diseases in which the production of energy fails. Well known in childhood, these mitochondrial diseases can onset in adulthood and may remain unrecognized. We propose a recent review (Medline 1981-2001) of the literature on adult forms of mitochondriopathies, illustrated with a typical case report. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: Mitochondrial diseases have numerous phenotypic expression in adulthood. Principles of diagnosis are i) recognize a phenotype, ii) prove the mitochondrial abnormalities, iii) realize a genetical analysis. Main varieties of adult phenotypes are studied and separated in 1) skeletal muscular involvement, ocular myopathies above all; 2) mitochondrial cardiomyopathies; 3) neurological involvement (MERRF, MELAS, NARP, MNGIE syndromes); 4) endocrinological involvement and diabetes mellitus; 5) multisystemic diseases with a particular focus on Kearns Sayre syndrome. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Phenotypic analysis of a patient with mitochondrial disease is not simple. A "multi-tissues" involvement is the main characteristic feature. Faced with such patients, replacement therapy, genomic therapy and genetic advice are evoked.
11859287	The course of vision disturbances in a patient with the MELAS syndrome. BACKGROUND: This article describes the neuropsychological and ophthalmic symptoms presented by a patient with MELAS, a mitochondrial cytopathy. This rare disease is characterized by a remitting-relapsing course against the background of a slowly progressive degenerative process. CASE REPORT: The patient is a 22-year-old Polish female, with initial onset of symptoms in 1994; the clinical diagnosis of MELAS was established in 1998, and confirmed in 2000 by the discovery of a novel mtDNA mutation. Her visual acuity fluctuates from near-normal to near-blindness, often changing dramatically within a matter of weeks; the visual field has more or less steadily narrowed to lunate. Visual evoked potentials show sporadic disturbances, while the nerve fiber layer shows significant attenuation. The evidence points to a complex etiology, involving both cortical damage and attenuation of the optic nerves and neural pathways. A similar two-phase pattern--episodic disturbances with rapid spontaneous recovery against a background of progressive deterioration--occurs in neuropsychological testing, which reveals progressive dementia and episodic aphasia. CONCLUSIONS: The peculiar pathomechanism of MELAS results in simultaneous insults to various parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems, creating the complex and highly variable pattern seen in this patient. In clinical practice care should be taken not to overlook the possible significance of such a pattern appearing in various systems and on varying levels.
23339111	Preimplantation genetic diagnosis in mitochondrial DNA disorders: challenge and success. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial or oxidative phosphorylation diseases are relatively frequent, multisystem disorders; in about 15% of cases they are caused by maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. Because of the possible severity of the phenotype, the lack of effective treatment, and the high recurrence risk for offspring of carrier females, couples wish to prevent the transmission of these mtDNA disorders to their offspring. Prenatal diagnosis is problematic for several reasons, and concern the often poor correlation between mutation percentages and disease severity and the uncertainties about the representativeness of a fetal sample. A new option for preventing transmission of mtDNA disorders is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which circumvents these problems by transferring an embryo below the threshold of clinical expression. METHODS: We present the data on nine PGD cycles in four female carriers of mitochondrial diseases: three mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (m.3243A>G), and one Leigh (m.8993T>G). Our threshold for transfer after PGD is 15% for the m.3243A>G mutation and 30% for the m.8993T>G mutation. RESULTS: All four female carriers produced embryos eligible for transfer. The m.8993T>G mutation in oocytes/embryos showed more skewing than the m.3243A>G. In about 80% of the embryos the mutation load in the individual blastomeres was fairly constant (interblastomere differences <10%). However, in around 11% (in embryos with the m.3243A>G mutation only), the mutation load differed substantially (>15%) between blastomeres of a single embryo, mostly as a result of one outlier. The m.8993T>G carrier became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy son. CONCLUSIONS: PGD provides carriers of mtDNA mutations the opportunity to conceive healthy offspring.
17223431	Cardiac involvement in adults with m.3243A>G MELAS gene mutation. Cardiac data in adults with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS syndrome) or asymptomatic gene carriers with the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid adenine-to-guanine point mutation at nucleotide pair 3243 are scarce. Twelve subjects (mean age 35 +/- 13 years), 8 with MELAS syndrome (patients) and 4 asymptomatic gene carriers (carriers), were enrolled in the study. Each subject underwent electrocardiography, exercise testing, Holter monitoring, echocardiography, and genetic and biochemical analysis for respiratory chain enzyme activity (complex I rest activity) in skeletal muscle. On electrocardiography and Holter monitoring, none of the subjects had evidence of preexcitation, cardiac arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities. Patients had significantly lower (42 +/- 17% from normal vs 103 +/- 14%, p <0.02) exercise tolerance. All but 1 of the patients and none of the gene carriers had ragged red fibers on muscle biopsy. The mean percentage of gene mutation in skeletal muscle tended to be higher in patients (53 +/- 19%, range 19% to 73%) compared with carriers (33 +/- 20%, range 15% to 62%). Mean complex I rest activity in patients (36 +/- 18%, range 10% to 58%) was significantly (p <0.01) lower compared with carriers (120 +/- 60%, range 72% to 205%). Left ventricular (LV) abnormalities were confined to patients with MELAS syndrome. Two patients had LV hypertrophy, 5 had LV systolic abnormalities, and 5 had LV diastolic dysfunction. Apart from 1 patient with an isolated LV diastolic abnormality, all patients with LV abnormalities had ragged red fibers. Patients with abnormal systolic LV function had a trend toward a higher percentage of mutated skeletal muscle (59.7 +/- 10.7% vs 35.8 +/- 21.3%, p <0.10) and significantly lower complex I rest activity (26.7 +/- 14.0% vs 97.8% +/- 57.9, p <0.01). In conclusion, none of the MELAS gene carriers had cardiac abnormalities, whereas most patients with the MELAS phenotype, particularly those with ragged red fibers, had LV involvement.
34329596	Sonlicromanol improves neuronal network dysfunction and transcriptome changes linked to m.3243A>G heteroplasmy in iPSC-derived neurons. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is often caused by an adenine to guanine variant at m.3243 (m.3243A>G) of the MT-TL1 gene. To understand how this pathogenic variant affects the nervous system, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into excitatory neurons with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function from MELAS patients with the m.3243A>G pathogenic variant. We combined micro-electrode array (MEA) measurements with RNA sequencing (MEA-seq) and found reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and presynaptic function, as well as non-cell autonomous processes in co-cultured astrocytes. Finally, we show that the clinical phase II drug sonlicromanol can improve neuronal network activity when treatment is initiated early in development. This was intricately linked with changes in the neuronal transcriptome. Overall, we provide insight in transcriptomic changes in iPSC-derived neurons with high m.3243A>G heteroplasmy, and show the pathology is partially reversible by sonlicromanol.
10485557	Prevalence of macular pattern dystrophy in maternally inherited diabetes and deafness. GEDIAM Group. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of macular pattern dystrophy (MPD) in maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD), a new subtype of diabetes mellitus that cosegregates with a mutation of mitochondrial DNA (i.e., the substitution of guanine for adenine at position 3243 of leucine transfer RNA) and to report the clinical characteristics of MPD. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six patients from 29 families with an adenine-to-guanine mutation of mitochondrial DNA were recruited from a French collaborative multicenter study. Thirty-five patients had MIDD, 8 were asymptomatic children of MIDD patients, and 3 had MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes). The 33 MIDD patients with diabetes were matched for diabetes duration and gender with 33 patients with "common" type-2 diabetes to compare the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in both series. METHODS: All patients had a full ophthalmologic examination and fundus photographs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence and severity of MPD and DR were assessed in each patient. RESULTS: Thirty MIDD patients (85.7%) of 35 exhibited bilateral MPD characterized by linear pigmentation surrounding the macula and optic disc. In 24 of these 30 patients, visual acuity was 20/25 or more in both eyes. The prevalence of DR was 6% in MIDD patients with diabetes versus 15% for patients with common type-2 diabetes (a difference that was not significant, P = 0.23). The fundus of each of the eight asymptomatic children was normal. MPD was present in one of the three cases of MELAS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MPD in MIDD is high. Its detection may be helpful for the diagnosis of this new subtype of diabetes, for which specific treatments may be proposed.
26112726	Progress in Diagnosing Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes. OBJECTIVE: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a progressive, multisystem affected mitochondrial disease associated with a number of disease-related defective genes. MELAS has unpredictable presentations and clinical course, and it can be commonly misdiagnosed as encephalitis, cerebral infarction, or brain neoplasms. This review aimed to update the diagnosis progress in MELAS, which may provide better understanding of the disease nature and help make the right diagnosis as well. DATA SOURCES: The data used in this review came from published peer review articles from October 1984 to October 2014, which were obtained from PubMed. The search term is "MELAS". STUDY SELECTION: Information selected from those reported studies is mainly based on the progress on clinical features, blood biochemistry, neuroimaging, muscle biopsy, and genetics in diagnosing MELAS. RESULTS: MELAS has a wide heterogeneity in genetics and clinical manifestations. The relationship between mutations and phenotypes remains unclear. Advanced serial functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide directional information on this disease. Muscle biopsy has meaningful value in diagnosing MELAS, which shows the presence of ragged red fibers and mosaic appearance of cytochrome oxidase negative fibers. Genetic studies have reported that approximately 80% of MELAS cases are caused by the mutation m.3243A>G of the mitochondrial transfer RNA (Leu (UUR)) gene (MT-TL1). CONCLUSIONS: MELAS involves multiple systems with variable clinical symptoms and recurrent episodes. The prognosis of MELAS patients depends on timely diagnosis. Therefore, overall diagnosis of MELAS should be based on the maternal inheritance family history, clinical manifestation, and findings from serial MRI, muscle biopsy, and genetics.
16018150	Pathology of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Muscle biopsy provides the best tissue to confirm a mitochondrial cytopathy. Histochemical features often correlate with specific syndromes and facilitate the selection of biochemical and genetic studies. Ragged-red fibres nearly always indicate a combination defect of respiratory complexes I and IV. Increased punctate lipid within myofibers is a regular feature of Kearns-Sayre and PEO, but not of MELAS and MERRF. Total deficiency of succinate dehydrogenase indicates a severe defect in Complex II; total absence of cytochrome-c-oxidase activity in all myofibres correlates with a severe deficiency of Complex IV or of coenzyme-Q10. The selective loss of cytochrome-c-oxidase activity in scattered myofibers, particularly if accompanied by strong succinate dehydrogenase staining in these same fibres, is good evidence of mitochondrial cytopathy and often of a significant mtDNA mutation, though not specific for Complex IV disorders. Glycogen may be excessive in ragged-red zones. Ultrastructure provides morphological evidence of mitochondrial cytopathy, in axons and endothelial cells as well as myocytes. Abnormal axonal mitochondria may contribute to neurogenic atrophy of muscle, a secondary chronic feature. Quantitative determinations of respiratory chain enzyme complexes, with citrate synthase as an internal control, confirm the histochemical impressions or may be the only evidence of mitochondrial disease. Biological and technical artifacts may yield falsely low enzymatic activities. Genetic studies screen common point mutations in mtDNA. The brain exhibits characteristic histopathological alterations in mitochondrial diseases. Skin biopsy is useful for mitochondrial ultrastructure in smooth erector pili muscles and axons; skin fibroblasts may be grown in culture. Mitochondrial alterations occur in many nonmitochondrial diseases and also may be induced by drugs and toxins.
15993323	Stroke-like episode involving a cerebral artery in a patient with MELAS. This report describes a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes who exhibited a segmental vascular narrowing in the crural segment of the right posterior cerebral artery by magnetic imaging angiography in the acute phase of the first stroke-like episode. The vascular stenosis almost improved on the subsequent neuroimaging study. This result suggested that major cerebral arteries might be occasionally involved in a stroke-like episode in MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes).
11907863	[Intestinal pseudoobstructions and gastric necrosis in mitochondrial myopathy]. HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 24-year-old female patient suffered for 4 months from recurrent abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Signs of an acute abdomen were the initial reason for admitting the patient to our hospital. The slim, pale patient had a complete bloated abdomen. Neurological status was normal. INVESTIGATIONS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Radiographic examination showed a paralytic ileus with a megacolon. The recurrent abdominal symptoms were due to a covered perforation of the stomach. This was shrunken, scarred and had to be resected. Further intestinal pseudoobstructions were accompanied by substantial exsudations in the lungs, intestines and abdomen. At this time mutism like behavior patterns and an ophthalmoplegia appeared. Leukoencephalopathy in brain MRI scans and increased liquor-lactate suggested mitochondrial myopathy. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of a mitochondrial myopathy was confirmed by increased liquor-lactate level, muscle biopsy with ragged-red fibers as well as abnormal mitochondrias and molecular-genetic investigations (mtDNA point mutation A3243G). Associations to MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and MNGIE (mitochondrial neuro-gastrointestinal encephalomyopathy) syndrome are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Unclear recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms even in the absence of neurological changes may reflect a mitochondrial disease. This applies especially to young patients with recurrent anorexia, vomiting and pseudoobstruction. In case of additional symptoms like ophthalmopathy, deafness, diabetes mellitus or signs of a MELAS syndrome the search for a mitochondrial system disorder is mandatory.
29506874	MT-ND5 Mutation Exhibits Highly Variable Neurological Manifestations at Low Mutant Load. Mutations in the m.13094T>C MT-ND5 gene have been previously described in three cases of Leigh Syndrome (LS). In this retrospective, international cohort study we identified 20 clinically affected individuals (13 families) and four asymptomatic carriers. Ten patients were deceased at the time of analysis (median age of death was 10years (range: 5 4months-37years, IQR=17 9years). Nine patients manifested with LS, one with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and one with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. The remaining nine patients presented with either overlapping syndromes or isolated neurological symptoms. Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity analysis was normal in five out of ten muscle biopsies. We confirmed maternal inheritance in six families, and demonstrated marked variability in tissue segregation, and phenotypic expression at relatively low blood mutant loads. Neuropathological studies of two patients manifesting with LS/MELAS showed prominent capillary proliferation, microvacuolation and severe neuronal cell loss in the brainstem and cerebellum, with conspicuous absence of basal ganglia involvement. These findings suggest that whole mtDNA genome sequencing should be considered in patients with suspected mitochondrial disease presenting with complex neurological manifestations, which would identify over 300 known pathogenic variants including the m.13094T>C.
19122133	Obsessive-compulsive disorder with mitochondrial disease. BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial diseases are among the most common genetic disorders, and they have been associated with several psychiatric syndromes. METHOD: The authors present two cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) occurring in patients with MELAS (the A3243G mutation). RESULTS: Their clinical course and response to standard OCD treatment strategies was poor. DISCUSSION: Possible mechanisms for OCD symptoms are suggested by animal models and neuropathological findings. It remains unclear whether different types of mitochondrial disorders are associated with particular neuropsychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms may predate the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorder; thus, psychiatrists should consider mitochondrial disorders in the presence of common physical signs that are typically associated with these disorders.
10231056	Microinjection of mitochondria into zygotes creates a model for studying the inheritance of mitochondrial DNA during preimplantation development. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of mutant mitochondria on preimplantation embryo development and of preimplantation embryo development on the survival of mutant mitochondrial DNA. DESIGN: Laboratory research. SETTING: Academic research laboratory. PATIENT(S): None. INTERVENTION(S): Mutant and wild-type mitochondria, fractionated from tissue obtained from a patient with MELAS syndrome, a mitochondrial disease, were microinjected into mouse zygotes. Control zygotes received either no injection or sham injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Preimplantation embryo development and survival of mutant mitochondrial DNA as determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULT(S): After microinjection into zygotes, the MELAS mutation could be identified by polymerase chain reaction until the hatched blastocyst stage of embryo development. The survival of MELAS-injected zygotes, observed for 4 days after injection, did not differ from the survival of zygotes injected with wild-type mitochondria or from the survival of uninjected or sham-injected controls. CONCLUSION(S): It appears that preimplantation embryo development does not screen out mitochondrial DNA mutations introduced into fertilized oocytes, and low levels of mutant mitochondrial DNA do not disrupt early embryo development.
27815040	The addition of ketone bodies alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring complex I assembly in a MELAS cellular model. Ketogenic Diet used to treat refractory epilepsy for almost a century may represent a treatment option for mitochondrial disorders for which effective treatments are still lacking. Mitochondrial complex I deficiencies are involved in a broad spectrum of inherited diseases including Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes syndrome leading to recurrent cerebral insults resembling strokes and associated with a severe complex I deficiency caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. The analysis of MELAS neuronal cybrid cells carrying the almost homoplasmic m.3243A>G mutation revealed a metabolic switch towards glycolysis with the production of lactic acid, severe defects in respiratory chain activity and complex I disassembly with an accumulation of assembly intermediates. Metabolites, NADH/NAD+ ratio, mitochondrial enzyme activities, oxygen consumption and BN-PAGE analysis were evaluated in mutant compared to control cells. A severe complex I enzymatic deficiency was identified associated with a major complex I disassembly with an accumulation of assembly intermediates of 400kDa. We showed that Ketone Bodies (KB) exposure for 4weeks associated with glucose deprivation significantly restored complex I stability and activity, increased ATP synthesis and reduced the NADH/NAD+ ratio, a key component of mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, without changing the mutant load, mtDNA copy number was significantly increased with KB, indicating that the absolute amount of wild type mtDNA copy number was higher in treated mutant cells. Therefore KB may constitute an alternative and promising therapy for MELAS syndrome, and could be beneficial for other mitochondrial diseases caused by complex I deficiency.
34106788	Effect of rapamycin on mitochondria and lysosomes in fibroblasts from patients with mtDNA mutations. Maintaining mitochondrial function and dynamics is crucial for cellular health. In muscle, defects in mitochondria result in severe myopathies where accumulation of damaged mitochondria causes deterioration and dysfunction. Importantly, understanding the role of mitochondria in disease is a necessity to determine future therapeutics. One of the most common myopathies is mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis stroke-like episodes (MELAS), which has no current treatment. Recently, patients with MELAS treated with rapamycin exhibited improved clinical outcomes. However, the cellular mechanisms of rapamycin effects in patients with MELAS are currently unknown. In this study, we used cultured skin fibroblasts as a window into the mitochondrial dysfunction evident in MELAS cells, as well as to study the mechanisms of rapamycin action, compared with control, healthy individuals. We observed that mitochondria from patients were fragmented, had a threefold decline in the average speed of motility, a twofold reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and a 1.5- to 2-fold decline in basal respiration. Despite the reduction in mitochondrial function, mitochondrial import protein Tim23 was elevated in patient cell lines. MELAS fibroblasts exhibited increased MnSOD levels and lysosomal function when compared with healthy controls. Treatment of MELAS fibroblasts with rapamycin for 24 h resulted in increased mitochondrial respiration compared with control cells, a higher lysosome content, and a greater localization of mitochondria to lysosomes. Our studies suggest that rapamycin has the potential to improve cellular health even in the presence of mtDNA defects, primarily via an increase in lysosomal content.
24473421	MELAS, an important consideration in the adult population presenting with unusual and recurrent stroke-like episodes. A 48-year-old man was admitted for workup of stroke-like symptoms and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. History and examination revealed that the patient had background diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus, epilepsy and had suffered a temporal lobe infarct 3 years ago. The unusual presentation and physical findings, along with subsequent MRI findings led to a diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). MELAS is a mitochondrial disorder typified by the aforementioned symptoms, and is typically diagnosed in the first two decades of life. 
26851065	Impaired nitric oxide production in children with MELAS syndrome and the effect of arginine and citrulline supplementation. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is one of the most frequent maternally inherited mitochondrial disorders. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is not fully understood and believed to result from several interacting mechanisms including impaired mitochondrial energy production, microvasculature angiopathy, and nitric oxide (NO) deficiency. NO deficiency in MELAS syndrome is likely to be multifactorial in origin with the decreased availability of the NO precursors, arginine and citrulline, playing a major role. In this study we used stable isotope infusion techniques to assess NO production in children with MELAS syndrome and healthy pediatric controls. We also assessed the effect of oral arginine and citrulline supplementations on NO production in children with MELAS syndrome. When compared to control subjects, children with MELAS syndrome were found to have lower NO production, arginine flux, plasma arginine, and citrulline flux. In children with MELAS syndrome, arginine supplementation resulted in increased NO production, arginine flux, and arginine concentration. Citrulline supplementation resulted in a greater increase of these parameters. Additionally, citrulline supplementation was associated with a robust increase in citrulline concentration and flux and de novo arginine synthesis rate. The greater effect of citrulline in increasing NO production is due to its greater ability to increase arginine availability particularly in the intracellular compartment in which NO synthesis takes place. This study, which is the first one to assess NO metabolism in children with mitochondrial diseases, adds more evidence to the notion that NO deficiency occurs in MELAS syndrome, suggests a better effect for citrulline because of its greater role as NO precursor, and indicates that impaired NO production occurs in children as well as adults with MELAS syndrome. Thus, the initiation of treatment with NO precursors may be beneficial earlier in life. Controlled clinical trials to assess the therapeutic effects of arginine and citrulline on clinical complications of MELAS syndrome are needed.

26960270	[A case of rhabdomyolysis after status epilepticus without stroke-like episodes in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes]. A 24-year-old man was referred to our hospital emergency department due to a sudden onset of convulsions after drinking. On arrival he presented status epilepticus and was managed by artificial ventilation. He had no brainstem signs or meningeal irritation. Head MRI showed an old infarction-like lesion in the left occipital lobe, but no abnormal signals on diffusion-weighted images. The patient showed acute rhabdomyolysis (CK 18,000 IU/l) and renal failure, and hemodialysis was started. On 18 day after admission, he was transferred to our department with mild proximal limb muscle weakness and bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment. Electroencephalography demonstrated diffuse intermittent slow wave activities. We suspected a mitochondrial disease because of a significant increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio (24.1) in the spinal fluid, and identified A3243G mutations in mitochondrial DNA (heteroplasmy 20%) in peripheral white blood cells. We diagnosed his illness as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). This is a rare case presenting an acute onset of rhabdomyolysis following alcohol intake related to A3243G mitochondrial mutation without preceding stroke-like episodes. 
17316689	Regional cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity during chronic stage of stroke-like episodes in MELAS -- implication of neurovascular cellular mechanism. BACKGROUND: Ischemic vascular hypothesis as a causative role in the pathogenesis of stroke-like episodes in MELAS remains to be debated. METHODS: This study consisted of two parts. Part 1 is a clinicoradiological study during acute stage of 18 consecutive stroke-like episodes in six patients with MELAS. Part 2 is a SPECT study to assess the regional cerebrovascular reactivity (rCVR) to acetazolamide during chronic stage in five patients with MELAS. RESULTS: Headache and epileptic seizure were the most common presenting symptoms. Unique features of acute stroke-like lesions included progressive spread of cortical lesions with vasogenic edema, focal periodic epileptiform discharges, focal hyperperfusion, and cortical laminar necrosis during subacute stage. During chronic stage, SPECT showed hypoperfusion in non-affected occipital cortex in three patients as well as in previously affected regions in four. The rCVR was preserved in three patients, focally impaired in one, and extensively impaired in one, but relatively preserved in the occipital cortex in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke-like episodes could be non-ischemic neurovascular events initiated by neuronal hyperexcitability. Once neuronal hyperexcitability develops in a focal brain region, epileptic activities depolarize adjacent neurons, leading to a propagation of epileptic activities into the surrounding cortex, and resulting in energy imbalance. The mechanisms for neuronal hyperexcitability remain to be elucidated.
10334931	Molecular and histological evaluation of pancreata from patients with a mitochondrial gene mutation associated with impaired insulin secretion. A mutation in mitochondrial DNA, which was originally identified in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), can be associated with a subtype of diabetes mellitus. To determine the molecular and histological basis of impaired insulin secretion in the subjects with this mutation, we studied autopsy pancreata specimens from eight subjects diagnosed as having MELAS. The 3243 bp mutation was identified in seven out of eight pancreata examined. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated a reduction in total islet mass, and in the numbers of both B and A cells. No evidence of insulitis or apoptosis was found. These data suggested that the 3243 bp mutation may cause the reduction of islet cells, mainly through mechanisms other than autoimmune destruction.
12625574	Cochlear implantation in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of a Nucleus C124M cochlear implant in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 29-year-old woman with MELAS syndrome presented with sensorineural hearing loss and diabetes mellitus and underwent multichannel cochlear implantation. The follow-up period was 10 months. The case history, assessment of mitochondrial disease, indications for the cochlear implant and the benefits of cochlear implantation were evaluated. RESULTS: Nine months after the surgery the patient could use the telephone and was quite satisfied with the improvement in communication due to the cochlear implant. CONCLUSION: Cochlear implantation can be recommended for patients with MELAS syndrome if they have residual retrocochlear function. Single photon emission computerized tomography was found to be very useful for evaluating retrocochlear function.
26935953	Sigmoid volvulus in a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS): a rare occurrence. Mitochondrial diseases are rare and devastating, with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and systemic symptoms. The majority of the published literature focuses on the neuromuscular manifestations and genetic components of this mitochondrial cytopathy, however, cardiac, renal, endocrine and gastrointestinal manifestations may also be present. The authors report a case detailing a 56-year-old woman's final hospitalisation from the gastrointestinal sequelae of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (Co Q10 deficiency variant). She presented with abdominal pain and distension associated with lactic acidosis, and was shown on imaging to have a colon perforation. This resulted in emergent surgery at which a necrotic colon secondary to a sigmoid colon was identified. Following four subsequent operations, and the development of multiorgan failure, care was eventually withdrawn. Practitioners of patients with MELAS should be cognisant of the rare but devastating gastrointestinal consequences of mitochondrial diseases. 
12013959	[MELAS presenting herpes simplex encephalitis]. 
12509858	Is the mitochondrial complex I ND5 gene a hot-spot for MELAS causing mutations? We identified two novel heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA point mutations in the gene encoding the ND5 subunit of complex I: a 12770A-->G transition identified in a patient with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and a 13045A-->C transversion in a patient with a MELAS/Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy/Leigh's overlap syndrome. Biochemical analysis of muscle homogenates showed normal or very mildly reduced complex I activity. Histochemistry was normal. Our observations add to the evidence that mitochondrial ND5 protein coding gene mutations frequently associate with the MELAS phenotype, and it highlights the role of complex I dysfunction in MELAS.
33397536	Imaging in Sequential Stroke-like Episodes in Adult MELAS. 
10356136	Infantile encephalopathy associated with the MELAS A3243G mutation. MELAS syndrome is typically characterized by normal early development and childhood-onset recurrent neurologic deficits (stroke-like episodes), seizures, short stature, lactic acidosis, and ragged red fibers on muscle biopsy specimens. It is usually, but not invariably, associated with the A3243G point mutation in the mitochondrial DNA tRNALeu(UUR) gene. We report 3 unrelated children with the A3243G mutation who presented with severe psychomotor delay in early infancy. One patient's clinical picture was more consistent with Leigh syndrome, with apneic episodes, ataxia, and bilateral striatal lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The second patient had generalized seizures refractory to treatment and bilateral occipital lesions on brain MRI. The third child had atypical retinal pigmentary changes, seizures, areflexia, and cerebral atrophy on brain MRI. All patients had several atypical features in addition to early onset: absence of an acute or focal neurologic deficit, variable serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels, lack of ragged red fibers in muscle biopsy specimens. The proportion of mutant mtDNA in available tissues was relatively low (range, 5% to 51% in muscle; 4% to 39% in blood). These observations further extend the phenotypic expression of the A3243G "MELAS" mutation. Our findings confirm previous observations that there is poor correlation between abundance of mutant mtDNA in peripheral tissues and neurologic phenotype. This suggests that other factors contribute to the phenotypic expression of this mutation.
17228817	[Usefulness of L-arginine infusion for status epilepticus in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes]. We encountered an 11-year-old girl with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who developed occipital lobe epilepsy at the age of 7 years and 4 months. Thereafter she had repeated status epilepticus associated with stroke-like episodes. Status epilepticus consisted of repetitive complex partial seizures with or without secondarily generalized tonic clonic seizures. The seizures did not respond to conventional anticonvulsive drugs, including diazepam, midazolam, phenytoin, lidocaine, chloral hydrate, and thiamylal sodium, and lasted for several hours (mean 9.5 hours). At the age of 11 years, intravenous infusion of L-arginine (0.5 g/kg body weight) was first given five hours after the onset of status epilepticus. The seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities improved dramatically. After the introduction of L-arginine, in addition to shortened duration of status epilepticus (mean 3 hours), clinical recovery from the status epilepticus was prompt, and the average hospitalization periods could be shortened. There were no obvious adverse effects, including vomiting, hypotension, and urticaria. Our experience suggests that early intravenous administration of L-arginine may be useful in the treatment of status epilepticus associated with stroke-like episode in patients with MELAS.
29921486	Comparison of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with arterial spin labeling (ASL) in the differentiation between mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic Acidosis, plus stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS). To compare the utility and limitation of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) in the differentiation between mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, plus stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS), a retrospective review of 17 MELAS and 26 AIS patients were performed. In all patients both MRS and ASL scans were performed within 1 week after admission. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and MR imaging data were reviewed and compared between the two groups. Compared with AIS, MELAS patients had a younger age of onset, a longer disease duration, a higher occurrence of epilepsy attack, occipital and parietal lesions, and dilated cerebral arteries (P < 0.05). In all MELAS patients lactate peak and hyperperfusion of the lesion was revealed. However in AIS lactate peak was observed in only 69.2% and hyperperfusion was observed in only 34.6% ischemic lesions (P < 0.05). Choline/Creatine ratios and Lactate/Creatine ratios were higher in AIS, while in MELAS cerebral blood flow and lesion-normal perfusion ratio was much higher (P < 0.05). No correlations was found between metabolite ratios and perfusion parameters in either group (P > 0.05). Area under curve (AUC) of perfusion for the differentiation between MELAS and AIS was 0.958 (P < 0.001). The cut-off value was 2.075, with a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 96.2%. AUC of Lactate/Creatine ratio was 0.469 (P = 0.737). Utility of MRS is limited in the differentiation between MELAS and AIS, while MR perfusion profiles are much more sensitive and specific.
20556599	The appearance of ADCs in the non-affected areas of the patients with MELAS. INTRODUCTION: The exact mechanism of the mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) remain unclear. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique for studying the pathophysiologic change of the MELAS. The purpose of the study is to see whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of MELAS in the non-affected areas is different from the ADC of the normal subjects and to speculate the pathophysiological mechanisms of the MELAS. METHODS: Sixteen cases of MELAS were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty healthy subjects were chosen to constitute the control group. All of them were performed on the 3.0T whole-body MR scanner with axial view T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (flair), T2-weighted imaging, T1flair, and DWI. An ADC map was reconstructed in the workstation. Two to five regions of interest were put in the non-affected frontal lobe and basal ganglia. All data took statistical analysis. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the ADC of the patients with MELAS and the controls in the non-affected areas, including the superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, corpus striatum, thalamus, and white matter of the semi-oval centrum. CONCLUSION: ADCs in the non-affected areas of the patients with MELAS are higher than those of the normal subjects. Pathological changes take place in the non-affected areas of the patients with MELAS.
29980632	Emerging therapies for mitochondrial diseases. For the vast majority of patients with mitochondrial diseases, only supportive and symptomatic therapies are available. However, in the last decade, due to extraordinary advances in defining the causes and pathomechanisms of these diverse disorders, new therapies are being developed in the laboratory and are entering human clinical trials. In this review, we highlight the current use of dietary supplement and exercise therapies as well as emerging therapies that may be broadly applicable across multiple mitochondrial diseases or tailored for specific disorders. Examples of non-tailored therapeutic targets include: activation of mitochondrial biogenesis, regulation of mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics, bypass of biochemical defects, mitochondrial replacement therapy, and hypoxia. In contrast, tailored therapies are: scavenging of toxic compounds, deoxynucleoside and deoxynucleotide treatments, cell replacement therapies, gene therapy, shifting mitochondrial DNA mutation heteroplasmy, and stabilization of mutant mitochondrial transfer RNAs.
20610441	MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome: a double pathogenic mutation in mitochondrial tRNA genes. BACKGROUND: Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibres (MERRF) and mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) are established phenotypes of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. The m.8356T>C transition in the mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) gene is a pathogenic mutations of MERRF. The m.3243A>G transition in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu) gene is detected in most MELAS patients. Although previous analyses of double mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were useful for discussing their nature, many unsolved questions remain. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and genetic features of a family with the above mtDNA double-point mutations and discuss the role of double mtDNA mutations in diverse clinical features in the family. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The proband was a 23-year-old woman with MERRF harbouring m.8356T>C and m.3243A>G transitions in mitochondrial tRNA genes. We assessed clinical aspects of her and those of her three relatives and performed mutation analyses on their mtDNA. RESULTS: Phenotypes of the four patients were MERRF, MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome and asymptomatic carrier. We hypothesise that the course of the phenotype of this family begins with MERRF and is followed by MELAS. This double mutation was heteroplasmic in blood of all four patients but with different rates in each patient, while m.8356T>C appeared homoplasmic and m.3243A>G was heteroplasmic in muscle of the two examined cases. No other mutations were detected in the total mtDNA sequence in this family. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of a double-point mutation in mtDNA, both of which were heteroplasmic and pathogenic for the established phenotypes.
28202819	[MELAS: Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-Like Episodes]. Mitochondrial disease is caused by a deficiency in the energy supply to cells due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial disease that presents with stroke-like episodes such as acute onset of neurological deficits and characteristic imaging findings. Stroke-like episodes in MELAS have the following features: 1) neurological deficits due to localization of lesions in the brain, 2) episodes often accompany epilepsy, 3) lesions do not follow the vascular supply area, 4) lesions are more often seen in the posterior brain than in the anterior brain, 5) lesions spread to an adjacent area in the brain, and 6) neurological symptoms often disappear together with imaging findings, but later relapse. About 80% of patients with MELAS have an A-to-G transition mutation at the nucleotide pair 3243 in the dihydrouridine loop of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR), which causes the absence of posttranscriptional taurine modification at the wobble nucleotide of mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) and disrupts protein synthesis. However, the precise pathophysiology of stroke-like episodes is under investigation, with possible hypotheses for these episodes including mitochondrial angiopathy, mitochondrial cytopathy, and neuron-astrocyte uncoupling. With regard to treatment, L-arginine and taurine have recently been suggested for relief of clinical symptoms.
20440095	Mutational analysis of whole mitochondrial DNA in patients with MELAS and MERRF diseases. Mitochondrial diseases are clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders, which make the exact diagnosis and classification difficult. The purpose of this study was to identify pathogenic mtDNA mutations in 61 Korean unrelated families (or isolated patients) with MELAS or MERRF. In particular, the mtDNA sequences were completely determined for 49 patients. From the mutational analysis of mtDNA obtained from blood, 5 confirmed pathogenic mutations were identified in 17 families, and 4 unreported pathogenically suspected mutations were identified in 4 families. The m.3243A>G in the tRNA(Leu(UUR))was predominantly observed in 10 MELAS families, and followed by m.8344A>G in the tRNA(Lys) of 4 MERRF families. Most pathogenic mutations showed heteroplasmy, and the rates were considerably different within the familial members. Patients with a higher rate of mutations showed a tendency of having more severe clinical phenotypes, but not in all cases. This study will be helpful for the molecular diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases, as well as establishment of mtDNA database in Koreans.
11708999	Hearing impairment is common in various phenotypes of the mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are common symptoms within different phenotypes of the mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. DESIGN: A series of 52 adults with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies and their symptomatic relatives were screened for the A3243G mutation using restriction enzyme analysis. In addition to clinical examination, patients with the mutation underwent audiometry. RESULTS: The A3243G mutation was identified in 16 patients (10 index patients and 6 symptomatic relatives). Six of these patients presented with strokelike episodes and met the classical criteria of MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes), and one had MELAS/MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers) overlap syndrome. Two patients presented with strokelike episodes but did not meet the classical criteria of MELAS. Predominant features of the 8 other patients were myopathy with hearing loss and diabetes mellitus (n = 1), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (n = 1), diabetes mellitus with hearing loss (n = 1), painful muscle stiffness with hearing loss (n = 1), cardiomyopathy (n = 1), diabetes mellitus (n = 1), and hearing loss (n = 2). In 11 of 16 patients, hearing impairment was obvious on clinical examination. Furthermore, all 5 patients with normal hearing on clinical examination showed subclinical hearing loss; in 4, hearing loss was more pronounced than age-related hearing impairment and in 1, hearing loss can be age related as well. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of phenotypes represent the variable multisystemic involvement of the A3243G mutation. Less than half of the patients presented with MELAS. Hearing impairment, the most common symptom, was clinically or subclinically relevant in 15 (94%) of 16 patients.
31163261	Sperm ultrastructure in several species of Carabidae beetles (Insecta, Adephaga) and their organization in spermatozeugmata. Sperm structure of seven species from different Carabidae tribes was studied. Carabus preslii and Carabus granulatus interstitialis form sperm bundles (spermatozeugmata) in which the heads of conventional insect sperm cells are embedded in the apical cap (spermatostyle), leaving the posterior flagella free. On the contrary, Pterostichus morio, Pterostichus melas, Pterostichus melanarius and Amara aulica form complex spermatozeugmata bearing conspicuous axial spermatostyles associated with lateral groups of sperm. Individual sperm cells are contained in chambers delimited by laminar extensions of the cortical region of the spermatostyle. Demetrias atricapillus shares the general spermatozeugma structure with the above species, but the anterior spermatostyle region has a different structure and posteriorly, the lateral groups of sperm are separated from the spermatostyle but remain connected to it by peduncles consisting of extensions of the cortical region of the spermatostyle. The sperm of the species examined in the study consist of a short, flat acrosomal cap and, with the exception of the Carabus species, show long nuclei which extend parallel to the axonemes, along the flagella. Two relatively small mitochondrial derivatives and two small accessory bodies flank the axoneme. These bodies become very thick in the posterior flagellar region of D. atricapillus. The study revealed different spermatozeugma models and different sperm organization in the Carabidae family.
23774553	MELAS and reversible vasoconstriction of the major cerebral arteries. A 26-year-old woman was admitted due to an altered mental status and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She had experienced chronic migraine-like headaches, progressive bilateral hearing loss, a short stature and nephrotic syndrome. Laboratory data showed elevated lactate and pyruvate levels. Brain MRI using diffusion-weighted imaging revealed a hyperintense lesion in the left temporal lobe. MR angiography revealed segmental stenosis at the C1 and M1-2 junction. A genetic study revealed a mitochondrial DNA A3243G point mutation. The patient's clinical symptoms and MRI/MR angiography (MRA) findings improved within four weeks. We herein discuss the possible pathophysiology involving both stroke-like episodes and reversible vasoconstriction.
10891641	Otoacoustic emission in patients with neurological disorders who have auditory brainstem response abnormality. Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were evaluated in 51 ears of 30 patients with a severe auditory brainstem response (ABR) waveform abnormality. Thirteen ears showed no ABR to click sound of higher intensity than 100 dBSPL (group 1). Fourteen ears exhibited only wave V or a decreased amplitude pattern of ABR (group 2). Twenty-four ears showed a predominant wave I or no wave III pattern (group 3). Almost all the ears with absent ABR showed no OAE, which strongly suggested hearing loss of cochlear origin, although one patient with alternating hemiplegia of childhood exhibited definite OAEs and auditory reactions without ABR. One patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) and her mother in group 2 had OAE abnormalities, which also suggested mild to severe hearing impairment. When OAEs are present, an accompanying ABR abnormality may be produced by brainstem dysfunction of the underlying disorder such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. There was a significant relationship (chi-square test P<0.001) between the positivity of the distortion product OAE response and the clinical auditory reactions in 24 patients, although their ABR abnormalities did not reflect hearing impairment directly. Careful examination of both audiometry and OAEs might be necessary for further assessment of the hearing function in pediatric patients with neurological disorders and specific auditory nerve disease.

17535832	Novel mutations of ND genes in complex I deficiency associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy. Isolated Complex I (CI) deficiency, the most frequent cause of mitochondrial disease, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. Complex I is a giant multiheteromeric enzyme composed of seven ND subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes, and at least 38 subunits encoded by nuclear genes. To establish the contribution to human mitochondrial encephalopathy of ND versus nuclear gene mutations, we have been undertaking a systematic analysis of CI genes in a cohort of 46 adult and paediatric patients with biochemically defined CI defect. Sequence analysis of the entire mtDNA let us identify six patients with mutations in ND genes. The clinical presentations varied, from infantile Leigh syndrome, to childhood MELAS, to adult-onset encephalopathic syndromes of variable severity. Three of the mutations were not previously reported (3481G > A, 14600G > A and 13063G > A, in ND1, ND6 and ND5 genes, respectively) and were further investigated in mutant transmitochondrial cybrids. Tight correlation between mutation load and decrease in CI activity was observed in each of the three mutant cybrid lines, supporting the pathogenic role of the novel mutations. Structural studies on mutant cybrids showed impaired assembly or reduced stability of the holoenzyme complex. In our experience ND gene mutations are relatively common in CI-defective mitochondrial encephalopathy of both children and adults.
16476819	Aortic rupture in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. BACKGROUND: Microangiopathy has been well described in the brain and muscle of patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with the common A3243G/MELAS point mutation who had aortic rupture and whose mother also died of large vessel rupture. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Collaboration between a primary care hospital and 2 academic tertiary care hospitals. RESULTS: Histologically, there was marked disarray of the smooth muscle architecture of the aorta, and immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the mitochondrial DNA-encoded cytochrome-C oxidase I subunit showed uniformly decreased immunostaining of the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the aorta and vasa vasorum. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that the mutation load was 40.5% in blood but 85.3% in the blood vessels. CONCLUSIONS: The severe vasculopathy in this patient is probably directly related to the high mutation load in the blood vessels. Although aortic rupture is an unusual manifestation of MELAS, it is an important potential complication in patients undergoing minor surgical procedures.
10462141	Renal complications in patients with diabetes mellitus associated with an A to G mutation of mitochondrial DNA at the 3243 position of leucine tRNA. The substitution of guanine for adenine at position 3243 of the leucine tRNA gene of mitochondrial DNA was originally described in association with MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes). Diabetes mellitus associated with the mutation (mitochondrial diabetes) is a different phenotype from MELAS. We identified 11 patients with the mutation among 385 Japanese diabetic patients: two had MELAS and nine had mitochondrial diabetes. We present data on a male patient with mitochondrial diabetes who developed the nephrotic syndrome at the age of 23. Light microscopy revealed mesangial expansion, PAS-positive deposits and segmental sclerosis in the glomeruli. Scattered mesangial electron-dense deposits and thickening of the basement membrane were found on electron microscopy, suggesting that diabetic glomerulosclerosis accompanied by focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS). Mitochondrial diabetes may pre-dispose patients to renal complications, including forms of glomerulonephritis, such as FGS.
15206559	Successful treatment with succinate in a patient with MELAS. We present a case report of a 27-year-old man with MELAS, who presented with general convulsions and left flaccid hemiparesis. Anticonvulsant drugs failed to achieve complete control of his convulsions. A good response to oral administration of succinate has been maintained for more than 30 months, with no recurrence of any stroke-like episode. Succinate therapy may have potential for treatment of uncontrolled convulsive MELAS patients.
15823923	Mitochondrial T9957C mutation in association with NAION and seizures but not MELAS. PURPOSE: To assess the functional significance of the mitochondrial nt-9957 mutation in a man with non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). This nt-9957 mutation has been previously reported in association with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like events (MELAS). METHODS: The patient was examined clinically and with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. The entire coding region of the mitochondrial genome was sequenced, and mitochondrial function was assessed by flow cytometry after staining with fluorescent dihydroethidium. RESULTS: This 76-year-old man had optic nerve disease bilaterally and seizures, but no clinical or radiological evidence of MELAS. He had no mitochondrial DNA mutation other than the 9957. Functional testing revealed a severe defect in mitochondrial complex III activity. CONCLUSIONS: This patient had a mitochondrial functional deficit consistent with his 9957 mutation. It seems quite likely that this mutation may be responsible for optic nerve and brain injuries.
20060349	Treatment of mitochondrial electron transport chain disorders: a review of clinical trials over the past decade. While many treatments for mitochondrial electron transport (respiratory) chain disorders have been suggested, relatively few have undergone controlled clinical trials. This review focuses on the recent history of clinical trials of dichloroacetate (DCA), arginine, coenzyme Q(10), idebenone, and exercise in both primary (congenital) disorders and secondary (degenerative) disorders. Despite prior clinical impressions that DCA had a positive effect on mitochondrial disorders, two trials of diverse subjects failed to demonstrate a clinically significant benefit, and a trial of DCA in MELAS found a major negative effect of neuropathy. Arginine also has been used to treat MELAS with promising effects, although a controlled trial is still needed for this potentially toxic agent. The anti-oxidant coenzyme Q(10) is very widely used for primary mitochondrial disorders but has not yet undergone a controlled clinical trial; such a trial is now underway, as well as trials of the co-Q analogue idebenone for MELAS and LHON. Greater experience has accumulated with multi-center trials of coenzyme Q(10) treatment to prevent the progression of Parkinson disease. Although initial smaller trials indicated a benefit, this has not yet been confirmed in subsequent trials with higher doses; a larger Phase III trial is now underway. Similarly, a series of trials of idebenone for Friedreich ataxia have shown some benefit in slowing the progression of cardiomyopathy, and controlled clinical trials are now underway to determine if there is significant neurological protection. Uncontrolled trials of exercise showed an increase of exercise tolerance in patients with disorders of mitochondrial DNA, but did not selectively increase the percentage of normal mtDNA; a larger partially controlled trial is now underway to evaluate this possible benefit. In summary, none of the controlled trials so far has conclusively shown a benefit of treatment with the agents tested, but some promising therapies are currently being evaluated in a controlled manner. These experiences underscore the importance of controlled clinical trials for evaluation of benefits and risks of recommended therapies. Application of such clinical trials to future more effective therapies for mitochondrial disorders will require multi-center collaboration, organization, leadership, and financial and advocacy support.
26391741	Advances in the Treatment of MELAS Syndrome: Could Cognitive Rehabilitation Have a Role? Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes syndrome (MELAS) is a rare inherited mitochondrial disorder, commonly due to the m.3243A>G mutation, which typically presents with seizures, headaches, and acute neurological stroke-mimicking deficits. At onset, there is often no general intellectual deterioration in these patients, although specific cognitive deficits in peculiar language domains, visual construction, attention, abstraction, or flexibility may be present. To date, there is no evidence for an effective treatment in individuals with MELAS. Herein, we describe the case of young woman affected by MELAS who underwent an intensive cognitive training by means of the following methods: (a) traditional cognitive training, (b) computerized cognitive training (CCT), and (c) CCT plus a low-intensity aerobic motor exercise. We compared her cognitive and psychological profile at baseline (T0) and at the end of each training (i.e., (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3 [T3]) using a proper psychometric battery, and we found a greater improvement at T3. Our findings support the idea that the combined CCT with motor training could represent a valuable therapeutic opportunity in MELAS. 
16690729	Prenatal diagnosis of myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome: contribution to understanding mitochondrial DNA segregation during human embryofetal development. INTRODUCTION: Myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like (MELAS) syndrome, a maternally inherited disorder that is among the most common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases, is usually associated with the m.3242A>G mutation of the mitochondrial tRNA(leu) gene. Very few data are available with respect to prenatal diagnosis of this serious disease. The rate of mutant versus wild-type mtDNA (heteroplasmy) in fetal DNA is indeed considered to be a poor indicator of postnatal outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Taking advantage of a novel semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for m.3243A>G mutant load assessment, we carried out nine prenatal diagnoses in five unrelated women, using two different fetal tissues (chorionic villi v amniocytes) sampled at two or three different stages of pregnancy. RESULTS: Two of the five women, although not carrying m.3243A>G in blood or extra-blood tissues, were, however, considered at risk for transmission of the mutation, as they were closely related to MELAS-affected individuals. The absence of 3243A>G in the blood of first degree relatives was associated with no mutated mtDNA in the cardiovascular system (CVS) or amniocytes, and their three children are healthy, with a follow-up of 3 months-3 years. Among the six fetuses from the three carrier women, three were shown to be homoplasmic (0% mutant load), the remaining three being heteroplasmic, with a mutant load ranging from 23% to 63%. The fetal mutant load was fairly stable at two or three different stages of pregnancy in CVS and amniocytes. Although pregnancy was terminated in the case of the fetus with a 63% mutant load, all other children are healthy with a follow-up of 3 months-6 years. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a prenatal diagnosis for MELAS syndrome might be helpful for at-risk families.

15841411	Cochlear implantation in patients with MELAS syndrome. MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a rare congenital disorder of mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA). Patients with this syndrome may present to the otolaryngologist with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that is genetic in origin. Mitochondrial cytopathies can present with a variety of symptoms, but they occasionally present with SNHL as their first manifestation. Two cases of MELAS patients who responded well to cochlear implantation are presented. A review of the literature is also carried out focusing mainly on diagnosis, anesthetic considerations and management of these patients.
17689757	A surviving case of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy diagnosed from the symptoms of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. A 49-year-old female cardiomyopathic patient with heart, hepatic, and renal failure and lactic acidosis was transferred to the intensive care unit without a unifying diagnosis. She was of short stature (145 cm tall), had difficulty in hearing, a past history of complete atrioventricular block, and had received a permanent pacemaker. She had been diagnosed and treated as dilated cardiomyopathy by her primary doctor. Treatment in the intensive care unit for 21 days including plasma exchange, continuous hemodiafiltration, artificial ventilation, and administration of catecholamine, carperitide, and a large amount of coenzyme Q10 (210 mg/day) improved the symptoms. Genetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA from leukocytes and sternocleidomastoid muscle revealed a 3243A>G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu (UUR)) gene, which is related to mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). The patient recovered through intensive care and could be discharged from hospital without any sequelae. This case was mitochondrial cardiomyopathy diagnosed from the symptoms of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Cardiomyopathy due to the mutation of mitochondrial DNA is not a common disease. However, it should be considered as a possible cause of heart failure.
32348839	Clinical and molecular characterization of pediatric mitochondrial disorders in south of China. Mitochondrial disorders (MDs) are genetic ailments affecting all age groups. Epidemiological data and frequencies of gene mutations in pediatric patients in China are scarce. This retrospective study assessed 101 patients with suspected MDs treated at the Neurology Department of Children's Hospital, Fudan University, in 2011-2017. Mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (nDNA) samples were assessed by long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based whole mtDNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES) for identifying pathogenic mutations. Muscle samples underwent various staining protocols and immunofluorescence for detecting selected proteins. Seventeen mutations in the MT-TL1, MT-COX2, MT-ND4, MT, tRNA TRNE, MT-TN, MT-TK, MT-ATP6, MT-ND6, MT-ND3 and MT-CO3 genes were identified in 39 patients, of which m.3243A > G, m.3303C > T, m.8993T > C/G, m.9176T > C, and m.10191T > C were most common. Mitochondrial myopathy and MELAS were most common for m.3243A > G mutation. Four novel mutations were detected, including m.9478insT, m.5666T > C, m.8265T > C, and m.8380-13600 deletion mutations related to Leigh syndrome, mitochondrial myopathy and KSS, respectively. Thirty-three mutations in the TK2, POLG, IBA57, HADHB, FBXL4, ALDH5A1, FOXRED1, TPK1, NDUFAF5, NDUFAF7, NDUFV1, CARS2, PDHA1, and HIBCH genes were identified in 19 patients, including 23 currently unknown. Higher rates of TK2, POLG, IBA57, and HADHB mutations were found in nDNA-mutated MD compared with the remaining individuals. Besides, IBA57 c.286T > C (p.Y96H), TK2 c.497A > T (p.D166V) founder mutations critically contributed to MDs. Comprehensive genomic analysis plays a critical role in pediatric MD diagnosis. These data summarize the relative frequencies of different gene mutations in a large Chinese population, and identified 23 novel MD-associated nDNA and 4 novel mtDNA mutations.
19344965	CMR gives clue to "ragged red fibers" in the heart in a patient with mitochondrial myopathy. Mitochondrial myopathy may manifest either as isolated myopathy or as a neuromuscular multisystemic disease and is caused by genetic defects in the mitochondrial genome resulting in respiratory chain disorders. MELAS, which is characterised by mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes due to gene mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (adenine-to-guanine transition at nucleotide pair 3243, m.3243A>G), constitutes such a mitochondrial multisystemic disease. Although hypertrophied or dilated cardiomyopathy is quite common in MELAS, there have been no cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-based studies in these patients so far. This case report represents the first case in which comprehensive CMR and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) data were obtained in the same patient with mitochondrial myopathy. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging demonstrated a unique pattern of myocardial damage and histological work-up revealed the presence of "ragged red fibers" (conglomerates of mitochondria) in the heart tissue verifying the diagnosis of a mitochondrial cardiomyopathy as part of the underlying mitochondrial disease MELAS.
16473046	"Erratic" complex partial status epilepticus as a presenting feature of MELAS. Patients with the syndrome of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) may rarely present with complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE) at clinical onset. We report on a 38-year-old woman with MELAS presenting with multifocal CPSE and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) on EEG during her first strokelike episode. CT scan documented a right temporo-parieto-occipital strokelike lesion. EEG showed prolonged seizure discharges with alternating focus over the temporo-occipital and frontotemporal regions of the right hemisphere; moreover, right frontotemporal PLEDs were evident when the seizure activity was localized in the temporo-occipital region. The electroclinical status and CT findings normalized gradually on carbamazepine therapy. The four other patients with MELAS described in the literature as presenting with CPSE showed unifocal epileptic discharges on EEG. We report for the first time a case in which multifocal CPSE is the presenting feature of MELAS. Our findings document the multifocality of neuronal hyperexcitability in the context of the cerebral strokelike lesion in this syndrome.
23324391	POLG1 mutations and stroke like episodes: a distinct clinical entity rather than an atypical MELAS syndrome. BACKGROUND: POLG1 mutations have been associated with MELAS-like phenotypes. However given several clinical differences it is unknown whether POLG1 mutations are possible causes of MELAS or give raise to a distinct clinical and genetic entity, named POLG1-associated encephalopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 74 years old man carrying POLG1 mutations presenting with strokes, myopathy and ragged red fibers with some atypical aspects for MELAS such as late onset, lack of cerebral calcification and presence of frontal and occipital MRI lesions better consistent with the POLG associated-encephalopathy spectrum. CONCLUSION: The lack of available data hampers a definite diagnosis in our patient as well as makes it difficult to compare MELAS, which is a clearly defined clinical syndrome, with POLG1-associated encephalopathy, which is so far a purely molecularly defined syndrome with a quite heterogeneous clinical picture. However, the present report contributes to expand the phenotypic spectrum of POLG1 mutations underlining the importance of searching POLG1 mutations in patients with mitochondrial signs and MELAS like phenotypes but negative for common mtDNA mutations.
17532800	Comparative anatomy of the foramen ovale in the hearts of cetaceans. The structure of the cardiac foramen ovale from 17 species representing six cetacean families, the Monodontidae, Phocoenidae, Delphinidae, Ziphiidae, Balaenidae and the Balaenopteridae, was studied using the scanning electron microscope. Eight white whale fetuses (Delphinapterus leucas) and a narwhal fetus (Monodon monoceros) represented the Monodontidae; one fetal and nine neonatal harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and a finless porpoise fetus (Neophocoena phocoenoides) represented the Phocoenidae; two white-beaked dolphin fetuses (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), four fetal and one neonatal Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus), a Risso's dolphin fetus (Grampus griseus), two common bottle-nosed dolphin neonates (Tursiops truncatus), a female short-beaked common dolphin fetus (Delphinus delphis), four killer whale fetuses (Orcinus orca) and two long-finned pilot whale fetuses (Globicephala melas) represented the Delphinidae; two northern bottlenose whale fetuses (Hyperoodon ampullatus) represented the Ziphiidae; one bowhead whale fetus (Balaena mysticetus) represented the Balaenidae and five Common minke whale fetuses (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), one blue whale fetus (Balaenoptera musculus), nine fin whale fetuses (Balaenoptera physalus) and four humpback whale fetuses (Megaptera novaeangliae) represented the Balaenopteridae. The hearts of an additional two incompletely identified toothed and four baleen whale fetuses were also studied. In each species the fold of tissue derived from the cardiac septum primum and subtended by the foramen ovale had the appearance of a short tunnel or sleeve which was fenestrated at its distal end. In the toothed whales the tissue fold was tunnel-shaped with the interatrial septum as the floor whereas in baleen whales it was more sleeve-like. In toothed whales thin threads extended from the fold to insert into the interatrial septum whereas a network of threads covered the distal end of the sleeve in the baleen whales. Similar structures were present in the corresponding cardiac tissues of neonatal Hippopotamidae.
16465741	Species and populations of the Anopheles gambiae complex in Cameroon with special emphasis on chromosomal and molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s. We studied the geographical distribution of species, chromosomal, and molecular forms of the Anopheles gambiae Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) complex in 23 sites in Cameroon, Central Africa. Almost all the specimens collected in the four northern-most arid sites were Anopheles arabiensis. Anopheles melas was found in a rural locality surrounded by mangrove swamps, on the Atlantic Coast. In total, 1,525 An. gambiae s.s. females were identified down to their molecular form, and inversion polymorphisms on polytene chromosomes were scored from 186 half-gravid females. The Forest chromosomal form, with standard arrangements almost fixed on both arms of chromosome-2, was the only one observed in the southern, more humid localities. Karyotypes typical of Savanna and Mopti were recorded northwards, in the humid savannas of the Adamawa Province. The molecular forms M and S were widespread throughout Cameroon, and assort independently from the chromosomal forms. S-form populations were characterized by karyotypes typical of Forest and Savanna chromosomal forms, and M-form populations were characterized by karyotypes typical of Forest, Savanna, and Mopti. No M/S hybrid patterns were detected, although M and S mosquitoes were sympatric in 15 sites, providing further evidence for positive assortative mating within molecular forms. The observed ecogeographical distribution of M and S was peculiar: the ecological parameters involved in this distribution still need to be clarified as well as the possible role of competitive exclusion between chromosomally homosequential molecular forms. No difference was observed in host preference or in Plasmodium falciparum infection rates between sympatric M and S populations.

28528606	Vitiligo: Not Simply a Skin Disease. Melanocytes, the cells responsible for skin pigmentation, are present in other parts of the body, such as the ocular, auditory, nervous, and cardiac systems. Within these systems, their roles serve a different purpose than their classical counterparts in skin as pigment cells. Such roles include cell turnover in retinal pigment epithelium, maintenance of balance and prevention of environmental damage in the auditory neuroepithelium, role-playing as dendritic cells within the leptomeninges, and prevention of oxidative damage in adipose tissue. Vitiligo, commonly known as a skin pigmentation disorder, has also been associated with several systemic disorders, such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and Alezzandrini, Kabuki, and MELAS syndromes. Therefore, since these conditions involve compromise of systems in which melanocytes reside, it is not surprising that vitiligo has other systemic associations. The authors present a detailed review of systemic associations of vitiligo and melanocytes' roles in other organ systems with a focus on systemic disease.
22031747	Static inflation and deflation pressure-volume curves from excised lungs of marine mammals. Excised lungs from eight marine mammal species [harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), gray seal (Halichoerus grypush), Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena)] were used to determine the minimum air volume of the relaxed lung (MAV, N=15), the elastic properties (pressure-volume curves, N=24) of the respiratory system and the total lung capacity (TLC). Our data indicate that mass-specific TLC (sTLC, l kg(-1)) does not differ between species or groups (odontocete vs phocid) and agree with that estimated (TLC(est)) from body mass (M(b)) by applying the equation: TLC(est)=0.135 M(b)(0.92). Measured MAV was on average 7% of TLC, with a range from 0 to 16%. The pressure-volume curves were similar among species on inflation but diverged during deflation in phocids in comparison with odontocetes. These differences provide a structural basis for observed species differences in the depth at which lungs collapse and gas exchange ceases.
18664474	PGD to reduce reproductive risk: the case of mitochondrial DNA disorders. This paper discusses the pros and cons of introducing PGD for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders such as NARP (Neurogenic muscle weakness, Ataxia, Retinis Pigmentosa)/Leigh, MELAS (Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes), private mtDNA mutations and LHON (Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy). Although there is little experience with PGD for mtDNA disorders, it is reasonable to assume that in many cases, the best one can achieve is the selection of the 'least' affected embryos for transfer. So instead of 'promising' parents a healthy child, PGD in these cases can only aim at reducing reproductive risk. From an ethical point of view, this raises challenging questions about parental and medical responsibilities. The main argument in favour of PGD is that it offers couples at risk the opportunity of reducing their chances of having a severely affected child. Potential objections are manifold, but we conclude that none of them supplies convincing moral arguments to regard risk-reducing PGD as unacceptable. Nevertheless, introducing this new application of PGD in clinical practice will raise further complex issues of determining conditions for its responsible use.

11589167	Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) may be underdiagnosed when mimicking mitochondrial disease. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) and mitochondrial diseases are multisystem disorders with clinical characteristics that may overlap. We present four patients with CDG whose phenotypes suggested the diagnosis of a mitochondrial disease. Patients 1 and 2 are siblings with hemiplegic headache, stroke-like episodes, lactic acidaemia and history of maternal migraine; their initial clinical diagnosis was MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes). Patient 3 suffers from ataxia, neuropathy, ophtalmoplegia and retinitis pigmentosa suggestive of NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa) syndrome. Patient 4 presented with neurological regression mimicking Leigh disease, with ptosis, myoclonus, ataxia and brainstem and cerebellar atrophy. Screening for mitochondrial disease including enzyme and mtDNA investigations on muscle biopsy were performed on Patients 1, 2 and 4 with normal results. However, evidence for a glycosylation disorder was substantiated by an increased carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT). The isoelectric focussing pattern of serum sialotransferrin was typical of CDG type I in Patients 1, 2 and 3 and was shifted towards the less sialylated bands in case 4. A deficiency of phosphomanomutase (PMM) confirmed the diagnosis of CDG-Ia in Patients 1, 2 and 3, who are compound heterozygous for mutations R141H/T237M (Patients 1 and 2) and R141H/P113L (Patient 3). In Patient 4, PMM activity was normal, and further enzymatic and molecular studies are underway. As the search for the primary defect in mitochondrial diseases is often unsuccessful, the pool of mitochondrial patients that remain without definite diagnosis might include CDG cases. Routine screening for CDG may avoid precocious invasive investigations.
17285419	Anesthetic management of a patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) during laparotomy. A 53-year-old man with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) underwent a gastrectomy. We administered bicarbonated Ringer's solution, which has a physiological concentration of bicarbonate. The level of serum lactate did not increase significantly, and metabolic acidosis did not occur throughout surgery or for 3 h after surgery. Aggressive warming was needed to maintain normothermia, presumably because the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is responsible for thermogenesis, is impaired in MELAS patients. It is important to maintain normothermia in MELAS patients in order to avoid further mitochondrial metabolic depression.
28139706	Identification of miRNA, lncRNA and mRNA-associated ceRNA networks and potential biomarker for MELAS with mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation. Researchers in the field of mitochondrial biology are increasingly unveiling of the complex mechanisms between mitochondrial dysfunction and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, roles of ncRNAs underlying mitochondrial myopathy remain unexplored. The aim of this study was to elucidate the regulating networks of dysregulated ncRNAs in Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) A3243G mutation, which might make contributions to the unveiling of the complex mechanisms underlying mitochondrial myopathy and, possibly, new tools applicable to clinical practice. Through high-throughput technology followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and bioinformatics analyses, for the first time, we found that the dysregulated muscle miRNAs and lncRNAs between 20 MELAS patients with mtDNA A3243G mutation and 20 controls formed complex regulation networks and participated in immune system, signal transduction, translation, muscle contraction and other pathways in discovery and training phase. Then, selected ncRNAs were validated in muscle and serum in independent validation cohorts by qRT-PCR. Finally, ROC curve analysis indicated reduced serum miR-27b-3p had the better diagnosis value than lactate and might serve as a novel, noninvasive biomarker for MELAS. Follow-up investigation is warranted to better understand roles of ncRNAs in mitochondrial myopathy pathogenesis.
17502560	MELAS associated with mutations in the POLG1 gene. 
19709537	[Arreflexic coma and MELAS syndrome]. MELAS is a progressive neurodegenerative and fatal disease characterized by mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. It is the result of a mitochondrial DNA mutation. Although the incidence of MELAS is currently unknown, it is suspected that approximately 1 out of every 5,000 persons world-wide have some type of defect in mitochondrial DNA. Cardinal clinical features observed in more than 90% of the patients include severe headache that may be associated with stroke-like episodes, seizures and the onset of symptoms before the age of 40 years. Diagnosis is established through genetic test or by with muscle biopsies that reveal the presence of ragged-red fibers. Prognosis is poor, with death at an early age. In this article, we present the clinical case of a 31-year old women diagnosed of MELAS syndrome who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of our hospital with arreflexic coma.

18203188	Progressive cerebral vascular degeneration with mitochondrial encephalopathy. MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a maternally inherited disorder characterized by recurrent cerebral infarctions that do not conform to discreet vascular territories. Here we report on a patient who presented at 7 years of age with loss of consciousness and severe metabolic acidosis following vomiting and dehydration. She developed progressive sensorineural hearing loss, myopathy, ptosis, short stature, and mild developmental delays after normal early development. Biochemical testing identified metabolites characteristic of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency (hexanoylglycine and suberylglycine), but also severe lactic acidemia (10-25 mM) and, in urine, excess of lactic acid, intermediates of the citric cycle, and marked ketonuria, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. She progressed rapidly to develop temporary cortical blindness. Brain imaging indicated generalized atrophy, more marked on the left side, in addition to white matter alterations consistent with a mitochondrial disorder. Magnetic resonance angiography indicated occlusion of the left cerebral artery with development of collateral circulation (Moyamoya syndrome). This process worsened over time to involve the other side of the brain. A muscle biopsy indicated the presence of numerous ragged red fibers. Molecular testing confirmed compound heterozygosity for the common mutation in the MCAD gene (985A>G) and a second pathogenic mutation (233T>C). MtDNA testing indicated that the muscle was almost homoplasmic for the 3243A>T mutation in tRNALeu, with a lower mutant load (about 50% heteroplasmy) in blood and skin fibroblasts. These results indicate that mitochondrial disorders may be associated with severe vascular disease resulting in Moyamoya syndrome. The contribution of the concomitant MCAD deficiency to the development of the phenotype in this case is unclear.
21228936	Diffusion and perfusion characteristics of MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode) in thirteen patients. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the diffusion and perfusion characteristics of acute MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episode) lesions in a large series to investigate the controversial changes of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) that were reported in prior studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 44 newly appearing lesions during 28 stroke-like episodes in 13 patients with MELAS. We performed a visual assessment of the MR images including the ADC and perfusion maps, comparison of the ADC between the normal and abnormal areas, comparison of % ADC between the 44 MELAS lesions and the 30 acute ischemic infarcts. In addition, the patterns of evolution on follow-up MR images were analyzed. RESULTS: Decreased, increased, and normal ADCs were noted in 16 (36%), 16 (36%), and 12 (27%) lesions, respectively. The mean % ADC was 102 +- 40.9% in the MELAS and 64 +- 17.8% in the acute vascular infarcts (p < 0.001), while perfusion imaging demonstrated hyper-perfusion in six acute MELAS lesions. On follow-up images, resolution, progression, and tissue loss were noted in 10, 4, and 17 lesions, respectively. CONCLUSION: The cytotoxic edema gradually evolves following an acute stroke-like episode in patients with MELAS, and this may overlap with hyper-perfusion and vasogenic edema. The edematous swelling may be reversible or it may evolve to encephalomalacia, suggesting irreversible damage.
16009776	Deep white matter pathologic features in watershed regions: a novel pattern of central nervous system involvement in MELAS. BACKGROUND: Myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome typically manifests in adults younger than 40 years with encephalopathy, stroke-like episodes, and lactic acidosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities typically involve the cortical gray and the adjacent subcortical white matter. OBJECTIVE: To describe a 58-year-old woman diagnosed with MELAS who was initially seen with acute myopathy, cardiac ischemia, psychosis, and MRI changes in a watershed distribution. RESULTS: Initial MRI of the brain showed the characteristic parieto-occipital gray matter lesions involving the adjacent white matter. Follow-up MRI revealed striking deep white matter involvement in a watershed distribution. A cerebral angiogram and thorough hypercoagulable workup results were normal. Electromyography showed acute denervation and myopathy. A muscle biopsy specimen revealed ragged red and cytochrome-c oxidase-negative fibers. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed an A3243G mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes should be considered in older patients with myopathy, cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy, and unaccountable MRI findings. Watershed pathologic features are a rare pattern of cerebral involvement in MELAS.
16004847	Migraine and white matter hyperintensities. Patients with migraine are at increased risk for white matter hyperintensities detected on magnetic resonance imaging. The presence of nonspecific white matter hyperintensities may cause uncertainty for physicians and anxiety for patients. The pathophysiology and long-term consequences of these lesions are unknown. Occasionally, white matter lesions in a migraineur may indicate an underlying disease such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), or central nervous system vasculitis. The ability to distinguish between nonspecific and disease-specific patterns of white matter hyperintensities in migraine sufferers is important for the practicing clinician.
21059492	Regression of stroke-like lesions in MELAS-syndrome after seizure control. There are some indications that seizure activity promotes the development of stroke-like episodes, or vice versa, in patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome or other syndromic mitochondrial disorders. A 41-year-old Caucasian female with MELAS syndrome, presenting with short stature, microcytic anaemia, increased blood-sedimentation rate, myopathy, hyper-gammaglobulinaemia, an iron-metabolism defect, migraine-like headaches, and stroke-like episodes, developed complex partial and generalised seizures at age 32 years. Valproic acid was ineffective but after switching to lamotrigine and lorazepam, she became seizure-free for five years and stroke-like episodes did not recur. Cerebral MRI initially showed enhanced gyral thickening and a non-enhanced T2-hyperintensity over the left parieto-temporo-occipital white matter and cortex and enhanced caudate heads. After two years without seizures, the non-enhanced hyperintense parieto-temporo-occipital lesion had disappeared, being attributed to consequent seizure control. The caudate heads, however, remained hyperintense throughout the observational period. This case indicates that adequate seizure control in a patient with MELAS syndrome may prevent the recurrence of stroke-like episodes and may result in the disappearance of stroke-like lesions on MRI.
29369945	Conventional and Diffusional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features of Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-Like Episodes in Chinese Patients: A Study of 40 Cases. PURPOSES: The aims of the study were to analyze the conventional and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and to investigate underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Features of 58 acute and 68 chronic stroke-like lesions as well as global brain abnormalities of 40 Chinese MELAS patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Gyriform DWI hyperintensity with decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and patchy DWI hyperintensity with normal ADC were noted in 56 of 58 and 2 of 58 cortical regions of acute lesions, respectively. High ADC and mix of low and high ADC were observed in 51 of 58 and 5 of 58 affected subcortical white matters, respectively. Lacunar infarcts existed in 23 of 40 patients. Among 17 patients who have been followed, recurrence, progression, and progressive atrophy were noted in 8, 9, and 4 cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the conventional and diffusional MRI features of MELAS, suggesting a model of acute stroke-like lesions in which the cortex manifest with cytotoxic edema and the subcortical area with vasogenic edema.
30216413	MELAS: Monitoring treatment with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. BACKGROUND: To assess the utility of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) as a biomarker of response to L-arginine in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). AIMS: To describe a case of MELAS treated with L-arginine that showed improvement clinically and on serial MRS METHODS: MRS was performed on a 1.5-Tesla scanner to evaluate a MELAS patient before, during, and after intravenous (IV) L-arginine therapy for the treatment of stroke-like episodes. L-arginine was infused at a dose of 500 mg/kg daily for 7 days followed by oral arginine therapy. RESULTS: The patient had clinical improvement after treatment with IV L-arginine. MRS performed before, during, and after treatment with IV L-arginine showed significant improvement in brain lactate and increase in the N-acetylaspartate/Choline (NAA/Cho) ratio compared to pre-treatment baseline. CONCLUSION: Serial MRS imaging showed significant improvement in lactate peaks and NAA/Cho ratios that corresponded with clinical improvement after L-arginine therapy. Given this correlation between radiologic and clinical improvement, MRS may be a useful biomarker assessing response to treatment in MELAS.
12297560	Neuronal hyperexcitability in stroke-like episodes of MELAS syndrome. BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of stroke-like episodes in patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) remains unknown. METHODS: Fourteen stroke-like episodes in six patients with MELAS were studied using clinical, neuroradiologic, and electrophysiologic approaches. In two patients postmortem examination was done. RESULTS: Headache and epileptic seizure were the most common presenting symptoms. In 13 of 14 episodes the cerebral cortex was primarily involved with variable subcortical edema particularly in the temporal, occipital, and parietal cortex. Repeated MRI performed in two episodes revealed progressive spread of the cortical lesion to the surrounding cortex for a few weeks after the onset of symptoms. In 6 of 11 episodes T1-weighted hyperintense cortical signal compatible with cortical laminar necrosis was seen during subacute stage of the episode. Fat-suppression MRI confirmed intracortical gyral hemorrhage in one episode. Petechial gyral microhemorrhages were also pathologically confirmed in the autopsy of another patient. In 9 of 11 episodes focal epileptiform discharges on EEG were noted in the acute brain lesion. In seven of nine episodes focal cortical hyperperfusion was seen in SPECT studies. CONCLUSION: The stroke-like episodes in MELAS may reflect neuronal hyperexcitability, which increases energy demand and creates energy imbalance between energy requirement and adequate availability of adenosine triphosphate due to oxidative phosphorylation defect particularly in the susceptible neuronal population, causing cortical necrosis. The episodic nature of stroke-like episodes is unexplained.
37221696	A different pattern of clinical, muscle pathology and brain MRI findings in MELAS with mt-ND variants. OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) caused by mitochondrial DNA-encoded complex I subunit (mt-ND) variants. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical, myopathological and brain MRI features of patients with MELAS caused by mt-ND variants (MELAS-mtND) were collected and compared with those of MELAS patients carrying the m.3243A > G variant (MELAS-A3243G). RESULT: A total of 18 MELAS-mtND patients (female: 7; median age: 24.5 years) represented 15.9% (n = 113) of all patients with MELAS caused by mtDNA variants in our neuromuscular center from January 2012 to June 2022. In this MELAS-mtND cohort, the two most common variants were m.10191 T > C (4/18, 22.2%) and m.13513 G > A (3/18, 16.7%). The most frequent symptoms were seizures (14/18, 77.8%) and muscle weakness (11/18, 61.1%). Compared with 87 MELAS-A3243G patients, MELAS-mtND patients were significantly more likely to have a variant that was absent in blood cells (40% vs. 1.4%). Furthermore, MELAS-mtND patients had a significantly lower MDC score (7.8 +- 2.7 vs. 9.8 +- 1.9); less hearing loss (27.8% vs. 54.0%), diabetes (11.1% vs. 37.9%), and migraine (33.3% vs. 62.1%); less short stature (males <= 165 cm; females <= 155 cm; 23.1% vs. 60.8%) and higher body mass index (20.4 +- 2.5 vs. 17.8 +- 2.7). MELAS-mtND patients had significantly more normal muscle pathology (31.3% vs. 4.1%) and fewer RRFs/RBFs (62.5% vs. 91.9%), COX-deficient fibers/blue fibers (25.0% vs. 85.1%) and SSVs (50.0% vs. 81.1%). Moreover, brain MRI evaluated at the first stroke-like episode showed significantly more small cortical lesions in MELAS-mtND patients (66.7% vs. 12.2%). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggested that MELAS-mtND patients have distinct clinical, myopathological and brain MRI features compared with MELAS-A3243G patients.
19496942	MELAS with diffuse degeneration of the cerebral white matter: report of an autopsy case. Up to now diffuse white matter demyelination of the cerebrum has been reported in only a few cases of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Here we document an autopsy case with this rare neuropathology. Most MELAS cases are diagnosed antemortem by A3243G transition of mitochondrial DNA. While cerebral damage including necrotic foci in the cerebral cortex are common findings in MELAS, prominent white matter involvement best characterizes this MELAS case. There were numerous necrotic foci, varying in size and chronological stage, in the cerebral white matter. In the areas of the white matter without necrotic foci, there was diffuse fibrillary gliosis with the loss of axons and oligodendrocytes. The gliosis was dominant in the deep white matter, sparing the U-fiber. The cerebral cortex showed diffuse cortical atrophy with few scattered necrotic foci. Distribution of the cerebral lesions does not coincide with the territory of blood supply. The vascular wall presented only slight to mild hyalinosis. We assumed a common pathogenesis to the cortical lesions and the white matter change. The pathogenesis of the present diffuse cerebral lesions may not be just secondary to circulatory disturbance but partly due to metabolic abnormality.
16769961	Endothelial dysfunction in MELAS improved by l-arginine supplementation. The authors evaluated endothelial function in patients with MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke) by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and found a significant decrease vs controls. Two years of supplementation with oral l-arginine, a nitric oxide precursor, significantly improved endothelial function to control levels and was harmonized with the normalized plasma levels of l-arginine in patients. l-Arginine therapy improved endothelial dysfunction and showed promise in treating strokelike episodes in MELAS.
18455161	MELAS mitochondrial DNA mutation A3243G reduces glutamate transport in cybrids cell lines. MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is commonly associated with the A3243G mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation encoding the transfer RNA of leucine (UUR) (tRNA (Leu(UUR))). The pathogenetic mechanisms of this mutation are not completely understood. Neuronal functions are particularly vulnerable to alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, which may affect the function of the neurotransmitter glutamate, leading to excitotoxicity. In order to investigate the possible effects of A3243G upon glutamate homeostasis, we assessed glutamate uptake in osteosarcoma-derived cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) expressing high levels of this mutation. High-affinity Na(+)-dependent glutamate uptake was assessed as radioactive [(3)H]-glutamate influx mediated by specific excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). The maximal rate (V(max)) of Na(+)-dependent glutamate uptake was significantly reduced in all the mutant clones. Although the defect did not relate to either the mutant load or magnitude of oxidative phosphorylation defect, we found an inverse relationship between A3243G mutation load and mitochondrial ATP synthesis, without any evidence of increased cellular or mitochondrial free radical production in these A3243G clones. These data suggest that a defect of glutamate transport in MELAS neurons may be due to decreased energy production and might be involved in mediating the pathogenic effects of the A3243G mtDNA mutation.
23603604	Multimodal imaging-monitored progression of stroke-like episodes in a case of MELAS syndrome. We report imaging findings during, between, and after 2 stroke-like episodes in a 45-year-old woman with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome with an A32243G mitochondrial mutation 6 years before. In November 2010, for a first episode, she showed mixed aphasia with logorrhea, disinhibition, agitation, euphoria, and a large left temporoparietal lesion. Symptomatology progressively regressed under L-arginine treatment. She was readmitted in June 2011 for a second episode with great anxiety, disorientation, impaired face recognition, worsening mixed aphasia, and a new right temporal lesion. After additional L-carnitine treatment, she remained without relapse for 14 months. 
12806294	A review of cochlear implantation in mitochondrial sensorineural hearing loss. OBJECTIVE: Mitochondrial sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) may be nonsyndromic (occurring in isolation), associated with the A1555G mutation in the MTRNR1 gene. Mitochondrial SNHL may also be syndromic, associated with the A3243G point mutation in the MTTL1 gene. In syndromic cases-mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS), maternally inherited diabetes and deafness, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia-the SNHL compounds already existing disabilities. The genetic basis for mitochondrial SNHL and postulated sites of pathologic changes are discussed. DATA SOURCES: Sources used were relevant clinical and basic science publications. STUDY SELECTION: A search of the entire databases of Medline and Web of Science, using various subject headings and free-text terms, was used to identify patients with mitochondrial disease having cochlear implants. DATA EXTRACTION: The data from publications were critically reviewed and tabulated to assess implantation outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: The data were not amenable to formal meta-analysis or valid data summarization, other than descriptive statistics. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increasing awareness of the prevalence of mitochondrial SNHL and its progressive nature. High-risk candidates warrant genetic testing and family screening. Correlating the data for mitochondrial SNHL as a treatable entity is important, and the authors present an overview of these patients successfully rehabilitated by cochlear implantation.
