input_text: 'Nasal Administration of Cationic Nanoemulsions as Nucleic Acids Delivery
  Systems Aiming at Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I Gene Therapy. PURPOSE: This study
  demonstrates the nasal administration (NA) of nanoemulsions complexed with the plasmid
  encoding for IDUA protein (pIDUA) as an attempt to reach the brain aiming at MPS
  I gene therapy. METHODS: Formulations composed of DOPE, DOTAP, MCT (NE), and DSPE-PEG
  (NE-PEG) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization, and assessed in vitro on
  human fibroblasts from MPS I patients and in vivo on MPS I mice for IDUA production
  and gene expression. RESULTS: The physicochemical results showed that the presence
  of DSPE-PEG in the formulations led to smaller and more stable droplets even when
  submitted to dilution in simulated nasal medium (SNM). In vitro assays showed that
  pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes were internalized by cells, and led to a 5% significant increase
  in IDUA activity, besides promoting a two-fold increase in IDUA expression. The
  NA of pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes to MPS I mice demonstrated the ability to reach the
  brain, promoting increased IDUA activity and expression in this tissue, as well
  as in kidney and spleen tissues after treatment. An increase in serum IL-6 was observed
  after treatment, although with no signs of tissue inflammatory infiltrate according
  to histopathology and CD68 assessments. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated
  that pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes could efficiently increase IDUA activity in vitro and
  in vivo after NA, and represent a potential treatment for the neurological impairment
  present in MPS I patients.'
