input_text: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in inborn errors of metabolism-a
  retrospective analysis on behalf of the pediatric disease working party from the
  Brazilian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. Hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established treatment for selected patients
  with inborn errors of metabolism. In this first report from the PDWP-SBTMO, we included
  105 patients transplanted between 1988 and 2021 across six Brazilian HSCT centers.
  The most prevalent diseases were X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (n = 61) and mucopolysaccharidosis
  (type I n = 20; type II n = 10), with a median age at HSCT of 8.7 years and 2.1
  years, respectively. Most conditioning regimens were myeloablative and busulfan-based.
  With a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the 5-years overall survival (OS) was 75%
  (95% CI, 0.65-0.82) with a superior 5-years OS for those transplanted after 2010
  (87% vs. 63%, p = 0.01). Higher risk of death was associated with the use of haploidentical
  donor (HR8.86, p 0.021), unrelated cord blood (HR 8.76, p 0.005), unrelated donor
  (HR 5.91, p 0.02), and for HSCT performed before 2010 (HR 4.16, p = 0.0015). The
  CI of acute GVHD was 24.8%, while chronic GVHD was 9.5%. Major causes of death were
  infections (n = 8), GVHD (n = 6), and neurologic progression (n = 3). Despite improvements
  in transplant outcomes since 2011, challenges persist, emphasizing the need for
  early diagnosis, timely transplantation and expanding HSCT centers with expertise
  in the field.
