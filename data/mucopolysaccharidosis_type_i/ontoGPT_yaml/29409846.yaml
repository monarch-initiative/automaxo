input_text: 'Metabolic Syndrome and Cardiovascular Risk Factors after Hematopoietic
  Cell Transplantation in Severe Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (Hurler Syndrome). Hematopoietic
  cell transplantation is a life-saving procedure, but one associated with increasing
  long-term cardiovascular risk requiring frequent long-term follow-up. This therapy
  has significantly lengthened survival in mucopolysaccharidosis type IH (Hurler syndrome),
  a disease with known coronary artery involvement. Metabolic syndrome-a constellation
  of central obesity, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
  elevated triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose-is associated with increased cardiovascular
  risk, and occurs when any 3 or more of these 5 components is present within a single
  individual. The incidence of metabolic syndrome and its components is poorly defined
  after transplantation for Hurler syndrome. Chart review of all long-term survivors
  of hematopoietic cell transplantation for Hurler syndrome >=9 years of age for factors
  comprising the metabolic syndrome: obesity, high blood pressure, low high-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose. Sixty-three
  patients were evaluated, 20 of whom had components of the metabolic syndrome available
  for review. There was no significant difference in age at transplantation, sex,
  number of transplants, pretransplant radiation, or percent engraftment between those
  with and without these data. Median follow-up after transplantation for the 20 patients
  with data was 14.3 years. Only 1 (5%) patient of this group fulfilled the criteria
  for metabolic syndrome. Fifty-three percent of the patients had 1 or more components
  of metabolic syndrome: the most common was high blood pressure occurring in 40%.
  Metabolic syndrome is uncommon in this cohort of long-term survivors of hematopoietic
  cell transplantation for Hurler syndrome but almost half of the patients had 1 or
  more components of the syndrome, with high blood pressure being the most common.
  Further studies are needed to develop guidelines in this diagnosis as well as other
  nonmalignant diseases of children.'
