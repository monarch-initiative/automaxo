input_text: "Early skeletal outcomes after hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell
  gene therapy for Hurler syndrome. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I Hurler (MPSIH) is
  characterized by severe and progressive skeletal dysplasia that is not fully addressed
  by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Autologous hematopoietic
  stem progenitor cell-gene therapy (HSPC-GT) provides superior metabolic correction
  in patients with MPSIH compared with HSCT; however, its ability to affect skeletal
  manifestations is unknown. Eight patients with MPSIH (mean age at treatment: 1.9
  years) received lentiviral-based HSPC-GT in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT03488394).
  Clinical (growth, measures of kyphosis and genu velgum), functional (motor function,
  joint range of motion), and radiological [acetabular index (AI), migration percentage
  (MP) in hip x-rays and MRIs and spine MRI score] parameters of skeletal dysplasia
  were evaluated at baseline and multiple time points up to 4 years after treatment.
  Specific skeletal measures were retrospectively compared with an external cohort
  of HSCT-treated patients. At a median follow-up of 3.78 years after HSPC-GT, all
  patients treated with HSPC-GT exhibited longitudinal growth within WHO reference
  ranges and a median height gain greater than that observed in patients treated with
  HSCT after 3-year follow-up. Patients receiving HSPC-GT experienced complete and
  earlier normalization of joint mobility compared with patients treated with HSCT.
  Mean AI and MP showed progressive decreases after HSPC-GT, suggesting a reduction
  in acetabular dysplasia. Typical spine alterations measured through a spine MRI
  score stabilized after HSPC-GT. Clinical, functional, and radiological measures
  suggested an early beneficial effect of HSPC-GT on MPSIH-typical skeletal features.
  Longer follow-up is needed to draw definitive conclusions on HSPC-GT's impact on
  MPSIH skeletal dysplasia."
