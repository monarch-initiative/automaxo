input_text: Targeting a Pre-existing Anti-transgene T Cell Response for Effective
  Gene Therapy of MPS-I in the Mouse Model of the Disease. Mucopolysaccharidosis type
  I (MPS-I) is a severe genetic disease caused by a deficiency of the alpha-L-iduronidase
  (IDUA) enzyme. Ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is a promising
  therapeutic approach for MPS-I, as demonstrated by preclinical studies performed
  in naive MPS-I mice. However, after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), several MPS-I
  patients develop anti-IDUA immunity that may jeopardize ex vivo gene therapy efficacy.
  Here we treat MPS-I mice with an artificial immunization protocol to mimic the ERT
  effect in patients, and we demonstrate that IDUA-corrected HSC engraftment is impaired
  in pre-immunized animals by IDUA-specific CD8+ T cells spared by pre-transplant
  irradiation. Conversely, humoral anti-IDUA immunity does not impact on IDUA-corrected
  HSC engraftment. The inclusion of lympho-depleting agents in pre-transplant conditioning
  of pre-immunized hosts allowes rescue of IDUA-corrected HSC engraftment, which is
  proportional to CD8+ T cell eradication. Overall, these data demonstrate the relevance
  of pre-existing anti-transgene T cell immunity on ex vivo HSC gene therapy, and
  they suggest the application of tailored immune-depleting treatments, as well as
  a deeper immunological characterization of patients, to safeguard the therapeutic
  effects of ex vivo HSC gene therapy in immunocompetent hosts.
