input_text: Engineering Memory T Cells as a platform for Long-Term Enzyme Replacement
  Therapy in Lysosomal Storage Disorders. Enzymopathy disorders are the result of
  missing or defective enzymes. Amongst these enzymopathies, mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I, is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the
  gene encoding alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), ultimately causes toxic build-up of glycosaminoglycans
  (GAGs). There is currently no cure and standard treatments provide insufficient
  relief to the skeletal structure and central nervous system (CNS). Human memory
  T cells (Tm) migrate throughout the body's tissues and can persist for years, making
  them an attractive approach for cellular-based, systemic enzyme replacement therapy.
  Here, we tested genetically engineered, IDUA-expressing Tm as a cellular therapy
  in an immunodeficient mouse model of MPS I. Our results demonstrate that a single
  dose of engineered Tm leads to detectable IDUA enzyme levels in the blood for up
  to 22 weeks and reduced urinary GAG excretion. Furthermore, engineered Tm take up
  residence in nearly all tested tissues, producing IDUA and leading to metabolic
  correction of GAG levels in the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, bone marrow,
  and the CNS, though only minimal improved cognition was observed. Our study indicates
  that genetically engineered Tm holds great promise as a platform for cellular-based
  enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I and
  potentially many other enzymopathies and protein deficiencies.
