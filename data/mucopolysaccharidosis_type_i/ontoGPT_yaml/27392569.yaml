input_text: "Musculoskeletal manifestations in mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler
  syndrome) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for young Hurler patients.
  Despite halting of neurocognitive decline and improvement of life expectancy, the
  beneficial effect on the skeletal system is limited. As orthopedic complications
  are one of the most disabling factors following HSCT, this points to the need for
  new treatment strategies. The study summarizes musculoskeletal manifestations in
  19 transplanted Hurler patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively. Patients'
  charts for physical examinations of the joint range of motion (JROM) of shoulders,
  elbows, hips and knees were reviewed. Radiographic evaluations of thorax, spine,
  pelvis and hands were performed. MRI scans of the craniocervical junction were analyzed
  to determine odontoid hypoplasia and the prevalence of craniocervical stenosis.
  RESULTS: Nineteen Hurler patients (10 females, 9 males) with an average age of 8.1
  years (range 2.5-23.8) at the latest follow-up, who underwent allogenic HSCT between
  1991 and 2012, were assessed after an average follow-up period of 6.4 years (range
  0.7-22.5). Seventeen patients achieved long-term engraftment, two developed graft
  failures. The majority of patients showed a steady state or improvements in the
  mobility of knees (31 %/63 %), hips (47 %/40 %) and elbows (56 %/38 %). However,
  shoulder abduction was impaired in 3/4 of patients and showed the highest rate of
  progression (31 %). In patients with graft failure, progressive restrictions in
  JROM were noted. Assessments of the craniocervical junction by MRI showed stable
  or improved diameters in 67 % of patients. Correction or stabilization of odontoid
  hypoplasia was found in 64 %. However thoracolumbar kyphosis, scoliosis, hip dysplasia
  and genua valga were progressive despite HSCT. At the last follow up, 47 % of patients
  were partially wheelchair dependent, 10 % wheelchair bound and 25 % regularly experienced
  pain in the spine, hips and lower extremities due to orthopedic problems. CONCLUSION:
  Joint mobility, odontoid hypoplasia and craniocervical stenosis might stabilize
  or even improve in Hurler patients following HSCT. However, despite the beneficial
  effects on some musculoskeletal manifestations, skeletal complications are frequently
  observed and the overall burden of orthopedic disease is significant. Frequent multi-disciplinary
  follow-up in a specialized center are essential. Novel therapeutic approaches (e.g.
  anti-inflammatory drugs) are needed to improve musculoskeletal outcomes."
