input_text: "Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase (Aldurazyme( )) for treating
  mucopolysaccharidosis type I. BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I can be classified
  as three clinical sub-types; Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome and Scheie
  syndrome, with the scale of severity being such that Hurler syndrome is the most
  severe and Scheie syndrome the least severe. It is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder
  caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Deficiency of this enzyme results
  in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the tissues. The clinical manifestations
  are facial dysmorphism, hepatosplenomegaly, upper airway obstruction, skeletal deformity
  and cardiomyopathy. If Hurler syndrome is left untreated, death ensues by adolescence.
  There are more attenuated variants termed Hurler-Scheie or Scheie syndrome, with
  those affected potentially not presenting until adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy
  has been used for a number of years in the treatment of Hurler syndrome, although
  the current gold standard would be a haemopoietic stem cell transplant in those
  diagnosed by 2.5 years of age. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane
  review published in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
  treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I with laronidase enzyme replacement therapy
  as compared to placebo. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis
  and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, MEDLINE
  via OVID and Embase.Date of most recent search: 05 October 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA:
  Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies of laronidase enzyme replacement
  therapy compared to placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently
  screened the identified studies. The authors then appraised and extracted data.
  MAIN RESULTS: One study of 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. This double-blind,
  placebo-controlled, randomised, multinational study looked at laronidase at a dose
  of 0.58 mg/kg/week versus placebo in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I.
  All primary outcomes listed in this review were studied in this study. The laronidase
  group achieved statistically significant improvements in per cent predicted forced
  vital capacity compared to placebo, MD 5.60 (95% confidence intervals 1.24 to 9.96)
  and in the six-minute-walk test (mean improvement of 38.1 metres in the laronidase
  group; P = 0.039, when using a prospectively planned analysis of covariance). The
  levels of urinary glycoaminoglycans were also significantly reduced. In addition,
  there were improvements in hepatomegaly, sleep apnoea and hypopnoea. Laronidase
  antibodies were detected in nearly all patients in the treatment group with no apparent
  clinical effect and titres were reducing by the end of the study. Infusion-related
  adverse reactions occurred in both groups but all were mild and none necessitated
  medical intervention or infusion cessation. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence
  demonstrates that laronidase is effective when compared to placebo in the treatment
  of mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The included study was comprehensive and of good
  quality, although there were few participants. The study included all of the key
  outcome measures we wished to look at. It demonstrated that laronidase is efficacious
  in relation to reducing biochemical parameters (reduced urine glycosaminoglycan
  excretion) and improved functional capacity as assessed by forced vital capacity
  and the six-minute-walk test. In addition glycosaminoglycan storage was reduced
  as ascertained by a reduction in liver volume. Laronidase appeared to be safe and,
  while antibodies were generated, these titres were reducing by the end of the study.
  More studies are required to determine long-term effectiveness and safety and to
  assess the impact upon quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase
  can be used pre- and peri-haemopoietic stem cell transplant, which is now the gold
  standard treatment in those patients diagnosed under 2.5 years of age."
