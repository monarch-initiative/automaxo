input_text: 'The effect of haemopoietic stem cell transplantation on the ocular phenotype
  in mucopolysaccharidosis type I (Hurler). PURPOSE: To determine whether the ocular
  phenotype in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPSI) Hurler is affected
  by the efficacy of previous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). DESIGN:
  A retrospective cohort study of patients with MPSI who had undergone treatment with
  HSCT. METHODS: Ocular phenotype was documented for each patient and compared to
  levels of biomarkers representing efficacy of previous transplantation. MAIN OUTCOME
  MEASURES: Assessment of visual acuity (VA), severity of corneal clouding and the
  presence of optic neuropathy or retinopathy. Biomarker assessment included dermatan
  sulphate/chondroitin sulphate (DS/CS) ratio and iduronidase enzyme level. RESULTS:
  Severe corneal clouding was significantly greater in patients with lower iduronidase
  levels (p = 0.023) and raised DS/CS ratio (R2  = 0.28 p = 0.043). Better VA was
  related to a higher iduronidase levels (R2  = 0.15, p = 0.004) and lower DS/CS ratio
  (R2  = 0.38, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Improved ocular phenotypes in MPSI are associated
  with markers signifying efficacy of prior transplant. Early and effective HSCT may
  result in a better visual prognosis and reduction in ocular complications for patients
  with MPSI.'
