input_text: 'CASE SERIES OF PATIENTS UNDER BIWEEKLY TREATMENT WITH LARONIDASE: A REPORT
  OF A SINGLE CENTER EXPERIENCE. OBJECTIVE: To report the stabilization of urinary
  glycosaminoglicans (GAG) excretion and clinical improvements in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I (MPS I) under an alternative dose regimen of laronidase of 1.2 mg/kg every
  other week. METHODS: We participated in a dose-optimization trial for laronidase
  in MPS-I patients using four alternative regimens: 0.58 mg/kg every week, 1.2 mg/kg
  every two weeks, 1.2 mg/kg every week and 1.8 mg/kg every other week (EOW). After
  the trial ended, the patients resumed the recommended dose and regimen of 0.58 mg/kg
  every week. Under this regimen, some patients presented difficulties in venous access
  and were unable to commute weekly to the treatment center. Therefore, we used an
  alternative regimen that consisted of 1.2 mg/kg EOW in eight patients. A retrospective
  study of medical records of MPS-I patients who underwent both enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) regimens, of 0.58 mg/kg every week and 1.2 mg/kg EOW, was done. RESULTS:
  Patients remained clinically stable under the alternative regimen, did not present
  elevation of urinary GAG nor any adverse event.Conclusions: The switch of dose regimen
  to 1.2 mg/kg EOW of laronidase was safe, and did not cause any clinical worsening
  in patients who had been previously under standard dose ERT.'
