input_text: Carbon nanotubes as nanovectors for intracellular delivery of laronidase
  in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The immobilization of proteins on carbon nanotubes
  (CNTs) has been widely reported mainly for the preparation of sensors while the
  conjugation of enzymes for therapeutic purposes has scarcely been considered. Herein
  we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of intracellular delivery
  of a therapeutic enzyme by means of CNTs, retaining its activity. Mucopolysaccharidosis
  I is a rare genetic disease characterized by the deficiency or absence of the activity
  of the alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme. We evaluated the capacity of the recombinant
  form of the human IDUA enzyme, laronidase (Aldurazyme ), conjugated with CNTs to
  be internalized by fibroblasts from subjects affected with Mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I and the capacity of the enzyme to retain its activity after internalization.
  The enzyme was successfully delivered into the lysosomal space and the enzymatic
  activity of the conjugate was preserved after internalization up to 48 hours. This
  paves the way towards the use of such a kind of construct for therapeutic applications.
