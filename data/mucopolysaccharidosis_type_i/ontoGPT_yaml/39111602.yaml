input_text: Synergistic effects of resveratrol and enzyme replacement therapy in the
  Mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare genetic
  disorder caused by mutations in the IDUA gene, leading to alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme
  deficiency and resulting in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG; heparan
  and dermatan sulfate) in lysosomes. The consequent GAG accumulation within cells
  leads to organ dysfunction and a range of debilitating symptoms. Enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) is the prevailing treatment, but its limitations (including high cost,
  time requirements, inefficiency in treatment of central nervous system (CNS), and
  immunogenicity) necessitate exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. This
  research propose a novel approach leveraging the synergistic effects of ERT and
  resveratrol-induced autophagy. Resveratrol, with its immunomodulatory and GAG degradation-stimulating
  properties, holds a promise in mitigating immune responses triggered by ERT. Moreover,
  its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier presents a potential solution for
  addressing CNS manifestations. This study employed cells from MPS I patients to
  investigate the combined effects of resveratrol and the enzyme. Evaluation of the
  therapeutic impact involved assessing GAG accumulation enzyme testing, and examining
  lysosome functionality and the autophagy process through fluorescence microscopy
  and Western blotting. The combined therapy stimulated the lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate
  receptor (M6PR) and lysosome biogenesis through the transcription factor EB (TFEB).
  Additionally, initial block of autophagy in autophagosome formation was relieved
  after the combined therapy and resveratrol alone. Together with increased enzyme
  activity through stimulation of the receptor, this synergistic therapy can be considered
  a new potential treatment for MPS I patients, improving their overall quality of
  life.
