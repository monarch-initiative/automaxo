input_text: 'IgE-Mediated Hypersensitivity and Desensitisation with Recombinant Enzymes
  in Pompe Disease and Type I and Type VI Mucopolysaccharidosis. Enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) is important for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders. Hypersensitivity
  reactions with ERT have been reported, and in these cases, desensitisation with
  the enzyme is necessary. Here we report the cases of 3 patients with lysosomal storage
  disorders, including Pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I and VI, who
  had IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions and positive skin tests. Successful
  desensitisation protocols with the culprit enzyme solution were used for these patients.
  All 3 patients were able to safely receive ERT with the desensitisation protocol. '
