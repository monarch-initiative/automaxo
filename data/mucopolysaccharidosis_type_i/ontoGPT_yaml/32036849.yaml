input_text: "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I in Children, a Forgotten Diagnosis Responsible
  for Undiagnosed Musculoskeletal Complaints: Report of Two Cases. Mucopolysaccharidoses
  (MPS) are a subgroup of lysosomal storage disorders. The underlying mechanism of
  MPS disorders are deficiency in specific enzymes which leads to accumulation of
  partially degraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in various tissues. A wide variety
  of manifestations are reported but musculoskeletal complaints are common among them.
  In milder forms of MPS, musculoskeletal complaints are presenting symptoms. Delays
  in diagnosis due to unspecific and mild symptoms is common. Misdiagnosis of MPS
  as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other inflammatory arthritis disorders is frequent.
  Early diagnosis and treatment prevents irreversible cellular damages and is a key
  factor in efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy. In this study we described two
  MPS patients with musculoskeletal complaints who were not diagnosed for a period
  of time. Although musculoskeletal manifestation are common in a variety of clinical
  conditions, their presence at low ages or co-occurrence of other manifestations
  (such as cardiac, respiratory, neurologic, etc.) in multiple systems should prompt
  evaluation of patients for MPS and other metabolic disorders. The rheumatologists'
  awareness on MPS should be promoted to achieve timely diagnosis and subsequent early
  treatment."
