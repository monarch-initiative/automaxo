input_text: 'Enzyme replacement therapy prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I: 10 year combined experience of 2 centres. Haematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for the severe form of Mucopolysaccharidosis
  Type I, or Hurler syndrome. In many centres standard practice is to deliver enzyme
  replacement therapy alongside haematopoietic stem cell transplantation to improve
  the condition of the patient prior to transplant. We report the combined 10 year
  experience of this approach in two paediatric metabolic and transplant centres.
  Of 81 patients who underwent a first transplant procedure for Hurler, 88% (71/81)
  survived and 81% (66/81) were alive and engrafted at a median follow-up of 46 months
  (range 3-124 months). The incidence of grade II-IV acute and any chronic graft versus
  host disease was 17% and 11% respectively. Urinary glycosaminoglycans were significantly
  reduced after a period of enzyme replacement therapy, and further reductions were
  seen at 13-24 months and 25+months after transplantation. In several individuals
  with decreased cardiac contractility, an improvement of their condition during enzyme
  replacement therapy enabled them to undergo transplantation, with one individual
  receiving full intensity conditioning.'
