input_text: 'Treatment of thoracolumbar kyphosis in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis
  type I: results of an international consensus procedure. BACKGROUND: In all patients
  with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), skeletal disease (dysostosis multiplex)
  is a prominent, debilitating, condition related complication that may impact strongly
  on activities of daily living. Unfortunately, it is not alleviated by treatment
  with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).
  Although early kyphosis is one of the key features of dysostosis multiplex, there
  is no international consensus on the optimal management. Therefore, an international
  consensus procedure was organized with the aim to develop the first clinical practice
  guideline for the management of thoracolumbar kyphosis in MPS I patients. METHODS:
  A literature review was conducted to identify all available information about kyphosis
  and related surgery in MPS I patients. Subsequently, a modified Delphi procedure
  was used to develop consensus statements. The expert panel included 10 spinal orthopedic
  surgeons, 6 pediatricians and 3 physiotherapists, all experienced in MPS I. The
  procedure consisted of 2 written rounds, a face-to-face meeting and a final written
  round. The first 2 rounds contained case histories, general questions and draft
  statements. During the face-to-face meeting consensus statements were developed.
  In the final round, the panel had the opportunity to anonymously express their opinion
  about the proposed statements. RESULTS: Eighteen case series and case reports were
  retrieved from literature reporting on different surgical approaches and timing
  of thoracolumbar kyphosis surgery in MPS I. During the face-to-face meeting 16 statements
  were discussed and revised. Consensus was reached on all statements. CONCLUSION:
  This international consensus procedure resulted in the first clinical practice guideline
  for the management of thoracolumbar kyphosis in MPS I patients, focusing on the
  goals and timing of surgery, as well as the optimal surgical approach, the utility
  of bracing and required additional assessments (e.g. radiographs). Most importantly,
  it was concluded that the decision for surgery depends not only on the kyphotic
  angle, but also on additional factors such as the progression of the deformity and
  its flexibility, the presence of symptoms, growth potential and comorbidities. The
  eventual goal of treatment is the maintenance or improvement of quality of life.
  Further international collaborative research related to long-term outcome of kyphosis
  surgery in MPS I is essential as prognostic information is lacking.'
