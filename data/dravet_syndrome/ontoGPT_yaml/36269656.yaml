input_text: 'Hyperthermia-Induced Seizures Enhance Brain Concentrations of the Endocannabinoid-Related
  Linoleoyl Glycerols in a Scn1a+/- Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome. Introduction:
  The endocannabinoid system contributes to the homeostatic response to seizure activity
  in epilepsy, a disease of brain hyperexcitability. Indeed, studies using conventional
  epilepsy models have shown that seizures increase endocannabinoids in the brain.
  However, it is unknown whether endocannabinoids and structurally related fatty acid
  amides and monoacylglycerols are similarly released in response to acute seizures
  in animal models of drug-resistant epilepsy. Therefore, in this study, we investigated
  whether a hyperthermia-induced seizure increased concentrations of endocannabinoids
  and related signaling lipids in the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome. Materials
  and Methods: We compared hippocampal concentrations of the major endocannabinoids
  and related monoglycerols and N-acylethanolamines in wild-type mice, naive Scn1a+/-
  mice, and Scn1a+/- mice primed with a single, hyperthermia-induced, generalized
  tonic-clonic seizure. Samples were collected 5 and 60 min following the seizure
  and then analyzed with LC-MS/MS. Results: We found that a hyperthermia-induced seizure
  in Scn1a+/- mice did not affect hippocampal concentrations of the major endocannabinoids,
  2-AG and anandamide, or the N-acylethanolamines studied, although the sampling of
  tissue 5 min postseizure may have been too late to capture any effect on these lipids.
  Heterozygous deletion of Scn1a alone did not affect these lipid signaling molecules.
  Notably, however, we found that a hyperthermia-induced seizure significantly increased
  hippocampal concentrations of the monoacylglycerols, 2-linoleoyl glycerol (2-LG)
  and 1-linoleoyl glycerol (1-LG), in Scn1a+/- mice. Conclusions: Our results show
  the unprecedented elevation of the lesser-studied endocannabinoid-related monoacylglycerols,
  2-LG and 1-LG, following a hyperthermia-induced seizure in a mouse model of Dravet
  syndrome. Future research is needed to comprehensively explore the function of these
  lipid signaling molecules during seizure activity and whether their actions can
  be exploited to develop new therapeutics.'
