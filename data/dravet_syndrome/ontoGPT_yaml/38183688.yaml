input_text: 'Caregiver-reported outcomes with real-world use of cannabidiol in Lennox-Gastaut
  syndrome and Dravet syndrome from the BECOME survey. PURPOSE: Plant-derived highly
  purified cannabidiol (CBD) reduced the frequency of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut
  syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) and improved the overall condition of patients
  in placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials. Anecdotal reports also suggest a
  positive effect on nonseizure outcomes. In this study, we aimed to identify, through
  a caregiver survey which nonseizure outcomes were most likely to change in these
  patients. METHODS: The BEhavior, COgnition, and More with Epidiolex  (BECOME) was
  a 20-minute, cross-sectional, online survey that was developed with extensive input
  from caregivers, healthcare professionals, and epilepsy researchers, and was based
  on questions from validated measures and previously published caregiver reports.
  US-based caregivers (from Jazz Pharmaceuticals patient/caregiver database) of people
  with LGS or DS who were treated with CBD (Epidiolex , 100 mg/mL oral solution) for
  >=3 months were asked to compare the past month to the period before CBD initiation
  and rate their impression of changes using symmetrical Likert scales. RESULTS: A
  total of 498 caregivers (97% parents) of patients with LGS (80%) or DS (20%) completed
  the survey. Mean (range) age of patients was 16 (1-73) years, and 52% were male.
  Patients were taking a median CBD dose of 14 mg/kg/d and median 4 concomitant antiseizure
  medications. A large proportion of respondents reported improvements in >=1 survey
  question for all nonseizure-related domains: alertness, cognition, and executive
  function (85%); emotional functioning (82%); language and communication (79% in
  nonverbal patients and 74% in verbal); activities of daily living (51%); sleep (51%);
  and physical functioning (46%). Respondents reported improvements in seizure-related
  domains, including overall seizure frequency (85%), overall seizure severity (76%),
  seizure-free days per week for >=1 seizure type (67%), and seizure freedom during
  the past month (16%). The majority of respondents who reported reduction in seizure
  frequency also reported improvements in nonseizure outcomes domains (51-80%). However,
  improvements in nonseizure outcomes (18-56%) were also reported in patients who
  either had no change or worsening of seizure frequency. CONCLUSIONS: This survey
  characterized and quantified caregiver impression of changes in the seizure and
  nonseizure outcomes in patients taking add-on CBD treatment. Overall, 93% of caregivers
  reported planning to continue CBD treatment, primarily because of reduced seizure
  burden but also because of improvements in nonseizure-related outcomes. Despite
  the limitations that are associated with a retrospective survey-based study design,
  these results support further evaluation of the effect of CBD treatment on nonseizure
  outcomes among patients with LGS or DS.'
