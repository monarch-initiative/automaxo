input_text: 'New therapeutic approach in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
  with cannabidiol. INTRODUCTION: Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
  (LGS) are two serious epileptic syndromes with paediatric onset which are refractory
  to therapy and are associated with an important increase in mortality rates and
  comorbidities compared to the general population. These pathologies have a strong
  impact on the lives of patients and their families, because they undergo multiple
  pharmacological therapies (many of them without specific indication), with frequent
  changes due to poor efficacy and associated adverse effects. The specialists who
  care for these patients highlight unmet needs and the lack of specific, safe and
  effective treatments for better management of the syndrome. DEVELOPMENT: A group
  of four neurologists specializing in epilepsy has met to review the scientific literature
  and evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral solution cannabidiol in the treatment
  of these syndromes, both in randomized clinical trials (CT) and in some observational
  studies. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabidiol is positioned as an innovative therapy that allows
  better control of epileptic seizures and comorbidities of DS and LGS, furthermore
  its efficacy and safety have been evaluated in more than 700 patients. In CTs, cannabidiol
  significantly reduced the percentage of convulsive seizures and drop seizures compared
  to placebo in patients with DS and LGS respectively, which could improve their quality
  of life and that of their family members. The most frequent adverse effects reported
  were somnolence and decreased appetite. Elevated liver aminotransferase levels were
  also reported, especially in patients given concomitant sodium valproate. This therapy
  may allow better control of the epileptic seizures associated with these syndromes.'
