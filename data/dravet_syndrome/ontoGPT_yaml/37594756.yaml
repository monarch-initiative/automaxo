input_text: Metabolic aspects of genetic ion channel epilepsies. Nowadays, particularly
  in countries with high incomes, individual mutations in people affected by genetic
  epilepsies are identified, and genetic therapies are being developed. In addition,
  drugs are being screened to directly target specific mutations, and personalised
  medicine is possible. However, people with epilepsy do not yet benefit from these
  advances, and many types of epilepsies are medication-resistant, including Dravet
  syndrome. Thus, in the meantime, alternative and effective treatment options are
  needed. There is increasing evidence that metabolic deficits contribute to epileptic
  seizures and that such metabolic impairments may be amenable to treatment, with
  metabolic treatment options like the ketogenic diet being employed with some success.
  However, the brain metabolic alterations that occur in ion channel epilepsies are
  not well-understood, nor how these may differ from epilepsies that are of acquired
  and unknown origins. Here, we provide an overview of studies investigating metabolic
  alterations in epilepsies caused by mutations in the SCN1A and KCNA1 genes, which
  are currently the most studied ion channel epilepsies in animal models. The metabolic
  changes found in these models are likely to contribute to seizures. A metabolic
  basis of these ion channel epilepsies is supported by human and/or animal studies
  that show beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet, which may be mediated by the
  provision of auxiliary brain fuel in the form of ketone bodies. Other potentially
  more preferred dietary therapies including medium-chain triglycerides and triheptanoin
  have also been tested in a limited number of studies, but their efficacies remain
  to be clearly established. The extent to which brain metabolism is affected in people
  with Dravet syndrome, KCNA1 epilepsy and the models thereof still requires clarification.
  This requires more experiments that yield functional insight into metabolism.
