input_text: 'A Phase II Randomized Trial to Explore the Potential for Pharmacokinetic
  Drug-Drug Interactions with Stiripentol or Valproate when Combined with Cannabidiol
  in Patients with Epilepsy. BACKGROUND: In recent randomized, placebo-controlled,
  phase III trials, highly purified cannabidiol demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable
  safety profile in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. It is
  anticipated that antiepileptic drugs such as stiripentol and valproate will be administered
  concomitantly with cannabidiol. OBJECTIVES: This trial evaluated the effect of cannabidiol
  on steady-state pharmacokinetics of stiripentol or valproate in patients with epilepsy,
  and the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol. METHODS: This phase II, two-arm,
  parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruited male
  and female patients with epilepsy aged 16-55 years. Patients receiving a stable
  dose of stiripentol or valproate were randomized 4:1 to receive concomitant double-blind
  cannabidiol or placebo. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified cannabidiol
  medicine (Epidiolex  in the USA; Epidyolex  in the EU; 100 mg/mL oral solution)
  at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day from day 12 to 26, following a 10-day dose-escalation
  period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were collected on days 1 and
  26 before stiripentol/valproate dosing and up to 12 h postdose. Treatment-emergent
  adverse events (AEs) were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 35 patients were recruited
  to the stiripentol arm (n = 14) or the valproate arm (n = 21). Both the safety and
  the pharmacokinetic populations of the stiripentol arm comprised 14 patients (2
  placebo; 12 cannabidiol). The safety population of the valproate arm comprised 20
  patients (4 placebo; 16 cannabidiol; one withdrew before receiving treatment); the
  pharmacokinetic population comprised 15 patients (3 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). Concomitant
  cannabidiol led to a small increase in stiripentol exposure (17% increase in maximum
  observed plasma concentration [Cmax]; 30% increase in area under the concentration-time
  curve over the dosing interval [AUCtau]). Concomitant cannabidiol also had little
  effect on valproate exposure (13% decrease in Cmax; 17% decrease in AUCtau) or its
  metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA) (23% decrease in Cmax; 30% decrease
  in AUCtau). All changes in exposure are expressed as the dose-normalized geometric
  mean (CV%) day 26 to day 1 ratio. The most common AE was diarrhea; most AEs were
  mild. Two patients discontinued cannabidiol because of serious AEs (rash [n = 1]
  in the stiripentol arm; hypertransaminasemia [n = 1] in the valproate arm). A separate
  in vitro study investigated the bidirectional effect of cannabidiol, or its metabolite
  7-carboxy-cannabidiol, on valproate plasma protein binding; no change in plasma
  protein binding was observed for either compound. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical relevance
  of the increase in stiripentol exposure is unknown; patients receiving cannabidiol
  and stiripentol concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions as individual
  patient responses may vary. Coadministration of cannabidiol did not affect the pharmacokinetics
  of valproate or its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in adult patients with epilepsy. Safety
  results were consistent with the known safety profile of cannabidiol at a dose of
  20 mg/kg/day. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02607891.'
