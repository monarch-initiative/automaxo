input_text: 'Status epilepticus following vaccination in children aged <=24 months:
  A five-year retrospective observational study. BACKGROUND: Status epilepticus is
  associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While vaccine-proximate status
  epilepticus (VP-SE) has rarely been associated with cases of Dravet syndrome, it
  is not known whether VP-SE differs clinically from non-vaccine proximate status
  epilepticus (NVP-SE). METHODS: Medical records of children aged <=24 months, presenting
  to one of five Australian tertiary pediatric hospitals with their first episode
  of status epilepticus from 2013 to 2017 were identified using ICD-coded discharge
  diagnoses. Vaccination history was obtained from the Australian Immunisation Register.
  Hospitalization details, subsequent epilepsy diagnosis, and vaccination uptake were
  compared between VP-SE and NVP-SE cases. RESULTS: Of 245 first status epilepticus
  hospitalization with immunization records, 35 (14%) were VP-SE and 21 (60%) followed
  measles-containing vaccines. Vaccine-proximate status epilepticus cases had a median
  age of 12.5 months [IQR 7.1-14.73], 23 (66%) were in males, 15 (43%) were febrile
  status epilepticus and 17 (49%) had an infection confirmed. There were no significant
  differences in hospitalization duration (P = 0.50) or intensive care unit admission
  (P = 0.42) between children with VP-SE compared to children with NVP-SE. Children
  with no history of seizures at their first VP-SE had longer hospitalizations, were
  more likely to require intensive care unit admission, but were less likely to have
  a subsequent diagnosis of epilepsy than children with previous seizures at their
  first VP-SE. CONCLUSION: First VP-SE was predominantly associated with a measles-containing
  vaccine at 12-months of age. Seizure severity was no different between first VP-SE
  and first NVP-SE. In children with VP-SE, subsequent seizure admissions and epilepsy
  diagnosis were associated with having seizure prior to their first SE.'
