input_text: "A single-center, retrospective analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations
  in children with Dravet syndrome. PURPOSE: Dravet syndrome is an early-onset epileptic
  encephalopathy caused most often by loss-of-function SCN1A variants. Following recognition
  of its genetic basis and unique clinical features, Dravet syndrome has become one
  of the most well-studied genetic epilepsies. We sought to evaluate the genetic diversity
  and correlative seizure phenotype, comorbidities, and response to antiepileptic
  therapies of patients with clinically-diagnosed Dravet syndrome seen in a tertiary
  care center. The goal of this study was to examine genotype-phenotype correlations
  and to ascertain if specific antiepileptic therapies may be more effective on the
  basis of genetic test result alone. METHOD: Retrospective chart review of demographics,
  comorbidities, seizure types, and responses to antiepileptic therapies of all patients
  (n = 137) with a clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome seen at Lurie Children's
  Hospital of Chicago from 2008 to 2016. RESULTS: Of the 96% of Dravet syndrome patients
  with pathogenic SCN1A variants subdivided by missense or truncating variant, there
  was no difference in clinical presentation. Response to antiepileptic therapies
  did not differ by genotype with regard to medication class. CONCLUSIONS: This is
  the largest cohort of Dravet patients from within the US to report medication response
  with respect to genotype. Missense variants in SCN1A were most common in the voltage-sensor
  and pore domains. All patients were most likely to respond to the recommended medication
  triad compared to other antiepileptic therapies."
