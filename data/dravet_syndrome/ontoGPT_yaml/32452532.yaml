input_text: 'Cannabidiol efficacy and clobazam status: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential impact of concomitant clobazam (CLB) use on
  the efficacy of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment in patients with Dravet syndrome and
  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome using meta-analytical techniques. METHODS: We searched for
  randomized, placebo-controlled, single- or double-blinded trials. The proportion
  of patients who achieved >=50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency during
  the treatment period was assessed according to CLB status. Risk ratios (RRs) with
  95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: Four trials were included
  and enrolled 714 participants, 429 for the add-on CBD group and 285 for the add-on
  placebo group. Among CBD-treated patients, 240 (55.9%) were taking concomitant CLB
  (CLB-On) and 189 (44.1%) were not taking concomitant CLB (CLB-Off); in placebo-treated
  patients, 158 (55.4%) were CLB-On and 127 (44.6%) CLB-Off. The percentages of patients
  who had at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency during the treatment period
  were 29.1% in the CBD arm and 15.7% in the placebo group among CLB-Off patients
  (RR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.12-2.90, P = .015). Among CBL-On patients, the >=50% reduction
  in seizure frequency was found in 52.9% and 27.8% in the CBD and placebo groups,
  respectively (RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.40-2.44, P < .001). SIGNIFICANCE: CBD was associated
  with a higher rate of seizure response in comparison to placebo when added to the
  existing antiepileptic regimen both in patients taking and in those not taking concomitant
  CLB. The lack of randomization for CLB status and the limited sample size need to
  be considered in the interpretation of the findings.'
