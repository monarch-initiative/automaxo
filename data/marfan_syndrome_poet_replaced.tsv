26811510		Republished review: Surgical management of diseaseD000094628 in MONDO:0007947 and other diseaseD009358 associated with diseaseD000094628.Elective root replacement in MONDO:0007947 has improved life expectancy in affected 9606. Three forms of surgery are now available: total root replacement (TRR) with a valved conduit, valve sparing root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve. TRR can be performed irrespective of aortic dimensions and a mechanical replacement valve is a secure and near certain means of correcting MONDO:0005648 but has HP:0001907 and diseaseD006470 risks. VSRR offers freedom from anticoagulation and attendant risks of diseaseD006470 but reoperation for MONDO:0005648 runs at 1.3% per annum. A prospective multi-institutional study has found this to be an underestimate of the true rate of valve-related adverse events. PEARS conserves the aortic root anatomy and optimises the chance of maintaining valve function but average follow-up is under 5 years and so the long-term results are yet to be determined. 9606 are on average in their 30s and so the cumulative lifetime need for reoperation, and of any valve-related complications, are consequently substantial. With lowering surgical risk of prophylactic root replacement, the threshold for intervention has reduced progressively over 30 years to 4.5 cm and so an increasing number of 9606 who are not destined to have a dissection are now having root replacement. In evaluation of these three forms of surgery, the number needed to treat to prevent dissection and the balance of net benefit and harm in future 9606 must be considered. 
34326135		Personalised external aortic root support for elective treatment of diseaseD000094628 in 200 9606.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In personalised external aortic root support (PEARS), a custom-made, macroporous mesh is used to stabilise a dilated aortic root and prevent HP:0005294, primarily in 9606 with genetically driven aortopathies. Data are needed on the safety and postoperative incidence of aortic events. METHODS: We present a multicentre cohort study evaluating the first 200 consecutive 9606 (median age 33 years) undergoing surgery with an intention to perform PEARS for aortic root dilatation in 23 centres between 2004 and 2019. Perioperative outcomes were collected prospectively while clinical follow-up was retrieved retrospectively. Median follow-up was 21.2 months. RESULTS: The main indication was MONDO:0007947 (73.5%) and the most frequent concomitant procedure was mitral valve repair (10%). An intervention for MONDO:0004994 or MONDO:0006714 was needed in 11 9606, 1 case resulting in perioperative diseaseD003643. No diseaseD000094630 were observed in 596 documented postoperative 9606 years. Late reoperation was performed in 3 9606 for operator failure to achieve complete mesh coverage. Among 9606 with at least mild MONDO:0005648 (MONDO:0005648) preoperatively, 68% had no or trivial MONDO:0005648 at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the clinical history of the first 200 9606 to undergo PEARS. To date, HP:0005294 has not been observed in the restrained part of the aorta, yet long-term follow-up is needed to confirm the potential of PEARS to prevent HP:0005294. While operative mortality is low, the reported diseaseD003327 reflect the learning curve of aortic root surgery in 9606 with connective tissue MONDO:0000001. PEARS may stabilise or reduce MONDO:0005648.
24395977		Personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) in MONDO:0007947: analysis of 1-9 year outcomes by intention-to-treat in a cohort of the first 30 consecutive 9606 to receive a novel tissue and valve-conserving procedure, compared with the published results of aortic root replacement.OBJECTIVE: Among people with MONDO:0007947 who have a typical diseaseD000094628, HP:0005294 is a characteristic cause of diseaseD003643. To pre-empt Type A HP:0005294, composite root replacement with a mechanical valve became the standard of care in the 1980s and 1990s. This is being superseded by valve-sparing aortic root replacement to avoid lifelong anticoagulation. In 2004, a total root and valve-sparing procedure, personalised external aortic support, was introduced. We report here results among the first 30 recipients. METHODS: From cross-sectional digital images, the 9606's own aorta is modelled by computer aided design and a replica is made in thermoplastic by rapid prototyping. On this, a personalised support of a macroporous chemicalD011108 mesh is manufactured. The mesh is positioned around the aorta, closely applied from the aortoventricular junction to beyond the brachiocephalic artery. The operation is performed with a beating heart and usually without cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2011, 30 9606, median age 28 years (IQR 20-44) had this operation and have been prospectively followed for 1.4-8.8 years by February 2013. During a total of 133 9606-years there were no diseaseD003643 or cerebrovascular, aortic or valve-related events. These early outcomes are better than published results for the more radical extirpative root replacement operations. CONCLUSIONS: The aortic valve, the root architecture, and the blood/endothelia interface are conserved. The perioperative burden is less and there has been freedom from aortic and valvular events. A prospective comparative study is planned.
26134372		Effect of personalized external aortic root support on aortic root motion and distension in MONDO:0007947 9606.OBJECTIVE: Personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) is a novel surgical approach with the aim of stabilizing the aortic root size and decreasing risk of HP:0005294 in MONDO:0007947 9606. A bespoke polymer mesh tailored to each 9606's individual aorta shape is produced by modeling and then surgically implanted. The aim of this study is to assess the mechanical effects of PEARS on the aortic root systolic downward motion (an important determinant of aortic wall stress), aortic root distension and on the left ventricle (LV). METHODS/RESULTS: A cohort of 27 MONDO:0007947 9606 had a prophylactic PEARS surgery between 2004 and 2012 with 24 having preoperative and follow-up cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging studies. Systolic downward aortic root motion, aortic root distension, LV volumes/mass and mitral annular systolic excursion before the operation and in the latest follow-up were measured randomly and blinded. After a median follow-up of 50.5 (IQR 25.5-72) months following implantation of PEARS, systolic downward motion of aortic root was significantly decreased (12.6+-3.6mm pre-operation vs 7.9+-2.9mm latest follow-up, p<0.00001). There was a tendency for a decrease in systolic aortic root distension but this was not significant (median 4.5% vs 2%, p=0.35). There was no significant change in LV volumes, ejection fraction, mass and mitral annular systolic excursion in follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PEARS surgery decreases systolic downward aortic root motion which is an important determinant of longitudinal aortic wall stress. Aortic wall distension and Windkessel function are not significantly impaired in the follow-up after implantation of the mesh which is also supported by the lack of deterioration of LV volumes or mass.

While mutations in 9606 ncbi2200 lead to HP:0001083, a major manifestation of MONDO:0007947 (MONDO:0007947), in 10090 ncbi14119 can compensate for reduced/lack of ncbi14118 and maintain the integrity of ocular structures. Here we examine the consequences of a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in the ncbi14118 gene in the ocular system of the mgDeltalpn 10090 model for MONDO:0007947. METHODS: Eyes from mgDeltalpn and wild-type 10090 at 3 and 6 months of age were analyzed by histology. The ciliary zonule was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Mutant 10090 presented a significantly larger distance of the ciliary body to the lens at 3 and 6 months of age when compared to wild-type, and HP:0001083. Immunofluorescence and SEM corroborated those findings in MONDO:0007947 10090, revealing a disorganized mesh of microfibrils on the floor of the ciliary body. Moreover, mutant 10090 also had a larger volume of the anterior chamber, possibly due to excess aqueous humor. Finally, chemicalD019808 treatment had limited efficacy in improving ocular phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with null or hypomorphic mutations, expression of a dominant-negative form of ncbi14118 leads to disruption of microfibrils in the zonule of 10090. This in turn causes MONDO:0001271 and enlargement of the anterior chamber. Therefore, heterozygous mgDeltalpn 10090 recapitulate the major ocular phenotypes of MONDO:0007947 and can be instrumental in understanding the development of the disease.
25406424	Association|chemicalD006025|MONDO:0007947	Histology of a MONDO:0007947 aorta 4.5 years after personalized external aortic root support.In 2008, a 26-year old man had personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh. He was the 16th of 46 9606 to have this operation. He had a typical MONDO:0007947 habitus. His mother died of this disease as did his brother, with an HP:0005294. The 9606 himself died suddenly 4.5 years after his PEARS operation. At autopsy, there was no blood in the pericardium. The coronary orifices and proximal arteries were normal. His diseaseD000082882 was minimally regurgitant as it was prior to operation and remained throughout follow-up. Macroscopically the implanted mesh was embedded in the adventitia and not separable from the aortic wall. Microscopically it was fully incorporated with collagen fibres as has been seen in our animal studies. The unsupported aortic arch showed some focal fragmentation of elastic fibres and a mild increase in chemicalD006025 consistent with MONDO:0007947. These appearances were not present in the supported aortic root, which had the histological appearance of a normal aorta. He was the first 9606 to die with an implant. The histological appearances suggest the possibility that the incorporated support of the aortic root allowed recovery of the microstructure of the media. 
27032474		Personalized external aortic root support: a review of the current status.Personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) is an emerging technology. It is a pre-emptive operation to halt aortic root expansion and maintain aortic valve function in MONDO:0007947 and is also applicable to diseaseD000094628 of other aetiologies. To fully evaluate PEARS, awareness of all those who advise these 9606 is necessary to ensure that 9606 are fully informed of the alternative operations, to carefully build experience, to ensure safety and quality and to monitor outcomes. Herein, we present a summary of published methods and outcomes and the arrangements in place for fuller evaluation. 
30963974		"Management and Outcomes of HP:0005294 in Pregnancy with MONDO:0007947: A Systematic Review.BACKGROUND: In MONDO:0007947 (MONDO:0007947), MONDO:0005021 is one of the main cardiovascular manifestations which deteriorate due to the physiological changes during pregnancy. We aimed to assess the up-to-date management and outcomes of diseaseD000094630 (diseaseD000094630) in pregnancy with MONDO:0007947. 9606 AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Original studies published between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2018 and which described the management and/or outcomes of diseaseD000094630 during or after pregnancy in 9606 with MONDO:0007947 were included. Literature searches were conducted. The PubMed search was performed using terms ""MONDO:0007947"" [Mesh] and ""Pregnancy"" [Mesh] whereas the Google Scholar search was for ""MONDO:0007947"" and ""Pregnancy"", all words anywhere in the article. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 177 articles on PubMed and 13,900 articles on Google Scholar. Assessment of full-text articles for eligibility after removal of duplicates from both databases yielded 12 eligible studies to be included in the final review. CONCLUSION: 9606 with MONDO:0007947 are at high risk of HP:0005294 during pregnancy and 9606 with aortic root 41-45 mm should consider avoiding pregnancy. Guideline-specific management of MONDO:0005160 in pregnancy will reduce the risk of HP:0005294. Diagnosis and Management of MONDO:0007947 need a multidisciplinary approach and team that should start working early in pregnancy. Further studies are needed to optimize medical and surgical approaches in addition to preconception counselling in highrisk subjects."
28419245		Support of the aortic wall: a histological study in 9940 comparing a macroporous mesh with low-porosity vascular graft of the same chemicalD011093 material.OBJECTIVES: Wrapping with various materials was an early treatment for MONDO:0005160. Wrapping with low-porosity vascular grafts has been associated with graft migration and vascular erosion. An alternative is to use a macroporous mesh (MPM) made of the same chemicalD011108 (polyethylene terephalate). We compared the histological outcome 1 year after wrapping 9940 aortas with low-porosity grafts versus MPM fabrics. METHODS: The 2 different fabrics were wrapped around the aorta of 3 9940. After 1 year the aortas were excised. The 2 wrapped segments of aorta were compared with each other and control aorta. Histological examinations and measurements were made of the layers of the aortic wall in 36 prespecified locations in each of the 3 9940. RESULTS: Both fabrics were consistently surrounded by foreign body reaction and well-vascularized diseaseD005355. This was more pronounced with the low-porosity vascular graft material which was poorly incorporated and caused buckling at the transition between wrapped and unwrapped aorta. Conversely, the MPM was fully incorporated, resulting in a composite mesh/biological aortic wall. There was reduction of medial thickness with both materials but it was locally more extreme due to the corrugations in the vascular graft material. The findings were consistent between sampled locations and were similar in the 3 animals. CONCLUSIONS: The different porosity and rigidity of the materials influences their incorporation into the aortic wall. The incorporation of the pliable MPM precludes the complications of migration and erosion which are seen after wrapping with low-porosity prosthetic vascular graft material.
32867844		A contemporary approach to a young female 9606 with MONDO:0018954 and an uncomplicated type HP:0005294: a case report.BACKGROUND: HP:0005294 is a relatively uncommon, but often catastrophic disease that requires early and accurate diagnosis. It often presents in 9606 with MONDO:0003900. The current aortic surgical techniques are related with serious early and late complications. This case report emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of diseaseD000094628 and the risk of HP:0005294, especially in 9606 with MONDO:0003900. We present an alternative, contemporary and multidisciplinary approach based on the present state of knowledge. CASE HP:0010861: We present a rare case of a young female 9606 with MONDO:0018954 who was admitted with an uncomplicated HP:0005294 (MONDO:0005344 / diseaseC536044) and a dilated diseaseD000094628. After a period of close surveillance and extensive vascular imaging, thoracic endovascular aortic repair was deemed to be technically not possible. Medical treatment was optimized and our 9606 successfully underwent a personalised external diseaseD000094628 support procedure (PEARS) as a contemporary alternative to existing diseaseD000094628 surgical techniques. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approach, close follow-up and multimodality imaging. The decision to intervene in a chronic type HP:0005294 is still challenging and should be made in experienced centers by an interdisciplinary team. However, if an acute complication occurs, thoracic endovascular aortic repair TEVAR is the method of choice. In all cases optimal medical treatment is important. There is increasing evidence that personalized external diseaseD000094628 support procedure PEARS is effective in stabilizing the diseaseD000094628 and preventing its dilatation and HP:0005294 not only in 9606 with MONDO:0007947, but also in other cases of diseaseD000094628 of other etiologies. Moreover, many publications have reported the additional benefit of reduction or even eradication of MONDO:0005648 by improving coaptation of the aortic valve leaflets in dilated aortas.

METHODS: Seven pregnant 9606 with MONDO:0007947 with HP:0005294 were identified, who were treated in Beijing Anzhen Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University between January 2012 and September 2014. 9606 charts were reviewed for cardiovascular surgery, occurrence of complications, clinical features and the maternal and fetal outcomes. RESULTS: (1) Among 7 9606, 4 cases were diagnosed as type A HP:0005294 and 3 were cases diagnosed as type B HP:0005294. The diagnosis mainly depends on CT angiography. New York Heart Association (NYHA) classify into 5 of level II, 1 of level III, 1 of leveI IV. Except for 1 9606 with MONDO:0001297 lead to MONDO:0005252, the remaining 6 cases had no complications. (2) Three 9606 underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in second trimester and two 9606 underwent heart surgery in third trimester. Two 9606 terminated pregnancy before heart surgery (one of whom underwent artificial abortion, one of whom underwent cesarean section in second trimester). (3) The methods of cardiovascular surgeries were as follow: 3 of Bentall+Sun', 1 of Bentall+Sun'+ right coronary artery bypass grafting, 1 of Bentall, 1 of the whole chest aorta replacement surgery, and 1 of femoral artery catheter chest aorta with membrane mesh stent implantation. The diameter of aortic roots measured during operation were 5 cm in 2 cases, 7 cm in 2 cases and 10 cm in 2 cases respectively. Among the 7 cases, 3 were conducted cesarean sections during cardiovascular surgery, 1 was terminated pregnancy due to HP:0003826 after cardiovascular surgery, and 1 was conducted cesarean section due to severe early-onset MONDO:0005081 at 30 weeks of pregnancy after cardiovascular surgery. (4) Among the 7 cases, 3 were conducted cesarean sections during cardiovascular surgery, the order of which was implemented cesarean section under general anesthesia firstly and then operated cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and heparinization. Two were conducted cardiovascular surgery after termination of pregnancy by early artificial abortion operation or hysterotomy. 1 was conducted Bentall surgery at 18 weeks of pregnancy, after that the 9606 was receiving chemicalD014859 until the fetal HP:0002170 was examined by ultrasound at 31 weeks of pregnancy; the 9606 was conducted cesarean section due to HP:0003826. 1 was conducted heart surgery at 24 weeks of pregnancy and continue the pregnancy to 30 weeks, was conducted cesarean section due to severe early-onset MONDO:0005081 at 30 weeks of pregnancy. (5) Among 7 9606, three 9606 underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass combined with cesarean section. Two 9606 terminated pregnancy after heart surgery. Two 9606 terminated pregnancy before heart surgery. Six 9606 were alive and one 9606 died of MONDO:0043726. (6) 3 cases of newborn with birth body mass between 1 080 to 1 490 g.1 case of birth died after 14 d. 2 cases for newborns were alive without exception. CONCLUSION: HP:0005294 poses serious risk for pregnant 9606 with MONDO:0007947 and the fetus, and the mortality rates for both the mother and the fetus are high. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment should be based on maternal and fetal conditions (such as HP:0005294, gestational age). When fetus is mature, cardiovascular surgery should be carried out with cesarean section. A multi-disciplinary team between obstetric and cardiovascular surgery is crucial to the outcome of these critical 9606.
35747770		Personalised external diseaseD000094628 support (PEARS) to stabilise an diseaseD000094628.9606 with congenitally determined diseaseD000094628 are at risk of MONDO:0005648, HP:0005294, diseaseD012421 and diseaseD003643. Personalised external diseaseD000094628 support (PEARS) may provide an alternative to diseaseD000094628 replacement. This was a multi-centre, prospective cohort of all consecutive 9606 who received ExoVasc mesh implants for a dilated diseaseD000094628 between 2004 and 2017. Baseline and peri-operative characteristics, as well as early postoperative outcomes are described, and time-related survival and re-operation free survival are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. From 2004 through 2017, 117 consecutive 9606 have received ExoVasc mesh implants for diseaseD000094628. The inclusion criteria were an aortic MONDO:0005961 and ascending aorta with asymptomatic dilatation of between 40 and 50 mm in diameter in 9606 aged 16 years or more. 9606 with more than mild MONDO:0005648 were excluded. There was one early diseaseD003643. The length of stay was within seven days in 75% of 9606. In conclusion, the operation achieves the objectives of valve-sparing root replacement. PEARS may be seen as a low-risk conservative operation, which can be applied earlier on in the disease process, and which is complementary to more invasive procedures, such as valve-sparing root replacement or total root replacement.
24986892		Surgical management of diseaseD000094628 in MONDO:0007947 and other diseaseD009358 associated with diseaseD000094628.Elective root replacement in MONDO:0007947 has improved life expectancy in affected 9606. Three forms of surgery are now available: total root replacement (TRR) with a valved conduit, valve sparing root replacement (VSRR) and personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve. TRR can be performed irrespective of aortic dimensions and a mechanical replacement valve is a secure and near certain means of correcting MONDO:0005648 but has HP:0001907 and diseaseD006470 risks. VSRR offers freedom from anticoagulation and attendant risks of diseaseD006470 but reoperation for MONDO:0005648 runs at 1.3% per annum. A prospective multi-institutional study has found this to be an underestimate of the true rate of valve-related adverse events. PEARS conserves the aortic root anatomy and optimises the chance of maintaining valve function but average follow-up is under 5 years and so the long-term results are yet to be determined. 9606 are on average in their 30s and so the cumulative lifetime need for reoperation, and of any valve-related complications, are consequently substantial. With lowering surgical risk of prophylactic root replacement, the threshold for intervention has reduced progressively over 30 years to 4.5 cm and so an increasing number of 9606 who are not destined to have a dissection are now having root replacement. In evaluation of these three forms of surgery, the number needed to treat to prevent dissection and the balance of net benefit and harm in future 9606 must be considered.
30243228		Obstetric and cardiac outcomes in 9606 with MONDO:0007947 and an aortic root diameter <= 45mm.OBJECTIVE: To assess obstetric and aortic outcomes in 9606 with MONDO:0007947 according to aortic root diameter, in view of recommendations for caesarean delivery when the aortic root diameter is >=40 mm in the 2010 American guidelines versus >45 mm in the 2011 European guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study conducted at Sainte-Justine Mother and 9606 Tertiary Hospital, 27 pregnancies in 20 9606 with MONDO:0007947 as defined by the international criteria, were followed prospectively between 1994 and 2017, after excluding 9606 with prior aortic surgery. Obstetric and aortic outcomes were compared in 2 groups according to aortic root diameter: < 40 mm (21 pregnancies) and 40-45 mm (6 pregnancies). RESULTS: 21/27 9606 had a vaginal delivery. The caesarean section rate was 23.8% and 16.7% in 9606 with diameter <40 mm and 40-45 mm respectively (p-value = 1), and perinatal outcome was similar across groups. Two 9606 with a prepregnancy aortic root diameter <40 mm developed an acute HP:0005294 during the third trimester. Both had a family history of HP:0005294. CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal delivery with rigorous HP:0012531 control and avoidance of Valsalva maneuver may be safely considered in 9606 with MONDO:0007947 and an aortic root diameter <=45 mm. The risk of HP:0005294 during pregnancy is hard to predict. Other factors such as family history of HP:0005294 and descending aorta size may play an important role, and this may modify our counselling.
33061070	Association|MONDO:0007947|ncbi2200	Aortic root surgery in MONDO:0007947.MONDO:0007947 (MONDO:0007947) is an MONDO:0003900 etiologically related with ncbi2200 gene mutation. The altered microfibril protein structure result in characteristic HP:0001626 including diseaseD000094628, diseaseD000094628, and HP:0005294. diseaseD000094628 and subsequent dissection are the major causes of reduced life expectancy in MONDO:0007947 9606. Prophylactic aortic root replacement has improved the survival of 9606 with MONDO:0007947. Elective root replacement carries very low mortality and morbidity. Emergency root replacement for dissection is accompanied with higher early mortality and late diseaseD003643/interventions. Both the techniques of aortic root replacement, total root replacement (TRR) with a prosthetic valved conduit, and valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) yield excellent early and late results. Considering the low risk of prosthetic valve-related events, the improved long-term survival, and event-free survival, TRR continues to be a very effective surgical option. VSSR also seems to be a good option for the first 10 to 15 years following surgery in MONDO:0007947 9606. The choice of procedure depends upon available expertise, 9606' choice, feasibility of anticoagulation, possibility of pregnancy, and lifestyle of the 9606. Aortic root morphology and state of valve cusps also affect the decision making. In recent times, personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve has also emerged as a promising alternative to aortic root replacement. All these 9606 need close monitoring for whole life after surgical intervention.
23624982	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD011093|MONDO:0007947	External aortic root support: a histological and mechanical study in 9940.OBJECTIVES: Personalized external aortic root support has completed initial evaluation and has technology appraisal in the UK for 9606 with MONDO:0007947 for use as an alternative to root replacement. Its long-term success in preventing HP:0005294 remains uncertain. Here, we report a study in 9940 to establish whether the externally supporting mesh, as used clinically, is biologically incorporated. The strength of the resulting mesh/artery composite has been tested. METHODS: The carotid artery of growing 9940 (n=6) was enclosed in a mesh sleeve made of a chemicalD011108, chemicalD011093. After a predefined interval of 4-6 months, a length of the artery was excised, including the sleeved and unsleeved portions, and was stress tested and examined histologically. RESULTS: One animal died of MONDO:0005249 7 days after implantation. Comparing sleeved with normal segments, the overall thickness was increased and there was a fibrotic sheet in the periarterial space. The overall vessel wall architecture was preserved in all specimens. Although media thickness of ensleeved arteries was smaller and in one animal mild diseaseC536897 was found in one quadrant of the outer part of the media. There was a significant increase in stiffness and maximum tensile strength of the supported segments compared with normal arterial tissue. CONCLUSIONS: chemicalD011093 mesh, as used for the external support of the dilated aortic root in MONDO:0007947, becomes incorporated in the periadventitial tissue of the carotid artery of 9940. Limited thinning of the media, without any signs of diseaseD007249 or medial diseaseD009336, was visible. There was a significantly greater tensile strength in the carotid artery/mesh composite compared with the unsleeved carotid artery.
1922850	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD011126|HP:0000023; Negative_Correlation|chemicalD011093|HP:0000023	When to use mesh in HP:0000023 repair.With 9606 living longer today, averaging 73 years old, the type of 9606 with HP:0000023 are different than in the past. At the present time, to avoid the high incidence of recurrence due to the aged and weakened tissue component of the groin area, we reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal with chemicalC025539 (chemicalD011093) mesh. Most surgeons agree to use a prosthetic mesh in recurrent HP:0000023 repairs. Moreover, sometimes it is necessary to use mesh in 9606 with connective tissue disorders like MONDO:0020066, MONDO:0007947, and acquired MONDO:0006652. Currently, chemicalD011126 and chemicalD011093 mesh are the most satisfactory, since they are readily available and become well incorporated by connective tissue.
20007995		Manufacturing and placing a bespoke support for the MONDO:0007947 aortic root: description of the method and technical results and status at one year for the first ten 9606.Fatal HP:0005294 commonly occurs in MONDO:0007947. Prevention currently relies on elective replacement of the aortic root. We are evaluating the placement of a manufactured, bespoke external support derived from a computer aided design in a prospective study. In the first ten 9606, measurements were made consistently of the ascending aorta at the level of closure of the aortic valve cusps from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies taken preoperatively and at fixed intervals thereafter. Before and after images were presented for measurement amongst duplicate images of 37 unoperated MONDO:0007947 9606 to permit assessment of intra-observer measurement reproducibility. All images were presented in random sequence to a radiologist unaware of the research question. The largest difference between the preoperative measurement and that made at least one year after surgery was determined. All 9606 had surgery as planned without complications and were alive at one year. In eight of the ten 9606, the largest observed change was a marked reduction in aortic root diameter. The primary objective of this surgery was achieved in each case, reinforcing the ascending aorta whilst leaving the native aortic valve intact and conserving the blood/endothelium interface.

30165980		External Aortic Root Support to Prevent MONDO:0005021 in 9606 With MONDO:0007947.BACKGROUND: Personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) was introduced in 2004 for prevention of diseaseD000094628 in MONDO:0007947 9606. The individual's aortic root is replicated by 3-dimensional printing. A chemicalD011108 mesh sleeve is manufactured, which is implanted with the aim to support and stabilize the aortic wall. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of PEARS for prevention of diseaseD000094628 in MONDO:0007947 9606. METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive MONDO:0007947 9606 operated 2004 to 2012 were prospectively monitored with magnetic resonance imaging. Following a pre-defined protocol, baseline and follow-up aorta measurements were made in a blinded random sequence. RESULTS: The mean age of the 9606 was 33 +- 13.3 years (range: 16 to 58 years), and the mean aortic root diameter was 45 +- 2.8 mm (range: 41 to 52 mm). Follow-up was 6.3 +- 2.6 years. There was no increase in the aortic root and ascending aorta diameters, but there was a tendency toward reduction: annulus diameter 28.9 +- 2.3 mm to 28.5 +- 2.4 mm (change -0.39 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.05 to 0.27 mm), sinus of Valsalva diameter 44.9 +- 2.9 mm to 44.5 +- 3.0 mm (change -0.37 mm, 95% CI: -1.23 to 0.51 mm), and ascending aorta diameter 32.4 +- 3.6 mm to 32.3 +- 3.7 mm (change -0.10 mm, 95% CI: -0.92 to 0.74 mm). In the same period, the descending aorta diameter increased from 22.9 +- 2.4 mm to 24.2 +- 3.0 mm (change 1.32 mm, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.94 mm; p < 0.001) with a tendency toward increase in aortic arch diameter 24.1 +- 2.0 mm to 24.5 +- 2.8 mm (change 0.41 mm, 95% CI: -0.56 to 1.37 mm). CONCLUSIONS: PEARS is effective in stabilizing the aortic root and preventing its dilatation. It is a viable alternative for prevention of diseaseD000094630 in MONDO:0007947 9606.
