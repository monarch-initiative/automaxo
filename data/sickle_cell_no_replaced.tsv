This study aims to synthesize available data on EBIs for SCD and assess IROs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs reporting on EBIs for SCD management implemented in LMICs. We identified articles from PubMed/Medline, Global Health, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science medical subject heading (MeSH and Emtree) and keywords, published from inception through February 23, 2020, and conducted an updated search through December 24, 2020. We provide intervention characteristics for each study, EBI impact on SCD, and evidence of reporting on IROs. MAIN RESULTS: 29 RCTs were analyzed. EBIs identified included disease modifying agents, supportive care agents/analgesics, anti-malarials, systemic treatments, patient/ provider education, and nutritional supplements. Studies using disease modifying agents, nutritional supplements, and anti-malarials reported improvements in pain crisis, hospitalization, children's growth and reduction in severity and prevalence of malaria. Two studies reported on the sustainability of supplementary arginine, citrulline, and daily chloroquine and hydroxyurea for SCD patients. Only 13 studies (44.8%) provided descriptions that captured at least three of the eight IROs. There was limited reporting of acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, cost and sustainability. CONCLUSION: EBIs are effective for SCD management in LMICs; however, measurement of IROs is scarce. Future research should focus on penetration of EBIs to inform evidence-based practice and sustainability in the context of LMICs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review is registered in PROSPERO #CRD42020167289.

Concomitant nutritional deficiencies, infections or exposure to environmental toxins exacerbate chronic anemia in children with SCD. The resulting relative anemia is associated with increased risk of strokes, poor cognitive function and impaired growth. It may also attenuate optimal response to hydroxyurea therapy, the only effective and practical treatment option for SCD in sub-Saharan Africa. This review will focus on the epidemiology, clinical sequelae, and treatment of relative anemia in children with SCD living in low and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Areas covered: The causes and treatment of relative anemia in children with SCD in sub-Saharan Africa. The MEDLINE database was searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles regarding relative anemia in children with SCD in sub-Saharan Africa. Expert commentary: Anemia due to nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases such as helminthiasis and malaria are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. Their co-existence in children with SCD increases morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preventing, diagnosing and treating the underlying cause of this relative anemia will improve SCD-related outcomes in children in sub-Saharan Africa.
30540112		SOCIOECONOMIC AND NUTRITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH SICKLE CELL ANEMIA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW.OBJECTIVE: To describe the socioeconomic and nutritional characteristics of children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia. DATA SOURCES: The present study is a systematic literature review based on published scientific articles. The searches were carried out using the electronic database of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health- PubMed. Two searches of articles published in the last 20years and without limitation of language were carried out. Thefirst one started from the Medical Subject Headings term "Anemia, Sickle Cell" associated with "Socioeconomic Factors"; and the second started from the term "Anemia, Sickle Cell" associated with "Anthropometry". Thesearches were directed to research conducted on humans in the age group from 0 to 18years. DATA SYNTHESIS: The final selection was composed by 11 articles on socioeconomic characteristics and 21articles on nutritional characteristics. Allstudies included children and adolescents with sickle cells disease (age range 0-18years), both genders, and most of them of black ethnicity. Families of children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia were of predominantly low socioeconomic status. Parents had lower educational levels when compared to parents of healthy children and adolescents. Body measurements (weight and height) and anthropometric indicators of children with sickle cell anemia were often lower when compared to healthy groups or reference populations. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia have socioeconomic limitations and worse nutritional conditions, when compared to reference populations. These limitations may lead to worse growth and greater occurrence of possible complications that can impair their quality of life.
30325033		Red blood cell mechanical sensitivity improves in patients with sickle cell disease undergoing chronic transfusion after prolonged, subhemolytic shear exposure.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetically inherited hemoglobinopathy in which deoxygenated hemoglobin S polymerizes, leading to stiff red blood cells (RBCs) and inefficient microcirculatory blood flow. Transfusion therapy acts as primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in SCD. Whether blood transfusion alters the mechanical sensitivity (MS) of RBCs to prolonged subhemolytic shear stress (shear) is unknown. We hypothesized that individuals with SCD undergoing chronic blood transfusion would have improved sensitivity to shear, compared with patients not undergoing transfusion therapy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood suspensions from individuals with SCD not receiving (n = 15) and receiving (n = 15) chronic simple transfusion were conditioned to shear (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 Pa) for various durations (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 sec), and then deformability of RBCs was immediately measured. Healthy young controls (n = 15) were included for reference. A surface mesh was interpolated using the data to determine the effect of blood transfusion on MS of RBCs. RESULTS: There was impaired RBC deformability to prolonged supraphysiologic shear in both SCD groups; however, MS improved in transfused patients when exposed to prolonged physiologic shear. Furthermore, in the transfused patients with SCD, the threshold above which subhemolytic damage occurs was similar to controls. CONCLUSION: We found that chronic transfusion therapy normalizes the MS threshold above which RBC subhemolytic damage occurs after prolonged shear exposure in SCD. An important and novel finding in transfused patients with SCD was the improvement in RBC deformability in response to prolonged shear exposure over the physiologic range.
26667608		Pregnancy outcomes in women with sickle-cell disease in low and high income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in women with sickle-cell disease (SCD) is associated with increased adverse outcomes. Findings on the association between SCD and adverse pregnancy outcomes are conflicting, and the results do not address whether these associations are similar in both low- and high-income countries. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate pregnancy outcomes associated with SCD. SEARCH STRATEGY: The MEDLINE database was searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles on pregnancy outcomes in women with SCD. SELECTION CRITERIA: We used full research articles published in English that compared women with SCD with women who did not have SCD, as controls. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were abstracted and analysed using comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.2. The primary outcomes were intrauterine growth restriction and perinatal mortality. Secondary outcomes were rates of caesarean sections, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage, maternal mortality, prematurity, and low birthweight. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies met all of the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. SCD was associated with intrauterine growth restriction (pooled OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.85-4.21), perinatal mortality (pooled OR 3.76, 95% CI 2.34-6.06), and low birthweight (pooled OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.42-2.83). SCD was also associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (pooled OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.47-2.85), maternal mortality (pooled OR 10.91, 95% CI 1.83-65.11, P = 0.009), and eclampsia (pooled OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.20-7.58). CONCLUSION: Pregnancy in women with SCD is associated with increased risks of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes in both low- and high-income countries. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: This meta-analysis showed worse pregnancy outcomes in women with sickle-cell disease compared with controls.
35140852		Association and Risk Factors of Osteonecrosis of Femoral Head in Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the level of evidence about the associated factors and the risk factors of osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH) in sickle cell individuals. METHODS: The review was based on the search and selection of studies available in the electronic databases PubMed, SCIELO, LILACS, BVS. As descriptors, the terms of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) corresponding to "Osteonecrosis", "Necrosis avascular" and "Aseptic necrosis" and "Femoral head" and "sickle cell disease" and "risk factor" and "predictor". RESULTS: Among clinical and laboratorial factors the most promising risk factors were the severity of sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome. As a result, from studies of a moderate level of quality, blood pressure, body weight, previous trauma, haemoglobin to haematocrit ratio (Hb/HCT), and number of hospitalizations can be highlighted. Others, such as genetic markers and male gender, have also been positively associated in lower quality studies. CONCLUSION: For a better clarification of what the risk factors are for the ONFH, it is necessary to study with populations of different origins, different ages, different profiles of Hb, which present greater methodological rigor and perform a multivariate analysis to control confounding factors. Further study is also needed to understand the genetic determinants of ONFH.
18830514		Newborn screening: what pediatricians should know.OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the current situation of neonatal screening worldwide and in Brazil. To define the role of pediatricians in neonatal screening programs. SOURCES: Scientific articles selected by means of searches run on the medical websites MEDLINE, Cochrane, PubMed (MeSH) and MD Consult, using the keywords newborn screening, neonatal, pediatrics, diagnosis, primary care, ethics and their equivalents in Portuguese, in isolation and in combination, in addition to medical textbooks on genetics and inborn errors of metabolism, published between January 1998 and December 2007, the National Neonatal Screening Program technical standards and routines manual, and Ministry of Health decree 822/2001. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Published data demonstrate a great diversity in the number of diseases included in the neonatal screening programs of different countries. In Brazil, the National Neonatal Screening Program was set up in 2001, to screen for phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism, sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. Screening for a wider range of conditions using mass spectrometry is currently the subject of disagreement and discussion of financial and ethical issues. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal screening is one of the most important advances for the prevention of pediatric diseases. Nevertheless, implementation is complex, multidisciplinary and dependent on public health policies and, to date, there is no consensus on which diseases should be included. A large number of scientific and ethical questions need to be discussed in order to better define the screening panels to be implemented. Pediatricians have important roles to play in all stages of neonatal screening programs.

This indicates that circulating erythrocytes are vulnerable to the oxidative injury occurring under the imbalance of redox homeostasis. In this review article, two topics are presented concerning the human erythrocytes exposed to the oxidative inflammation including septic and sterile conditions. First, we demonstrate rheological derangement of erythrocytes subjected to acute oxidative injury caused by exogenous generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Erythrocyte filterability as whole-cell deformability has been estimated by the gravity-based nickel mesh filtration technique in our laboratory and was dramatically impaired in a time-dependent manner after starting exposure to the ROS generators, that is associated with concurrent progression of membrane protein degradation, phospholipid peroxidation, erythrocyte swelling, methemoglobin formation, and oxidative hemolysis. Second, we introduce an impairment of erythrocyte filterability confirmed quantitatively in diabetes mellitus and hypertension of animal models and patients under treatment. Among the cell geometry, internal viscosity, and membrane property as the three major determinants of erythrocyte deformability, erythrocyte membrane alteration is supposed to be the primary cause of this impairment in these lifestyle-related diseases associated with persistent oxidative inflammation. Excessive ROS trigger the inflammatory responses and reduce the erythrocyte membrane fluidity. Oxidative inflammation increasing erythrocyte membrane rigidity underlies the impaired systemic microcirculation, which is observed in diabetic and/or hypertensive patients. On the other hand, elevated internal viscosity caused by sickle hemoglobin polymerization is a primary cause of impaired erythrocyte filterability in sickle cell disease (SCD). However, oxidative inflammation is also involved in the pathophysiology of SCD. The physiologic level of ROS acts as signaling molecules for adaptation to oxidative environment, but the pathological level of ROS induces suicidal erythrocyte death (eryptosis). These findings provide further insight into the ROS-related pathophysiology of many clinical conditions.
22048588		Orofacial manifestations of hematological disorders: anemia and hemostatic disorders.The aim of this paper is to review the literature and identify orofacial manifestations of hematological diseases, with particular reference to anemias and disorders of hemostasis. A computerized literature search using MEDLINE was conducted for published articles on orofacial manifestations of hematological diseases, with emphasis on anemia. Mesh phrases used in the search were: oral diseases AND anaemia; orofacial diseases AND anaemia; orofacial lesions AND anaemia; orofacial manifestations AND disorders of haemostasis. The Boolean operator "AND" was used to combine and narrow the searches. Anemic disorders associated with orofacial signs and symptoms include iron deficiency anemia, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, megaloblastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, thalassaemia and aplastic anemia. The manifestations include conjunctiva and facial pallor, atrophic glossitis, angular stomatitis, dysphagia, magenta tongue, midfacial overgrowth, osteoclerosis, osteomyelitis and paraesthesia/anesthesia of the mental nerve. Orofacial petechiae, conjunctivae hemorrhage, nose-bleeding, spontaneous and post-traumatic gingival hemorrhage and prolonged post-extraction bleeding are common orofacial manifestations of inherited hemostatic disorders such as von Willebrand's disease and hemophilia. A wide array of anemic and hemostatic disorders encountered in internal medicine has manifestations in the oral cavity and the facial region. Most of these manifestations are non-specific, but should alert the hematologist and the dental surgeon to the possibilities of a concurrent disease of hemopoiesis or hemostasis or a latent one that may subsequently manifest itself.
38013366		Psychosocial challenges of persons with sickle cell anemia: A narrative review.Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a severe form of sickle cell disease that primarily affects black populations and individuals in tropical countries. This condition causes significant morbidity and mortality and leads to a range of psychosocial challenges. A preliminary search was conducted on Ovid Medline and public databases with a combination of Medical Subject Headings keywords, resulting in 368 articles. The articles were screened based on the selection criteria in a nonsystematic method by 3 researchers, and a narrative synthesis was done to analyze extracted data from selected peer-reviewed article. Mental disorders, sleep disturbances, interpersonal relationship challenges, stigmatization, and workplace discrimination were identified as significant contributors to the psychosocial distress experienced by individuals with SCA and their families. Depression and anxiety were prevalent among individuals with SCA, leading to poor treatment adherence, increased pain, and disruptions in various aspects of life. Sleep disturbances, including sleep-disordered breathing and sleepwalking, were also identified as significant contributors to poor sleep quality in SCA patients. Families of individuals with SCA also face challenges, including psychological stress, financial strain, and social disruption. Stigmatization is common, leading to misconceptions and discrimination. Workplace discrimination is prevalent, with a high unemployment rate among adult SCA patients. Comprehensive care is crucial to address these psychosocial issues. Early identification and intervention, comprehensive support programs, patient and family education, enhanced pain management strategies, and integration of mental health into clinical care are recommended. School-based support, research and advocacy, and community support groups are also important. By addressing these challenges through comprehensive care and support, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and society can reduce psychosocial distress and improve the lives of individuals with SCA.
30122266		Impact of Red Blood Cell Antigen Matching on Alloimmunization and Transfusion Complications in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: A Systematic Review.Red blood cells (RBC) transfusion is critical in managing acute and chronic complications in sickle cell disease (SCD); however, it is complicated by RBC alloimmunization, iron overload, transfusion reactions and infection. Several reports documented an increased incidence of alloantibodies in transfused individuals with SCD, especially for Rh and Kell antigens. As a result, the National Institutes of Health Expert Panel and British Society for Haematology guidelines recommend primary matching for C/c, E/e and K antigens in addition to ABO/RhD for RBC transfusions. However, the evidence supporting these recommendations was cited as limited and understanding of alloimmunization in SCD is evolving. To examine the limitations of the evidence, we undertook a systematic review of evidence behind recommendations for limited and extended serologic and genotypic RBC antigen matching to reduce alloimmunization, autoimmunization and transfusion reactions. Searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases using MeSH index and free text terms between 1976 through October 2015 and papers and captured through July 2016 through review references in papers, word of mouth, and ongoing Google Scholar and Medline Alerts identified 303 unique articles. Nineteen articles met inclusion criteria and were classified by the Oxford Centre Evidence Based levels of evidence. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklists were completed for 18 of the 19 studies. There were no prospective randomized controlled trials. Sixteen of the articles were cohort studies, two were cross-sectional studies, and one decision tree model examining costs. Low-quality evidence from observational cohort studies supports that alloimmunization prevalence can be decreased by extending serological RBC antigen matching. Transfusion reactions are generally poorly and inconsistently reported. There was no evidence reporting the effect prophylactic genotypic matching has on alloimmunization, autoimmunization or transfusion reactions. There were no studies comparing prophylactic genotypic matching to serologic matching. High-quality evidence was lacking to support clinical decision making regarding best transfusion practices. Multicenter prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to determine best strategies for reducing the rate of alloimmunization using serologic and genotypic matching.
37200963		Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with sickle cell disease: an integrative review.Sickle cell disease is the most common hemoglobinopathy among humans. As the condition promotes susceptibility to infections, chronic inflammation, and hypercoagulability disorders, several international agencies have included individuals with this disease in the COVID-19 risk group for severe outcomes. However, available information about the subject is not properly systematized yet. This review aimed to understand and summarize the scientific knowledge about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with sickle cell disease. Searches were performed in the Medline, PubMed, and Virtual Health Library databases based on descriptors chosen according to the Medical Subject Headings. We analyzed studies published between 2020 and October 2022, developed with qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methodology, and written in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. The search resulted in 90 articles organized into six categories. There is disagreement in the literature about how different aspects related to sickle cell disease, such as chronic inflammation status, hypercoagulability, hemolytic anemia, use of hydroxyurea, and access to medical care interference with the clinical course of COVID-19. These topics deserve further investigation. It is evident, however, that the infection may manifest in an atypical way and act as a trigger for the development of sickle cell-specific complications, such as acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive crises, conditions that are associated with great morbidity and mortality. Therefore, healthcare professionals must be aware of the different forms of presentation of COVID-19 among these individuals. Specific guidelines and therapeutic protocols, as well as public policies for sickle cell individuals, must be considered. Systematic review registration: This review (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NH4AS) and the review protocol (https://osf.io/3y649/) are registered in the Open Science Framework platform.
28905692		The emerging challenge of optimal blood pressure management and hypertensive syndromes in pregnant women with sickle cell disease: a review.INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common hemoglobinopathy, affecting a considerable proportion of black populations of African origin, Middle East and in the Indian sub-continent. Women with SCD are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes. Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy such as preeclampsia and eclampsia are more common in women with sickle cell disease. Areas covered: This review examined the influence of hypertension and SCD in pregnancy, and provides the preliminary evidence that the traditional systolic and diastolic blood pressure thresholds for hypertensive disorders such as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia may require reassessment in pregnant women with SCD. The causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, hypertensive complications of pregnancy in women with and without sickle cell disease were reviewed. A MEDLINE database search using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles regarding sickle cell disease, pregnancy and hypertension was performed. Expert commentary: Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease is associated with high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Using the existing thresholds for diagnosis and treatment for hypertensive disease in pregnancy without adjustment to accommodate for the lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in those with sickle cell disease may worsen an already poor maternal and perinatal outcome in this population.
36927679		Patient perspectives on noninvasive prenatal testing among black women in the United States: a scoping review.Advances in reproductive health technologies such as noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are changing the landscape of prenatal care and maternal health. NIPT, made clinically available in the United States (US) in 2011, is a screening test that utilizes cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to detect for aneuploidies and genetic characteristics in fetal DNA. In September 2020, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended NIPT for all pregnant patients regardless of age or risk factors. We examined peer-reviewed, empirical studies published from January 2011 to February 2022, assessing NIPT studies with patient perspectives in the US and what is known about how empirical studies include Black women. Our scoping review draws from PubMed (with advanced MeSH search options) and Scopus databases for advanced scoping review, with 33 articles meeting our criteria. Empirical studies on NIPT show patient perceptions range across five themes: 1) accuracy / safety, 2) return of results, 3) patient knowledge, 4) informed consent, and 5) perceptions among minoritized groups (with perceptions of race and gender as a social demographic intersection). Additionally, among the 15 studies that included that Black woman in their study sample, none measured the perceptions of Black women with genetic conditions. Bridging this knowledge gap is critical because NIPT is becoming increasingly accessible across the nation and is being developed to screen for additional genetic conditions, such as sickle cell disease. Ultimately, NIPT researchers need to go to greater lengths to examine the patient perspectives of Black women with and without genetic conditions.
26141903	treat|@CHEMICAL_Vitamin_D|@DISEASE_Anemia_Sickle_Cell	[Vitamin D in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease: an integrative review].OBJECTIVE: To review the literature about the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its consequences in children and adolescents with sickle-cell disease. DATA SOURCES: The literature survey was performed through the bibliographic databases Medline; U.S. National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health (PubMed); Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude (Lilacs), and the Cochrane Library. The keywords were selected using Medical Heading Terms (MeSH): "Vitamin D" OR "Vitamin D deficiency" AND "Anemia, Sickle Cell" AND "Child" AND "Adolescent". The search was limited to articles in English, Spanish and Portuguese, published until April 2014. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eleven articles were selected among the 18 found. In 6 of the 11 studies, serum levels of vitamin D in children and/or adolescents with sickle-cell anemia were low. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with sickle-cell anemia exceeded that of the comparison group. The low intake of vitamin D, seasonality, exposure to sun, increased metabolism associated with the hemoglobinopathy, and age increase were factors associated with the deficiency. There was an association between a significant vitamin D deficiency and bone weakness and painful crises. There was a positive correlation between increased levels of vitamin D by supplementation and functional, physical capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The vitamin D deficiency in children and adolescents with sickle-cell disease is prevalent and requires further studies to demonstrate its association with comorbidities and possible benefits of vitamin D supplementation.
36714120		Feature preserving mesh network for semantic segmentation of retinal vasculature to support ophthalmic disease analysis.Introduction: Ophthalmic diseases are approaching an alarming count across the globe. Typically, ophthalmologists depend on manual methods for the analysis of different ophthalmic diseases such as glaucoma, Sickle cell retinopathy (SCR), diabetic retinopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy. All these manual assessments are not reliable, time-consuming, tedious, and prone to error. Therefore, automatic methods are desirable to replace conventional approaches. The accuracy of this segmentation of these vessels using automated approaches directly depends on the quality of fundus images. Retinal vessels are assumed as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of many ophthalmic diseases. Mostly newly developed ophthalmic diseases contain minor changes in vasculature which is a critical job for the early detection and analysis of disease. Method: Several artificial intelligence-based methods suggested intelligent solutions for automated retinal vessel detection. However, existing methods exhibited significant limitations in segmentation performance, complexity, and computational efficiency. Specifically, most of the existing methods failed in detecting small vessels owing to vanishing gradient problems. To overcome the stated problems, an intelligence-based automated shallow network with high performance and low cost is designed named Feature Preserving Mesh Network (FPM-Net) for the accurate segmentation of retinal vessels. FPM-Net employs a feature-preserving block that preserves the spatial features and helps in maintaining a better segmentation performance. Similarly, FPM-Net architecture uses a series of feature concatenation that also boosts the overall segmentation performance. Finally, preserved features, low-level input image information, and up-sampled spatial features are aggregated at the final concatenation stage for improved pixel prediction accuracy. The technique is reliable since it performs better on the DRIVE database, CHASE-DB1 database, and STARE dataset. Results and discussion: Experimental outcomes confirm that FPM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with superior computational efficiency. In addition, presented results are achieved without using any preprocessing or postprocessing scheme. Our proposed method FPM-Net gives improvement results which can be observed with DRIVE datasets, it gives Se, Sp, and Acc as 0.8285, 0.98270, 0.92920, for CHASE-DB1 dataset 0.8219, 0.9840, 0.9728 and STARE datasets it produces 0.8618, 0.9819 and 0.9727 respectively. Which is a remarkable difference and enhancement as compared to the conventional methods using only 2.45 million trainable parameters.
7771550	associate|@CHEMICAL_Oxygen|@CHEMICAL_Polymers	Contributions of sickle hemoglobin polymer and sickle cell membranes to impaired filterability.Sickle cell anemia is a disease of abnormal rheology caused by acute and reversible, as well as chronic and irreversible, changes in the properties and deformability of sickle erythrocytes. Deformability is determined by several factors, including intracellular sickle hemoglobin polymerization, the abnormal membrane properties of sickle cells, and the abnormal rheological properties of the soluble concentrated hemoglobin solution within dense sickle red blood cells. In this study, we used a 5-microns pore nickel mesh filter to evaluate quantitatively the effects of these factors on the filterability of erythrocytes containing sickle hemoglobin. We used sickle trait and sickle/beta(+)-thalassemia cells, because they have minimal membrane abnormalities or density heterogeneity, to investigate the effects of polymer formation on rheological properties. We found that filterability of these cells is sensitive to small amounts of intracellular polymer and that impaired filtration is linearly related to oxygen-dependent polymer formation, up to a polymer fraction of 0.3. By increasing the proportion of dense cells in populations of normal cells or cells from individuals with sickle syndromes and equilibrating these cells with gas ligands, we estimate that polymerization, even at 95% saturation, contributes twice as much to impaired filterability of sickle erythrocytes as the abnormal membranes in homozygous sickle cell disease. At lower saturation values, the effects of polymer are even greater. The viscosity of the concentrated hemoglobin in dense cells had the smallest effect, over physiologically relevant saturation values. These results emphasize the importance of sickle hemoglobin polymerization in the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease and should help define its pathophysiology and responses to therapy in quantitative terms.
34966850		Bochdalek Hernia and Partial Diaphragmatic Agenesis: Pedicled Intercostal Muscle Flap and Mesh Repair in a Young Adult with Sickle Cell Disease.Congenital Bochdalek hernia (BH) in an adult is rare and has an unusual presentation. They are confined to the pediatric age group with an incidence of 1:3,000 live births. It rarely persists asymptomatic until adulthood. Surgical repair by thoracic, abdominal, or thoraco-abdominal approach is the treatment of choice with diaphragmatic reconstruction in associated diaphragmatic agenesis. With only 10 cases of BH with partial diaphragmatic agenesis reported to date, we discuss the rarity, unusual presentation, and management of BH in a young adult with sickle cell disease that has not been reported in the literature.
31039424		Neurologic complications in children under five years with sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world affecting every organ. The major challenge in the medical care of children with SCD is preventing end-organ dysfunction, particularly the brain. Major neurologic complications in children less than five years with SCD include, but are not limited to, Silent cerebral infarct, cerebral sinus thrombosis, epilepsy, reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Recurrent headaches and migraine are not rare in children under five years with SCD. This review will focus on the neurologic complications and the description of the modifiable risk factors in children less than 5 years of age with emphasis on differences between high and low resource settings. AREAS COVERED: Neurologic complications of children under 5 years of age and the modifiable risk factors. The PUBMED database was searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords for articles regarding neurologic complications in children under 5 years of age. CONCLUSION: Neurologic complications in children under five years of age with SCD may be more frequent than currently reported, among which Silent cerebral infarct and cognitive impairment are the most common.
33563075	treat|@CHEMICAL_Hydroxyurea|@DISEASE_Systemic_carnitine_deficiency	Sickle cell anemia/sickle cell disease and pregnancy outcomes among ethnic tribes in India: an integrative mini-review.Objective: To evaluate the studies which have reported the prevalence of maternal complications and outcomes for women with SCA/SCD. Healthy populations make a healthy community and improve the future for mankind. Pregnant women are an essential segment of humanity as they bear the fetus and supply nutrition for their development throughout the gestational period. Their health status and disease conditions also play a vital role in deciding the future of the offspring.Materials and methods: The Mesh terms: "Haemoglobinopathies" + "Sickle cell anemia" + "Sickle cell disease" + "Ethnic tribes" + "Pregnancy outcomes" + "India" were used to search the literature available from public databases such as "PubMed", "PubMed Central" "Google Scholar", "Science Direct" and "Scopus" and the same is checked for removing repetitions. The data was extracted and collected literature was thoroughly analysed. SCD/SCA is a commonly prevalent hereditary hemoglobinopathy disease and is related to augmented risk factors and premature mortality.Results: SCD severely affects pregnancy, which leads to the elevated occurrence of perinatal and maternal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, abortions, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), etc., and sufficient care during the pregnancy guarantees an improved outcome. Due to the best health care conveniences, availability of drugs such as hydroxyurea, antibiotic prophylaxis, and vaccination, the life expectancy of SCD patients has greatly improved in recent times though directly related to the access and services available at the healthcare facilities for the needy and poor. Moreover, the latest innovations in the fields of prenatal screening and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), facilitate partners suffering from SCA/SCD to have a healthy child. There are no available studies on the prevalence of SCA/SCD in pregnant women among ethnic tribal populations from India.Conclusion: This review article is focused on the effects of SCA/SCD on pregnancy outcomes, the consistent follow-up, routine check-ups and successful management of complications throughout pregnancy, the various diagnostic methods toward preventive methods, curative and management therapeutic strategies and also defines the perinatal and maternal outcomes in the ethnic tribal populations of India.
