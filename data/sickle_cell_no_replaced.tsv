38168168	Computational identification of potential modulators of heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) for pharmacological intervention against sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) poses a significant health challenge and therapeutic approaches often target fetal hemoglobin (HbF) to ameliorate symptoms. Hydroxyurea, a current therapeutic option for SCD, has shown efficacy in increasing HbF levels. However, concerns about myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia necessitate the exploration of alternative compounds. Heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) presents a promising target for pharmacological intervention in SCD due to its association with HbF modulation. This study systematically screened compounds for their potential inhibitory functions against HRI. METHODS: Small-molecule compounds from 17 plants commonly utilized in traditional SCD management were subjected to <i>in silico</i> screening against HRI. Molecular docking was performed, and free binding energy calculations were determined using molecular mechanics with generalized born and surface area (MMGBSA). The lead compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns. Computational quantum mechanical modelling of the lead compounds was subsequently performed. We further examined the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and physiological properties of the identified compounds. RESULTS: Five potential HRI inhibitors, including kaempferol-3-(2G-glucosyrutinoside), epigallocatechin gallate, tiliroside, myricetin-3-O-glucoside, and cannabiscitrin, with respective docking scores of -16.0, -12.17, -11.37, -11.56 and 11.07 kcal/mol, were identified. The MMGBSA analysis of the complexes yielded free-binding energies of -69.76, -71.17, -60.44, 53.55, and - 55 kcal/mol, respectively. The identified leads were stable within HRI binding pocket for the duration of 100 ns simulation. CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully identified five phytoligands with potential inhibitory effects on HRI, opening avenues for their use as modulators of HbF in SCD patients. This finding holds promise for advancing treatment strategies in SCD. However, additional preclinical analyses are warranted to validate the chemotherapeutic properties of the lead compounds.
38190937	Factors Associated with Pathway-Concordant Neuroimaging for Pediatric Ischemic Stroke.OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and non-invasive diagnostic angiography among children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute ischemic stroke. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from >50 US children's hospitals. We included children 29 days through 17 years old hospitalized from the ED with an International Classification of Disease, 10<sup>th</sup> revision, diagnosis code for acute ischemic stroke between October 1, 2015, and November 30, 2022. We excluded children with a principal diagnosis code of trauma/external injury, without neuroimaging on day of presentation, and into-ED transfers. Our outcomes were defined as acquisition of MRI (versus computed tomography only) and angiography (versus no angiography) on day of presentation. We performed generalized linear mixed modeling with hospital as a random effect to determine the association of demographics, known comorbidities, and treatment factors with each outcome. RESULTS: We included 1,601 children. In multivariable analysis, younger age, mechanical ventilation, and Black race were associated with lower odds of MRI acquisition, while history of moyamoya disease and sickle cell disease were associated with higher odds. Younger age, mechanical ventilation, Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, other races, history of metabolic disease, and history of seizures were associated with lower odds of angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Younger and non-White children experienced lower odds of MRI and angiography, which may be driven by health system limitations or provider implicit biases or both. Our results expose risk factors for underdiagnosis of ischemic stroke and provide opportunities to tailor institutional pathways reflective of underlying pathophysiology.
38179780	Feasibility and performance of in-house red blood cell reagents to detect unexpected antibodies in immunized patients in Burkina Faso.In sub-Saharan Africa, antibody detection tests remain inaccessible because of the high cost and limited shelf life of red blood cell (RBC) reagents. This study aimed at investigating the feasibility and performance of locally prepared RBC reagents for antibody detection in Burkina Faso. We conducted an experimental study comparing commercial RBC panels and a local panel prepared from phenotyped blood donors in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Antibody detection testing was performed by the indirect antiglobulin test using a gel card filtration column in a low-ionic-strength solution. Judgment criteria were the concordance rate and the kappa agreement coefficient of results generated by the two panels. A total of 302 blood donors were phenotyped for the major antigens of the RH, KEL, MNS, FY, JK, LE, and P1PK blood group systems. From this pool of donors, we designed an RBC detection panel that was used to screen for unexpected antibodies in 1096 plasma samples from 832 patients with a history of transfusion and 264 recently delivered or pregnant women with no history of blood transfusion. A positive antibody detection test was observed in 8.1 percent of the samples using the local panel versus 6.4 percent with the commercial panels. A total of 23 samples were negative with the commercial panels and positive with the local panel, while the findings were reversed for four samples. The concordance rate was 97.5 percent, and the kappa agreement coefficient was 0.815. Our results suggest that the development of local RBC panels can be an alternative to commercial panels in countries with limited resources. It could also be a cost-effective intervention, mainly for children under 5 years of age, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women, all of whom are most at risk for malaria and sickle cell disease complications. Blood services could develop and implement appropriate strategies to make phenotyped donor pools available for the design of suitable RBC panels.
38189147	Strengthening Health System and Community Mobilization for Sickle Cell Disease Screening and Management among Tribal Populations in India: An Interventional Study.Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects 5% of the global population, with over 300,000 infants born yearly. In India, 73% of those with the sickle hemoglobin gene belong to indigenous tribes in remote regions lacking proper healthcare. Despite the prevalence of SCD, India lacked state-led public health programs until recently, leaving a gap in screening and comprehensive care. Hence, the Indian Council of Medical Research conducted implementation research to address this gap. This paper discusses the development and impact of the program, including screening and treatment coverage for SCD in tribal areas. With a quasi-experimental design, this study was conducted in six tribal-dominated districts in three phases - formative, intervention, and evaluation. The intervention included advocacy, partnership building, building the health system's capacity and community mobilization, and enabling the health systems to screen and manage SCD patients. The capacity building included improving healthcare workers' skills through training and infrastructure development of primary healthcare (PHC) facilities. The impact of the intervention is visible in terms of people's participation (54%, 76% and 93% of the participants participated in some intervention activities, underwent symptomatic screening and demanded the continuity of the program, respectively), and improvement in SCD-related knowledge of the community and health workers (with more than 50% of net change in many of the knowledge-related outcomes). By developing screening and treatment models, this intervention model demonstrated the feasibility of SCD care at the PHC level in remote rural areas. This accessible approach allows the tribal population in India to routinely seek SCD care at their local PHCs, offering great convenience. Nevertheless, additional research employing rigorous methodology is required to fine-tune the model. National SCD program may adopt this model, specifically for community-level screening and management of SCD in remote and rural areas.
38174872	Sleep experiences of parents of children 18 years or younger with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study.STUDY OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 Pandemic has highlighted disparities in healthcare. Parents assist in sickle cell disease management in children. Understanding sleep in parents of children who are diagnosed with sickle cell disease is an important facet of disease management. Our objectives were to identify sleep characteristics of parents of children with sickle cell disease aged 18 years or younger during the COVID-19 pandemic, to investigate measures used by parents to achieve restful sleep, and to discuss how sleep may be improved in parents of children diagnosed with sickle cell disease. METHODS: This study conducted 14 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with parents of children diagnosed with sickle cell disease. A majority of the interviews (93%) was conducted at a hematology clinic. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze data. RESULTS: All parents reported that their child experienced pain because of sickle cell disease. Most parents (86.7%) reported that their child was diagnosed with HbSS. Four themes were identified: difficulty obtaining restful sleep during their child's sickle cell crisis, sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic, factors affecting sleep, and effects of sleep disturbance and deprivation on parental performance. CONCLUSIONS: This research has highlighted some of the difficulties experienced by parents of children who are diagnosed with sickle cell disease and allows for additional insight into the sleep experiences of parents as they attempt to manage their child's disease.
38249565	Differential clinical characteristics across traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Syndromes in patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Pain is a common, debilitating, and poorly understood complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). The need for clinical pain management of SCD is largely unmet and relies on opioids as the main therapeutic option, which leads to a decreased quality of life (QoL). According to the literature, acupuncture has shown certain therapeutic effects for pain management in SCD. However, these clinical studies lack the guidance of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Syndrome Differentiation principles for treatment. AIM: To characterize differences in clinical presentation amongst TCM diagnosed Syndromes in SCD patients. METHOD: Fifty-two patients with SCD and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in an ongoing trial of acupuncture. Each participant completed a series of questionnaires on pain, physical function, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression and QoL and underwent cold- and pressure-based quantitative sensory testing at baseline. Data on prescription opioid use over the 12 months prior to study enrollment was used to calculate mean daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Differences among the three TCM Syndromes were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey <i>post hoc</i> testing. Two-sample <i>t</i>-tests were used to compare SCD and HC groups. RESULTS: TCM diagnosis criteria classified SCD patients into one of three TCM Syndromes: (a) Equal; (b) Deficiency; and (c) Stagnation. The Stagnation group exhibited higher pain interference, physical dysfunction, nociplastic pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, MME consumption and lower sleep quality and QoL compared to the Equal group. Few differences were observed between HCs and the Equal SCD group across outcomes. Deficiency and Stagnation groups were differentiated with observed- and patient-reported clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that TCM diagnosed Syndromes in SCD can be differentially characterized using validated objective and patient-reported outcomes. Because characteristics of pain and co-morbidities in each SCD patient are unique, targeting specific TCM "Syndromes" may facilitate treatment effectiveness with a Syndrome-based personalized treatment plan that conforms to TCM principles. These findings lay the foundation for the development of tailored acupuncture interventions based on TCM Syndromes for managing pain in SCD. Larger samples are required to further refine and validate TCM diagnostic criteria for SCD.
38231083	Burden of employment loss and absenteeism in adults and caregivers of children with sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder affecting 100,000 people with estimated annual medical costs of $3 billion in the US; however, the economic impact on patients is not well described. We aimed to examine the indirect economic burden and to test the hypothesis that socioeconomic status and greater social vulnerability risks are associated with increased absenteeism and employment loss. We surveyed adults and caregivers of children with SCD at five US centers during 2014-2021. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations of employment loss and missed days of work with demographics and social determinants. Indirect costs were estimated by multiplying self-reported missed days of work and job loss by 2022 average wages by state of participating institution. Of the 244 participants, 10.3% reported employment loss in the last 5 years, and 17.5% reported missing 10 or more days of work. Adults had three times more employment loss compared to caregivers of children with SCD (OR 3.18, 95%CI 1.12-9.01) but fewer missed days of work (OR 0.24, 95%CI 0.11-0.0.51). Participants who did not live with a partner reported increased employment loss (OR 4.70, 95%CI 1.04-21.17) and more missed days of work (OR 4.58, 95%CI 1.04-20.15). The estimated annual indirect economic burden was $2,266,873 ($9,290 per participant). Adults with SCD and caregivers of children with SCD commonly report employment loss and missed days of work with important risk factors. The high indirect economic burden suggests that future economic evaluation of SCD should include SCD-related indirect economic burden.
38225633	Barriers and facilitators to a task-shifted stroke prevention program for children with sickle cell anemia in a community hospital: a qualitative study.BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at high risk for stroke. Protocols for stroke prevention including blood transfusions, screening for abnormal non-imaging transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements, and hydroxyurea therapy are difficult to implement in low-resource environments like Nigeria. This study aimed to examine the contextual factors around TCD screening in a community hospital in Nigeria using qualitative interviews and focus groups. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive qualitative study in a community hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria, using focus groups and interviews. Interview guides and analysis were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework and the Theory of Planned Behavior. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using an iterative deductive (CFIR)/Inductive (transcribed quotes) qualitative methodology. RESULTS: We conducted two focus groups and five interviews with health care workers (nurses and doctors) and hospital administrators, respectively. Themes identified key elements of the inner setting (clinic characteristics, resource availability, implementation climate, and tension for change), characteristics of individuals (normative, control, and behavioral beliefs), and the implementation process (engage, implement, and adopt), as well as factors that were influenced by external context, caregiver needs, team function, and intervention characteristics. Task shifting, which is already being used, was viewed by providers and administrators as a necessary strategy to implement TCD screening in a clinic environment that is overstressed and under-resourced, a community stressed by poverty, and a nation with an underperforming health system. CONCLUSION: Task shifting provides a viable option to improve health care by making more efficient use of already available human resources while rapidly expanding the human resource pool and building capacity for TCD screening of children with SCD that is more sustainable. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05434000.
38190311	An Updated Equitable Model of Readiness for Transition to Adult Care: Content Validation in Young People With Sickle Cell Disease.IMPORTANCE: Despite elevated health risks during young adulthood, many adolescents and young adults with serious health care needs face barriers during the transfer to an adult specialty practitioner, and health disparities may occur during the transition. OBJECTIVE: To validate the content of an updated Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) in a group of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their supports. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Health equity framework components were reviewed. Systems of power (eg, institutional and practitioner bias) and environments or networks (eg, peer or school support) were added as SMART-E preexisting factors, and health literacy was included within readiness factors. Adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 29 years with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners participated in this convergent, mixed-methods study within Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January and August 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Content validity was assessed through nominations of top 3 most important transition barriers prior to interviews and focus groups, ratings on importance of SMART-E factors (0-4 scale; ratings >2 support validity) after interviews and focus groups, nominations of 3 most important factors for transition and for health equity, and qualitative content analysis of interview transcripts. RESULTS: The study enrolled 10 pediatric adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 18.6 [2.9] years; 4 female and 6 male), 10 transferred adolescents and young adults (mean [SD] age, 22.9 [2.1] years; 8 female and 2 male), 9 caregivers (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [8.7] years; 5 female and 4 male), and 9 practitioners (mean [SD] age, 45.6 [10.5] years; 8 female and 1 male). Quantitative ratings supported the content validity of SMART-E and met established criteria for validity. Systems of power was the most endorsed transition barrier (14 of 38 participants) reported prior to interviews and focus groups. After the interview, participants endorsed all SMART-E factors as important for transition, with new factors systems of power and environments and networks rated at a mean (SD) 2.8 (1.23) and 3.1 (0.90), respectively, on a 0 to 4 scale of importance. The most important factors for transition and equity varied by participant group, with all factors being endorsed, supporting the comprehensiveness of SMART-E. Qualitative data corroborated quantitative findings, further supporting validity, and minor modifications were made to definitions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SMART-E obtained initial content validation with inclusion of health equity factors for adolescents and young adults with SCD, caregivers, and practitioners. The model should be evaluated in other populations of adolescents and young adults with chronic disease.
38200547	Experiences and outcomes of fertility testing in male adolescents with sickle cell disease.Adult males with sickle cell disease (SCD) may have abnormal semen parameters, raising the concern that SCD and/or treatments may impact fertility. Yet, studies that include adolescents are lacking. To determine if fertility testing is feasible in male adolescents with SCD, and to explore their experiences and outcomes of fertility testing, 33 adolescents who completed a web-based SCD reproductive health education program were offered a free semen analysis. Five (15%) obtained testing and each had abnormalities. Barriers to testing included lack of time and transportation and discomfort. Findings highlight the need for larger, longitudinal studies using innovative testing approaches.
38224366	Enhancing diagnostic precision for acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease: insights from dual-energy CT lung perfusion mapping.PURPOSE: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is secondary to occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature and a potentially life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Dual-energy CT (DECT) iodine perfusion map reconstructions can provide a method to visualize and quantify the extent of pulmonary microthrombi. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with sickle cell disease who underwent DECT CTPA with perfusion were retrospectively identified. The presence or absence of airspace opacities, segmental perfusion defects, and acute or chronic pulmonary emboli was noted. The number of segmental perfusion defects between patients with and without acute chest syndrome was compared. Sub-analyses were performed to investigate robustness. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 68 were clinically determined to not have ACS and 34 were determined to have ACS by clinical criteria. Of the patients with ACS, 82.4% were found to have perfusion defects with a median of 2 perfusion defects per patient. The presence of any or new perfusion defects was significantly associated with the diagnosis of ACS (P = 0.005 and < 0.001, respectively). Excluding patients with pulmonary embolism, 79% of patients with ACS had old or new perfusion defects, and the specificity for new perfusion defects was 87%, higher than consolidation/ground glass opacities (80%). CONCLUSION: DECT iodine map has the capability to depict microthrombi as perfusion defects. The presence of segmental perfusion defects on dual-energy CT maps was found to be associated with ACS with potential for improved specificity and reclassification.
38197728	Psychiatry referral and appointment attendance in a clinic for young adults with sickle cell disease.Mental illness is a common sickle cell disease (SCD) comorbidity. This observational study evaluated psychiatry appointment attendance among 137 young adults with SCD. In their first year of adult SCD care, 43% of subjects were referred to psychiatry. Referral was associated with chronic transfusion therapy. Twenty-four percent of subjects attended a psychiatry appointment; attendance was associated with the appointment being scheduled within 6 weeks of referral and no subject characteristics. Ninety-one percent of subjects attending psychiatry appointments had a psychiatric disorder. Among young adults with SCD, psychiatric morbidity is high. Psychiatric services are, therefore, essential for this patient population.

38244835	Manual red cell exchange (RBCXm) in acute sickle cell crisis: A cost effective modality in resource limited settings.This short communication highlights the significance of manual red blood cell exchange (RBCXm) procedure which is an emergency procedure for patients of sickle cell disease (SCD) in sickle cell crisis . To the best of our knowledge there is no standardised technique for performing RBCXm meanwhile, an automated method using an apheresis machine is either unavailable or is unaffordable. As a result, patients end up receiving top up red cell transfusions further associated with risk of iron overload, hyper viscosity and sometimes volume overload overshadowing the benefits of red cell exchange. Therefore, we developed a protocol for manual red cell exchange (RBCXm) and performed it in a patient with painful sickle cell crisis who had cost constraints for automated red cell exchange (RBCXa) procedure. RBCXm provided symptomatic relief to our patient with adequate sickle cell reduction. This RBCXm protocol may be useful in low income (LIC) and low middle income countries (LMIC) where patients have recurrent episodes of sickle cell crisis and there is unavailability or unaffordability for RBCXa using an apheresis equipment.
38228954	Exagamglogene Autotemcel: First Approval.Exagamglogene autotemcel (Casgevy ) is a genetically modified autologous CD34<sup>+</sup> cell enriched population. It contains human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells edited ex vivo by CRISPR/Cas9 (a DNA double strand break-inducing nuclease system) to differentiate into erythroid cells that produce high levels of foetal hemoglobin. Developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, exagamglogene autotemcel received its first approval on 16 November 2023 in the UK for the treatment of transfusion-dependent b-thalassemia (TDT) in patients aged   12 years for whom haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen matched related HSC donor is not available. On the same day, it was also approved in the UK for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) in patients aged   12 years with recurrent vasoocclusive crises (VOCs) who have the b<sup>S</sup>/b<sup>S</sup>, b<sup>S</sup>/b<sup>+</sup> or b<sup>S</sup>/b<sup>0</sup> genotype for whom HSC transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen matched related HSC donor is not available. Subsequently, exagamglogene autotemcel was approved in the USA on 8 December 2023 for the treatment of SCD in patients aged   12 years with recurrent VOCs and received a positive opinion in the EU on 14 December 2023 for the treatment of TDT and SCD. A regulatory assessment of exagamglogene autotemcel is currently underway for the treatment of TDT in the USA. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of exagamglogene autotemcel leading to these first approvals.
38239353	Role of MCP-1 as an inflammatory biomarker in nephropathy.The Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also referred to as chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), belongs to the extensive chemokine family and serves as a crucial mediator of innate immunity and tissue inflammation. It has a notable impact on inflammatory conditions affecting the kidneys. Upon binding to its receptor, MCP-1 can induce lymphocytes and NK cells' homing, migration, activation, differentiation, and development while promoting monocytes' and macrophages' infiltration, thereby facilitating kidney disease-related inflammation. As a biomarker for kidney disease, MCP-1 has made notable advancements in primary kidney diseases such as crescentic glomerulonephritis, chronic glomerulonephritis, primary glomerulopathy, idiopathic proteinuria glomerulopathy, acute kidney injury; secondary kidney diseases like diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis; hereditary kidney diseases including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and sickle cell kidney disease. MCP-1 not only predicts the occurrence, progression, prognosis of the disease but is also closely associated with the severity and stage of nephropathy. When renal tissue is stimulated or experiences significant damage, the expression of MCP-1 increases, demonstrating a direct correlation with the severity of renal injury.
38179555	A social profile of deaths related to sickle cell disease in India: a case for an ethical policy response.India accounts for 14.5 percent of the global SCD newborns, roughly over 42,000 a year, second to sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the availability of cheap diagnostic and treatment options, SCD remains a largely neglected disease within healthcare policy and practice. Epidemiological modeling based on small, often dated, regional studies (largely from sub-Saharan Africa) estimate that between 50 and 90 percent of affected children will/die before the age of 5 years. This premise, coupled with targets of reducing under 5 mortality (SDG 4), privileges public health interventions for screening and prevention of new births, undermining investments in long-term health and social care. This paper presents a retrospective, descriptive analysis of the socio-demographic profile of 447 patients diagnosed with sickle cell or sickle-beta thalassemia, who died following admission at a tertiary care entre in India. We used anonymized hospital records of 3,778 sickle cell patients, admitted in pediatric and adult/medical wards between January 2016 and February 2021. A majority of hospital deaths occurred in the second and third decades of life, following a hospital admission for a week. The overall mortality during 2016-2019 was 14% with little gender difference over time. Contrary to our expectations, the number of hospital deaths did not increase during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, between 2020 and 2021. The conclusion highlights the importance of longitudinal, socio-demo-graphic data on deaths as providing important insights for identifying ethical policy interventions focused on improving SCD outcomes over time, reducing inequities in access to care, and preventing what might be considered "excess" deaths.
38195958	EPAS1-mutated paragangliomas associated with haemoglobin disorders.We report a large series of 40 patients presenting EPAS1-mutated paraganglioma (PGL) in whom we investigated a cause underlying chronic hypoxia. Four patients suffered from hypoxaemic heart disease. In patients with available haemoglobin electrophoresis results, 59% presented with a haemoglobin disorder, including six with sickle cell disease, five with sickle cell trait and two with heterozygous haemoglobin C disease. Histological and transcriptomic characterization of EPAS1 tumours revealed increased angiogenesis and high similarities with pseudohypoxic PGLs caused by VHL gene mutations. Sickle haemoglobinopathy carriers could thus be at increased risk for developing EPAS1-PGLs, which should be taken into account in their management and surveillance.
38206762	Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: results of an international Delphi panel.Data to guide evidence-based management of pregnant people with sickle cell disease (SCD) is limited. This international Delphi panel aimed to identify consensus among multidisciplinary experts for SCD management during pregnancy. The two-round Delphi process used questionnaires exploring seven topics (antenatal care, hydroxyurea use, transfusion, prevention of complications, treatment of complications, delivery and follow-up, and bottlenecks and knowledge gaps) developed by a steering committee. Thirteen panelists (hematologists, physiologists, obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine and transfusion medicine physicians) from the US, the UK, Turkey and France completed the first survey; 12 panelists completed the second round. Anonymized responses were collected and summarized by a contract research organization (Akkodis Belgium). Consensus/strong consensus was predefined as 75%-90% (9-10/12)/>90% ( 11/12) of panelists agreeing or disagreeing on a response to a predefined clinical scenario or statement. In several areas of SCD management, consensus was achieved: experts recommended performing at least monthly multidisciplinary antenatal follow-up, administering prophylactic aspirin for preeclampsia prevention between gestational weeks 12-36, initiating prophylactic transfusion therapy in certain cases, or choosing automated red blood cell exchange over other transfusion methods in patients with iron overload or severe acute chest syndrome. No consensus was reached on several topics including the prophylactic aspirin dose, indications for starting infection prophylaxis, routine use of prophylactic transfusions, or use of prophylactic transfusions for preventing fetal complications. These recommendations could inform clinical care for pregnant SCD patients in the absence of large clinical trials involving this population; the identified knowledge gaps can orient future research.

38169476	Hydroxyurea reduces infections in children with sickle cell anemia in Uganda.After starting hydroxyurea treatment, Ugandan children with sickle cell anemia had 60% less severe or invasive infections, including malaria, bacteremia, respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis, than before starting hydroxyurea treatment (incidence rate ratio =0.40 [95% confidence interval], 0.29-0.54, P<0.001).
38215581	Characterization of a cohort of Angolan children with sickle cell anemia treated with hydroxyurea.BACKGROUND: Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a monogenic disease, although its severity and response to treatment are very heterogeneous. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterize a cohort of Angolan children with SCA and evaluate their response to hydroxyurea (HU) treatment and the potential side effects and toxicity. METHODS: The study enrolled 215 patients between 3 and 12 years old before and after the administration of HU, at a fix dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients started HU medication and 141 of them completed the 12-month treatment. After initiating HU treatment, the frequency of clinical events decreased (transfusions 53.4 %, hospitalizations 47.1 %). The response to HU medication varied among patients, with some experiencing an increase in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) of <5 %. The mean increase in HbF was 11.9 %, ranging from 1.8 % to 31 %. Responders to HU treatment were 57 %, inadequate responders 38.7 % and non-adherent 4.2 %. No clinical side effects related to HU were reported. Hematological toxicities were transient and reversible. Children naive to HU and with lower HbF reported higher number of hospitalizations caused by malaria infection. During HU treatment, the frequency of malaria episodes did not appear to be affected by HbF levels. CONCLUSIONS: the present study provided a valuable contribution to the understanding of the clinical and laboratory profiles of Angolan children with SCA. These findings support the evidence that the implementation of prophylactic measures and treatment with HU is associated with increased survival in children with SCA.
38193560	Early Cholecystectomy in Sickle Cell Patients with Uncomplicated Cholelithiasis is Associated with Better Outcomes.BACKGROUND: Up to 85% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) will develop gallstones by their third decade. Cholecystectomy is the most commonly performed procedure in these patients. Cholecystectomy is recommended for patients with SCD with symptomatic cholelithiasis and leads to lower morbidity. No contemporary large studies have evaluated this recommendation or associated clinical outcomes. This study evaluates clinical outcomes after cholecystectomy in patients with SCD and cholelithiasis with specific advanced clinical presentations. STUDY DESIGN: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for patients with SCD and gallbladder disease between years 2006-2015. Patients were divided into groups based on their disease presentation including: uncomplicated cholelithiasis, acute and chronic cholecystitis, and gallstone pancreatitis. Clinical outcomes associated with disease presentation were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, Chi-square, ANOVA, and logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 6,662 patients with SCD who presented with cholelithiasis. Median age was 20 [IQR 16-34] and 54% were female. Cholecystectomy was performed in 1,779 SCD patients with the most common indication being chronic cholecystitis (44%), followed by uncomplicated cholelithiasis (27%), acute cholecystitis (21%), and choledocholithiasis and/or gallstone pancreatitis (8%). On multivariable regression, advanced clinical presentation was the strongest predictor of peri-operative vaso-occlusive crisis, which was the most common complication. Patients undergoing cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis were at lower risk than those with acute cholecystitis (OR 2.37; [1.64-3.41]), chronic cholecystitis (OR 1.74; [1.26-2.4]), and choledocholithiais and/or gallstone pancreatitis (OR 2.24; [1.41-3.57]). CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-three percent patients with SCD have advanced clinical presentation at the time of their cholecystectomy. Following cholecystectomy, peri-operative vaso-occlusive events were significantly increased in patients with advanced clinical presentation. These data support screening abdominal ultrasounds and early cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis in patients with SCD.
38223313	Predictors of hospital readmissions in adult patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder, affecting primarily Black and Hispanic individuals. In 2016, 30-day readmissions incurred 95,445 extra days of hospitalization, $152 million in total hospitalization costs, and $609 million in total hospitalization charges. OBJECTIVES: 1) To estimate hospital readmissions within 30 days among patients with SCD in the State of California. 2) Identify the factors associated with readmission within 30 days for SCD patients in California. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of adult SCD patients hospitalized in California between 2005 and 2014. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to examine significant differences in patient characteristics and their association with hospital readmissions. RESULTS: From 2,728 individual index admissions, 70% presented with single admission, 10% experienced one readmission, and 20% experienced   two readmissions within 30 days. Significant predictors associated with zero vs. one readmission were male gender (OR=1.37, CI: 1.06-1.77), Black ethnicity (OR=3.27, CI: 1.71-6.27) and having Medicare coverage (OR=1.89, CI: 1.30-2.75). Lower likelihood of readmission was found in those with a Charlson Comorbidity index of three or more (OR=0.53, CI: 0.29-0.97). For zero vs.   two readmissions, significant predictors were male gender (OR=1.43, CI: 1.17-1.74), Black ethnicity (OR=6.90, CI: 3.41-13.97), Hispanic ethnicity (OR=2.33, CI: 1.05-5.17), Medicare coverage (OR=3.58, CI: 2.68-4.81) and Medi-Cal coverage (OR=1.70, CI: 1.31-2.20). Lower likelihood for having two or more readmissions were associated with individuals aged 65+ (OR=0.97, CI: 0.96-0.98) and those with self-payment status (OR=0.32, CI: 0.12-0.54). CONCLUSIONS: In California, male, Black, and Hispanic patients, as well as those covered by Medicare or Medi-Cal, were found to have an increased risk of hospital readmissions. Redirecting outpatient goals to address these patient populations and risk factors is crucial for reducing readmission rates.
38181478	Perspectives on anemia: Factors confounding understanding of past occurrence.OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews factors confounding the understanding of the past occurrence of anemia. Using the evidence gathered, a framework is presented of ways forward to enable greater confidence in diagnosing acquired anemia in paleopathology, facilitating insights into longer-term perspectives on this globally relevant condition. RESULTS: To date, porotic lesions have been central to paleopathological investigations of anemia. The fact that porotic bone lesions are omnipresent and have multiple causes but are likely to have a relatively low, age-related frequency in individuals with anemia, a condition that will have been common in past communities, is confounding. METHODS: Establishing frameworks that move away from porotic lesions is proposed to facilitate higher levels of more accurate anemia diagnoses in paleopathology. SIGNIFICANCE: Acceptance of the fundamental principle that anemia may be better considered as a condition requiring metric evaluation of bone structures, supplemented by careful consideration of lesions, will advance understanding of acquired anemia in past communities. Such an approach would provide a clear basis for further consideration of congenital conditions causing anemia, such as sickle-cell disease and thalassemia. LIMITATIONS: This paper simply opens the conversation on the better diagnosis of anemia in paleopathology; it starts the iterative process of achieving some consensus and progress on diagnosing anemia in paleopathology. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Engagement with ideas presented, sharing data and development of metric parameters will assist in identifying the effects of marrow hyperplasia on bone, enabling more robust work on the important topic of anemia.
38205646	Management of a patient with sickle cell disease and multiple red blood cell alloantibodies in preparation for a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only widely available curative option for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Alloimmunization in this population is frequent and can complicate transfusion management during the HSCT period. The case of a pediatric patient with severe SCD clinical phenotype, multiple alloantibodies (9), and hyperhemolysis syndrome who underwent haploidentical HSCT is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The patient was known for an anti-e, despite RHCE*01.01 allele, which predicts a C- c+ E- weak e+ phenotype. Donors matching the patient's extended phenotype were targeted for RHCE genotyping. RESULTS: Donors homozygotes or heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01 were selected for compatibility analyses and ranked based on strength of reactions. Discordance between zygosity and strength of reactions was observed, as the most compatible donors were heterozygotes for RHCE*01.01. In total, the patient received seven RBC units from two different donors during HSCT process without transfusion reaction or development of new alloantibodies. Six months post-HSCT, his hemoglobin level is stable at around 120 g/L and his chimerism is 100%. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the complexity of transfusion management during HSCT of alloimmunized patients with SCD. Collecting sufficient compatible units requires early involvement of transfusion medicine teams and close communication with the local blood provider. Genotyping of donors self-identifying as Black is useful for identifying compatible blood for those patients but has some limitations. HSCT for heavily alloimmunized patients is feasible and safe with early involvement of transfusion medicine specialists. Further research on the clinical impact of genotypic matching is needed.
38187369	Is cost of surgery and hospital length of stay increased for sickle cell disease patients undergoing total joint replacement surgeries? Systematic review and multivariate meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients undergo major joint replacement surgeries with significant improvement in quality of life. Previous literature have tried to explore differences in hospital charges and length of stay between patients with and without SCD. The aim of this meta-analysis is to find out if both outcomes are increased for patients with SCD patients compared to those without SCD. METHODS: Literature search was conducted and studies that compared hospital charges and length of stay between patients with and without sickle cell disease following major arthroplasties were retrieved. A multivariate meta-analysis was conducted using Random-Effect model with the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) using the Metafor Package in R and Rstudio. RESULTS: Four observational studies were found eligible for the study. The estimated average mean difference based on the random effect model for hospital charges was 7548.50 (95 % CI: 3779.65 to 11317.65) and for length of stay was 2.28 (95 % CI: 1.32 to 3.24) while the prediction interval for the true mean difference for both outcomes were -1810.56 to 16907.56 and -0.01 to 4.57 respectively. CONCLUSION: This present study showed that hospital charges and length of stay are increased for patients with SCD compared to patients without.
38178227	In vitro delayed response to dihydroartemisinin of malaria parasites infecting sickle cell erythocytes.BACKGROUND: Decreased efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been previously reported in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The main purpose of this study was to investigate the in vitro susceptibility of isolates to dihydro-artemisinin (DHA) to provide a hypothesis to explain this treatment failure. METHODS: Isolates were collected from patients attending health centres in Abidjan with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The haemoglobin type has been identified and in vitro drug sensitivity tests were conducted with the ring stage assay and maturation inhibition assay. RESULTS: 134 isolates were obtained. Parasitaemia and haemoglobin levels at inclusion were lower in patients with haemoglobin HbSS and HbSC than in patients with normal HbAA. After ex vivo RSA and drug inhibition assays, the lowest rate of parasitic growth was found with isolates from HbAS red cells. Conversely, a significantly higher survival rate of parasites ranging from 15 to 34% were observed in isolates from HbSS. Isolates with in vitro reduced DHA sensitivity correlate with lower RBC count and haematocrit and higher parasitaemia at inclusion compared to those with isolates with normal DHA sensitivity. However, this decrease of in vitro sensitivity to DHA was not associated with Kelch 13-Propeller gene polymorphism. CONCLUSION: This study highlights an in vitro decreased sensitivity to DHA, for isolates collected from HbSS patients, not related to the Pfkelch13 gene mutations. These results are in line with recent studies pointing out the role of the redox context in the efficacy of the drug. Indeed, SCD red cells harbour a highly different ionic and redox context in comparison with normal red cells. This study offers new insights into the understanding of artemisinin selective pressure on the malaria parasite in the context of haemoglobinopathies in Africa.
38181784	In vivo measurement of RBC survival in patients with sickle cell disease before or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Stable, mixed donor-recipient chimerism after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is sufficient for phenotypic disease reversal and results from differences in donor/recipient red blood cell (RBC) survival. Understanding variability and predictors of RBC survival among patients with SCD before and after HSCT is critical for gene therapy research which seeks to generate sufficient corrected hemoglobin to reduce polymerization thereby overcoming the red cell pathology of SCD. This study utilized biotin-labeling of RBCs to determine the lifespan of RBCs in patients with SCD compared to patients who have successfully undergone curative HSCT, participants with sickle cell trait (HbAS), and healthy (HbAA) donors (NCT04476277). Twenty participants were included in the analysis (N=6 SCD pre-HSCT, N=5 SCD post-HSCT, N=6 HbAS, N=3 HbAA). The average RBC lifespan was significantly shorter for participants with SCD pre-HSCT (64.1 days, range 35-91) compared to those with SCD post-HSCT (113.4 days, range 105-119), HbAS (126.0 days, range 119-147), and HbAA (123.7 days, range 91-147) (p<0.001). RBC lifespan correlated with various hematologic parameters, and strongly correlated with the average final fraction of sickled RBCs after deoxygenation (p<0.001). No adverse events were attributable to the use of biotin and related procedures. Biotin labeling of RBCs is a safe and feasible methodology to evaluate RBC survival in patients with SCD before and after HSCT. Understanding differences in RBC survival may ultimately guide gene therapy protocols to determine hemoglobin composition required to reverse the SCD phenotype as it relates directly to RBC survival.
38171495	Mental health, pain and likelihood of opioid misuse among adults with sickle cell disease.Depressive symptoms are prevalent in individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) and may exacerbate pain. This study examines whether higher depressive symptoms are associated with pain outcomes, pain catastrophizing, interference and potential opioid misuse in a large cohort of adults with SCD. The study utilized baseline data from the 'CaRISMA' trial, which involved 357 SCD adults with chronic pain. Baseline assessments included pain intensity, daily mood, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorders scale, PROMIS Pain Interference, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System and the Current Opioid Misuse Measure. Participants were categorized into 'high' or 'low' depression groups based on PHQ scores. Higher depressive symptoms were significantly associated with increased daily pain intensity, negative daily mood, higher pain interference and catastrophizing, poorer quality of life and a higher likelihood of opioid misuse (all p < 0.01). SCD patients with more severe depressive symptoms experienced poorer pain outcomes, lower quality of life and increased risk of opioid misuse. Longitudinal data from this trial will determine whether addressing depressive symptoms may potentially reduce pain frequency and severity in SCD.
38202591	New Synthetic Isoxazole Derivatives Acting as Potent Inducers of Fetal Hemoglobin in Erythroid Precursor Cells Isolated from b-Thalassemic Patients.Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is highly beneficial for patients carrying b-thalassemia, and novel HbF inducers are highly needed. Here, we describe a new class of promising HbF inducers characterized by an isoxazole chemical skeleton and obtained through modification of two natural molecules, geldanamycin and radicicol. After preliminary biological assays based on benzidine staining and RT-qPCR conducted on human erythroleukemic K562 cells, we employed erythroid precursors cells (ErPCs) isolated from b-thalassemic patients. ErPCs weretreated with appropriate concentrations of isoxazole derivatives. The accumulation of globin mRNAs was studied by RT-qPCR, and hemoglobin production by HPLC. We demonstrated the high efficacy of isozaxoles in inducing HbF. Most of these derivatives displayed an activity similar to that observed using known HbF inducers, such as hydroxyurea (HU) or rapamycin; some of the analyzed compounds were able to induce HbF with more efficiency than HU. All the compounds were active in reducing the excess of free a-globin in treated ErPCs. All the compounds displayed a lack of genotoxicity. These novel isoxazoles deserve further pre-clinical study aimed at verifying whether they are suitable for the development of therapeutic protocols for b-thalassemia.
38204310	Newborn screening for sickle cell anemia in Antalya, Turkiye.BACKGROUND: In a screening study conducted on adults, the prevalence of sickle cell traits in Antalya was found to be 0.24%. Since no screening studies have been conducted in the neonatal period in our region, the exact incidence has not been determined. In this study, we aim to report our experience of neonatal screening for sickle cell disease in Antalya, Turkiye. METHODS: During a 14-month period, 2562 heel prick blood samples, taken on filter paper from Akdeniz University Hospital, Antalya Education and Research Hospital and Antalya Ataturk State Hospital and four other healthcare centers, were studied using the high pressure liquid chromatography method. Blood samples were studied using the `Sickle Cell Short Program` test method on a Bio Rad Variant device. RESULTS: In the study, no patients with sickle cell disease were identified. Four newborns who were sickle cell carriers (0.15%) and two newborns who were Hemoglobin D carriers (0.08 %), were found. CONCLUSION: Considering the efficiency and cost calculations made as a result of the data obtained from our study, it was concluded that sickle cell screening would not be effective in newborns. It seems more effective and economical to screen the children of parents, who are found to be at risk for Hemoglobin S carriage as a result of premarital tests.
38237718	Metabolic Regulation of Erythrocyte Development and Disorders.The formation of new red blood cells (erythropoiesis) has served as a paradigm for understanding cellular differentiation and developmental control of gene expression. The metabolic regulation of this complex, coordinated process remains poorly understood. Each step of erythropoiesis, including lineage specification of hematopoietic stem cells, proliferation, differentiation, and terminal maturation into highly specialized oxygen-carrying cells, has unique metabolic requirements. Developing erythrocytes in mammals are also characterized by unique metabolic events such as loss of mitochondria with switch to glycolysis, ejection of nucleus and organelles, high level heme and hemoglobin synthesis, and antioxidant requirement to protect hemoglobin molecules. Genetic defects in metabolic enzymes including pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cause common erythrocyte disorders, whereas other inherited disorders such as sickle cell disease and b-thalassemia display metabolic abnormalities associated with disease pathophysiology. Here we describe recent discoveries on the metabolic control of red blood cell formation and function, highlight emerging concepts in understanding the erythroid metabolome, and discuss potential therapeutic benefits of targeting metabolism for red cell disorders.
38168584	Evaluating sheep hemoglobins with MD simulations as an animal model for sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects millions worldwide, yet there are few therapeutic options. To develop effective treatments, preclinical models that recapitulate human physiology and SCD pathophysiology are needed. SCD arises from a single Glu-to-Val substitution at position 6 in the b subunit of hemoglobin (Hb), promoting Hb polymerization and subsequent disease. Sheep share important physiological and developmental characteristics with humans, including the same developmental pattern of fetal to adult Hb switching. Herein, we investigated whether introducing the SCD mutation into the sheep b-globin locus would recapitulate SCD's complex pathophysiology by generating high quality SWISS-MODEL sheep Hb structures and performing MD simulations of normal/sickle human (huHbA/huHbS) and sheep (shHbB/shHbS) Hb, establishing how accurately shHbS mimics huHbS behavior. shHbS, like huHbS, remained stable with low RMSD, while huHbA and shHbB had higher and fluctuating RMSD. shHbB and shHbS also behaved identically to huHbA and huHbS with respect to b<sub>2</sub>-Glu6 and b<sub>1</sub>-Asp73 (b<sub>1</sub>-Asn72 in sheep) solvent interactions. These data demonstrate that introducing the single SCD-causing Glu-to-Val substitution into sheep b-globin causes alterations consistent with the Hb polymerization that drives RBC sickling, supporting the development of a SCD sheep model to pave the way for alternative cures for this debilitating, globally impactful disease.
38216623	Crowdsourced human-based computational approach for tagging peripheral blood smear sample images from Sickle Cell Disease patients using non-expert users.In this paper, we present a human-based computation approach for the analysis of peripheral blood smear (PBS) images images in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). We used the Mechanical Turk microtask market to crowdsource the labeling of PBS images. We then use the expert-tagged erythrocytesIDB dataset to assess the accuracy and reliability of our proposal. Our results showed that when a robust consensus is achieved among the Mechanical Turk workers, probability of error is very low, based on comparison with expert analysis. This suggests that our proposed approach can be used to annotate datasets of PBS images, which can then be used to train automated methods for the diagnosis of SCD. In future work, we plan to explore the potential integration of our findings with outcomes obtained through automated methodologies. This could lead to the development of more accurate and reliable methods for the diagnosis of SCD.
38222852	Clinical and Laboratory Correlates of QTc Duration in Adult and Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease, a common genetic disorder in African Americans, manifests an increased risk of sudden death, the basis of which is incompletely understood. Prolongation of heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval on the electrocardiogram, a standard clinical measure of cardiac repolarization, may contribute to sudden death by predisposing to <i>torsades de pointes</i> ventricular tachycardia. METHODS: We established a cohort study of 293 adult and 121 pediatric sickle cell disease patients drawn from the same geographic region as the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohort, in which significant correlates of QT duration have been characterized and quantitatively modeled. Herein, we establish clinical and laboratory correlates of QTc duration in our cohort using stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis. We then compared our adult sickle cell disease data to effect-size predictions from the published JHS statistical model of QT interval duration. RESULTS: In adult sickle cell disease, gender, diuretic use, QRS duration, serum ALT levels, anion gap, and diastolic blood pressure show positive correlation; hemoglobin levels show inverse correlation; in pediatric sickle cell disease, age, hemoglobin levels, and serum bicarbonate and creatinine levels show inverse correlation. The mean QTc in our adult sickle cell disease cohort is 7.8 milliseconds longer than in the JHS cohort, even though the JHS statistical model predicts that the mean QTc in our cohort should be > 11 milliseconds shorter than in the much older JHS cohort, a differential of > 18 milliseconds. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell disease patients have substantial QTc prolongation relative to their age, driven by factors some overlapping, in adult and pediatric sickle cell disease, and distinct from those that have been defined in the general African American community.
38237001	Perspectives of Adolescents and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease and Clinicians on Improving Transition Readiness With a Video Game Intervention.We aimed to learn the experiences of clinicians and adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (AYA-SCD) with managing their disease at home and making medical decisions as they transition from pediatric to adult care, and their perceptions of a video game intervention to positively impact these skills. We conducted individual, semistructured interviews with patients (AYA-SCD ages 15 to 26 years) and clinicians who provide care to AYA-SCD at an urban, quaternary-care hospital. Interviews elicited patients' and clinicians' experiences with AYA-SCD, barriers and facilitators to successful home management, and their perspectives on shared decision-making and a video game intervention. To identify themes, we conducted an inductive analysis until data saturation was reached. Participants (16 patients and 21 clinicians) identified 4 main themes: (1) self-efficacy as a critical skill for a successful transition from pediatric to adult care, (2) the importance of patient engagement in making medical decisions, (3) multilevel determinants of optimal self-efficacy and patient engagement, and (4) support for a video game intervention which, by targeting potential determinants of AYA-SCD achieving optimal self-efficacy and engagement in decision-making, may improve these important skills.
38182466	Clinical, laboratory, and molecular characteristics of a cohort of children with hemoglobinopathy S/beta-thalassemia.INTRODUCTION: Hemoglobinopathy Sb-thalassemia (HbSb-thal) has a wide range of clinical and laboratory severity. There is limited information on the natural history of HbSb-thal and its modulating factors. We described the molecular, hematological, and clinical characteristics of a cohort of children with HbSb-thal and estimated its incidence in Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: Laboratory and clinical data were retrieved from medical records. Molecular analysis was performed by HBB gene sequencing, PCR-RFLP, gap-PCR, and MLPA. RESULTS: Eighty-nine children were included in the study. Fourteen alleles of b-thal mutations were identified. The incidence of HbSb-thal in the state was 1 per 22,250 newborns. The most common b<sup>S</sup>-haplotypes were CAR and Benin. The most frequent b<sup>thal</sup>-haplotypes were V, II, and I. Coexistence of 3.7 kb HBA1/HBA2 deletion was present in 21.3 % of children. b-thalassemia mutations were associated with several clinical and laboratory features. In general, the incidence of clinical events per 100 patient-years was similar for children with HbSb<sup>0</sup>-thal, IVS-I-5 G>A, and IVS-I-110 G>A. Children with HbSb<sup>+</sup>-intermediate phenotypes had a more severe laboratory and clinical profile when compared with those with HbSb<sup>+</sup>-mild ones. b<sup>S</sup>-haplotypes and a-thalassemia did not meaningfully influence the phenotype of children with HbSb-thal. CONCLUSION: The early identification of b-thalassemia alleles may help the clinical management of these children.
38173541	Abnormal Neurologic Findings in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Without a History of Major Neurologic Events.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are prone to symptomatic neurologic complications. Previous studies reported accrual of neural injury starting at early age, even without having symptomatic neurologic events. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of abnormal neurologic findings in patients with SCD with no history of major symptomatic neurologic events. METHODS: Our study extracted patients diagnosed with SCD from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease. Patients who underwent a neurologic evaluation were included in our analysis. Patients with previous documented major symptomatic neurologic events were excluded. We compared patients with SCD with abnormal neurologic findings with those without in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters using multivariate binary logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 3,573 patients with SCD were included (median age = 11 [IQR = 19] years, male = 1719 [48.1%]). 519 (14.5%) patients had at least one abnormal neurologic finding. The most common findings in descending order were abnormal reflexes, gait abnormalities, cerebellar dysfunction, language deficits, nystagmus, abnormal muscle tone and strength, Romberg sign, Horner syndrome, and intellectual impairment. History of eye disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.63-4.68) and history of osteomyelitis (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.34-4.84) were the strongest predictors of abnormal neurologic findings, followed by smoking (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.08-2.33), aseptic necrosis (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.33), hand-foot syndrome (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.04-2.12), and male sex (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-2.02). DISCUSSION: Neurologic deficits are relatively common in patients with SCD, even without documented major neurologic insults. They range from peripheral and ophthalmic deficits to central and cognitive disabilities. Patients with SCD should have early regular neurologic evaluations and risk factor modification, particularly actively promoting smoking cessation.
38215146	Understanding apoptosis in sickle cell anemia patients: Mechanisms and implications.Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells. While much research has focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of SCA, recent attention has turned to the role of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the disease progression. This review aims to elucidate the intricate mechanisms of apoptosis in SCA patients and explore its implications in disease severity, complications, and potential therapeutic interventions. Different research search engines such as PubMed central, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia Edu, etc were utilized in writing this paper. Apoptosis, a highly regulated cellular process, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis by eliminating damaged or dysfunctional cells. In SCA, the imbalance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals contributes to increased erythrocyte apoptosis, exacerbating anemia and vaso-occlusive crises. Various factors, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and altered cell signaling pathways, converge to modulate the apoptotic response in SCA. Furthermore, the interaction between apoptotic cells and the vascular endothelium contributes to endothelial dysfunction, promoting the pathogenesis of vasculopathy and organ damage seen in SCA patients. In conclusion, unraveling the complexities of apoptosis in SCA provides valuable insights into the disease pathophysiology and offers novel avenues for therapeutic interventions.
38241664	Acute Hematogenous Osteomyelitis of the Pelvis in Children.BACKGROUND: Pelvic involvement has been reported in 3%-14% of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) cases in children. One guideline suggests need for a longer antibiotic course in pelvic AHO, however, recent data are lacking. We describe the clinical course of children with pelvic AHO and compare it to nonpelvic AHO. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of AHO admitted to Texas Children's Hospital from January 2012 to December 2020 was conducted. Patients 6 months-<19 years old and with  14 days of symptoms at admission were eligible. Patients with sickle cell disease or immunocompromised were excluded. Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed for differences between continuous variables and Fisher exact for categorical variables using STATA 17. RESULTS: We compared 104 cases of pelvic AHO to 314 cases of nonpelvic AHO. Patients had similar microbiology, length of stay and length of antibiotic therapy. Patients with pelvic AHO had pyomyositis identified by magnetic resonance imaging more often (28.8 vs. 9.4%, P < 0.001) and bone abscess less often (22.1 vs. 46.5%, P < 0.001). Rates of chronic complications were comparable between patients with pelvic AHO and nonpelvic AHO (8.4% vs. 15.1%, P = 0.1). Nineteen patients (18.3%) with pelvic AHO received  30 antibiotic days without complications, but they had less need for intensive care or bone abscesses than patients treated longer. CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic AHO in children may be more frequent than previously reported but is not associated with more complications. Four weeks of therapy may be sufficient in selected patients. Prospective studies to compare outcomes with different lengths of therapy are needed.
38190149	Stepping Systematically Forward Toward Health Equity in Sickle Cell Disease.
38171625	THromboprophylaxis In Sickle Cell Disease with central venous catheters (THIS): an internal pilot randomised controlled trial protocol.INTRODUCTION: Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) and central venous catheters (CVC) are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Minimal data exist regarding the use of anticoagulation as thromboprophylaxis of VTE in this demographic, and as a result, clinical equipoise exists. Prophylactic dose rivaroxaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, is efficacious and safe as thromboprophylaxis in other demographics, and may be an optimal agent in SCD with CVC. Prior to conducting a full clinical trial to assess rivaroxaban as thromboprophylaxis in SCD with CVC, a pilot study is needed to gauge its feasibility. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: THromboprophylaxis In Sickle Cell Disease pilot trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing if it is feasible and safe to conduct an adequately powered RCT comparing rivaroxaban to matching placebo as thromboprophylaxis in those with SCD and CVC. Fifty adult patients with SCD and CVC will be randomised to receive either rivaroxaban 10 mg daily or matching placebo for the duration of the CVC in situ for up to 1 year. After randomisation, follow-up visits will occur every 3 months. The primary outcomes pertain to the feasibility of a full trial and include numbers of eligible and recruited participants. Exploratory outcomes include overall incidence of VTE and bleeding complications, as well as quality of life. If the full trial is feasible, blinding will be maintained and patients in the pilot study will be included in the full trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was initially approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (REB) in Toronto, Canada. All sites will obtain approval from their respective REB prior to commencement of study activities. Study results will be disseminated through presentations at medical conferences and peer-reviewed publications. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05033314.
38188902	An Unusual Case of Hyperhemolysis Syndrome and Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction due to Anti-Jk(a) and Anti-P1 Antibodies.BACKGROUND: Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HS) is a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction that can cause hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to drop below pretransfusion levels, leading to severe anemia. HS most commonly occurs in patients with a pre-existing hemoglobinopathy such as sickle cell disease (SCD) or beta-thalassemia. METHODS: We report a case of HS, occurring in the absence of hemoglobinopathy, making the diagnosis challenging. The patient reported was also affected by a CIC-rearranged sarcoma. As part of the workup, the patient received a bone marrow biopsy for suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. RESULTS: This provided a rare biopsy specimen to correlate reticulocytopenia with marked erythroid hyperplasia in the marrow, supporting the hypothesis of reticulocyte destruction as a contributing cause of anemia in these patients. This patient had demonstrable alloantibodies to the Jk(a) and P1 antigens as potential triggers for HS. CONCLUSIONS: It is vital that a diagnosis of HS be correctly made in these patients with severe anemia, as blood transfusions generally lead to worsening of their conditions.
38167227	Successful Conservative Therapy for Infected Penile Implants: A Case Series.BACKGROUND Traditionally, penile implant infections have been treated by removal followed by immediate or delayed replacement. The use of antibiotics in conservative therapy has recently attracted attention. CASE REPORT We report our experience with 4 cases of infected penile implants managed conservatively. Case 1 was a 41-year-old with sickle cell anemia who presented with low-grade fever and purulent discharge that started 1 month postoperatively and lasted for 3 weeks. He had left graft after fibrotic tissue excision with 14-mm collection in the left corpus cavernosum. He was managed with IV pipracillin/tazobactam and vancomycin for 13 days. Follow-up after 23 weeks showed complete wound healing. Case 2 was a 62-year-old with diabetes who had purulent discharge that started 41 days postoperatively and lasted for 1 week. He received 5 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the wound. Case 3 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 30 days postoperatively with fever, purulent discharge for 5 days. He received a total of 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up 3 weeks after discharge showed complete wound healing. Case 4 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 1 month postoperatively with fever and pus discharge for 1 week. He completed 10 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 1 week showed marked wound healing. CONCLUSIONS Choosing patients with early superficial infected penile prosthesis for conservative management should be tailored to selected patients who does not have leukocytosis, signs of sepsis, high-grade fever, or an exposed device.

38189099	Hypercoagulability in Sickle Cell Disease: A Thrombo-Inflammatory Mechanism.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin S. Patients with SCD suffer from frequent episodes of anemia, chronic hemolysis, pain crisis, and vaso-occlusion. Additionally, SCD is associated with diverse and serious clinical complications, including thrombosis, which can lead to organ failure, increased morbidity, and eventually, mortality. SCD is known to be a hypercoagulable condition, and the cause of hypercoagulability is multifactorial, with the molecular basis of hemoglobin S being the main driver. The presence of hemoglobin S induces sickling of the RBCs and their subsequent hemolysis, as well as oxidative stress. Both of these processes can alter the hemostatic system, through the activation of platelets, coagulation system, and fibrinolysis, as well as depletion of coagulation inhibitors. These changes can also induce the formation of microvesicles and expression of tissue factor, leading to activation of WBCs, endothelial cell damage, and inflammatory response. Understanding the various factors that drive hypercoagulability as a thrombo-inflammatory mechanism in SCD can help provide explanations for the pathogenesis and other complications of the disease.
