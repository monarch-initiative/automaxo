OBJECTIVES: To delineate the prevalence of cardiac findings in hypermobile and classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and provide longitudinal analysis of aortic root growth. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was conducted, and data were analyzed for cross-sectional prevalence of aortic dilation and valvular anomalies. The clinical implications of aortic root growth were determined by assessment of progression of aortic root measurements over time and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Patients whose first echocardiogram was obtained in late childhood or adulthood were less likely to have aortic dilation (P < .002) than those whose first echocardiogram was obtained in early childhood. Longitudinally, seven individuals had dilated aortas before age 14, and only one individual continued to show dilation after age 14 (P = .0143). No patient with a normal aortic root in childhood had development of dilation in adulthood. Fifteen of the 252 patients (6.0%) had mitral valve prolapse (MVP), although only one patient (0.4%) had MVP that was mild to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Although aortic root size and MVP are increased in patients with these types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, they tend to be of little clinical consequence. Echocardiography may still be warranted as part of cardiovascular assessment, but decreased frequency of screening is recommended especially in symptom-free adults.",

Collagen V is a quantitatively minor component of collagen I fibrils and the defective product of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). To provide new insights into its embryonic function, a continuous evaluation of the expression pattern of proalpha1(V), a chain common to all collagen V molecular forms, was performed by in situ hybridization of developing mouse from 7.5 days after conception (dpc) to birth. Proalpha1(V) transcripts were first detected at 8.5 dpc, signals being considerably augmented at 16.5 dpc and declining at birth. Hybridization signals were, at first, exclusively detected in the dorsal aorta wall, heart, and adnexa. At 10.5 dpc, col5a1 expression was found in the heart, dorsal aorta wall, branchial arches, mesonephrotic tubules, and intestinal mesenchyme and coincided with proalpha1(I) developmental expression. Later stages exhibited an intense signal in more restricted regions, notably the skin, the bones and vertebral column, the cornea, the tendons and ligaments, the peritoneal membranes, the umbilical cord, and the salivary gland. The data revealed the important contribution of collagen V to the development of functional connective tissues. Proalpha1(V) signals were exclusively detected in the flattened cells of the surface ectoderm at 10.5 dpc. By 12.5 dpc, when cells had become cuboidal, the signal switched to the dermal fibroblasts. Thus, type V collagen appears to contribute to epidermis differentiation. Our data also suggest that collagen V participates in bone formation and/or mineralization and in the renewal of stromal cells in the cornea. The results underscore the role of collagen V in developing embryos and provide important clues for analyzing the phenotype of mouse models for EDS.",

PURPOSE: Type V collagen forms heterotypic fibrils with type I collagen and accounts for 10% to 20% of corneal collagen. The purpose of this study was to define the ocular phenotype resulting from mutations in the type V collagen genes COL5A1 and COL5A2 and to study the pathogenesis of anomalies in a Col5a1-deficient mouse. METHODS: Seven patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) due to COL5A1 haploinsufficiency and one with an exon-skipping mutation in COL5A2 underwent an ocular examination, corneal topography, pachymetry, and specular microscopy. A Col5a1-haploinsufficient mouse model of classic EDS was used for biochemical and immunochemical analyses of corneas. Light and electron microscopy were used to quantify stromal thickness, fibril density, fibril structure, and diameter. RESULTS: Five males and three females (mean age, 26 +/- 13.57 years; range, 11-52) were studied. All patients had \"floppy eyelids.\" The corneas of all eyes were thinner (mean corneal thickness: 435.75 +/- 12.51 microm) when compared with control corneas (568.89 +/- 28.46 microm; P < 0.0001). In the Col5a1+/- mouse cornea, type V collagen content was reduced by approximately 49%, and stromal thickness was reduced by approximately 26%. Total collagen deposition in Col5a1(+/-) corneas also was reduced. Collagen fibril diameters were increased, but fibril density was decreased throughout the stroma at all developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: In the eye, COL5A1 and COL5A2 mutations manifest as abnormally thin and steep corneas with floppy eyelids. Mechanisms involved in producing the latter anomalies probably involve altered regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis due to abnormalities in heterotypic type I/V collagen interactions similar to those observed in the Col5a1+/- mouse cornea.",

PURPOSE: Type V collagen forms heterotypic fibrils with type I collagen and accounts for 10% to 20% of corneal collagen. The purpose of this study was to define the ocular phenotype resulting from mutations in the type V collagen genes COL5A1 and COL5A2 and to study the pathogenesis of anomalies in a Col5a1-deficient mouse. METHODS: Seven patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) due to COL5A1 haploinsufficiency and one with an exon-skipping mutation in COL5A2 underwent an ocular examination, corneal topography, pachymetry, and specular microscopy. A Col5a1-haploinsufficient mouse model of classic EDS was used for biochemical and immunochemical analyses of corneas. Light and electron microscopy were used to quantify stromal thickness, fibril density, fibril structure, and diameter. RESULTS: Five males and three females (mean age, 26 +/- 13.57 years; range, 11-52) were studied. All patients had \"floppy eyelids.\" The corneas of all eyes were thinner (mean corneal thickness: 435.75 +/- 12.51 microm) when compared with control corneas (568.89 +/- 28.46 microm; P < 0.0001). In the Col5a1+/- mouse cornea, type V collagen content was reduced by approximately 49%, and stromal thickness was reduced by approximately 26%. Total collagen deposition in Col5a1(+/-) corneas also was reduced. Collagen fibril diameters were increased, but fibril density was decreased throughout the stroma at all developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: In the eye, COL5A1 and COL5A2 mutations manifest as abnormally thin and steep corneas with floppy eyelids. Mechanisms involved in producing the latter anomalies probably involve altered regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis due to abnormalities in heterotypic type I/V collagen interactions similar to those observed in the Col5a1+/- mouse cornea.",

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the frequency and utility of echocardiographic examination in patients with all forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and sought to identify clinical variables associated with an abnormal echocardiogram. DESIGN/SETTING: This was a retrospective study of all patients carrying a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome of any type who were evaluated by a pediatrician or pediatric subspecialist at a single tertiary medical center with an affiliated children's hospital during the period January 2013 to December 2018. PATIENTS: Chart review was performed on all patients carrying a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in the electronic medical record. OUTCOME MEASURES: Data from genetics examination, cardiovascular examination where applicable, genetic test results when available, and echocardiography were recorded. RESULTS: Of 262 patients identified, echocardiography and cardiac evaluation were common occurring in 90% and 50% of patients with any form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Cardiovascular complications occurred in 50% of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome but echocardiography was normal in all. Aortic dilation was common in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome but absent in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve occurred at the same incidence as the general population. Cardiac symptoms were present in 12% but did not correlate with abnormal cardiac structure. Presentation with symptoms of musculoskeletal pain was inversely related to the presence of cardiac pathology. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the absence of cardiac pathology in patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, routine cardiac evaluation and echocardiography are not required for patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.",

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the frequency and utility of echocardiographic examination in patients with all forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and sought to identify clinical variables associated with an abnormal echocardiogram. DESIGN/SETTING: This was a retrospective study of all patients carrying a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome of any type who were evaluated by a pediatrician or pediatric subspecialist at a single tertiary medical center with an affiliated children's hospital during the period January 2013 to December 2018. PATIENTS: Chart review was performed on all patients carrying a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in the electronic medical record. OUTCOME MEASURES: Data from genetics examination, cardiovascular examination where applicable, genetic test results when available, and echocardiography were recorded. RESULTS: Of 262 patients identified, echocardiography and cardiac evaluation were common occurring in 90% and 50% of patients with any form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Cardiovascular complications occurred in 50% of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome but echocardiography was normal in all. Aortic dilation was common in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome but absent in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve occurred at the same incidence as the general population. Cardiac symptoms were present in 12% but did not correlate with abnormal cardiac structure. Presentation with symptoms of musculoskeletal pain was inversely related to the presence of cardiac pathology. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the absence of cardiac pathology in patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, routine cardiac evaluation and echocardiography are not required for patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.",

Collagen V (Col5) is a quantitatively minor component of collagen fibrils comprising tendon, however, plays a crucial role in regulation of development and dynamic healing processes. Clinically, patients with COL5a1 haploinsufficiency, known as classic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (cEDS), present with hyperextensible skin, joint instability and laxity, with the females more likely to be affected. Previous studies in Col5-deficient mice indicated that reduced Col5a1 expression leads to a reduction in stiffness, fibril deposition and altered fibril structure. Additionally, Col5-deficient male tendons demonstrated altered healing compared to wild-type tendons, however female mice have not yet been studied utilizing this model. Along with clinical differences between sexes in cEDS patient populations, differences in hormone physiology may be a factor influencing tendon health. Therefore, the objective of this study was to utilize a Col5a1+/- female mouse model, to determine the effect of Col5 on tendon cell morphology, cell density, tissue composition, and mechanical properties throughout healing. We hypothesized that reduction in Col5 expression would result in an abnormal wound matrix post-injury, resulting in reduced mechanical properties compared to normal tendons. Following patellar tendon surgery, mice were euthanized at 1, 3, and 6-weeks post-injury. Col5-deficient tendons demonstrated altered and decreased healing compared to WT tendons. The lack of resolution in cellularity by 6-weeks post-injury in Col5-deficient tendons influenced the decreased mechanical properties. Stiffness did not increase post-injury in Col5-deficient mice, and collagen fiber realignment was delayed during mechanical loading.

Collagen V mutations underlie classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and joint hypermobility is an important clinical manifestation. We define the function of collagen V in tendons and ligaments, as well as the role of alterations in collagen V expression in the pathobiology in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A conditional Col5a1(flox/flox) mouse model was bred with Scleraxis-Cre mice to create a targeted tendon and ligament Col5a1-null mouse model, Col5a1(Deltaten/Deltaten). Targeting was specific, resulting in collagen V-null tendons and ligaments. Col5a1(Deltaten/Deltaten) mice demonstrated decreased body size, grip weakness, abnormal gait, joint laxity, and early-onset osteoarthritis. These gross changes were associated with abnormal fiber organization, as well as altered collagen fibril structure with increased fibril diameters and decreased fibril number that was more severe in a major joint stabilizing ligament, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), than in the flexor digitorum longus tendon. The ACL also had a higher collagen V content than did the flexor digitorum longus tendon. The collagen V-null ACL and flexor digitorum longus tendon both had significant alterations in mechanical properties, with ACL exhibiting more severe changes. The data demonstrate critical differential regulatory roles for collagen V in tendon and ligament structure and function and suggest that collagen V regulatory dysfunction is associated with an abnormal joint phenotype, similar to the hypermobility phenotype in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.",

PURPOSE: To analyze in vivo corneal morphology and ultrastructural features in patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). METHODS: Fifty patients with classic EDS and 50 age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. A clinical evaluation was made with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and a complete ophthalmic examination, including assessment of the best-corrected visual acuity and refraction, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, tear break-up time, intraocular pressure, Schirmer test without topical anesthesia, and corneal diameter. Scheimpflug camera topography and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) were used to investigate corneal morphology and corneal ultrastructural features respectively. RESULTS: Classic EDS patients, compared to controls, had thinner and steeper corneas (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively; independent samples t-test). IVCM showed thinner stromas, lower keratocyte densities (P < 0.001), increased applanation-related stromal folds (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test), and increased endothelial hyperreflective dots (P < 0.05) in these patients. The study group also had increased symptoms (OSDI score: P < 0.01, independent samples t-test) and signs (tear break-up time and Schirmer test: P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) of tear film dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with classic EDS had macro- and microstructural changes of the cornea, which is a target tissue of the disease. These findings should be considered to optimize clinical management of these patients and to evaluate the opportunity of adding ocular findings to the classic EDS diagnostic criteria.",

PURPOSE: To analyze in vivo corneal morphology and ultrastructural features in patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). METHODS: Fifty patients with classic EDS and 50 age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. A clinical evaluation was made with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and a complete ophthalmic examination, including assessment of the best-corrected visual acuity and refraction, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, tear break-up time, intraocular pressure, Schirmer test without topical anesthesia, and corneal diameter. Scheimpflug camera topography and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) were used to investigate corneal morphology and corneal ultrastructural features respectively. RESULTS: Classic EDS patients, compared to controls, had thinner and steeper corneas (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively; independent samples t-test). IVCM showed thinner stromas, lower keratocyte densities (P < 0.001), increased applanation-related stromal folds (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test), and increased endothelial hyperreflective dots (P < 0.05) in these patients. The study group also had increased symptoms (OSDI score: P < 0.01, independent samples t-test) and signs (tear break-up time and Schirmer test: P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) of tear film dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with classic EDS had macro- and microstructural changes of the cornea, which is a target tissue of the disease. These findings should be considered to optimize clinical management of these patients and to evaluate the opportunity of adding ocular findings to the classic EDS diagnostic criteria.",

A clinical evaluation was made with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and a complete ophthalmic examination, including assessment of the best-corrected visual acuity and refraction, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, tear break-up time, intraocular pressure, Schirmer test without topical anesthesia, and corneal diameter. Scheimpflug camera topography and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) were used to investigate corneal morphology and corneal ultrastructural features respectively. RESULTS: Classic EDS patients, compared to controls, had thinner and steeper corneas (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively; independent samples t-test). IVCM showed thinner stromas, lower keratocyte densities (P < 0.001), increased applanation-related stromal folds (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test), and increased endothelial hyperreflective dots (P < 0.05) in these patients. The study group also had increased symptoms (OSDI score: P < 0.01, independent samples t-test) and signs (tear break-up time and Schirmer test: P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) of tear film dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with classic EDS had macro- and microstructural changes of the cornea, which is a target tissue of the disease. These findings should be considered to optimize clinical management of these patients and to evaluate the opportunity of adding ocular findings to the classic EDS diagnostic criteria.",
