input_text: Spontaneous ruptured dissection of the right common iliac artery in a
  patient with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome phenotype. Unlike vascular Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome (EDS), classic EDS is rarely associated with vascular manifestation. We
  report the case of a 39-year-old man who presented with acute abdominal pain. At
  the time of presentation, the patient was in hypovolemic shock, and computed tomography
  angiogram demonstrated common iliac artery dissection with rupture. He underwent
  an attempted endovascular repair that was converted to an open repair of a ruptured
  right common iliac artery dissection. Subsequent genetic testing revealed a substitution
  of arginine for cysteine in type I collagen, COL1A1 exon 14 c.934C>T mutation, consistent
  with a rare variant of classic EDS.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
