input_text: 'A comprehensive study of the spatial and temporal expression of the col5a1
  gene in mouse embryos: a clue for understanding collagen V function in developing
  connective tissues. Collagen V is a quantitatively minor component of collagen I
  fibrils and the defective product of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). To provide
  new insights into its embryonic function, a continuous evaluation of the expression
  pattern of proalpha1(V), a chain common to all collagen V molecular forms, was performed
  by in situ hybridization of developing mouse from 7.5 days after conception (dpc)
  to birth. Proalpha1(V) transcripts were first detected at 8.5 dpc, signals being
  considerably augmented at 16.5 dpc and declining at birth. Hybridization signals
  were, at first, exclusively detected in the dorsal aorta wall, heart, and adnexa.
  At 10.5 dpc, col5a1 expression was found in the heart, dorsal aorta wall, branchial
  arches, mesonephrotic tubules, and intestinal mesenchyme and coincided with proalpha1(I)
  developmental expression. Later stages exhibited an intense signal in more restricted
  regions, notably the skin, the bones and vertebral column, the cornea, the tendons
  and ligaments, the peritoneal membranes, the umbilical cord, and the salivary gland.
  The data revealed the important contribution of collagen V to the development of
  functional connective tissues. Proalpha1(V) signals were exclusively detected in
  the flattened cells of the surface ectoderm at 10.5 dpc. By 12.5 dpc, when cells
  had become cuboidal, the signal switched to the dermal fibroblasts. Thus, type V
  collagen appears to contribute to epidermis differentiation. Our data also suggest
  that collagen V participates in bone formation and/or mineralization and in the
  renewal of stromal cells in the cornea. The results underscore the role of collagen
  V in developing embryos and provide important clues for analyzing the phenotype
  of mouse models for EDS.'
