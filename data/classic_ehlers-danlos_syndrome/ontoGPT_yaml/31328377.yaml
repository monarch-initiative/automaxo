input_text: "Utilization of echocardiography in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. OBJECTIVES:
  This study assessed the frequency and utility of echocardiographic examination in
  patients with all forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and sought to identify clinical
  variables associated with an abnormal echocardiogram. DESIGN/SETTING: This was a
  retrospective study of all patients carrying a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
  of any type who were evaluated by a pediatrician or pediatric subspecialist at a
  single tertiary medical center with an affiliated children's hospital during the
  period January 2013 to December 2018. PATIENTS: Chart review was performed on all
  patients carrying a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in the electronic medical
  record. OUTCOME MEASURES: Data from genetics examination, cardiovascular examination
  where applicable, genetic test results when available, and echocardiography were
  recorded. RESULTS: Of 262 patients identified, echocardiography and cardiac evaluation
  were common occurring in 90% and 50% of patients with any form of Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome. Cardiovascular complications occurred in 50% of patients with vascular
  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome but echocardiography was normal in all. Aortic dilation was
  common in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome but absent in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome. Mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve occurred at the same incidence
  as the general population. Cardiac symptoms were present in 12% but did not correlate
  with abnormal cardiac structure. Presentation with symptoms of musculoskeletal pain
  was inversely related to the presence of cardiac pathology. CONCLUSIONS: In light
  of the absence of cardiac pathology in patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
  routine cardiac evaluation and echocardiography are not required for patients with
  hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."
