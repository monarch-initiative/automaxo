input_text: Targeted deletion of collagen V in tendons and ligaments results in a
  classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome joint phenotype. Collagen V mutations underlie classic
  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and joint hypermobility is an important clinical manifestation.
  We define the function of collagen V in tendons and ligaments, as well as the role
  of alterations in collagen V expression in the pathobiology in classic Ehlers-Danlos
  syndrome. A conditional Col5a1(flox/flox) mouse model was bred with Scleraxis-Cre
  mice to create a targeted tendon and ligament Col5a1-null mouse model, Col5a1(Deltaten/Deltaten).
  Targeting was specific, resulting in collagen V-null tendons and ligaments. Col5a1(Deltaten/Deltaten)
  mice demonstrated decreased body size, grip weakness, abnormal gait, joint laxity,
  and early-onset osteoarthritis. These gross changes were associated with abnormal
  fiber organization, as well as altered collagen fibril structure with increased
  fibril diameters and decreased fibril number that was more severe in a major joint
  stabilizing ligament, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), than in the flexor digitorum
  longus tendon. The ACL also had a higher collagen V content than did the flexor
  digitorum longus tendon. The collagen V-null ACL and flexor digitorum longus tendon
  both had significant alterations in mechanical properties, with ACL exhibiting more
  severe changes. The data demonstrate critical differential regulatory roles for
  collagen V in tendon and ligament structure and function and suggest that collagen
  V regulatory dysfunction is associated with an abnormal joint phenotype, similar
  to the hypermobility phenotype in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
