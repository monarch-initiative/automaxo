input_text: Cutaneous metaplastic synovial cyst in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Classic
  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by laxity.
  The skin, as one of the organs involved, shows hyperextensibility, which makes it
  prone to trauma. In this context, it would seem logical for cutaneous synovial metaplasia,
  which is considered a form of repair, to be commonly found in cases of EDS. However,
  there are only two previously published cases of synovial metaplasia in EDS. We
  present a third case in a 56-year-old woman with painful redundant skin in both
  elbows and knees for whom a skin fold of the left elbow was removed to relieve her
  symptoms. The biopsy showed preservation of the elastic and collagen fibers. The
  main alteration was the evidence of dermal cystic spaces lined by fibrinoid rests
  with focal pseudopapillary projections. However, in some zones the cellular lining
  was preserved, and it was composed of vimentin-positive, fibroblast-like flat, elongated
  cells, as well as CD68-positive macrophages. No birefringent particles were found
  in an examination under polarized light.
