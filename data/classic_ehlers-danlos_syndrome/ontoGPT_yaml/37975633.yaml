input_text: Collagen V haploinsufficiency in female murine patellar tendons results
  in altered matrix engagement and cellular density, demonstrating decreased healing.
  Collagen V (Col5) is a quantitatively minor component of collagen fibrils comprising
  tendon, however, plays a crucial role in regulation of development and dynamic healing
  processes. Clinically, patients with COL5a1 haploinsufficiency, known as classic
  Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (cEDS), present with hyperextensible skin, joint instability
  and laxity, with the females more likely to be affected. Previous studies in Col5-deficient
  mice indicated that reduced Col5a1 expression leads to a reduction in stiffness,
  fibril deposition and altered fibril structure. Additionally, Col5-deficient male
  tendons demonstrated altered healing compared to wild-type tendons, however female
  mice have not yet been studied utilizing this model. Along with clinical differences
  between sexes in cEDS patient populations, differences in hormone physiology may
  be a factor influencing tendon health. Therefore, the objective of this study was
  to utilize a Col5a1+/- female mouse model, to determine the effect of Col5 on tendon
  cell morphology, cell density, tissue composition, and mechanical properties throughout
  healing. We hypothesized that reduction in Col5 expression would result in an abnormal
  wound matrix post-injury, resulting in reduced mechanical properties compared to
  normal tendons. Following patellar tendon surgery, mice were euthanized at 1, 3,
  and 6-weeks post-injury. Col5-deficient tendons demonstrated altered and decreased
  healing compared to WT tendons. The lack of resolution in cellularity by 6-weeks
  post-injury in Col5-deficient tendons influenced the decreased mechanical properties.
  Stiffness did not increase post-injury in Col5-deficient mice, and collagen fiber
  realignment was delayed during mechanical loading. Therefore, increased Col5a1 expression
  post-injury is necessary to re-establish matrix engagement and cellularity throughout
  tendon healing. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
