input_text: 'Assessment of functional diversities in patients with Asthma, COPD, Asthma-COPD
  overlap, and Cystic Fibrosis (CF).The objectives of the present study were to evaluate
  the discriminating power of spirometric and plethysmographic lung function parameters
  to differenciate the diagnosis of asthma, ACO, COPD, and to define functional characteristics
  for more precise classification of obstructive lung diseases. From the databases
  of 4 centers, a total of 756 lung function tests (194 healthy subjects, 175 with
  asthma, 71 with ACO, 78 with COPD and 238 with CF) were collected, and gradients
  among combinations of target parameters from spirometry (forced expiratory volume
  one second: FEV1; FEV1/forced vital capacity: FEV1/FVC; forced expiratory flow between
  25-75% FVC: FEF25-75), and plethysmography (effective, resistive airway resistance:
  sReff; aerodynamic work of breathing at rest: sWOB), separately for in- and expiration
  (sReffIN, sReffEX, sWOBin, sWOBex) as well as static lung volumes (total lung capacity:
  TLC; functional residual capacity: FRCpleth; residual volume: RV), the control of
  breathing (mouth occlusion pressure: P0.1; mean inspiratory flow: VT/TI; the inspiratory
  to total time ratio: TI/Ttot) and the inspiratory impedance (Zinpleth = P0.1/VT/TI)
  were explored. Linear discriminant analyses (LDA) were applied to identify discriminant
  functions and classification rules using recursive partitioning decision trees.
  LDA showed a high classification accuracy (sensitivity and specificity > 90%) for
  healthy subjects, COPD and CF. The accuracy dropped for asthma (~70%) and even more
  for ACO (~60%). The decision tree revealed that P0.1, sRtot, and VT/TI differentiate
  most between healthy and asthma (68.9%), COPD (82.1%), and CF (60.6%). Moreover,
  using sWOBex and Zinpleth ACO can be discriminated from asthma and COPD (60%). Thus,
  the functional complexity of obstructive lung diseases can be understood, if specific
  spirometric and plethysmographic parameters are used. Moreover, the newly described
  parameters of airway dynamics and the central control of breathing including Zinpleth
  may well serve as promising functional marker in the field of precision medicine.'
