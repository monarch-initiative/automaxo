input_text: "Liver magnetic resonance elastography and fat fraction in pediatric patients
  with cystic fibrosis versus healthy children.BACKGROUND: Liver involvement is an
  important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
  While liver biopsy is the gold standard for demonstrating involvement, its invasiveness
  prompts a search for noninvasive alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate liver involvement
  in pediatric patients with CF (versus healthy controls) using magnetic resonance
  (MR) elastography/spectroscopy and to correlate the imaging findings with clinical/laboratory
  characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective cross-sectional
  study conducted between April 2020 and March 2022 in patients with CF versus healthy
  controls. Patients with CF were divided into two subgroups: those with CF-related
  liver disease and those without. MR images were acquired on a 1.5-tesla machine.
  Kilopascal (kPa) values were derived from processing MR elastography images. MR
  spectroscopy was used to measure liver fat fraction, as an indication of hepatosteatosis.
  Groups were compared using either the Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test.
  The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to compare qualitative variables.
  RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with CF (12 +- 3.3 years, 32 boys) and 24 healthy volunteers
  (11.1 +- 2.4 years, 15 boys) were included in the study. Median liver stiffness
  (P=0.003) and fat fraction (P=0.03) were higher in the CF patients than in the controls.
  Median liver stiffness values were higher in CF patients with CF-related liver disease
  than in those without CF-related liver disease (P=0.002). Liver stiffness values
  of CF patients with high alanine aminotransferase (ALT), high gamma-glutamyl transferase,
  and thrombocytopenia were found to be higher than those without (P=0.004, P<0.001,
  P<0.001, respectively). Only the high ALT group showed a high fat fraction (P=0.002).
  CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CF had higher liver stiffness than the control group,
  and patients with CF-related liver disease had higher liver stiffness than both
  the CF patients without CF-related liver disease and the control group. Patients
  with CF had a higher fat fraction than the control group. Noninvasive assessment
  of liver involvement using MR elastography/spectroscopy can support the diagnosis
  of CF-related liver disease and the follow-up of patients with CF."
