input_text: 'Improved recognition of lung function decline as signal of cystic fibrosis
  pulmonary exacerbation: a Cystic Fibrosis Learning Network Innovation Laboratory
  quality improvement initiative.INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a systemic
  autosomal recessive condition characterised by progressive lung disease. CF pulmonary
  exacerbations (PEx) are episodes of worsening respiratory status, and frequent PEx
  are a risk factor for accelerated lung function decline, yet many people with CF
  (PwCF) go untreated at the time of decline. The goal of this quality improvement
  (QI) initiative was to improve recognition, treatment and follow-up of PEx in PwCF.
  METHODS: Using the Model for Improvement, the Cystic Fibrosis Learning Network (CFLN)
  initiated a QI innovation laboratory (iLab) with a global aim to decrease the rate
  of lung function decline in PwCF. The iLab standardised definitions for signals
  of PEx using a threshold for decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
  and/or changes in symptoms. The FEV1 decline signal was termed FIES (FEV1-indicated
  exacerbation signal). Processes for screening and recognition of FIES and/or symptom
  changes, a treatment algorithm and follow-up in the presence of a signal were tested
  concurrently in multiple settings. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific aim is to increase
  the per cent of PwCF assessed for a PEx signal at ambulatory encounters and to increase
  the per cent of recommendations to follow-up within 6 weeks for PwCF experiencing
  a PEx signal. RESULTS: FIES recognition increased from 18.6% to 73.4% across all
  teams during the iLab, and every team showed an improvement. Of PwCF assessed, 15.8%
  experienced an FIES event (>10% decline in FEV1 per cent predicted (FEV1pp)). Follow-up
  within 6 weeks was recommended for an average of 70.5% of those assessed for FIES
  and had an FEV1pp decline greater than 5%. CONCLUSION: The CFLN iLab successfully
  defined and implemented a process to recognise and follow-up PEx signals. This process
  has the potential to be spread to the larger CF community. Further studies are needed
  to assess the impact of these processes on PwCF outcomes.'
