input_text: "[Cystic fibrosis carrier screening: a Health technology assessment.]This
  project of Health technology assessment was aimed at defining the impacts of offering
  a cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening to the general population, compared to
  the current situation, where the test is offered to individuals at high-risk to
  give birth to a child with CF. Results revealed: i) a lack of robust and updated
  data; ii) a return on investment up to six years from the screening's introduction,
  despite important economic and organizational efforts; iii) a general positive attitude
  of healthcare professionals, people with CF, families and general population; iv)
  possible issues related to the social impact."
