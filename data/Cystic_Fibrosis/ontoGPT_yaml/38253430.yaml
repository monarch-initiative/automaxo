input_text: "Rate and predictors of insufficient sweat volume in very young infants
  after pilocarpine gel iontophoresis: prospective, population-based study.OBJECTIVE:
  To verify the rate and predictors of 'quantity not sufficient' (QNS) among Brazilian
  infants younger than 3 months with positive newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis
  (CF). DESIGN: Prospective, population-based study. SETTING: Public Statewide Newborn
  Screening Programme where the incidence rate of CF is  1:11 000. PATIENTS: Subjects
  with positive two-tiered immunoreactive trypsinogen. INTERVENTIONS: Sweat induction
  and collection were performed in the same facility; one sweat sample was obtained
  per individual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The QNS rate and its predictors; analysis
  corresponded to the day of sweat collection. RESULTS: Among the 975 participants,
  QNS rates for 10 and 15 microL were 3.6% (95% CI 2.5% to 4.9%) and 8.3% (95% CI
  6.6% to 10.2%). Infants weighing >3056 and >3845 g and with gestational age higher
  than 37 weeks had a greater likelihood (5.5 and 6.7, and 2.7 and 5.8 times more,
  respectively) of avoiding QNS than their peers. CONCLUSION: QNS rates fulfilled
  the requirements, but predictors differed from those recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis
  Foundations guidelines."
