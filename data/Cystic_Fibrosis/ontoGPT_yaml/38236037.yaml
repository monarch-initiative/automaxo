input_text: Time-dependent pharmacodynamics of amikacin on Mycobacterium abscessus
  growth and resistance emergence.Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary disease is increasing
  in prevalence globally, particularly for individuals with cystic fibrosis. These
  infections are challenging to treat due to a high rate of resistance. Amikacin is
  critical to treatment, but the development of toxicity, amikacin resistance, and
  treatment failure are significant challenges. Amikacin has been characterized previously
  as peak-dependent and extended-interval dosing is commonly used. In our hollow fiber
  infection model of M. abscessus, amikacin exhibited time-dependent rather than the
  expected peak-dependent pharmacodynamics. Humanized amikacin exposures with more
  frequent, short-interval dosing (continuous infusion or every 12 hours) yielded
  improved microbiological response compared to extended-interval dosing (every 24
  hours or 1-3 times per week). Short-interval dosing inhibited growth with a mean
  (SD) maximum Deltalog10 colony forming units of -4.06 (0.52), significantly more
  than extended-interval dosing (P = 0.0013) every 24 hours, -2.40 (0.58), or 1-3
  times per week, -2.39 (0.38). Growth recovery, an indicator of resistance emergence,
  occurred at 6.56 (0.70) days with short-interval dosing but was significantly earlier
  with extended-interval dosing (P = 0.0032) every 24 hours, 3.88 (0.85) days, and
  1-3 times per week, 3.27 (1.72) days. Microbiological response correlated best with
  the pharmacodynamic index of %T > minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), with an
  EC80 for growth inhibition of ~40%T > MIC. We used a previously published population
  model of amikacin to determine the probability of achieving 40%T > MIC and show
  that current dosing strategies are far below this target, which may partially explain
  why treatment failure remains so high for these infections. These data support a
  cautious approach to infrequent amikacin dosing for the treatment of M. abscessus.IMPORTANCEPulmonary
  disease caused by Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is increasing worldwide,
  particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis. MABSC is challenging to treat due
  to high levels of antibiotic resistance. Treatment requires 2-4 antibiotics over
  more than 12 months and has a significant risk of toxicity but still fails to eradicate
  infection in over 50% of patients with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotic dosing strategies
  have been largely informed by common bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The
  "pharmacodynamic" effects of amikacin, a backbone of MABSC treatment, were thought
  to be related to maximum "peak" drug concentration, leading to daily or three times
  weekly dosing. However, we found that amikacin MABSC kill and growth recovery, an
  indicator of antibiotic resistance, are dependent on how long amikacin concentrations
  are above the minimum inhibitory concentration, not how high the peak concentration
  is. Therefore, we recommend a re-evaluation of amikacin dosing to determine if increased
  frequency can improve efficacy.
