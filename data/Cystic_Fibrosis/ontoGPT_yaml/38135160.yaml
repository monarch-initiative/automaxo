input_text: 'Nanoparticle-based platforms for targeted drug delivery to the pulmonary
  system as therapeutics to curb cystic fibrosis: A review.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is
  a genetic disorder of the respiratory system caused by mutation of the Cystic Fibrosis
  Trans-Membrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene that affects a huge number of people
  worldwide. It results in difficulty breathing due to a large accumulation of mucus
  in the respiratory tract, resulting in serious bacterial infections, and subsequent
  death. Traditional drug-based treatments face hindered penetration at the site of
  action due to the thick mucus layer. Nanotechnology offers possibilities for developing
  advanced and effective treatment platforms by focusing on drugs that can penetrate
  the dense mucus layer, fighting against the underlying bacterial infections, and
  targeting the genetic cause of the disease. In this review, current nanoparticle-mediated
  drug delivery platforms for CF, challenges in therapeutics, and future prospects
  have been highlighted. The effectiveness of the different types of nano-based systems
  conjugated with various drugs to combat the symptoms and the challenges of treating
  CF are brought into focus. The toxic effects of these nano-medicines and the various
  factors that are responsible for their effectiveness are also highlighted.'
