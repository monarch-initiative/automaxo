input_text: Combination treatment to improve mucociliary transport of Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa biofilms.People with muco-obstructive pulmonary diseases such as cystic
  fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have acute
  or chronic respiratory infections that are difficult to treat due in part to the
  accumulation of hyperconcentrated mucus within the airway. Mucus accumulation and
  obstruction promote chronic inflammation and infection and reduce therapeutic efficacy.
  Bacterial aggregates in the form of biofilms exhibit increased resistance to mechanical
  stressors from the immune response (e.g., phagocytosis) and chemical treatments
  including antibiotics. Herein, combination treatments designed to disrupt the mechanical
  properties of biofilms and potentiate antibiotic efficacy are investigated against
  mucus-grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and optimized to 1) alter biofilm viscoelastic
  properties, 2) increase mucociliary transport rates, and 3) reduce bacterial viability.
  A disulfide bond reducing agent (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, TCEP), a surfactant
  (NP40), a biopolymer (hyaluronic acid, HA), a DNA degradation enzyme (DNase), and
  an antibiotic (tobramycin) are tested in various combinations to maximize biofilm
  disruption. The viscoelastic properties of biofilms are quantified with particle
  tracking microrheology and transport rates are quantified in a mucociliary transport
  device comprised of fully differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells.
  The combination of the NP40 with hyaluronic acid and tobramycin was the most effective
  at increasing mucociliary transport rates, decreasing the viscoelastic properties
  of mucus, and reducing bacterial viability. Multimechanistic targeting of biofilm
  infections may ultimately result in improved clinical outcomes, and the results
  of this study may be translated into future in vivo infection models.
