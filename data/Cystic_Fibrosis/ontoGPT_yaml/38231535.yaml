input_text: NorA efflux pump mediates Staphylococcus aureus response to Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa pyocyanin toxicity.Endogenous transporters protect Staphylococcus aureus
  against antibiotics and also contribute to bacterial defense from environmental
  toxins. We evaluated the effect of overexpression of four efflux pumps, NorA, NorB,
  NorC, and Tet38, on S. aureus survival following exposure to pyocyanin (PYO) of
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, using a well diffusion assay. We measured the PYO-created
  inhibition zone and found that only an overexpression of NorA reduced S. aureus
  susceptibility to pyocyanin killing. The MICPYO of the NorA overexpressor increased
  threefold compared to that of wild-type RN6390 and was reduced 2.5-fold with reserpine,
  suggesting that increased NorA efflux caused PYO resistance. The PYO-created inhibition
  zone of a DeltanorA mutant was consistently larger than that of a plasmid-borne
  NorA overexpressor. PYO also produced a modest increase in norA expression (1.8-fold
  at 0.25 microg/mL PYO) that gradually decreased with increasing PYO concentrations.
  Well diffusion assays carried out using P. aeruginosa showed that DeltanorA mutant
  was less susceptible to killing by PYO-deficient mutants PA14phzM and PA14phzS than
  to killing by PA14. NorA overexpression led to reduced killing by all tested P.
  aeruginosa. We evaluated the NorA-PYO interaction using a collection of 22 clinical
  isolates from adult and pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, which included
  both S. aureus (CF-SA) and P. aeruginosa (CF-PA). We found that when isolated alone,
  CF-PA and CF-SA expressed varying levels of PYO and norA transcripts, but all four
  CF-PA/CF-SA pairs isolated concurrently from CF patients produced a low level of
  PYO and low norA transcript levels, respectively, suggesting a partial adaptation
  of the two bacteria in circumstances of persistent co-colonization.
