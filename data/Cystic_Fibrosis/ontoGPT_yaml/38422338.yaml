input_text: "Clinical determinants of the modified incremental step test in adults
  with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.OBJECTIVES: This study primarily aimed to
  investigate the clinical determinants of the Modified Incremental Step Test (MIST)
  in adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). A secondary objective
  was to compare the cardiopulmonary responses after the MIST and Incremental Shuttle
  Walk Test (ISWT), two commonly adopted symptom-limited maximum field tests in chronic
  respiratory diseases. METHODS: Forty-six patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis
  participated in this cross-sectional study. MIST and ISWT were performed to determine
  exercise capacity, while disease severity, fatigue, and quality of life were assessed
  using the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS),
  and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), respectively. Quadriceps muscle
  strength was evaluated using a hand-held dynamometer, walking speed with a wireless
  inertial sensing device, and the level of physical activity (steps/day) with a pedometer.
  RESULTS: The BSI score, quadriceps muscle strength, daily step count, and the SGRQ
  total score explained 61.9% of the variance in the MIST (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.67, AR2
  = 0.619). The BSI score (r = -0.412, p = 0.004), quadriceps muscle strength (r =
  0.574, p = 0.001), daily step count (r = 0.523, p < 0.001), walking speed (r = 0.402,
  p = 0.006), FSS score (r = -0.551, p < 0.001), and SGRQ total score (r = -0.570,
  p < 0.001) correlated with the MIST. The patients achieved higher heart rates (HR),
  HR%, desaturation, dyspnea, and leg fatigue in the MIST compared to the ISWT (p
  < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity, quadriceps muscle strength, physical activity
  level, and quality of life were determinants of MIST. The advantages of the MIST,
  including higher cardiopulmonary response than ISWT and greater portability, which
  facilitates its use in various settings, make MIST the preferred choice for investigating
  symptom-limited exercise capacity in patients with NCFB."
