input_text: 'Severity of bronchiectasis predicts use of and adherence to high frequency
  chest wall oscillation therapy - Analysis from the United States Bronchiectasis
  and NTM research registry.BACKGROUND: High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO)
  is a form of airway clearance therapy that has been available since the mid-1990s
  and is routinely used by patients suffering from retained pulmonary secretions.
  Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), neuromuscular disease (NMD), and other disorders,
  including bronchiectasis (BE) and COPD (without BE), are commonly prescribed this
  therapy. Limited evidence exists describing HFCWO use in the BE population, its
  impact on long-term management of disease, and the specific patient populations
  most likely to benefit from this therapy. This study sought to characterize the
  clinical characteristics of patients with BE who have documented use of HFCWO at
  baseline and 1-year follow-up. METHODS: An analysis from a large national database
  registry of patients with BE was performed. Demographic and clinical characteristics
  of all patients receiving HFCWO therapy at baseline are reported. Patients were
  stratified into two groups based on continued or discontinued use of HFCWO therapy
  at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Over half (54.8 %) of patients who reported using
  HFCWO therapy had a Modified Bronchiectasis Severity Index (m-BSI) classified as
  severe, and the majority (81.4 %) experienced an exacerbation in the prior two years.
  Of patients with 1-year follow-up data, 73 % reported continued use of HFCWO. Compared
  to patients who discontinued therapy, these patients were more severe at baseline
  and at follow-up suggesting that patients with more severe disease are more likely
  to continue HFCWO therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have more severe disease and
  continue to experience exacerbations and hospitalizations are more likely to continue
  HFCWO therapy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NA.'
