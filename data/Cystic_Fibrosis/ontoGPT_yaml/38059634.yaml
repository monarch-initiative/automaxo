input_text: Population pharmacokinetics and target attainment analysis of vancomycin
  after intermittent dosing in adults with cystic fibrosis.Vancomycin is the first-line
  agent to treat pulmonary infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
  aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). However, there is no consensus
  on vancomycin initial dosing in this population among health institutions, and there
  is a large variability in initial dosing across the United States. In this study,
  we characterized the pharmacokinetics (PK) of vancomycin in PwCF using a population
  PK approach. The clinical PK data to develop the population PK model were obtained
  from vancomycin therapeutic monitoring data from PwCF undergoing treatment for infections
  due to MRSA. The population PK model was then used to perform comprehensive Monte
  Carlo simulations to evaluate the probability of target attainment (PTA) of 12 different
  initial dosing scenarios. The area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration
  (MIC) ratio >=400 mg*h/L and <650 mg*h/L were used as efficacy and toxicity targets
  for PTA analysis. A total of 181 vancomycin plasma concentrations were included
  in the analysis. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination best described
  the data. Weight significantly influenced the vancomycin PK (P < 0.05). In the final
  model, clearance was estimated as 5.52 L/h/70 kg, and the volume of distribution
  was 31.5 L/70 kg. The PTA analysis showed that at MIC = 1 microg/mL, doses 1,500
  q8h and 2,000 q12h showed the highest %PTA in achieving both efficacy and toxicity
  targets. The PTA results from this study may potentially inform the initial dosing
  regimens of vancomycin to treat pulmonary infections due to MRSA in PwCF.
