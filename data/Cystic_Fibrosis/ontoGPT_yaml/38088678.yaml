input_text: 'Respiratory system parameters in children with low severity cystic fibrosis:
  is there early involvement in relation to healthy peers?OBJECTIVE: To compare and
  analyze pulmonary function and respiratory mechanics parameters between healthy
  children and children with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical
  study included healthy children (HSG) and children with cystic fibrosis (CFG), aged
  6-13 years, from teaching institutions and a reference center for cystic fibrosis
  in Florianopolis/SC, Brazil. The patients were paired by age and sex. Initially,
  an anthropometric evaluation was undertaken to pair the sample characteristics in
  both groups; the medical records of CFG were consulted for bacterial colonization,
  genotype, and disease severity (Schwachman-Doershuk Score - SDS) data. Spirometry
  and impulse oscillometry were used to assess pulmonary function. RESULTS: In total,
  110 children were included, 55 in each group. In the CFG group, 58.2% were classified
  as excellent by SDS, 49.1% showed the DeltaF508 heterozygotic genotype, and 67.3%
  were colonized by some pathogens. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences
  between both groups (p<0.05) in most pulmonary function parameters and respiratory
  mechanics. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cystic fibrosis showed obstructive ventilatory
  disorders and compromised peripheral airways compared with healthy children. These
  findings reinforce the early changes in pulmonary function and mechanics associated
  with this disease.'
