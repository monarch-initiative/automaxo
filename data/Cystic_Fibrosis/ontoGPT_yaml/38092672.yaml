input_text: Mutations in genes lpxL1, bamA, and pmrB impair the susceptibility of
  cystic fibrosis strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to murepavadin.Murepavadin is
  a peptidomimetic exhibiting specific inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas species.
  In the present study, its in vitro activity was assessed on 230 cystic fibrosis
  (CF) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 12 French hospitals, in comparison
  with 12 other antipseudomonal antibiotics. Although murepavadin is still in preclinical
  stage of development, 9.1% (n = 21) of strains had a minimum inhibitory concentration
  (MIC) >4 mg/L, a level at least 128-fold higher than the modal MIC value of the
  whole collection (<=0.06 mg/L). Whole-genome sequencing of these 21 strains along
  with more susceptible isogenic counterparts coexisting in the same patients revealed
  diverse mutations in genes involved in the synthesis (lpxL1 and lpxL2) or transport
  of lipopolysaccharides (bamA, lptD, and msbA), or encoding histidine kinases of
  two-component systems (pmrB and cbrA). Allelic replacement experiments with wild-type
  reference strain PAO1 confirmed that alteration of genes lpxL1, bamA, and/or pmrB
  can decrease the murepavadin susceptibility from 8- to 32-fold. Furthermore, we
  found that specific amino acid substitutions in histidine kinase PmrB (G188D, Q105P,
  and D45E) reduce the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to murepavadin, colistin, and
  tobramycin, three antibiotics used or intended to be used (murepavadin) in aerosols
  to treat colonized CF patients. Whether colistin or tobramycin may select mutants
  resistant to murepavadin or the opposite needs to be addressed by clinical studies.
