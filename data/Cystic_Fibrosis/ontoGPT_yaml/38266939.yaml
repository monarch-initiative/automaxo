input_text: Inhaled dry powder liposomal azithromycin for treatment of chronic lower
  respiratory tract infection.A dry powder inhaled liposomal azithromycin formulation
  was developed for the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis
  and bronchiectasis. Key properties including liposome size, charge and encapsulation
  efficiency powder size, shape, glass transition temperature (Tg), water content
  and in vitro respiratory deposition were determined. Antimicrobial activity against
  cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory pathogens was determined by MIC, MBC and biofilm
  assays. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies were performed using A549 cells.
  The average liposome size was 105 nm, charge was 55 mV and encapsulation efficiency
  was 75 %. The mean powder particle size d[v,50] of 4.54 microm and Mass Median Aerodynamic
  Diameter (MMAD) was 5.23 microm with a mean Tg of 76 C and water content of 2.1
  %. These excellent physicochemical characteristics were maintained over one year.
  Liposomal loaded azithromycin demonstrated enhanced activity against P. aeruginosa
  clinical isolates grown in biofilm. The formulation was rapidly delivered into bacterial
  cells with > 75 % uptake in 1 h. Rapid uptake into A549 cells via a cholesterol-dependent
  endocytosis pathway with no cytotoxic effects apparent. These data demonstrate that
  this formulation could offer benefits over current treatment regimens for people
  with chronic respiratory infection.
