input_text: 'Impact of habitual physical activity and exercise capacity on quality
  of life in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND: The influence
  of habitual physical activity and exercise capacity on health-related quality of
  life (HRQoL) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is poorly characterized. This
  study investigated the influence of habitual physical activity, exercise capacity,
  lung function, and body mass index (BMI) on HRQoL in adolescent and adult pwCF.
  METHOD: Subjects were fitted with an accelerometer to determine habitual physical
  activity (steps/day), including time spent at different intensities, for up to 4
  weeks. Then bicycle ergometry (maximal exercise capacity; Wpeak), lung function
  (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s, ppFEV1 ), BMI, and response
  to the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) were determined. RESULTS: Sixty-five
  pwCF participated in the study. Physically active pwCF had significantly higher
  ppFEV1 (p < .001) and exercise capacity (p < .001) than inactive pwCF, and had significantly
  higher scores on the CFQ-R physical (p = .006), emotional (p = .015), role (p =
  .008), health (p = .006), and weight (p = .004) subscales. On multiple linear regression
  analysis, ppFEV1 and, to a lesser extent, exercise capacity, were the most important
  determinants of HRQoL in pwCF. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical
  activity did not influence any of the CFQ-R subscales, whereas time spent in vigorous-intensity
  influenced CFQ-R scores for role (p = .007), body (p = .001), health (p = .009),
  and weight (p = .01). CONCLUSION: HRQoL in adolescent and adult pwCF was influenced
  by several factors. Avoiding sedentary behavior and spending time in vigorous-intensity
  levels positively influenced HRQoL, whereas the total number of steps per day played
  only a minor role in determining HRQoL. Both ppFEV1 and exercise capacity markedly
  influenced HRQoL.'
