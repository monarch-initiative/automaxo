input_text: 'Continuous glucose monitoring and advanced glycation endproducts for
  prediction of clinical outcomes and development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes
  in adults with CF.Introductions: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is associated
  with pulmonary decline, compromised nutritional status, and earlier mortality. Onset
  is often insidious, so screening for early detection of glycemic abnormalities is
  important. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been validated in people with
  CF and has been shown to detect early glycemic variability otherwise missed on 2-hour
  oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). We previously reported that CGM measures
  of hyperglycemia and glycemic variability are superior to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
  in distinguishing those with and without CFRD. However, little is known about the
  long-term predictive value of CGM measures of glycemia for both the development
  of CFRD and their effect on key clinical outcomes such as weight maintenance and
  pulmonary function. In addition, there have been no studies investigating advanced
  glycation endproducts (AGE) assessed by skin autofluorescence in people with CF.
  Methods: In this prospective observational study, CGM and HbA1c were measured at
  2 to 3 time points 3 months apart in 77 adults with CF. Participants who did not
  have CFRD at the time of enrollment underwent OGTT at the baseline visit, and all
  participants had AGE readings at baseline. Follow up data including anthropometric
  measures, pulmonary function and CFRD status were collected by review of medical
  records 1- and 2-years after the baseline visits. We applied multivariable linear
  regression models correlating glycemic measures to change in key clinical outcomes
  (weight, BMI, FEV1) accounting for age, gender and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor
  (ETI) use. We also conducted logistic regression analyses comparing baseline glycemic
  data to development of CFRD during the 2-year follow up period. Results: Of the
  77 participants, 25 had pre-existing CFRD at the time of enrollment, and six participants
  were diagnosed with CFRD by the OGTT performed at the baseline visit. When adjusting
  for age, gender, and ETI use, multiple CGM measures correlated with weight and BMI
  decline after one year but not after two years. CGM and HbA1c at baseline did not
  predict decline in FEV1 (p>0.05 for all). In the 46 participants without a diagnosis
  of CFRD at baseline, two participants were diagnosed with CFRD over the following
  two years, but CGM measures at baseline did not predict progression to CFRD. Baseline
  AGE values were higher in individuals with CFRD and correlated with multiple measures
  of dysglycemia (HbA1c, AG, SD, CV, TIR, % time >140, >180, >250) as well as weight.
  AGE values also correlated with FEV1 decline at year 1 and weight decline at year
  1 and year 2. Conclusions: Several key CGM measures of hyperglycemia and glycemic
  variability were predictive of future decline in weight and BMI over one year in
  this population of adults with CF with and without CFRD. None of the baseline glycemic
  variables predicted progression to CFRD over 2 years. To our knowledge, this is
  the first report correlating AGE levels with key clinical and glycemic measures
  in CF. Limitations of these analyses include the small number of participants who
  developed CFRD (n=2) during the follow up period and the initiation of ETI by many
  participants, affecting their trajectory in weight and pulmonary function. These
  results provide additional data supporting the potential role for CGM in identifying
  clinically significant dysglycemia in CF. Future studies are needed to investigate
  CGM as a diagnostic and screening tool for CFRD and to understand the implications
  of AGE measures in this patient population.'
