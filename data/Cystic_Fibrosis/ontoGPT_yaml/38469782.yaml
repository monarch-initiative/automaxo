input_text: "Development of a Low Cost Semiquantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction
  Assay for Molecular Diagnosis of Williams Syndrome.BACKGROUND: Williams Beuren Syndrome
  (WBS) is a well-recognized and common genetic cause of congenital heart defects,
  developmental delay, hypercalcemia, and characteristic facial features. It is caused
  by a 1.5 - 1.8 Mb heterozygous deletion of chromosome 7q11.23 with loss of around
  28 coding genes. The aim of this study was to develop a low-cost, semi-quantitative
  PCR (sqPCR) method to detect the chromosome 7q11.23 deletion. METHODS: Twenty-four
  suspected WBS cases were recruited following ethical clearance and informed consent.
  Blood was obtained, DNA extracted and spectrophotometrically quantified using standard
  methods. To detect the deletion by dosage analysis, a target region within a gene
  located in the WBS commonly deleted region of 7q11.23 was amplified together with
  a control region in a duplex sqPCR assay. The control region was telomeric to the
  WBS commonly deleted region and was located in chromosome 7q31.2. The two target
  regions within the deleted region namely a locus within ELN and a marker in the
  intergenic region between FZD9 and FKBP6 and designated IFF, were amplified in separate
  duplex sqPCR assays. The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)
  gene was used as the control for normalization. Included in the assay were a non-deleted
  and deleted individuals' samples. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were identified to
  have the deletion while five did not. All 24 patients' results were confirmed by
  whole exome sequencing and 11 also by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH).
  CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained indicates the sqPCR assay developed in this study
  to be an accurate and reliable diagnostic test for WBS. Most Sri Lankan patients
  with WBS are diagnosed clinically, as many parents of affected WBS children are
  unable to afford currently available molecular diagnostic testing. This low cost
  sqPCR test is therefore likely to benefit Sri Lankan WBS patients, by enabling genetic
  testing for confirming or refuting a clinical diagnosis of WBS and may be of use
  in other low and middle income countries."
