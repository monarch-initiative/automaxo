input_text: 'High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level in stable-state bronchiectasis
  predicts exacerbation risk.BACKGROUND: Elevation of systemic inflammatory markers
  were found to correlate with increased disease extent, reduced lung function and
  higher risk of future severe exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although
  a significant correlation of circulating hs-CRP levels with HRCT scores and resting
  oxygen saturation in patients with stable-state non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis
  was suggested, there is little data on the relationship between hs-CRP and the prognosis
  of bronchiectasis and a lack of data on the role of hs-CRP in predicting bronchiectasis
  exacerbation. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on Chinese patients with
  non- CF bronchiectasis from 1st October to 31st December 2021. Baseline serum hs-CRP
  were obtained at stable-state. The follow-up period lasted for one year. Co-primary
  endpoints were the development of any bronchiectasis exacerbation and hospitalized
  bronchiectasis exacerbation. RESULTS: Totally 123 patients were included. Higher
  hs-CRP was associated with increased risk to develop any bronchiectasis exacerbation,
  adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.254 (95% CI = 1.040-4.885, p = 0.039), and borderline
  significantly increased hospitalized bronchiectasis exacerbation with aOR of 1.985
  (95% CI = 0.922-4.277, p = 0.080). CONCLUSION: Baseline serum hs-CRP level at stable-state
  can predict risk of bronchiectasis exacerbation, which is reflecting chronic low-grade
  inflammation in bronchiectasis.'
