input_text: Signal-correction errors in the EasyOne Pro LAB multiple-breath washout
  device significantly impact outcomes in children and adults.Multiple-breath washout
  (MBW) is an established technique to assess functional residual capacity (FRC) and
  ventilation inhomogeneity in the lung. Indirect calculation of nitrogen concentration
  requires accurate measurement of gas concentrations. To investigate the accuracy
  of the CO2 concentration and molar mass (MM) values used for the indirect calculation
  of nitrogen concentration in a commercial MBW device [EasyOne Pro LAB (EOPL), ndd
  Medizintechnik AG, Switzerland] and its impact on outcomes. We used high-precision
  gas mixtures to evaluate CO2 and MM sensor output in vivo and in vitro. We developed
  updated algorithms to correct observed errors and assessed the impact on MBW outcomes
  and FRC measurement accuracy compared with body plethysmography. The respiratory
  exchange ratio (RER)-based adjustment of the measured CO2 signal used in the EOPL
  led to an overestimated CO2 signal (range -0.1% to 1.0%). In addition, an uncorrected
  dependence on humidity was identified. These combined effects resulted in an overestimation
  of expired nitrogen concentrations (range -0.7% to 2.6%), and consequently MBW outcomes.
  Corrected algorithms reduced the mean (SD) cumulative expired volume by 15.8% (9.7%),
  FRC by 6.6% (3.0%), and lung clearance index by 9.9% (7.6%). Differences in FRC
  between the EOPL and body plethysmography further increased. Inadequate signal correction
  causes RER- and humidity-dependent expired nitrogen concentration errors and overestimation
  of test outcomes. Updated algorithms reduce average signal error, however, RER values
  far from the population average still cause measurement errors. Despite improved
  signal accuracy, the updated algorithm increased the difference in FRC between the
  EOPL and body plethysmography.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated the accuracy of the
  molar mass (MM) and CO2 sensors of a commercial multiple-breath washout device (ndd
  Medizintechnik AG, Switzerland). We identified humidity and respiratory exchange
  ratio-dependent errors that in most measurements resulted in an overestimation of
  expired nitrogen concentrations, and consequently, MBW results. Functional residual
  capacity and lung clearance index decreased by 6.6% and 9.9%, respectively. Despite
  improved signal accuracy, the difference in FRC between the EOPL and body plethysmography
  increased.
