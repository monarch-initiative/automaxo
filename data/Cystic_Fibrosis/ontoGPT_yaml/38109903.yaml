input_text: 'Impact of Reanalysis of Nitrogen Multiple-Breath Washout on its Relationship
  with Chest Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in Clinically Stable and Pulmonary
  Exacerbated Children with Cystic Fibrosis.RATIONALE: Multiple-breath washout (MBW)-derived
  lung clearance index (LCI) detects lung disease in children with cystic fibrosis
  (CF). Correction of a cross-talk error in the software of the MBW device Exhalyzer
  D in a new software version has generated significant interest regarding its impact
  on previous MBW findings. Since LCI and chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlated
  before in CF children, this study aims to reassess previous MBW data after correction.
  PATIENTS/METHODS: Reanalysis of the main findings from a previously published study
  comparing MBW and MRI in a pediatric CF cohort by reassessment of nitrogen (N2)
  MBW of 61 stable children with CF, 75 age-matched healthy controls (HC), and 15
  CF children with pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) in the corrected software version.
  RESULTS: The corrected LCI (N2LCIcor) decreased in the entire cohort (-17.0 (11.2)%),
  HC (-8.5 (8.2)%), stable CF children (-22.2 (11.1)%), and within the PEx group at
  baseline, at PEx and after antibiotic therapy (-21.5 (7.3)%; -22.5 (6.1)%; -21.4
  (6.6)%; all P<0.01). N2LCIcor and N2LCIpre correlated with chest MRI scores in stable
  CF (r=0.70 to 0.84; all P<0.01) without a significant difference between N2LCIcor
  and N2LCIpre. Change in LCI from baseline to PEx and from PEx to after therapy decreased
  from N2LCIpre to N2LCIcor, but these changes remained significant (all P=0.001).
  DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that N2LCIcor is significantly lower
  than N2LCIpre, but key results published in the original study demonstrating N2MBW
  and MRI as complementary methods for clinical surveillance in children with CF remain
  unaffected.'
