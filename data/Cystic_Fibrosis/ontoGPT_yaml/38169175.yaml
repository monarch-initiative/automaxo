input_text: 'ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guideline on nutrition care for cystic fibrosis.BACKGROUND:
  Nutritional status is paramount in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and is directly correlated
  with morbidity and mortality. The first ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guidelines on nutrition
  care for infants, children, and adults with CF were published in 2016. An update
  to these guidelines is presented. METHODS: The study was developed by an international
  multidisciplinary working group in accordance with officially accepted standards.
  Literature since 2016 was reviewed, PICO questions were discussed and the GRADE
  system was utilized. Statements were discussed and submitted for on-line voting
  by the Working Group and by all ESPEN members. RESULTS: The Working Group updated
  the nutritional guidelines including assessment and management at all ages. Supplementation
  of vitamins and pancreatic enzymes remains largely the same. There are expanded
  chapters on pregnancy, CF-related liver disease, and CF-related diabetes, bone disease,
  nutritional and mineral supplements, and probiotics. There are new chapters on nutrition
  with highly effective modulator therapies and nutrition after organ transplantation.'
