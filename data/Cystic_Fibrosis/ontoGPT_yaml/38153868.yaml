input_text: 'The cost of simplifying treatments for cystic fibrosis: Implications
  of the SIMPLIFY trial.BACKGROUND: Dornase alfa and hypertonic saline are mucoactive
  therapies that can improve respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).
  A recent randomized control trial showed that participants with well-preserved pulmonary
  function taking elexacaftor + tezacaftor + ivacaftor (ETI) who discontinued dornase
  alfa or hypertonic saline for 6 weeks had no clinically meaningful decline in lung
  function. This may prompt discussions with care providers regarding ongoing use
  of these medications. OBJECTIVE: To compare the costs of outpatient medications
  between people taking ETI who continued or discontinued (1) dornase alfa or (2)
  hypertonic saline from 2 clinical trials and project cost differences in the US
  CF population if these 2 medications were used only intermittently for symptom relief
  instead of chronically. METHODS: The SIMPLIFY study was 2 parallel multicenter trials
  that randomized participants 1:1 to either continue or discontinue therapy. To estimate
  costs, we used data from the Merative MarketScan Databases to identify people with
  CF from 2020 to 2021. Our primary outcomes were differences in costs of outpatient
  prescription drugs among those who continued vs discontinued dornase alfa and, separately,
  hypertonic saline. We obtained adjusted differences in median costs. To estimate
  the annual cost savings if the population of people with CF taking ETI used these
  medications only intermittently, we multiplied the proportion of people in MarketScan
  with CF diagnoses who were taking each of these medications by the median cost savings
  per year and subtracted the cost of "rescue" use. RESULTS: A total of 392 participants
  from the dornase alfa trial and 273 from the hypertonic saline trial were included
  in analyses. The adjusted difference in median medication costs was not significant
  for the hypertonic saline trial, but we observed a significantly decreased 6-week
  cost of medications in the dornase alfa trial (adjusted median difference in costs
  between discontinue and continue of $5,860 (95% CI = $4,870-$6,850); P < 0.0001).
  We estimated that two-thirds of people with CF use ETI and dornase alfa in the United
  States; if they discontinued dornase alfa except for intermittent use, the resulting
  annual savings would be $1.21 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Although the costs of dornase
  alfa and hypertonic saline are smaller compared with ETI, reduction in use would
  lead to substantial prescription drug cost savings and reduce the treatment burden.
  However, individual benefits of these therapies should be considered, and decisions
  regarding changes in therapy remain an important discussion between people with
  CF and their providers. Study registration number: NCT04378153.'
