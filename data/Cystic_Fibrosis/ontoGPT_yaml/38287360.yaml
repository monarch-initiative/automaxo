input_text: 'Promising antibacterial efficacy of arenicin peptides against the emerging
  opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium abscessus.BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium abscessus,
  a fast-growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium, is an emerging opportunistic pathogen
  responsible for chronic bronchopulmonary infections in people with respiratory diseases
  such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Due to its intrinsic polyresistance to a wide range
  of antibiotics, most treatments for M. abscessus pulmonary infections are poorly
  effective. In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) active against bacterial
  strains and less prompt to cause resistance, represent a good alternative to conventional
  antibiotics. Herein, we evaluated the effect of three arenicin isoforms, possessing
  two or four Cysteines involved in one (Ar-1, Ar-2) or two disulfide bonds (Ar-3),
  on the in vitro growth of M. abscessus. METHODS: The respective disulfide-free AMPs,
  were built by replacing the Cysteines with alpha-amino-n-butyric acid (Abu) residue.
  We evaluated the efficiency of the eight arenicin derivatives through their antimicrobial
  activity against M. abscessus strains, their cytotoxicity towards human cell lines,
  and their hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes. The mechanism of action of the
  Ar-1 peptide was further investigated through membrane permeabilization assay, electron
  microscopy, lipid insertion assay via surface pressure measurement, and the induction
  of resistance assay. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that Ar-1 was the safest
  peptide with no toxicity towards human cells and no hemolytic activity, and the
  most active against M. abscessus growth. Ar-1 acts by insertion into mycobacterial
  lipids, resulting in a rapid membranolytic effect that kills M. abscessus without
  induction of resistance. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present study emphasized Ar-1
  as a potential new alternative to conventional antibiotics in the treatment of CF-associated
  bacterial infection related to M. abscessus.'
