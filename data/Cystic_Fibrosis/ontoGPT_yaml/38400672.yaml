input_text: 'Peri-operative and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation in patients
  with cystic fibrosis.INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of data regarding the peri-operative
  and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.
  Herein, we report the peri-operative and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation
  in CF patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All CF patients who received a kidney transplant
  at the national kidney transplant center between 1993 and 2022 were identified.
  Recipients of the contralateral donor kidney were selected as a control group. Primary
  outcomes included 1-, 5-, and 10- year death-censored graft survival and overall
  survival. Secondary outcomes included peri-operative morbidity, acute graft rejection,
  delayed graft function (DGF), and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Fourteen patients
  received a kidney transplant over the study period. Median age at transplantation
  was 35 (IQR 31, 40) years. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year death-censored graft survival
  was 92, 74, and 74% in the CF group compared to 100, 92, and 92% in the control
  group (p = .44). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival in the CF group was 85,
  66, and 57% compared to 100, 92, and 82% in the control group (p = .036). There
  was no significant difference in peri-operative outcomes including LOS (10 vs. 11
  days, p = .84), ICU admission (1 vs. 0 patients, p > .99), acute rejection episodes
  (2 vs. 1 patients, p > .99), and DGF (1 vs. 2 patients, p = .60). CONCLUSION: CF
  patients have good long-term graft survival, however, overall survival was worse
  compared to a matched cohort. These data provide important information for transplant
  surgeons when considering suitable donor allografts in this unique patient population.'
