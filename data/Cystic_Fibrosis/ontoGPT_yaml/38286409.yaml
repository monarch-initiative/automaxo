input_text: 'Necessity of Tobramycin trough Levels in Once Daily Iv-Treatment in Patients
  with Cystic Fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Once daily intravenous (iv) treatment with tobramycin
  for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is
  frequently monitored by measuring tobramycin trough levels (TLs). Although the necessity
  of these TLs is recently questioned in pwCF without renal impairment, no study has
  evaluated this so far. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the frequency
  of increased tobramycin TLs in pwCF treated with a once daily tobramycin dosing
  protocol. METHODS: Patient records of all consecutive once daily iv tobramycin courses
  in 35 pwCF between 07/2009 and 07/2019 were analyzed for tobramycin level, renal
  function, co-medication and comorbidity. RESULTS: Eight elevated TLs (2.9% of 278
  courses) were recorded in four patients, two with normal renal function. One of
  these resolved without adjustment of tobramycin dosages suggesting a test timing
  or laboratory error. In the other patient the elevated tobramycin level decreased
  after tobramycin dosage adjustment. Six of the elevated levels occurred in two patients
  with chronic renal failure. In 15 other patients with reduced glomerular filtration
  rate (GFR) (36 courses) but normal range creatinine no case of elevated tobramycin
  trough levels was detected. Neither cumulative tobramycin dosages nor concomitant
  diabetes or nutritional status were risk factors for elevated TLs. CONCLUSION: Our
  data show that elevated tobramycin TLs are rare but cannot be excluded, so determination
  of tobramycin TLs is still recommended for safety.'
