input_text: Use of CFTR Modulators for Cystic Fibrosis in a Patient with Liver Transplant
  and ESRD on Hemodialysis.Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused
  by mutations of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) protein. The most recent therapeutic approach to cystic fibrosis
  aims to correct structural and functional abnormalities of CFTR protein. CFTR modulators
  including ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor are used in patients with F508del mutation,
  with clinical improvement. To date, there are no experiences of CFTR modulator therapy
  in cystic fibrosis patients with organ transplantation and severe renal impairment.
  We report the case of a patient diagnosed with cystic fibrosis with F508del mutation,
  who underwent liver transplantation at the age of 19 and started hemodialysis at
  the age of 24 due to end-stage renal disease secondary to membranous glomerulonephritis.
  She was treated with Kaftrio (ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor) with clinical benefits
  on appetite, improvement of body mass index, and reduction of pulmonary exacerbations.
  A reduction of dosage to 75% of the standard dose was required due to alterations
  of the liver function. Conclusions. Use of CFTR modulators in patient with cystic
  fibrosis, liver transplant and end-stage renal disease could be considered safe
  but a clinical and laboratoristic monitoring of hepatic function is needed.
