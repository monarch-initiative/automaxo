input_text: 'Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Population Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients
  with Cystic Fibrosis: A First Step Toward Personalized Therapy.BACKGROUND: A major
  breakthrough in cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy was achievedAQ1 with CFTR modulators.
  The lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination is indicated for the treatment of CF in pediatric
  patients above 6 years old. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of lumacaftor/ivacaftor
  in these vulnerable pediatric populations are AQ2crucial to optimize treatment protocols.
  OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The objectives of this study were to describe the population
  PK (PPK) of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in children with CF, and to identify factors
  associated with interindividual variability. The association between drug exposure
  and clinical response was also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 75 children were
  included in this PPK study, with 191 concentrations available for each compound
  and known metabolites (lumacaftor, ivacaftor, ivacaftor-M1, and ivacaftor-M6). PPK
  analysis was performed using Monolix software. A large interindividual variability
  was observed. The main sources of interpatient variability identified were patient
  bodyweight and hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase). Forced expiratory
  volume in the first second (FEV1) was statistically associated with the level of
  exposure to ivacaftor after 48 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the
  first analysis of lumacaftor/ivacaftor PPK in children with CF. These data suggest
  that dose adjustment is required after identifying variability factors to optimize
  efficacy. The use of therapeutic drug monitoring as a basis for dose adjustment
  in children with CF may be useful.'
