input_text: 'A prospective study to assess the impact of a novel CFTR therapy combination
  on body composition in patients with cystic fibrosis with F508del mutation.BACKGROUND
  & AIM: Malnutrition is a prevalent condition in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and can result
  in worsening of pulmonary function and other comorbidities. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies are improving the CF-related care and outcomes.
  Body Mass Index (BMI) is the most commonly used parameter to assess nutritional
  status, albeit it is a very unspecific indicator. Hence, current guidelines recommend
  body composition analysis as a part of nutritional assessment. The aim of our study
  was to evaluate the impact of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) treatment
  on body composition and respiratory function. METHODS: We recruited patients with
  CF from University Hospital La Princesa, with follow-up in the Adult Cystic Fibrosis
  Unit. All patients were eligible to initiate ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy. Body composition
  was assessed with a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and spirometry data were
  obtained before and after 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Our study sample was composed
  of 36 patients with CF. We observed a significant increase in BMI after 6 months
  of treatment (p < 0.001), as well as an increase in fat mass (p = 0.008) and visceral
  fat area (p = 0.026). The other body composition parameters did not yield significant
  changes. Overall, %FEV1 increased from 72.67 % (+-17.39) to 84.74 % (+-18.18) after
  6 months of treatment. Interestingly, we found an inverse correlation between %FEV1
  and fat mass (r = -0,476; p = 0,0058), %FEV1 and age (r = -0,411; p = 0,0196) and
  between %FEV1 and visceral fat area (r = -0,515; p = 0,0025). On the contrary, we
  found a direct correlation between %FEV1 and body cell mass (r = 0,367; p = 0,038).
  CONCLUSIONS: Novel CFTR modulators are emerging for the treatment of CF. Specifically,
  triple combination with ELX/TEZ/IVA has shown to effectively improve both pulmonary
  and nutritional status in patients with CF with F508del mutation. Body composition
  should be a part of the routine assessment for patients with CF.'
