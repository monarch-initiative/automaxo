input_text: 'Polymyxin B and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid act synergistically against
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.Polymyxin B and ethylenediaminetetraacetic
  acid are antimicrobials possessing antibiofilm activity. They act by displacement
  and chelation, respectively, of divalent cations in bacterial membranes and may
  therefore act synergistically when applied in combination. If so, this combination
  of agents may be useful for the treatment of diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF),
  in which biofilms are present on the respiratory epithelium. We used checkerboard
  assays to investigate the synergy between these agents using reference strains Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 in planktonic form. We
  then determined the efficacy of each agent against biofilms of both species grown
  on 96-pin lids and proceeded to combination testing against the P. aeruginosa reference
  strain and 10 clinical isolates from patients with CF. Synergism was observed for
  planktonic forms of both species and for biofilms of P. aeruginosa. The susceptibility
  of biofilms of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates to these agents was variable compared
  to the laboratory reference strain. This combination of agents may be useful in
  the management of biofilm-associated conditions, particularly those amenable to
  topical therapies. These results provide a basis upon which the antimicrobial and
  antibiofilm efficacy of preparations containing these agents may be enhanced.IMPORTANCEBacteria
  living in biofilms produce a protective matrix which makes them difficult to kill.
  Patients with severe respiratory disease often have biofilms. Polymyxin B is an
  antibiotic commonly used in topical medications, such as eye drops and nasal sprays.
  Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used widely as a preservative in medication
  but also has antimicrobial properties. It has been hypothesized that Polymyxin B
  and EDTA could have a synergistic relationship: when used in combination their antimicrobial
  effect is enhanced. Here, we evaluated the levels at which Polymyxin B and EDTA
  work together to kill common pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus
  aureus. We found that Polymyxin B and EDTA were synergistic. This synergy may be
  useful in the management of planktonic infection with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus,
  or biofilm infection with P. aeruginosa. This synergy may be beneficial in the treatment
  of respiratory biofilms, in which P. aeruginosa biofilms are common.'
