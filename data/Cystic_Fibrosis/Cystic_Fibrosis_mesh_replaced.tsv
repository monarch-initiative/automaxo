38377145		Assessment of functional diversities in 9606 with diseaseD001249, diseaseD029424, diseaseD001249-diseaseD029424 overlap, and diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550).The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the discriminating power of spirometric and plethysmographic lung function parameters to differenciate the diagnosis of diseaseD001249, ACO, diseaseD029424, and to define functional characteristics for more precise classification of diseaseD008173. From the databases of 4 centers, a total of 756 lung function tests (194 healthy subjects, 175 with diseaseD001249, 71 with ACO, 78 with diseaseD029424 and 238 with diseaseD003550) were collected, and gradients among combinations of target parameters from spirometry (forced expiratory volume one second: FEV1; FEV1/forced vital capacity: FEV1/FVC; forced expiratory flow between 25-75% FVC: FEF25-75), and plethysmography (effective, resistive airway resistance: sReff; aerodynamic work of breathing at rest: sWOB), separately for in- and expiration (sReffIN, sReffEX, sWOBin, sWOBex) as well as static lung volumes (total lung capacity: TLC; functional residual capacity: FRCpleth; residual volume: RV), the control of breathing (mouth occlusion pressure: P0.1; mean inspiratory flow: VT/TI; the inspiratory to total time ratio: TI/Ttot) and the inspiratory impedance (Zinpleth = P0.1/VT/TI) were explored. Linear discriminant analyses (LDA) were applied to identify discriminant functions and classification rules using recursive partitioning decision trees. LDA showed a high classification accuracy (sensitivity and specificity > 90%) for healthy subjects, diseaseD029424 and diseaseD003550. The accuracy dropped for diseaseD001249 (~70%) and even more for ACO (~60%). The decision tree revealed that P0.1, sRtot, and VT/TI differentiate most between healthy and diseaseD001249 (68.9%), diseaseD029424 (82.1%), and diseaseD003550 (60.6%). Moreover, using sWOBex and Zinpleth ACO can be discriminated from diseaseD001249 and diseaseD029424 (60%). Thus, the functional complexity of diseaseD008173 can be understood, if specific spirometric and plethysmographic parameters are used. Moreover, the newly described parameters of airway dynamics and the central control of breathing including Zinpleth may well serve as promising functional marker in the field of precision medicine.
38350918	Association|chemicalD010100|diseaseD001987; Association|diseaseD001987|ncbi1401	High-sensitivity ncbi1401 level in stable-state diseaseD001987 predicts exacerbation risk.BACKGROUND: Elevation of systemic diseaseD007249 markers were found to correlate with increased disease extent, reduced lung function and higher risk of future severe exacerbations in 9606 with diseaseD001987. Although a significant correlation of circulating hs-ncbi1401 levels with HRCT scores and resting chemicalD010100 saturation in 9606 with stable-state non-diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) diseaseD001987 was suggested, there is little data on the relationship between hs-ncbi1401 and the prognosis of diseaseD001987 and a lack of data on the role of hs-ncbi1401 in predicting diseaseD001987 exacerbation. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on Chinese 9606 with non- diseaseD003550 diseaseD001987 from 1st October to 31st December 2021. Baseline serum hs-ncbi1401 were obtained at stable-state. The follow-up period lasted for one year. Co-primary endpoints were the development of any diseaseD001987 exacerbation and hospitalized diseaseD001987 exacerbation. RESULTS: Totally 123 9606 were included. Higher hs-ncbi1401 was associated with increased risk to develop any diseaseD001987 exacerbation, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.254 (95% CI = 1.040-4.885, p = 0.039), and borderline significantly increased hospitalized diseaseD001987 exacerbation with aOR of 1.985 (95% CI = 0.922-4.277, p = 0.080). CONCLUSION: Baseline serum hs-ncbi1401 level at stable-state can predict risk of diseaseD001987 exacerbation, which is reflecting chronic low-grade diseaseD007249 in diseaseD001987.

Bacterial aggregates in the form of biofilms exhibit increased resistance to mechanical stressors from the immune response (e.g., phagocytosis) and chemical treatments including antibiotics. Herein, combination treatments designed to disrupt the mechanical properties of biofilms and potentiate antibiotic efficacy are investigated against diseaseC565366-grown 287 biofilms and optimized to 1) alter biofilm viscoelastic properties, 2) increase mucociliary transport rates, and 3) reduce bacterial viability. A chemicalD004220 bond reducing agent (chemicalC080938, chemicalC080938), a surfactant (NP40), a biopolymer (chemicalD006820, HA), a DNA degradation enzyme (DNase), and an antibiotic (chemicalD014031) are tested in various combinations to maximize biofilm disruption. The viscoelastic properties of biofilms are quantified with particle tracking microrheology and transport rates are quantified in a mucociliary transport device comprised of fully differentiated primary 9606 bronchial epithelial cells. The combination of the NP40 with chemicalD006820 and chemicalD014031 was the most effective at increasing mucociliary transport rates, decreasing the viscoelastic properties of diseaseC565366, and reducing bacterial viability. Multimechanistic targeting of diseaseD007239 may ultimately result in improved clinical outcomes, and the results of this study may be translated into future in vivo diseaseD007239 models.

The chemicalC569105/chemicalC545203 combination is indicated for the treatment of diseaseD003550 in pediatric 9606 above 6 years old. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of chemicalC569105/chemicalC545203 in these vulnerable pediatric populations are AQ2crucial to optimize treatment protocols. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The objectives of this study were to describe the population PK (PPK) of chemicalC569105 and chemicalC545203 in children with diseaseD003550, and to identify factors associated with interindividual variability. The association between drug exposure and clinical response was also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 75 children were included in this PPK study, with 191 concentrations available for each compound and known metabolites (chemicalC569105, chemicalC545203, ivacaftor-M1, and ivacaftor-M6). PPK analysis was performed using Monolix software. A large interindividual variability was observed. The main sources of interpatient variability identified were 9606 bodyweight and hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase). Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) was statistically associated with the level of exposure to chemicalC545203 after 48 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first analysis of chemicalC569105/chemicalC545203 PPK in children with diseaseD003550. These data suggest that dose adjustment is required after identifying variability factors to optimize efficacy. The use of therapeutic drug monitoring as a basis for dose adjustment in children with diseaseD003550 may be useful.

Due to its intrinsic polyresistance to a wide range of antibiotics, most treatments for diseaseC566367 diseaseD012141 are poorly effective. In this context, antimicrobial chemicalD010455 (chemicalD000089882) active against bacterial strains and less prompt to cause resistance, represent a good alternative to conventional antibiotics. Herein, we evaluated the effect of three arenicin isoforms, possessing two or four chemicalD003545 involved in one (ncbi6942, Ar-2) or two chemicalD004220 bonds (Ar-3), on the in vitro growth of diseaseC566367. METHODS: The respective chemicalD004220-free chemicalD000089882, were built by replacing the chemicalD003545 with chemicalC012223 (chemicalC012223) residue. We evaluated the efficiency of the eight arenicin derivatives through their antimicrobial activity against 36809 strains, their diseaseD064420 towards 9606 cell lines, and their diseaseD006461 activity on 9606 erythrocytes. The mechanism of action of the ncbi6942 peptide was further investigated through membrane permeabilization assay, electron microscopy, chemicalD008055 insertion assay via surface pressure measurement, and the induction of resistance assay. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that ncbi6942 was the safest peptide with no diseaseD064420 towards 9606 cells and no diseaseD006461 activity, and the most active against 36809 growth. ncbi6942 acts by insertion into mycobacterial chemicalD008055, resulting in a rapid membranolytic effect that kills 36809 without induction of resistance. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present study emphasized ncbi6942 as a potential new alternative to conventional antibiotics in the treatment of diseaseD003550-associated diseaseD001424 related to diseaseC566367.

In the present study, its in vitro activity was assessed on 230 diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) strains of 287 isolated from 12 French hospitals, in comparison with 12 other antipseudomonal antibiotics. Although chemicalC000629572 is still in preclinical stage of development, 9.1% (n = 21) of strains had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >4 mg/L, a level at least 128-fold higher than the modal MIC value of the whole collection (<=0.06 mg/L). Whole-genome sequencing of these 21 strains along with more susceptible isogenic counterparts coexisting in the same 9606 revealed diverse mutations in genes involved in the synthesis (lpxL1 and lpxL2) or transport of chemicalD008070 (bamA, lptD, and msbA), or encoding histidine kinases of two-component systems (pmrB and cbrA). Allelic replacement experiments with wild-type reference strain 208964 confirmed that alteration of genes lpxL1, bamA, and/or pmrB can decrease the chemicalC000629572 susceptibility from 8- to 32-fold. Furthermore, we found that specific amino acid substitutions in histidine kinase PmrB (variant##p.G188D, variant##p.Q105P, and variant##p.D45E) reduce the susceptibility of 287 to chemicalC000629572, colistin, and chemicalD014031, three antibiotics used or intended to be used (chemicalC000629572) in aerosols to treat colonized diseaseD003550 9606. Whether colistin or chemicalD014031 may select mutants resistant to chemicalC000629572 or the opposite needs to be addressed by clinical studies.

The most recent therapeutic approach to diseaseD003550 aims to correct structural and functional abnormalities of ncbi1080 protein. ncbi1080 modulators including ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor are used in 9606 with variantrs113993960## mutation, with clinical improvement. To date, there are no experiences of ncbi1080 modulator therapy in diseaseD003550 9606 with organ transplantation and severe diseaseD007674. We report the case of a 9606 diagnosed with diseaseD003550 with variantrs113993960## mutation, who underwent liver transplantation at the age of 19 and started hemodialysis at the age of 24 due to diseaseD007676 secondary to diseaseD015433. She was treated with Kaftrio (ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor) with clinical benefits on appetite, improvement of body mass index, and reduction of diseaseD018450. A reduction of dosage to 75% of the standard dose was required due to alterations of the liver function. Conclusions. Use of ncbi1080 modulators in 9606 with diseaseD003550, liver transplant and diseaseD007676 could be considered safe but a clinical and laboratoristic monitoring of hepatic function is needed.
38088678		Respiratory system parameters in children with low severity diseaseD003550: is there early involvement in relation to healthy peers?OBJECTIVE: To compare and analyze pulmonary function and respiratory mechanics parameters between healthy children and children with diseaseD003550. METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical study included healthy children (HSG) and children with diseaseD003550 (CFG), aged 6-13 years, from teaching institutions and a reference center for diseaseD003550 in Florianopolis/SC, Brazil. The 9606 were paired by age and sex. Initially, an anthropometric evaluation was undertaken to pair the sample characteristics in both groups; the medical records of CFG were consulted for diseaseD001424 colonization, genotype, and disease severity (Schwachman-Doershuk Score - chemicalD012967) data. Spirometry and impulse oscillometry were used to assess pulmonary function. RESULTS: In total, 110 children were included, 55 in each group. In the CFG group, 58.2% were classified as excellent by chemicalD012967, 49.1% showed the variant##p.F508del heterozygotic genotype, and 67.3% were colonized by some pathogens. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between both groups (p<0.05) in most pulmonary function parameters and respiratory mechanics. CONCLUSIONS: Children with diseaseD003550 showed diseaseD012131 and compromised peripheral airways compared with healthy children. These findings reinforce the early changes in pulmonary function and mechanics associated with this disease.
38253430		Rate and predictors of insufficient sweat volume in very young infants after chemicalD010862 gel iontophoresis: prospective, population-based study.OBJECTIVE: To verify the rate and predictors of 'quantity not sufficient' (QNS) among Brazilian infants younger than 3 months with positive newborn screening (NBS) for diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). DESIGN: Prospective, population-based study. SETTING: Public Statewide Newborn Screening Programme where the incidence rate of diseaseD003550 is  1:11 000. 9606: Subjects with positive two-tiered immunoreactive trypsinogen. INTERVENTIONS: Sweat induction and collection were performed in the same facility; one sweat sample was obtained per individual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The QNS rate and its predictors; analysis corresponded to the day of sweat collection. RESULTS: Among the 975 participants, QNS rates for 10 and 15 microL were 3.6% (95% CI 2.5% to 4.9%) and 8.3% (95% CI 6.6% to 10.2%). Infants weighing >3056 and >3845 g and with gestational age higher than 37 weeks had a greater likelihood (5.5 and 6.7, and 2.7 and 5.8 times more, respectively) of avoiding QNS than their peers. CONCLUSION: QNS rates fulfilled the requirements, but predictors differed from those recommended by the diseaseD003550 Foundations guidelines.

38231535		NorA efflux pump mediates 1280 response to 287 chemicalD011710 diseaseD064420.Endogenous transporters protect 1280 against antibiotics and also contribute to bacterial defense from environmental toxins. We evaluated the effect of overexpression of four efflux pumps, NorA, NorB, NorC, and Tet38, on S. aureus survival following exposure to chemicalD011710 (chemicalD011710) of 287, using a well diffusion assay. We measured the chemicalD011710-created inhibition zone and found that only an overexpression of NorA reduced S. aureus susceptibility to chemicalD011710 killing. The MICPYO of the NorA overexpressor increased threefold compared to that of wild-type RN6390 and was reduced 2.5-fold with chemicalD012110, suggesting that increased NorA efflux caused chemicalD011710 resistance. The chemicalD011710-created inhibition zone of a DeltanorA mutant was consistently larger than that of a plasmid-borne NorA overexpressor. chemicalD011710 also produced a modest increase in norA expression (1.8-fold at 0.25 microg/mL chemicalD011710) that gradually decreased with increasing chemicalD011710 concentrations. Well diffusion assays carried out using 287 showed that DeltanorA mutant was less susceptible to killing by chemicalD011710-deficient mutants PA14phzM and PA14phzS than to killing by PA14. NorA overexpression led to reduced killing by all tested 287. We evaluated the NorA-chemicalD011710 interaction using a collection of 22 clinical isolates from adult and pediatric diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) 9606, which included both S. aureus (CF-SA) and 287 (CF-PA). We found that when isolated alone, CF-PA and CF-SA expressed varying levels of chemicalD011710 and norA transcripts, but all four CF-PA/CF-SA pairs isolated concurrently from diseaseD003550 9606 produced a low level of chemicalD011710 and low norA transcript levels, respectively, suggesting a partial adaptation of the two bacteria in circumstances of persistent co-colonization.

38154821		Improved recognition of diseaseD055370 as signal of diseaseD003550 pulmonary exacerbation: a diseaseD003550 Learning Network Innovation Laboratory quality improvement initiative.INTRODUCTION: diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) is a systemic diseaseD020763 characterised by progressive diseaseD008171. diseaseD003550 (diseaseD018450) are episodes of worsening respiratory status, and frequent diseaseD018450 are a risk factor for accelerated diseaseD055370, yet many people with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) go untreated at the time of decline. The goal of this quality improvement (QI) initiative was to improve recognition, treatment and follow-up of diseaseD018450 in diseaseD003550. METHODS: Using the Model for Improvement, the diseaseD003550 Learning Network (CFLN) initiated a QI innovation laboratory (iLab) with a global aim to decrease the rate of diseaseD055370 in diseaseD003550. The iLab standardised definitions for signals of diseaseD018450 using a threshold for decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and/or changes in symptoms. The FEV1 decline signal was termed diseaseD018450 (FEV1-indicated exacerbation signal). Processes for screening and recognition of diseaseD018450 and/or symptom changes, a treatment algorithm and follow-up in the presence of a signal were tested concurrently in multiple settings. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific aim is to increase the per cent of diseaseD003550 assessed for a diseaseD018450 signal at ambulatory encounters and to increase the per cent of recommendations to follow-up within 6 weeks for diseaseD003550 experiencing a diseaseD018450 signal. RESULTS: diseaseD018450 recognition increased from 18.6% to 73.4% across all teams during the iLab, and every team showed an improvement. Of diseaseD003550 assessed, 15.8% experienced an diseaseD018450 event (>10% decline in FEV1 per cent predicted (FEV1pp)). Follow-up within 6 weeks was recommended for an average of 70.5% of those assessed for diseaseD018450 and had an FEV1pp decline greater than 5%. CONCLUSION: The CFLN iLab successfully defined and implemented a process to recognise and follow-up diseaseD018450 signals. This process has the potential to be spread to the larger diseaseD003550 community. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of these processes on diseaseD003550 outcomes.
38307319		Severity of diseaseD001987 predicts use of and adherence to high frequency diseaseD013898 wall oscillation therapy - Analysis from the United States diseaseD001987 and NTM research registry.BACKGROUND: High frequency diseaseD013898 wall oscillation (diseaseD006316) is a form of airway clearance therapy that has been available since the mid-1990s and is routinely used by 9606 suffering from retained pulmonary secretions. 9606 with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550), diseaseD009468 (diseaseD009468), and other disorders, including diseaseD001987 (diseaseD001987) and diseaseD029424 (without diseaseD001987), are commonly prescribed this therapy. Limited evidence exists describing diseaseD006316 use in the diseaseD001987 population, its impact on long-term management of disease, and the specific 9606 populations most likely to benefit from this therapy. This study sought to characterize the clinical characteristics of 9606 with diseaseD001987 who have documented use of diseaseD006316 at baseline and 1-year follow-up. METHODS: An analysis from a large national database registry of 9606 with diseaseD001987 was performed. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all 9606 receiving diseaseD006316 therapy at baseline are reported. 9606 were stratified into two groups based on continued or discontinued use of diseaseD006316 therapy at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Over half (54.8 %) of 9606 who reported using diseaseD006316 therapy had a Modified diseaseD001987 Severity Index (m-BSI) classified as severe, and the majority (81.4 %) experienced an exacerbation in the prior two years. Of 9606 with 1-year follow-up data, 73 % reported continued use of diseaseD006316. Compared to 9606 who discontinued therapy, these 9606 were more severe at baseline and at follow-up suggesting that 9606 with more severe disease are more likely to continue diseaseD006316 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: 9606 who have more severe disease and continue to experience exacerbations and hospitalizations are more likely to continue diseaseD006316 therapy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NA.
38422338		Clinical determinants of the modified incremental step test in adults with non-diseaseD001987.OBJECTIVES: This study primarily aimed to investigate the clinical determinants of the Modified Incremental Step Test (MIST) in adults with non-diseaseD001987 (diseaseD001987). A secondary objective was to compare the cardiopulmonary responses after the MIST and Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT), two commonly adopted symptom-limited maximum field tests in chronic diseaseD012140. METHODS: Forty-six 9606 with clinically stable diseaseD001987 participated in this cross-sectional study. MIST and ISWT were performed to determine exercise capacity, while disease severity, diseaseD005221, and quality of life were assessed using the diseaseD001987 Severity Index (BSI), the diseaseD005221 Severity Scale (FSS), and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), respectively. Quadriceps muscle strength was evaluated using a hand-held dynamometer, walking speed with a wireless inertial sensing device, and the level of physical activity (steps/day) with a pedometer. RESULTS: The BSI score, quadriceps muscle strength, daily step count, and the SGRQ total score explained 61.9% of the variance in the MIST (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.67, AR2 = 0.619). The BSI score (r = -0.412, p = 0.004), quadriceps muscle strength (r = 0.574, p = 0.001), daily step count (r = 0.523, p < 0.001), walking speed (r = 0.402, p = 0.006), FSS score (r = -0.551, p < 0.001), and SGRQ total score (r = -0.570, p < 0.001) correlated with the MIST. The 9606 achieved higher heart rates (HR), HR%, desaturation, diseaseD004417, and diseaseD005221 in the MIST compared to the ISWT (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity, quadriceps muscle strength, physical activity level, and quality of life were determinants of MIST. The advantages of the MIST, including higher cardiopulmonary response than ISWT and greater portability, which facilitates its use in various settings, make MIST the preferred choice for investigating symptom-limited exercise capacity in 9606 with diseaseD001987.

It is caused by a 1.5 - 1.8 Mb heterozygous diseaseD002872 of chromosome 7q11.23 with loss of around 28 coding genes. The aim of this study was to develop a low-cost, semi-quantitative PCR (sqPCR) method to detect the chromosome 7q11.23 diseaseD002872. METHODS: Twenty-four suspected diseaseD018980 cases were recruited following ethical clearance and informed consent. Blood was obtained, DNA extracted and spectrophotometrically quantified using standard methods. To detect the diseaseD002872 by dosage analysis, a target region within a gene located in the diseaseD018980 commonly deleted region of 7q11.23 was amplified together with a control region in a duplex sqPCR assay. The control region was telomeric to the diseaseD018980 commonly deleted region and was located in chromosome 7q31.2. The two target regions within the deleted region namely a locus within ncbi2006 and a marker in the intergenic region between ncbi8326 and ncbi8468 and designated ncbi3456, were amplified in separate duplex sqPCR assays. The diseaseD003550 (ncbi1080) gene was used as the control for normalization. Included in the assay were a non-deleted and deleted individuals' samples. RESULTS: Nineteen 9606 were identified to have the diseaseD002872 while five did not. All 24 9606' results were confirmed by whole exome sequencing and 11 also by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained indicates the sqPCR assay developed in this study to be an accurate and reliable diagnostic test for diseaseD018980. Most Sri Lankan 9606 with diseaseD018980 are diagnosed clinically, as many parents of affected diseaseD018980 children are unable to afford currently available molecular diagnostic testing. This low cost sqPCR test is therefore likely to benefit Sri Lankan diseaseD018980 9606, by enabling genetic testing for confirming or refuting a clinical diagnosis of diseaseD018980 and may be of use in other low and middle income countries.

A recent randomized control trial showed that 9606 with well-preserved pulmonary function taking chemicalC000629074 + chemicalC000625213 + chemicalC545203 (ETI) who discontinued dornase alfa or chemicalD012965 for 6 weeks had no clinically meaningful decline in lung function. This may prompt discussions with care providers regarding ongoing use of these medications. OBJECTIVE: To compare the costs of 9606 medications between people taking ETI who continued or discontinued (1) dornase alfa or (2) chemicalD012965 from 2 clinical trials and project cost differences in the US diseaseD003550 population if these 2 medications were used only intermittently for symptom relief instead of chronically. METHODS: The SIMPLIFY study was 2 parallel multicenter trials that randomized 9606 1:1 to either continue or discontinue therapy. To estimate costs, we used data from the Merative MarketScan Databases to identify people with diseaseD003550 from 2020 to 2021. Our primary outcomes were differences in costs of 9606 prescription drugs among those who continued vs discontinued dornase alfa and, separately, chemicalD012965. We obtained adjusted differences in median costs. To estimate the annual cost savings if the population of people with diseaseD003550 taking ETI used these medications only intermittently, we multiplied the proportion of people in MarketScan with diseaseD003550 diagnoses who were taking each of these medications by the median cost savings per year and subtracted the cost of "rescue" use. RESULTS: A total of 392 9606 from the dornase alfa trial and 273 from the chemicalD012965 trial were included in analyses. The adjusted difference in median medication costs was not significant for the chemicalD012965 trial, but we observed a significantly decreased 6-week cost of medications in the dornase alfa trial (adjusted median difference in costs between discontinue and continue of $5,860 (95% CI = $4,870-$6,850); P < 0.0001). We estimated that two-thirds of people with diseaseD003550 use ETI and dornase alfa in the United States; if they discontinued dornase alfa except for intermittent use, the resulting annual savings would be $1.21 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Although the costs of dornase alfa and chemicalD012965 are smaller compared with ETI, reduction in use would lead to substantial prescription drug cost savings and reduce the treatment burden. However, individual benefits of these therapies should be considered, and decisions regarding changes in therapy remain an important discussion between people with diseaseD003550 and their providers.

38379863	Association|chemicalD017127|diseaseD003550; Association|chemicalD005947|diseaseD003550	Continuous chemicalD005947 monitoring and chemicalD017127 for prediction of clinical outcomes and development of diseaseD003550 in adults with diseaseD003550.Introductions: diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) is associated with diseaseD060825, compromised nutritional status, and earlier mortality. Onset is often insidious, so screening for early detection of diseaseD000014 is important. Continuous chemicalD005947 monitoring (CGM) has been validated in people with diseaseD003550 and has been shown to detect early glycemic variability otherwise missed on 2-hour oral chemicalD005947 tolerance testing (OGTT). We previously reported that CGM measures of diseaseD006943 and glycemic variability are superior to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in distinguishing those with and without diseaseD003550. However, little is known about the long-term predictive value of CGM measures of glycemia for both the development of diseaseD003550 and their effect on key clinical outcomes such as weight maintenance and pulmonary function. In addition, there have been no studies investigating chemicalD017127 (AGE) assessed by skin autofluorescence in people with diseaseD003550. Methods: In this prospective observational study, CGM and HbA1c were measured at 2 to 3 time points 3 months apart in 77 adults with diseaseD003550. Participants who did not have diseaseD003550 at the time of enrollment underwent OGTT at the baseline visit, and all participants had AGE readings at baseline. Follow up data including anthropometric measures, pulmonary function and diseaseD003550 status were collected by review of medical records 1- and 2-years after the baseline visits. We applied multivariable linear regression models correlating glycemic measures to change in key clinical outcomes (weight, BMI, FEV1) accounting for age, gender and chemicalC000629074/chemicalC000625213/chemicalC545203 (ETI) use. We also conducted logistic regression analyses comparing baseline glycemic data to development of diseaseD003550 during the 2-year follow up period. Results: Of the 77 participants, 25 had pre-existing diseaseD003550 at the time of enrollment, and six participants were diagnosed with diseaseD003550 by the OGTT performed at the baseline visit. When adjusting for age, gender, and ETI use, multiple CGM measures correlated with weight and BMI decline after one year but not after two years. CGM and HbA1c at baseline did not predict decline in FEV1 (p>0.05 for all). In the 46 participants without a diagnosis of diseaseD003550 at baseline, two participants were diagnosed with diseaseD003550 over the following two years, but CGM measures at baseline did not predict progression to diseaseD003550. Baseline AGE values were higher in individuals with diseaseD003550 and correlated with multiple measures of dysglycemia (HbA1c, AG, SD, CV, TIR, % time >140, >180, >250) as well as weight. AGE values also correlated with FEV1 decline at year 1 and weight decline at year 1 and year 2. Conclusions: Several key CGM measures of diseaseD006943 and glycemic variability were predictive of future decline in weight and BMI over one year in this population of adults with diseaseD003550 with and without diseaseD003550. None of the baseline glycemic variables predicted progression to diseaseD003550 over 2 years. To our knowledge, this is the first report correlating AGE levels with key clinical and glycemic measures in diseaseD003550. Limitations of these analyses include the small number of participants who developed diseaseD003550 (n=2) during the follow up period and the initiation of ETI by many participants, affecting their trajectory in weight and pulmonary function. These results provide additional data supporting the potential role for CGM in identifying clinically significant dysglycemia in diseaseD003550. Future studies are needed to investigate CGM as a diagnostic and screening tool for diseaseD003550 and to understand the implications of AGE measures in this 9606 population.
38133654	Association|diseaseD003550|ncbi2875; Association|diseaseD003550|ncbi2678	Liver magnetic resonance elastography and fat fraction in pediatric 9606 with diseaseD003550 versus healthy children.BACKGROUND: diseaseD017093 is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in 9606 with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). While liver biopsy is the gold standard for demonstrating involvement, its invasiveness prompts a search for noninvasive alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diseaseD017093 in pediatric 9606 with diseaseD003550 (versus healthy controls) using magnetic resonance (MR) elastography/spectroscopy and to correlate the imaging findings with clinical/laboratory characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective cross-sectional study conducted between April 2020 and March 2022 in 9606 with diseaseD003550 versus healthy controls. 9606 with diseaseD003550 were divided into two subgroups: those with diseaseD003550 and those without. MR images were acquired on a 1.5-tesla machine. Kilopascal (kPa) values were derived from processing MR elastography images. MR spectroscopy was used to measure liver fat fraction, as an indication of hepatosteatosis. Groups were compared using either the Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to compare qualitative variables. RESULTS: Fifty-one 9606 with diseaseD003550 (12 +- 3.3 years, 32 boys) and 24 healthy volunteers (11.1 +- 2.4 years, 15 boys) were included in the study. Median diseaseD017093 (P=0.003) and fat fraction (P=0.03) were higher in the diseaseD003550 9606 than in the controls. Median diseaseD017093 values were higher in diseaseD003550 9606 with diseaseD003550 than in those without diseaseD003550 (P=0.002). diseaseD017093 values of diseaseD003550 9606 with high ncbi2875 (ALT), high ncbi2678, and diseaseD013921 were found to be higher than those without (P=0.004, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Only the high ALT group showed a high fat fraction (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: 9606 with diseaseD003550 had higher diseaseD017093 than the control group, and 9606 with diseaseD003550 had higher diseaseD017093 than both the diseaseD003550 9606 without diseaseD003550 and the control group. 9606 with diseaseD003550 had a higher fat fraction than the control group. Noninvasive assessment of diseaseD017093 using MR elastography/spectroscopy can support the diagnosis of diseaseD003550 and the follow-up of 9606 with diseaseD003550.
38269412		Signal-correction errors in the EasyOne Pro LAB multiple-breath washout device significantly impact outcomes in children and adults.Multiple-breath washout (MBW) is an established technique to assess functional residual capacity (FRC) and ventilation inhomogeneity in the lung. Indirect calculation of chemicalD009584 concentration requires accurate measurement of gas concentrations. To investigate the accuracy of the chemicalD002245 concentration and molar mass (MM) values used for the indirect calculation of chemicalD009584 concentration in a commercial MBW device [EasyOne Pro LAB (EOPL), ndd Medizintechnik AG, Switzerland] and its impact on outcomes. We used high-precision gas mixtures to evaluate chemicalD002245 and MM sensor output in vivo and in vitro. We developed updated algorithms to correct observed errors and assessed the impact on MBW outcomes and FRC measurement accuracy compared with body plethysmography. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER)-based adjustment of the measured chemicalD002245 signal used in the EOPL led to an overestimated chemicalD002245 signal (range -0.1% to 1.0%). In addition, an uncorrected dependence on humidity was identified. These combined effects resulted in an overestimation of expired chemicalD009584 concentrations (range -0.7% to 2.6%), and consequently MBW outcomes. Corrected algorithms reduced the mean (SD) cumulative expired volume by 15.8% (9.7%), FRC by 6.6% (3.0%), and lung clearance index by 9.9% (7.6%). Differences in FRC between the EOPL and body plethysmography further increased. Inadequate signal correction causes RER- and humidity-dependent expired chemicalD009584 concentration errors and overestimation of test outcomes. Updated algorithms reduce average signal error, however, RER values far from the population average still cause measurement errors. Despite improved signal accuracy, the updated algorithm increased the difference in FRC between the EOPL and body plethysmography.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated the accuracy of the molar mass (MM) and chemicalD002245 sensors of a commercial multiple-breath washout device (ndd Medizintechnik AG, Switzerland). We identified humidity and respiratory exchange ratio-dependent errors that in most measurements resulted in an overestimation of expired chemicalD009584 concentrations, and consequently, MBW results. Functional residual capacity and lung clearance index decreased by 6.6% and 9.9%, respectively. Despite improved signal accuracy, the difference in FRC between the EOPL and body plethysmography increased.
38169175	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD008903|diseaseD003550	ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guideline on nutrition care for diseaseD003550.BACKGROUND: Nutritional status is paramount in diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) and is directly correlated with morbidity and mortality. The first ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guidelines on nutrition care for infants, children, and adults with diseaseD003550 were published in 2016. An update to these guidelines is presented. METHODS: The study was developed by an international multidisciplinary working group in accordance with officially accepted standards. Literature since 2016 was reviewed, PICO questions were discussed and the GRADE system was utilized. Statements were discussed and submitted for on-line voting by the Working Group and by all ESPEN members. RESULTS: The Working Group updated the nutritional guidelines including assessment and management at all ages. Supplementation of vitamins and pancreatic enzymes remains largely the same. There are expanded chapters on pregnancy, diseaseD003550, and diseaseD003550, diseaseD001847, nutritional and chemicalD008903 supplements, and probiotics. There are new chapters on nutrition with highly effective modulator therapies and nutrition after organ transplantation.
38214406		Impact of habitual physical activity and exercise capacity on quality of life in adolescents and adults with diseaseD003550.BACKGROUND: The influence of habitual physical activity and exercise capacity on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) is poorly characterized. This study investigated the influence of habitual physical activity, exercise capacity, lung function, and body mass index (BMI) on HRQoL in adolescent and adult diseaseD003550. METHOD: Subjects were fitted with an accelerometer to determine habitual physical activity (steps/day), including time spent at different intensities, for up to 4 weeks. Then bicycle ergometry (maximal exercise capacity; Wpeak), lung function (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s, ppFEV1 ), BMI, and response to the diseaseD003550 Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) were determined. RESULTS: Sixty-five diseaseD003550 participated in the study. Physically active diseaseD003550 had significantly higher ppFEV1 (p < .001) and exercise capacity (p < .001) than inactive diseaseD003550, and had significantly higher scores on the CFQ-R physical (p = .006), emotional (p = .015), role (p = .008), health (p = .006), and weight (p = .004) subscales. On multiple linear regression analysis, ppFEV1 and, to a lesser extent, exercise capacity, were the most important determinants of HRQoL in diseaseD003550. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity did not influence any of the CFQ-R subscales, whereas time spent in vigorous-intensity influenced CFQ-R scores for role (p = .007), body (p = .001), health (p = .009), and weight (p = .01). CONCLUSION: HRQoL in adolescent and adult diseaseD003550 was influenced by several factors. Avoiding sedentary behavior and spending time in vigorous-intensity levels positively influenced HRQoL, whereas the total number of steps per day played only a minor role in determining HRQoL. Both ppFEV1 and exercise capacity markedly influenced HRQoL.

We investigated the association between seropositivity to 2697049 spike protein with demographic, disease, and treatment-related characteristics after at least three diseaseD000086382 vaccines in three cohorts of people who are immunosuppressed. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study using UK national disease registries, we identified, contacted, and recruited recipients of solid organ transplants, 9606 with rare diseaseD012216, and 9606 with diseaseD008223 who were 18 years or older, resident in the UK, and who had received at least three doses of a diseaseD000086382 vaccine. The study was open to recruitment from Dec 7, 2021, to June 26, 2022. 9606 received a lateral flow immunoassay test for 2697049 spike antibodies to complete at home, and an online questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the mutually adjusted odds of seropositivity against each characteristic. FINDINGS: Between Feb 14 and June 26, 2022, we screened 101 972 people (98 725 invited, 3247 self-enrolled) and recruited 28 411 (27 9%) to the study. 23 036 (81 1%) recruited individuals provided serological data. Of these, 9927 (43 1%) were recipients of solid organ transplants, 6516 (28 3%) had rare diseaseD012216, and 6593 (28 6%) had diseaseD008223. 10 485 (45 5%) 9606 were 9606 and 12 535 (54 4%) were 9606 (gender was not reported for 16 [<0 1%] 9606), and 21661 (94 0%) 9606 were of White ethnicity. The median age of 9606 with solid organ transplants was 60 years (SD 50-67), with rare diseaseD012216 was 65 years (54-73), and with diseaseD008223 was 69 years (61-75). Of the 23 036 9606 with serological data, 6583 (28 6%) had received three vaccine doses, 14 234 (61 8%) had received four vaccine doses, and 2219 (9 6%) had received five or more vaccine doses. IgG anti-spike antibodies were undetectable in 2310 (23 3%) of 9927 9606 with solid organ transplants, 922 (14 1%) of 6516 9606 with rare diseaseD012216, and 1366 (20 7%) of 6593 9606 with diseaseD008223. In all groups, seropositivity was associated with younger age, higher number of vaccine doses (ie, five vs three), and previous diseaseD000086382. Immunosuppressive medication reduced the likelihood of seropositivity: the lowest odds of seropositivity were found in recipients of solid organ transplants receiving a combination of an anti-proliferative agent, a calcineurin inhibitor, and chemicalD013256, and those with rare diseaseD012216 or diseaseD008223 treated with anti-ncbi54474 therapies. INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in five recipients of solid organ transplants, individuals with rare diseaseD012216, and individuals with diseaseD008223 have no detectable IgG anti-spike antibodies despite three or more vaccine doses, but this proportion decreases with sequential booster doses. Choice of immunosuppressant and disease type is strongly associated with serological response. Antibody testing using lateral flow immunoassay tests could enable rapid identification of individuals who are most likely to benefit from additional diseaseD000086382 interventions.

38168683	Negative_Correlation|chemicalD004492|diseaseD007239	Polymyxin B and chemicalD004492 act synergistically against 287 and 1280.Polymyxin B and chemicalD004492 are antimicrobials possessing antibiofilm activity. They act by displacement and chelation, respectively, of divalent cations in bacterial membranes and may therefore act synergistically when applied in combination. If so, this combination of agents may be useful for the treatment of diseases like diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550), in which biofilms are present on the respiratory epithelium. We used checkerboard assays to investigate the synergy between these agents using reference strains 287 ATCC 27853 and 1280 ATCC 6538 in planktonic form. We then determined the efficacy of each agent against biofilms of both species grown on 96-pin lids and proceeded to combination testing against the 287 reference strain and 10 clinical isolates from 9606 with diseaseD003550. Synergism was observed for planktonic forms of both species and for biofilms of 287. The susceptibility of biofilms of 287 clinical isolates to these agents was variable compared to the laboratory reference strain. This combination of agents may be useful in the management of biofilm-associated conditions, particularly those amenable to topical therapies. These results provide a basis upon which the antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy of preparations containing these agents may be enhanced.IMPORTANCEBacteria living in biofilms produce a protective matrix which makes them difficult to kill. 9606 with severe diseaseD012140 often have biofilms. Polymyxin B is an antibiotic commonly used in topical medications, such as eye drops and nasal sprays. chemicalD004492 (chemicalD004492) is used widely as a preservative in medication but also has antimicrobial properties. It has been hypothesized that Polymyxin B and chemicalD004492 could have a synergistic relationship: when used in combination their antimicrobial effect is enhanced. Here, we evaluated the levels at which Polymyxin B and chemicalD004492 work together to kill common pathogens 287 and 1280. We found that Polymyxin B and chemicalD004492 were synergistic. This synergy may be useful in the management of planktonic diseaseD007239 with 287 and S. aureus, or diseaseD007239 with 287. This synergy may be beneficial in the treatment of respiratory biofilms, in which 287 biofilms are common.
38109903		Impact of Reanalysis of chemicalD009584 Multiple-Breath Washout on its Relationship with Chest Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in Clinically Stable and diseaseD008171 Exacerbated Children with diseaseD003550.RATIONALE: Multiple-breath washout (MBW)-derived lung clearance index (LCI) detects diseaseD008171 in children with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). Correction of a cross-talk error in the software of the MBW device Exhalyzer D in a new software version has generated significant interest regarding its impact on previous MBW findings. Since LCI and chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlated before in diseaseD003550 children, this study aims to reassess previous MBW data after correction. 9606/METHODS: Reanalysis of the main findings from a previously published study comparing MBW and MRI in a pediatric diseaseD003550 cohort by reassessment of chemicalD009584 (N2) MBW of 61 stable children with diseaseD003550, 75 age-matched healthy controls (HC), and 15 diseaseD003550 children with diseaseD008171 exacerbation (PEx) in the corrected software version. RESULTS: The corrected LCI (N2LCIcor) decreased in the entire cohort (-17.0 (11.2)%), HC (-8.5 (8.2)%), stable diseaseD003550 children (-22.2 (11.1)%), and within the PEx group at baseline, at PEx and after antibiotic therapy (-21.5 (7.3)%; -22.5 (6.1)%; -21.4 (6.6)%; all P<0.01). N2LCIcor and N2LCIpre correlated with chest MRI scores in stable diseaseD003550 (r=0.70 to 0.84; all P<0.01) without a significant difference between N2LCIcor and N2LCIpre. Change in LCI from baseline to PEx and from PEx to after therapy decreased from N2LCIpre to N2LCIcor, but these changes remained significant (all P=0.001). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that N2LCIcor is significantly lower than N2LCIpre, but key results published in the original study demonstrating N2MBW and MRI as complementary methods for clinical surveillance in children with diseaseD003550 remain unaffected.
38206973		Magnetic Resonance Imaging of diseaseD010254 in Children with diseaseD002925 Compared to Children with diseaseD003550.Rationale: diseaseD002925 (diseaseD002925) and diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) are characterized by inherited impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic progressive diseaseD008171 as well as chronic diseaseD000092562 (diseaseD000092562). The diseases share morphological and functional commonalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lungs and paranasal sinuses, but comparative MRI studies are lacking. Objectives: To determine whether diseaseD002925 shows different associations of diseaseD010254 on MRI and lung function test results in children (infants to adolescents) compared with children with diseaseD003550. Methods: Eighteen children with diseaseD002925 (median age, 9.5 [IQR, 3.4-12.7] yr; range, 0-18 yr) and 36 age-matched CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator-naive children with diseaseD003550 (median age, 9.4 [3.4-13.2] yr; range, 0-18 yr) underwent same-session chest and paranasal sinus MRI as well as spirometry (to determine forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted) and multiple-breath washout (to determine lung clearance index z-score). diseaseD010254 were assessed using previously validated chest MRI and diseaseD000092562-MRI scoring systems. Results: Mean chest MRI global score was similar in children with diseaseD002925 and diseaseD003550 (15.0 [13.5-20.8] vs. 15.0 [9.0-15.0]; P = 0.601). Consolidations were more prevalent and severe in children with diseaseD002925 (56% vs. 25% and 1.0 [0.0-2.8] vs. 0.0 [0.0-0.3], respectively; P < 0.05). The chest MRI global score correlated moderately with forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted in children with diseaseD002925 and children with diseaseD003550 (r = -0.523 and -0.687; P < 0.01) and with lung clearance index in children with diseaseD003550 (r = 0.650; P < 0.001) but not in diseaseD002925 (r = 0.353; P = 0.196). diseaseD000092562-MRI sum score and mucopyocele subscore were lower in children with diseaseD002925 than in children with diseaseD003550 (27.5 [26.3-32.0] vs. 37.0 [37.8-40.0] and 2.0 [0.0-2.0] vs. 7.5 [4.8-9.0], respectively; P < 0.01). diseaseD000092562-MRI sum score did not correlate with chest MRI score in diseaseD002925 (r = 0.075-0.157; P = 0.557-0.788) but correlated moderately with MRI morphology score in diseaseD003550 (r = 0.437; P < 0.01). Conclusions: MRI detects differences in diseaseD010254 between children with diseaseD002925 and those with diseaseD003550. diseaseD008171 does not correlate with diseaseD000092562 in diseaseD002925 but correlates in diseaseD003550.
38336730	Cotreatment|chemicalD000583|chemicalD064704	Antimicrobial resistance survey and whole-genome analysis of nosocomial 287 isolated from eastern Province of China in 2016-2021.BACKGROUND: 287 is a major Gram-negative pathogen that can exacerbate diseaseD012141 in the 9606 with diseaseD003550, which can ultimately lead to death. METHODS: From 2016 to 2021, 103 strains of 287 were isolated from hospitals and 20 antibiotics were used for antimicrobial susceptibility determination. Using next-generation genome sequencing technology, these strains were sequenced and analyzed in terms of serotypes, ST types, and resistance genes for epidemiological investigation. RESULTS: The age distribution of 9606 ranged from 10 days to 94 years with a median age of 69 years old. The strains were mainly isolated from sputum (72 strains, 69.9%) and blood (14 strains, 13.6%). The size of these genomes ranged from 6.2 Mb to 7.4 Mb, with a mean value of 6.5 Mb. In addition to eight antibiotics that show inherent resistance to 287, the sensitivity rates for colistin, chemicalD000583, chemicalD005839, chemicalD002442, chemicalD010878, chemicalD000077725, chemicalD002939, chemicalD000077731, chemicalD001398, chemicalD015378, chemicalD000077723 and chemicalD064704 were 100%, 95.15%, 86.41%, 72.82%, 71.84%, 69.90%, 55.34%, 52.43%, 50.49%, 50.49%, 49.51% and 47.57% respectively, and the carriage rate of MDR strains was 30.69% (31/101). Whole-genome analysis showed that a total of 50 ST types were identified, with ST244 (5/103) and ST1076 (4/103) having a more pronounced distribution advantage. Serotype predictions showed that O6 accounted for 29.13% (30/103), O11 for 23.30% (24/103), O2 for 18.45% (19/103), and O1 for 11.65% (12/103) of the highest proportions. Notably, we found a significantly higher proportion of ExoU in 287 strains of serotype O11 than in other cytotoxic exoenzyme positive strains. In addition to this, a total of 47 crpP genes that mediate resistance to chemicalD024841 antibiotics were found distributed on 43 287 strains, and 10 new variants of CrpP were identified, named 1.33, 1.34, 1.35, 1.36, 1.37, 1.38, 1.39, 1.40, 1.41 and 7.1. CONCLUSIONS: We investigated the antibiotic susceptibility of clinical isolates of 287 and genomically enriched the diversity of 287 for its prophylactic and therapeutic value.

Although the necessity of these TLs is recently questioned in diseaseD003550 without diseaseD007674, no study has evaluated this so far. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the frequency of increased chemicalD014031 TLs in diseaseD003550 treated with a once daily chemicalD014031 dosing protocol. METHODS: 9606 records of all consecutive once daily iv chemicalD014031 courses in 35 diseaseD003550 between 07/2009 and 07/2019 were analyzed for chemicalD014031 level, renal function, co-medication and comorbidity. RESULTS: Eight elevated TLs (2.9% of 278 courses) were recorded in four 9606, two with normal renal function. One of these resolved without adjustment of chemicalD014031 dosages suggesting a test timing or laboratory error. In the other 9606 the elevated chemicalD014031 level decreased after chemicalD014031 dosage adjustment. Six of the elevated levels occurred in two 9606 with diseaseD007676. In 15 other 9606 with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (36 courses) but normal range chemicalD003404 no case of elevated chemicalD014031 trough levels was detected. Neither cumulative chemicalD014031 dosages nor concomitant diseaseD003920 or nutritional status were risk factors for elevated TLs. CONCLUSION: Our data show that elevated chemicalD014031 TLs are rare but cannot be excluded, so determination of chemicalD014031 TLs is still recommended for safety.
38169359		[diseaseD003550 carrier screening: a Health technology assessment.]This project of Health technology assessment was aimed at defining the impacts of offering a diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) carrier screening to the general population, compared to the current situation, where the test is offered to individuals at high-risk to give birth to a child with diseaseD003550. Results revealed: i) a lack of robust and updated data; ii) a return on investment up to six years from the screening's introduction, despite important economic and organizational efforts; iii) a general positive attitude of healthcare professionals, 9606 with diseaseD003550, families and general population; iv) possible issues related to the social impact.
38400672		Peri-operative and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation in 9606 with diseaseD003550.INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of data regarding the peri-operative and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation in diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) 9606. Herein, we report the peri-operative and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation in diseaseD003550 9606. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All diseaseD003550 9606 who received a kidney transplant at the national kidney transplant center between 1993 and 2022 were identified. Recipients of the contralateral donor kidney were selected as a control group. Primary outcomes included 1-, 5-, and 10- year death-censored graft survival and overall survival. Secondary outcomes included peri-operative morbidity, acute graft rejection, delayed graft function (DGF), and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Fourteen 9606 received a kidney transplant over the study period. Median age at transplantation was 35 (IQR 31, 40) years. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year death-censored graft survival was 92, 74, and 74% in the diseaseD003550 group compared to 100, 92, and 92% in the control group (p = .44). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival in the diseaseD003550 group was 85, 66, and 57% compared to 100, 92, and 82% in the control group (p = .036). There was no significant difference in peri-operative outcomes including LOS (10 vs. 11 days, p = .84), ICU admission (1 vs. 0 9606, p > .99), acute rejection episodes (2 vs. 1 9606, p > .99), and DGF (1 vs. 2 9606, p = .60). CONCLUSION: diseaseD003550 9606 have good long-term graft survival, however, overall survival was worse compared to a matched cohort. These data provide important information for transplant surgeons when considering suitable donor allografts in this unique 9606 population.

Body Mass Index (BMI) is the most commonly used parameter to assess nutritional status, albeit it is a very unspecific indicator. Hence, current guidelines recommend body composition analysis as a part of nutritional assessment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of chemicalC000629074-chemicalC000625213-chemicalC545203 (ELX/TEZ/IVA) treatment on body composition and respiratory function. METHODS: We recruited 9606 with diseaseD003550 from University Hospital La Princesa, with follow-up in the Adult diseaseD003550 Unit. All 9606 were eligible to initiate ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy. Body composition was assessed with a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and spirometry data were obtained before and after 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Our study sample was composed of 36 9606 with diseaseD003550. We observed a significant increase in BMI after 6 months of treatment (p < 0.001), as well as an increase in fat mass (p = 0.008) and visceral fat area (p = 0.026). The other body composition parameters did not yield significant changes. Overall, %FEV1 increased from 72.67 % (+-17.39) to 84.74 % (+-18.18) after 6 months of treatment. Interestingly, we found an inverse correlation between %FEV1 and fat mass (r = -0,476; p = 0,0058), %FEV1 and age (r = -0,411; p = 0,0196) and between %FEV1 and visceral fat area (r = -0,515; p = 0,0025). On the contrary, we found a direct correlation between %FEV1 and body cell mass (r = 0,367; p = 0,038). CONCLUSIONS: Novel ncbi1080 modulators are emerging for the treatment of diseaseD003550. Specifically, triple combination with ELX/TEZ/IVA has shown to effectively improve both pulmonary and nutritional status in 9606 with diseaseD003550 with variantrs113993960## mutation. Body composition should be a part of the routine assessment for 9606 with diseaseD003550.

However, there is no consensus on chemicalD014640 initial dosing in this population among health institutions, and there is a large variability in initial dosing across the United States. In this study, we characterized the pharmacokinetics (PK) of chemicalD014640 in diseaseD003550 using a population PK approach. The clinical PK data to develop the population PK model were obtained from chemicalD014640 therapeutic monitoring data from diseaseD003550 undergoing treatment for diseaseD007239 due to MRSA. The population PK model was then used to perform comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the probability of target attainment (PTA) of 12 different initial dosing scenarios. The area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio >=400 mg*h/L and <650 mg*h/L were used as efficacy and diseaseD064420 targets for PTA analysis. A total of 181 chemicalD014640 plasma concentrations were included in the analysis. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination best described the data. Weight significantly influenced the chemicalD014640 PK (P < 0.05). In the final model, clearance was estimated as 5.52 L/h/70 kg, and the volume of distribution was 31.5 L/70 kg. The PTA analysis showed that at MIC = 1 microg/mL, doses 1,500 q8h and 2,000 q12h showed the highest %PTA in achieving both efficacy and diseaseD064420 targets. The PTA results from this study may potentially inform the initial dosing regimens of chemicalD014640 to treat diseaseD012141 due to MRSA in diseaseD003550.

Key properties including liposome size, charge and encapsulation efficiency powder size, shape, glass transition temperature (Tg), chemicalD014867 content and in vitro respiratory deposition were determined. Antimicrobial activity against diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) diseaseD012131 was determined by MIC, MBC and biofilm assays. diseaseD064420 and cellular uptake studies were performed using 0023 cells. The average liposome size was 105 nm, charge was 55 mV and encapsulation efficiency was 75 %. The mean powder particle size d[v,50] of 4.54 microm and Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) was 5.23 microm with a mean Tg of 76 C and chemicalD014867 content of 2.1 %. These excellent physicochemical characteristics were maintained over one year. Liposomal loaded chemicalD017963 demonstrated enhanced activity against 287 clinical isolates grown in biofilm. The formulation was rapidly delivered into bacterial cells with > 75 % uptake in 1 h. Rapid uptake into 0023 cells via a chemicalD002784-dependent endocytosis pathway with no diseaseD064420 effects apparent. These data demonstrate that this formulation could offer benefits over current treatment regimens for people with diseaseD012141.

These diseaseD007239 are challenging to treat due to a high rate of resistance. chemicalD000583 is critical to treatment, but the development of diseaseD064420, chemicalD000583 resistance, and treatment failure are significant challenges. chemicalD000583 has been characterized previously as peak-dependent and extended-interval dosing is commonly used. In our hollow fiber diseaseD007239 model of diseaseC566367, chemicalD000583 exhibited time-dependent rather than the expected peak-dependent pharmacodynamics. Humanized chemicalD000583 exposures with more frequent, short-interval dosing (continuous infusion or every 12 hours) yielded improved microbiological response compared to extended-interval dosing (every 24 hours or 1-3 times per week). Short-interval dosing inhibited growth with a mean (SD) maximum Deltalog10 colony forming units of -4.06 (0.52), significantly more than extended-interval dosing (P = 0.0013) every 24 hours, -2.40 (0.58), or 1-3 times per week, -2.39 (0.38). Growth recovery, an indicator of resistance emergence, occurred at 6.56 (0.70) days with short-interval dosing but was significantly earlier with extended-interval dosing (P = 0.0032) every 24 hours, 3.88 (0.85) days, and 1-3 times per week, 3.27 (1.72) days. Microbiological response correlated best with the pharmacodynamic index of %T > minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), with an EC80 for growth inhibition of ~40%T > MIC. We used a previously published population model of chemicalD000583 to determine the probability of achieving 40%T > MIC and show that current dosing strategies are far below this target, which may partially explain why treatment failure remains so high for these diseaseD007239. These data support a cautious approach to infrequent chemicalD000583 dosing for the treatment of 36809.diseaseD004194 caused by Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is increasing worldwide, particularly in 9606 with diseaseD003550. MABSC is challenging to treat due to high levels of antibiotic resistance. Treatment requires 2-4 antibiotics over more than 12 months and has a significant risk of diseaseD064420 but still fails to eradicate diseaseD007239 in over 50% of 9606 with diseaseD003550. Antibiotic dosing strategies have been largely informed by common 629395 such as 287. The "pharmacodynamic" effects of chemicalD000583, a backbone of MABSC treatment, were thought to be related to maximum "peak" drug concentration, leading to daily or three times weekly dosing. However, we found that chemicalD000583 MABSC kill and growth recovery, an indicator of antibiotic resistance, are dependent on how long chemicalD000583 concentrations are above the minimum inhibitory concentration, not how high the peak concentration is. Therefore, we recommend a re-evaluation of chemicalD000583 dosing to determine if increased frequency can improve efficacy.
38135160	Association|diseaseD003550|ncbi1080	Nanoparticle-based platforms for targeted drug delivery to the pulmonary system as therapeutics to curb diseaseD003550: A review.diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) is a diseaseD030342 respiratory system caused by mutation of the ncbi1080 (ncbi1080) gene that affects a huge number of people worldwide. It results in difficulty breathing due to a large accumulation of mucus in the respiratory tract, resulting in serious diseaseD001424, and subsequent death. Traditional drug-based treatments face hindered penetration at the site of action due to the thick mucus layer. Nanotechnology offers possibilities for developing advanced and effective treatment platforms by focusing on drugs that can penetrate the dense mucus layer, fighting against the underlying diseaseD001424, and targeting the genetic cause of the disease. In this review, current nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery platforms for diseaseD003550, challenges in therapeutics, and future prospects have been highlighted. The effectiveness of the different types of nano-based systems conjugated with various drugs to combat the symptoms and the challenges of treating diseaseD003550 are brought into focus. The toxic effects of these nano-medicines and the various factors that are responsible for their effectiveness are also highlighted.
38054992		Risk of CFTR-related disorders and diseaseD003550 in an Italian cohort of CRMS/CFSPID subjects in preschool and school age.The identification of diseaseD003550 screening-positive, inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID) in infants is a controversial outcome of newborn screening for diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). Today, despite improvements in the knowledge of CFSPID and the description of several cohorts, little data are available on cohorts with a follow-up period of more than 6 years. In this study, we report the outcomes of an Italian cohort of CFSPID individuals with CFSPID or formerly CFTR-related disorders (ncbi1080-diseaseD000077733) (CFSPID > ncbi1080-diseaseD000077733) or diagnosed with diseaseD003550 (CFSPID > diseaseD003550). This was an observational and multicentre Italian study collecting clinical data on CFSPID born between the period January 1, 2011, and December 13, 2019. A total of 268 participants were included: 243 with persistent CFSPID, 7 with CFSPID > ncbi1080-diseaseD000077733, and 18 with CFSPID > diseaseD003550. The trend of sweat chloride (SC) values, percentage of definitive diagnoses, lung function in school-aged children, and development of diseaseD003550-related complications were evaluated. At the end of the observation period, almost 80% of the individuals with CFSPID did not have a conclusive diagnosis. A total of 29 children (10.8%) transitioned to a diagnosis of diseaseD003550 for pathological SC values (>= 60 mmol/L) or multi-organ involvement, and 18 (6.7%) to ncbi1080-diseaseD000077733. Children who were followed up for > 6 years (median age, 7.5 years; range, 6.04-10.5) had normal lung function and were pancreatic sufficient, and the evolution in diseaseD003550 was only present in two cases. CONCLUSION: Most Italian preschool and school-aged children with CFSPID did not have a conclusive diagnosis, and progression to diseaseD003550 was unlikely in children > 6 years of age. An annual follow-up could be indicated to identify early evolution in clinical features consistent with a ncbi1080-diseaseD000077733. WHAT IS KNOWN:   diseaseD003550 newborn screening identifies also subjects with an inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID).   Over time a variable percentage of CFSPIDs will be diagnosed as diseaseD003550.   Little data is available on CFSPIDs with a follow-up period of more than six years. WHAT IS NEW:   80% of Italian preschool and school-age CFSPIDs not have a conclusive diagnosis.   Italian preschool and school-age CFSPIDs have normal lung function and are pancreatic sufficient.   Annual follow-up after 6 years is recommended in CFSPID with abnormal LCI2.5 or with a diseaseD003550-causing variant in trans with a VVCC.

This study aims to determine the effect of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) on body mass index (BMI) and glycemic control. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study of a cohort of 17 adult diseaseD003550 patients was conducted at the diseaseD003550 reference center of Ghent University Hospital. BMI evolution was analyzed 18 months before and 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after the start of ETI. The evolution of diseaseD003922 and the 2 h oral chemicalD005947 tolerance test (OGTT) results were described until 36 months after start of ETI, in a small subgroup of ten patients with diseaseD003550 or diseaseD018149 (diseaseD018149). RESULTS: A significant increase in mean BMI of 1.2 kg/m2 (+-1.3 SD) was observed. Most diseaseD015430 was observed in the first 3 months after starting treatment. This effect was sustained during the observed period of 18 months. Six patients had ncbi3630 dependent diseaseD003550, of which three were able to stop ncbi3630 after starting ETI. Two patients with diseaseD003550 treated with dietary measures showed an initial normalization of the 2 h OGTT, but deterioration at 36 month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: After initiation of ETI an increase in BMI was observed in adults with diseaseD003550. ETI can have a beneficial impact on chemicalD005947 metabolism in patients with diseaseD003550, leading to a possible need for reduction or cessation of ncbi3630 therapy.
38431897		[Experience with diseaseD000086382 and immunization in a group of adult 9606 with diseaseD003550].
38132670		Phenotypes of a 287 hypermutator lineage that emerged during prolonged mechanical ventilation in a 9606 without diseaseD003550.Hypermutator lineages of 287 arise frequently during the years of diseaseD007239 experienced by 9606 with diseaseD003550 and diseaseD001987 but are rare in the absence of chronic diseaseD007239 and structural diseaseD008171. Since the onset of the diseaseD000086382 pandemic, large numbers of 9606 have remained mechanically ventilated for extended periods of time. These 9606 are prone to acquire bacterial pathogens that persist for many weeks and have the opportunity to evolve within the pulmonary environment. However, little is known about what types of adaptations occur in these bacteria and whether these adaptations mimic those observed in chronic diseaseD007239. We describe a diseaseD000086382 9606 with a secondary 287 diseaseD012141 in whom the causative bacterium persisted for >50 days. Over the course of this diseaseD007239, a hypermutator lineage of 287 emerged and co-existed with a non-hypermutator lineage. Compared to the parental lineage, the hypermutator lineage evolved to be less diseaseD064420 and less virulent. Genomic analyses of the hypermutator lineage identified numerous mutations, including in the mismatch repair gene mutL and other genes frequently mutated in individuals with diseaseD003550. Together, these findings demonstrate that hypermutator lineages can emerge when 287 persists following acute diseaseD007239 such as ventilator-associated diseaseD011014 and that these lineages have the potential to affect 9606 outcomes.IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa may evolve to accumulate large numbers of mutations in the context of chronic diseaseD007239 such as those that occur in individuals with diseaseD003550. However, these "hypermutator" lineages are rare following acute diseaseD007239. Here, we describe a non-diseaseD003550 9606 with diseaseD000086382 who remained mechanically ventilated for months. The 9606 became infected with a strain of 287 that evolved to become a hypermutator. We demonstrate that hypermutation led to changes in diseaseD064420 and virulence. These findings are important because they demonstrate that 287 hypermutators can emerge following acute diseaseD007239 and that they have the potential to affect 9606 outcomes in this setting.
38441982	Association|chemicalD000077731|ncbi55894; Association|diseaseD003550|ncbi55894	In vitro activity of 9606 defensins ncbi574045 and ncbi55894 against multidrug-resistant ESKAPE Gram-negatives of clinical origin and selected peptidoglycan recycling-defective mutants.The use of immune compounds as antimicrobial adjuvants is a classic idea recovering timeliness in the current antibiotic resistance scenario. However, the activity of certain antimicrobial peptides against ESKAPE Gram-negatives has not been sufficiently investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the activities of 9606 defensins ncbi574045 and ncbi55894 alone or combined with permeabilizing/peptidoglycan-targeting agents against clinical ESKAPE Gram-negatives [470 (194965), 550 (138950), 573 (KP), and acute/chronic 287 (PA)]. Lethal concentrations (LCs) of ncbi574045 and ncbi55894 were determined in four collections of multidrug resistant 138950, 194965, KP, and PA clinical strains (10-36 isolates depending on the collection). These defensins act through membrane permeabilization plus peptidoglycan building blockade, enabling that alterations in peptidoglycan recycling may increase their activity, which is why different recycling-defective mutants were also included. Combinations with physiological ncbi4069 and subinhibitory colistin for bactericidal activities determination, and with chemicalD000077731 for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were also assessed. ncbi574045 showed undetectable activity (LC > 32 mg/L for all strains). ncbi55894 showed appreciable activities: LC ranges 2-16, 8-8, 8->32, and 8->32 mg/L for 194965, 138950, KP, and PA, being PA strains from diseaseD003550 significantly more resistant than acute origin ones. None of the peptidoglycan recycling-defective mutants showed greater susceptibility to ncbi574045/ncbi55894. Combination with colistin or ncbi4069 did not change their bactericidal power, and virtually neither did chemicalD000077731 + ncbi55894 compared to chemicalD000077731 MICs. This is the first study comparatively analyzing the ncbi574045/ncbi55894 activities against the ESKAPE Gram-negatives, and demonstrates interesting bactericidal capacities of ncbi55894 mostly against 194965 and 138950. IMPORTANCE: In the current scenario of critical need for new antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant 629395, all options must be considered, including classic ideas such as the use of purified immune compounds. However, information regarding the activity of certain 9606 defensins against ESKAPE Gram-negatives was incomplete. This is the first study comparatively assessing the in vitro activity of two membrane-permeabilizing/peptidoglycan construction-blocking defensins (ncbi574045 and ncbi55894) against relevant clinical collections of ESKAPE Gram-negatives, alone or in combination with permeabilizers, additional peptidoglycan-targeting attacks, or the blockade of its recycling. Our data suggest that ncbi55894 has a notable bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant 470 and 550 strains that should be considered as potential adjuvant option. Our results suggest for the first time an increased resistance of 287 strains from chronic diseaseD007239 compared to acute origin ones, and provide new clues about the predominant mode of action of ncbi55894 against Gram-negatives (permeabilization rather than peptidoglycan-targeting).

Since the enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of chemicalD012701 and chemicalD004298, its deficiency determines the lack of these neurotransmitters, but also of chemicalD009638 and chemicalD004837. Onset is early and the key signs are diseaseD009123, diseaseD009069 (diseaseD013224, diseaseD004421 and diseaseD018476), diseaseD002658 and diseaseD001342. Taiwan is the site of a potential founder variant (variant#1644#c.IVS6+4A>T) with a predicted incidence of 1/32,000 births, while only 261 9606 with this deficit have been described worldwide. Actually, the number of affected persons could be greater, given that the spectrum of clinical manifestations is broad and still little known. In our study we selected 350 unrelated 9606 presenting with different diseaseD009461 including heterogeneous diseaseD009468, diseaseD003072, diseaseD001523 and diseaseD000067877, for which the underlying etiology had not yet been identified. Molecular investigation of the ncbi1644 gene was carried out with the aim of identifying affected 9606 and/or carriers. Our study shows a high frequency of carriers (2.57%) in Sicilian subjects with diseaseD009461, with a higher concentration in northern and eastern Sicily. Assuming these data as representative of the general Sicilian population, the risk may be comparable to some diseaseD035583 included in the newborn screening programs such as diseaseD009134, diseaseD003550 and diseaseD010661.
38179878	Association|chemicalD008055|ncbi1080	Impact of chemicalC000629074/chemicalC000625213/chemicalC545203 on chemicalD008055 and fat-soluble vitamin levels and association with body mass index.INTRODUCTION: ncbi1080 (ncbi1080) modulators improve gastrointestinal absorption of nutrients and may result in changes in body mass index (BMI), serum chemicalD008055, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. We hypothesized that serum chemicalD008055 and vitamin levels would increase with ncbi1080 modulator therapy and that greater increase in chemicalD008055 and vitamin levels would be related to greater increase in BMI. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the impact of chemicalC000629074/chemicalC000625213/chemicalC545203 (ETI) on nutritional parameters, serum chemicalD008055, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. Pre-ETI values (<2 years prior) and post-ETI values (>1 month after) were compared. Linear regression was used to evaluate whether change in BMI is associated with the change in chemicalD008055 and/or vitamin levels and whether modulator duration is associated with the degree of rise in chemicalD008055 and/or vitamin levels. RESULTS: Adults and adolescents with diseaseD003550 (n = 137) were evaluated before and 31-300 days after starting ETI. Median BMI (adults 21.9 vs. 23.5 kg/m2 ; adolescents 48 vs. 63 percentile) increased after initiation of ETI. Total chemicalD002784 (126 vs. 154 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (63 vs. 78 mg/dL), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (84 vs. 102 mg/dL), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (43 vs. 49 mg/dL) increased after ETI, while chemicalD014280 and very low density lipoprotein did not change. Median values for chemicalD014807 (34.5 vs. 38.0 ng/mL) and chemicalD014801 (40.1 vs. 47.9 microg/dL) increased, while chemicalD014810 did not change significantly. There was no significant correlation between BMI change or duration of modulator therapy with vitamin levels or chemicalD008055 changes. CONCLUSION: After initiation of ETI therapy, serum chemicalD008055 increased in our population, but most values remained within the normal range. Vitamins A and D levels increased post-ETI and no changes were noted in chemicalD014810 No significant correlation between the degree of BMI change and the magnitude of increase in chemicalD008055 or vitamin levels was found.
38128948		Self-reported engagement in everyday activities following bilateral lung transplantation in paediatric diseaseD003550: a single centre study.INTRODUCTION: Following lung transplantation, it is unknown how children/adolescents self-assess their performance in everyday activities, importance of these activities, and whether resumption of everyday activities influences self-reported quality of life. The aim was to examine the effect of bilateral lung transplantation on children's/adolescent's perception of engagement in everyday activities over the first 18 months post-transplant. METHODS: A multiple-single-case-study pre-post test design was conducted at a National Paediatric Lung Transplant Service. Participants were aged under 18 years and were 3 months post first bilateral lung transplant at the time of recruitment. Outcomes were self-reported quality of life (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Transplant Module and engagement in meaningful life roles (Child Occupational Self-Assessment (COSA) Scale) measured at 3 months and 18 months post-transplant from participants, and their parent(s) (PedsQL). Analysis included paired between-time differences and descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Seven participants were recruited to the trial with a mean age of 13 (SD 4) years and a diagnosis of diseaseD003550. The total mean scores on PedsQL remained stable between 3 months and 18 months for both participants and parents. The PedsQL transplant module total mean scores of participants significantly increased from 3 months (M=66.58, SD=11.83) to 18 months (M=80.25, SD=11.56), t(5) = 2.91, p=0.03 whereas parents' scores remained stable. COSA responses reported 'big problems' with self-care tasks, family engagement and coping with worries at 3 months. At 18 months, the 'big problem' activities shifted to community engagement and independence. CONCLUSION: Time influences self-reported quality of life and engagement in meaningful life roles for children/adolescents and their parents 3 months to 18 months post-lung transplant. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing on occupational roles and occupational performance of children and adolescents when designing post-transplant interventions, suggesting a key role for occupational therapy after transplantation.
38309533		Novel time-saving OGTT sparing HbA1c-HOMA2 based algorithm for the diagnosis of diseaseD003550.AIMS: The diagnosis of diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) faces several challenges. We propose a novel screening algorithm to alleviate the burden of diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). METHODS: Through a retrospective cross-sectional single-centre study, HbA1c and HOMA2 indices were assessed in multiple models as alternative diagnostic tools from OGTT data. We sought to establish specific thresholds for diseaseD003550 screening with oral chemicalD005947 tolerance test (OGTT) as gold standard. We evaluated various straightforward or sequential approaches, in terms of diagnostic accuracy while also quantify the potential reduction in OGTTs through these different methods. RESULTS: HOMA indices were recovered in 72 9606. We devised a composite index that combines HbA1c and HOMA-B: diseaseD003920 Predicting Index in diseaseD003550 (DIPIc) = (HbA1c(%) x 3.455) - (HOMA-B(%) x  0.020) - 19.294. This index yields the highest screening accuracy according to receiver-operating characteristics curves. Using a stepwise algorithm that incorporates DIPIc decreases the requirement for annual OGTTs. A diseaseD003550 exclusion cutoff less than -1.7445 (sensitivity 98 %), in conjunction with a diseaseD003550 diagnostic threshold greater than 0.4543 (specificity 98 %) allows for 71 % OGTT sparing. CONCLUSION: The composite index DIPIc is a suitable, less invasive screening method for diseaseD003550, which enables to avoid many OGTTs.

The aim of this study was to conduct an epidemiological survey of diseaseD053713 9606, to screen for ncbi1080 mutations, and to follow their pregnancy outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART). METHODS: This cohort study enrolled diseaseD053713 9606 undergoing ART and whole-exome sequencing from January 2018 to September 2023. Semen parameters, sex hormones, and seminal plasma biochemistry were evaluated. ncbi1080 mutations identified in diseaseD053713 9606 were analyzed. In addition, the laboratory outcomes, clinical outcomes, and neonatal outcomes were compared between diseaseD053713 9606 carrying two ncbi1080 mutations and the others after surgical sperm extraction-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. RESULTS: A total of 76 9606 with diseaseD053713 were enrolled. ncbi1080 mutations were identified in 35 (46.1%) diseaseD053713 9606. A total of 60 ncbi1080 mutation sites of 27 types were identified, and 10 of them were novel. The average frequency was 1.71 (60/35) per person. The most common mutation was variantrs73715573## (25%, 15/60). After ICSI treatment, there were no statistically significant differences in laboratory outcomes, clinical outcomes, and neonatal outcomes between diseaseD053713 9606 carrying two ncbi1080 mutations (n = 25) and other diseaseD053713 9606 (n = 51). CONCLUSION: Apart from the variant#1080# mutation, the genetic mutation pattern of ncbi1080 in Chinese diseaseD053713 9606 is heterogeneous, which is significantly different from that of Caucasians. Although carrying two ncbi1080 mutations or not had no effect on the pregnancy outcomes in diseaseD053713 9606 after ICSI, genetic counseling is still recommended for such 9606.
38233941		Lung clearance index short-term variability in diseaseD003550: a pre-post pulmonary exacerbation study.BACKGROUND: Multiple Breath washout (MBW) represents an important tool to detect early a possible pulmonary exacerbation especially in diseaseD003550. Lung clearance index (LCI) is the most commonly reported multiple breath washout (MBW) index and in the last years was used as management measure for evaluation. Our aim was to analyze clinical utility of LCI index variability in pulmonary exacerbation in CF after intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. METHODS: A single-center study was conducted at CF Unit of Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital among hospitalized > 3 years 9606 for diseaseD018450 and treated with antibiotic IV treatment for 14 days. MBW and spirometry were evaluated within 72 h of admission to hospital and at the end of hospitalization. Descriptive analysis was conducted and correlations between quantitative variables were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-seven 9606 (M22/F35) with an average age 18.56 (+- 8.54) years were enrolled. LCI2.5 was significantly reduced at the end of antibiotic treatment in both pediatric and adult populations with an average reduction of -6,99%; 37/57 9606 denoted an improvement, 20/57 are stable or worsened in LCI2.5 values and 4/57 (7.02%) had a significant deterioration (> 15%) at end of treatment. On the contrary a significative elevation of FEV1 and FVC were found, respectively of + 7,30% and of + 5,46%. A positive good correlection among LCI 2.5 and Scond (rho = + 0,615, p = 0.000) and LCI 2.5 and Sacin (rho = + 0,649, p = 0.000) and a negative strong correlation between FEV1 and LCI 2.5 were found in post treatment period. A similar modification of LCI 2.5 and FEV1 was noticed in both adult and pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: LCI may have a role in the routine clinical care of both adult and pediatric CF 9606 as a good tool to assess response to IV antibiotic end-therapy in the same way as FEV1.
38458782		Using reference equations to standardise incremental shuttle walk test performance in children and young people with chronic conditions and facilitate the evaluation of exercise capacity and disease severity.AIMS: The aim was to evaluate whether standardised exercise performance during the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) can be used to assess disease severity in children and young people (CYP) with chronic conditions, through (1) identifying the most appropriate paediatric normative reference equation for the ISWT, (2) assessing how well CYP with diseaseD006467 and diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) perform against the values predicted by the best fit reference equation and (3) evaluating the association between standardised ISWT performance and disease severity. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out using existing data from two independent studies (2018-2019) at paediatric hospitals in London,UK. CYP with diseaseD006467 (n=35) and diseaseD003550 (n=134) aged 5-18 years were included. Published reference equations for standardising ISWT were evaluated through a comparison of populations, and Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the level of agreement between distances predicted by each equation. Associations between ISWT and disease severity were assessed with linear regression. RESULTS: Three relevant reference equations were identified for the ISWT that standardised performance based on age, sex and body mass index (Vardhan, Lanza, Pinho). A systematic proportional bias of standardised ISWT was observed in all equations, most pronounced with Vardhan and Lanza; the male Pinho equation was identified as most appropriate. On average, CYP with diseaseD003550 and diseaseD006467 performed worse than predicted by the Pihno equation, although the range was wide. Standardised ISWT, and not ISWT distance alone, was significantly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s in CYP with diseaseD003550. Standardised ISWT in CYP with diseaseD006467 was slightly associated with diseaseD006467 joint health score, but this was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: ISWT performance may be useful in a clinic to identify those with worsening disease, but only when performance is standardised against a healthy reference population. The development of validated global reference equations is necessary for more robust assessment.

38268067		Effects of a remotely supervised resistance training program on muscle strength and body composition in adults with diseaseD003550: Randomized controlled trial.INTRODUCTION: Among the limited studies on physical exercise interventions in adults with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550), few have specifically addressed the improvement of peripheral muscle strength and body fat-free mass. The aim of this study was to examine the impacts of a remotely supervised, individualized 8-week resistance training program of moderate to high intensity on strength and body composition in these subjects. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial performed in adults with diseaseD003550. The exercise group (EX) performed three 1-h resistance training sessions per week over 8 weeks. The control group (CON) followed the physical activity recommendations of their physician. The main outcomes were muscle strength and body composition, with secondary measures including pulmonary function and quality of life. Two-way repeated measures analysis was used. RESULTS: In 23 participants (age 32.13 +- 7.72 years), the intervention showed a significant beneficial effect on leg press strength, with a large effect size, both in absolute (p = 0.011;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.281) and relative (p = 0.007;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.310) terms. Large intervention effects were observed on total fat mass (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.415), body diseaseD018205 index (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.436), and fat mass index (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.445), all showing reduction in the EX group. In addition, significant large size effects were detected on total fat-free mass (p = 0.046;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.177), trunk fat-free mass (p = 0.039;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.188), and fat-free mass index (p = 0.048;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.174), all favoring exercise. No significant effects were observed on pulmonary function and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week remotely supervised resistance training program, with moderate to high intensity, effectively improved lower limb muscle strength and body composition.

These chemicalD001704-based viscoelastic structures protect pathogenic organisms from immune responses and antibiotics. Consequently, treatments directed at disrupting biofilms represent a promising strategy for combating biofilm-associated diseaseD007239. In diseaseD003550 9606, the viscoelasticity of biofilms is determined mainly by their polymicrobial nature and species-specific traits, such as 287 filamentous (Pf) bacteriophages. Therefore, we examined the impact of microbicidal chemicalC000629385 (chemicalD016572) supported by mucolytic agents-DNase I and chemicalC017645 (chemicalC017645), on the viability and viscoelasticity of mono- and bispecies biofilms formed by Pf-positive and Pf-negative 287 strains co-cultured with 1280 or 5476. METHODS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of chemicalC000629385 against 287 in mono- and dual-species cultures was assessed by determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC). Inhibition of 287 mono- and dual-species biofilms formation by chemicalC000629385 alone and in combination with DNase I or chemicalC017645 (chemicalC017645) was estimated by the chemicalD005840 assay. Additionally, the viability of the biofilms was measured by colony-forming unit (CFU) counting. Finally, the biofilms' viscoelastic properties characterized by shear storage (G') and loss moduli (G"), were analyzed with a rotational rheometer. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that chemicalC000629385 CSA-13 inhibits biofilm formation and increases its fluidity regardless of the Pf-profile and species composition; however, the Pf-positive biofilms are characterized by elevated viscosity and elasticity parameters. CONCLUSION: Due to its microbicidal and viscoelasticity-modifying properties, CSA-13 displays therapeutic potential in biofilm-associated diseaseD007239, especially when combined with mucolytic agents.

Notably, the spectrum and frequency of pathogenic ncbi1080 variants vary between populations and geographical regions. In this work, we made an attempt to evaluate the allele frequency (AF) of 12 common ncbi1080 variants in infertile Russian 9606 and healthy individuals from different districts of Russia. Because of the limited number of population-based studies on Russian individuals, we characterized the population AFs based on data from the Registry of Russian diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) 9606. In addition to the diseaseD003550 9606 registry, we estimated the local frequencies of the same set of variants based on the results of genotyping of diseaseD003550 9606 in local biocollections (from St. Petersburg and Yugra regions). AFs of common ncbi1080 variants calculated based on registry and biocollection data showed good concordance with directly measured population AFs. The estimated region-specific frequencies of ncbi1080 variants allowed us to uncover statistically significant regional differences in the frequencies of the variantrs113993960## (variant#1080#c.1521_1523del; variantrs113993960##) and CFTRdele2,3(21kb) (c.54-5940_273+10250del21kb; variant#1080#p.S18RfsX) variants. The data from population-based studies confirmed previous observations that variantrs113993960##, CFTRdele2,3(21kb), and variant#1080#p.L138ins (variant#1080#c.413_415dup; variantrs397508686##)variants are the most abundant among infertile 9606, and their frequencies are significantly lower in healthy individuals and should be taken into account during genetic monitoring of the reproductive health of Russian individuals.
38184455		diseaseD013901 post diseaseD001982 in 9606 with diseaseD003550. A 7-year single centre retrospective review.diseaseD001982 (diseaseD001982) is a treatment used to manage haemoptysis. We performed a 7-year review of diseaseD001982 procedures for haemoptysis at our diseaseD003550 centre aiming to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of 9606 with diseaseD013901 post-diseaseD001982. Our review suggests that whilst diseaseD001982 is an effective method for controlling life-threatening haemoptysis, 9606 are at risk of developing diseaseD013901 with long term residual symptoms, and therefore careful consideration should be given in offering diseaseD001982, especially to otherwise well 9606 with chronic small volume haemoptysis and managing teams should have a low threshold to image symptomatic 9606.
38296344		Eradication treatment for diseaseD011552 in adults with diseaseD001987: a systematic review and meta-analysis.INTRODUCTION: 287 is the most commonly isolated pathogen in diseaseD001987 and is associated with worse outcomes. Eradication treatment is recommended by guidelines, but the evidence base is limited. The expected success rate of eradication in clinical practice is not known. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched for studies investigating 287 eradication treatment using antibiotics (systemic or inhaled) in 9606 with diseaseD001987. The primary outcome was the percentage of 9606 negative for 287 at 12 months after eradication treatment. diseaseD003550 was excluded. RESULTS: Six observational studies including 289 9606 were included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis found a 12-month 287 eradication rate of 40% (95% CI 34-45%; p<0.00001), with no significant heterogeneity (I2=0%). Combined systemic and inhaled antibiotic treatment was associated with a higher eradication rate (48%, 95% CI 41-55%) than systemic antibiotics alone (27%, 13-45%). CONCLUSION: Eradication treatment in diseaseD001987 results in eradication of 287 from sputum in ~40% of cases at 12 months. Combined systemic and inhaled antibiotics achieve higher eradication rates than systemic antibiotics alone.

Association|chemicalD014867|diseaseD013035	[Standard technical specifications for chemicalD016210 (chemicalD016210) bronchial challenge test (2023)].The chemicalD016210 challenge test (MCT) is a standard evaluation method of assessing airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and its severity, and has significant clinical value in the diagnosis and treatment of diseaseD001249. A consensus working group consisting of experts from the Pulmonary diseaseD003291 and Clinical Respiratory Physiology Committee of the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians, the Task Force for Pulmonary diseaseD003291 of the Chinese Thoracic Society, and the Pulmonary diseaseD003291 Group of Respiratory Branch of the Chinese Geriatric Society jointly developed this consensus. Based on the "Guidelines for Pulmonary diseaseD003291-Bronchial Provocation Test" published in 2014, the issues encountered in its use, and recent developments, the group has updated the Standard technical specifications of chemicalD016210 (chemicalD016210) bronchial challenge test (2023). Through an extensive collection of expert opinions, literature reviews, questionnaire surveys, and multiple rounds of online and offline discussions, the consensus addressed the eleven core issues in MCT's clinical practice, including indications, contraindications, preparation of provocative agents, test procedures and methods, quality control, safety management, interpretation of results, and reporting standards. The aim was to provide clinical pulmonary diseaseD003291 practitioners in healthcare institutions with the tools to optimize the use of this technique to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.Summary of recommendationsQuestion 1: Who is suitable for conducting MCT? What are contraindications for performing MCT?9606 with atypical symptoms and a clinical suspicion of diseaseD001249, 9606 diagnosed with diseaseD001249 requiring assessment of the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness, individuals with diseaseD065631 who are at risk of developing diseaseD001249, 9606 in need of evaluating the effectiveness of diseaseD001249 treatment, individuals in occupations with high safety risks due to airway hyperresponsiveness, 9606 with chronic diseases prone to airway hyperresponsiveness, others requiring assessment of airway reactivity.Absolute contraindications: (1) 9606 who are allergic to chemicalD016210 (chemicalD016210) or other parasympathomimetic drugs, with diseaseD004342 including diseaseD005076, diseaseD011537/diseaseD004487 (diseaseD014060), severe diseaseD004244, and diseaseD004417; (2) 9606 with a history of life-threatening diseaseD001249 attacks or those who have required mechanical ventilation for diseaseD001249 attacks in the past three months; (3) 9606 with moderate to severe disease608852 [Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) less than 60% of the predicted value or FEV1<1.0 L]; (4) Severe diseaseD014581; (5) Other situations inappropriate for forced vital capacity (FVC) measurement, such as diseaseD009203 or diseaseD020521 in the past three months, poorly controlled diseaseD006973, diseaseD001014, recent eye surgery, or increased diseaseD019586.Relative contraindications: (1) Moderate or more severe impairment of baseline lung diseaseD003291 (FEV1%pred<70%), but individuals with FEV1%pred>60% may still be considered for MCT with strict observation and adequate preparation; (2) Experiencing diseaseD001249 acute exacerbation; (3) Poor cooperation with baseline lung diseaseD003291 tests that do not meet quality control requirements; (4) Recent diseaseD012141 (<4 weeks); (5) Pregnant or lactating 9606; (6) 9606 currently using cholinesterase inhibitors (for the treatment of diseaseD009157); (7) 9606 who have previously experienced diseaseD013035 during pulmonary diseaseD003291 tests, with a significant decrease in FEV1 even without the inhalation of provocative.Question 2: How to prepare and store the challenge solution for diseaseD013736 use, the drug must be reconstituted and then diluted into various concentrations for provocation. The dilution concentration and steps for chemicalD016210 vary depending on the inhalation method and provocation protocol used. It is important to follow specific steps. Typically, a specified amount of diluent is added to the chemicalD016210 reagent bottle for reconstitution, and the mixture is shaken until the solution becomes clear. The diluent is usually physiological chemicalD012965, but chemicalD012965 with chemicalD019800 (0.4%) can also be used. chemicalD019800 can reduce the possibility of diseaseD001424 contamination, and its presence does not interfere with the provocation test. After reconstitution, other concentrations of chemicalD016210 solution are prepared using the same diluent, following the dilution steps, and then stored separately in sterile containers. Preparers should carefully verify and label the concentration and preparation time of the solution and complete a preparation record form. The reconstituted and diluted chemicalD016210 solution is ready for immediate use without the need for freezing. It can be stored for two weeks if refrigerated (2-8 C). The reconstituted solution should not be stored directly in the nebulizer reservoir to prevent crystallization from blocking the capillary opening and affecting aerosol output. The temperature of the solution can affect the production of the nebulizer and cause diseaseD013035 in the subject upon inhaling cold droplets. Thus, refrigerated solutions should be brought to room temperature before use.Question 3: What preparation is required for subjects prior to MCT?(1) Detailed medical history inquiry and exclusion of contraindications.(2) Inquiring about factors and medications that may affect airway reactivity and assessing compliance with medication washout requirements: When the goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of diseaseD001249 treatment, bronchodilators other than those used for diseaseD001249 treatment do not need to be discontinued. Antihistamines and chemicalD004205 have no effect on MCT responses, and the effects of a single dose of inhaled corticosteroids and chemicalD015289 modifiers are minimal, thus not requiring cessation before the test. For 9606 routinely using corticosteroids, whether to discontinue the medication depends on the objective of the test: if assisting in the diagnosis of diseaseD001249, differential diagnosis, aiding in step-down therapy for diseaseD001249, or exploring the effect of discontinuing anti-inflammatory treatment, corticosteroids should be stopped before the provocation test; if the 9606 is already diagnosed with diseaseD001249 and the objective is to observe the level of airway reactivity under controlled medication conditions, then discontinuation is not necessary. Medications such as ncbi3497 monoclonal antibodies, ncbi3566 monoclonal antibodies, traditional Chinese medicine, and ethnic medicines may interfere with test results, and clinicians should decide whether to discontinue these based on the specific circumstances.(3) Explaining the test procedure and potential adverse reactions, and obtaining informed consent if necessary.Question 4: What are the methods of the MCT? And which ones are recommended in current clinical practice?Commonly used methods for MCT in clinical practice include the quantitative nebulization method (chemicalD000250 method), Forced Oscillalion method (Astograph method), 2-minute tidal breathing method (Cockcroft method), hand-held quantitative nebulization method (Yan method), and 5-breath method (Chai 5-breath method). The chemicalD000250 method allows for precise dosing of inhaled chemicalD016210, ensuring accurate and reliable results. The Astograph method, which uses respiratory resistance as an assessment indicator, is easy for subjects to perform and is the simplest operation. These two methods are currently the most commonly used clinical practice in China.Question 5: What are the steps involved in MCT?The MCT consists of the following four steps:(1) Baseline lung diseaseD003291 test: After a 15-minute rest period, the subjects assumes a seated position and wear a nose clip for the measurement of pulmonary diseaseD003291 indicators [such as FEV1 or respiratory resistance (Rrs)]. FEV1 should be measured at least three times according to spirometer quality control standards, ensuring that the best two measurements differ by less than 150 ml and recording the highest value as the baseline. Usually, if FEV1%pred is below 70%, proceeding with the challenge test is not suitable, and a bronchodilation test should be considered. However, if clinical assessment of airway reactivity is necessary and FEV1%pred is between 60% and 70%, the provocation test may still be conducted under close observation, ensuring the subject's safety. If FEV1%pred is below 60%, it is an absolute contraindication for MCT.(2) Inhalation of diluent and repeat lung diseaseD003291 test for control values: the diluent, serving as a control for the inhaled chemicalD016210, usually does not significantly impact the subject's lung diseaseD003291. the higher one between baseline value and the post-dilution FEV1 is used as the reference for calculating the rate of FEV1 decline. If post-inhalation FEV1 decreases, there are usually three scenarios: (1)If FEV1 decreases by less than 10% compared to the baseline, the test can proceed, continue the test and administer the first dose of chemicalD016210. (2)If the FEV1 decreases by>=10% and<20%, indicating a heightened airway reactivity to the diluent, proceed with the lowest concentration (dose) of the provoking if FEV1%pred has not yet reached the contraindication criteria for the MCT. if FEV1%pred<60% and the risk of continuing the challenge test is considerable, it is advisable to switch to a bronchodilation test and indicate the change in the test results report. (3)If FEV1 decreases by>=20%, it can be directly classified as a positive challenge test, and the test should be discontinued, with bronchodilators administered to alleviate diseaseD000402.(3) Inhalation of chemicalD016210 and repeat lung diseaseD003291 test to assess decline: prepare a series of chemicalD016210 concentrations, starting from the lowest and gradually increasing the inhaled concentration (dose) using different methods. Perform pulmonary diseaseD003291 tests at 30 seconds and 90 seconds after completing nebulization, with the number of measurements limited to 3-4 times. A complete Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) measurement is unnecessary during testing; only an acceptable FEV1 measurement is required. The interval between two consecutive concentrations (doses) generally should not exceed 3 minutes. If FEV1 declines by>=10% compared to the control value, reduce the increment of chemicalD016210 concentration (dose) and adjust the inhalation protocol accordingly. If FEV1 declines by>=20% or more compared to the control value or if the maximum concentration (amount) has been inhaled, the test should be stopped. After inhaling the chemicalD016210, close observation of the subject's response is necessary. If necessary, monitor blood chemicalD010100 saturation and auscultate lung breath sounds. The test should be promptly discontinued in case of noticeable clinical symptoms or signs.(4) Inhalation of bronchodilator and repeat lung diseaseD003291 test to assess recovery: when the bronchial challenge test shows a positive response (FEV1 decline>=20%) or suspiciously positive, the subject should receive inhaled rapid-acting bronchodilators, such as short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) or short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA). Suppose the subject exhibits obvious symptoms of diseaseD004417, diseaseD012135, or typical diseaseD001249 manifestations, and diseaseD012135 is audible in the lungs, even if the positive criteria are not met. In that case, the challenge test should be immediately stopped, and rapid-acting bronchodilators should be administered. Taking chemicalD000420 as an example, inhale 200-400 mug (100 mug per puff, 2-4 puffs, as determined by the physician based on the subject's condition). Reassess pulmonary diseaseD003291 after 5-10 minutes. If FEV1 recovers to within 10% of the baseline value, the test can be concluded. However, if there is no noticeable improvement (FEV1 decline still>=10%), record the symptoms and signs and repeat the bronchodilation procedure as mentioned earlier. Alternatively, add chemicalD009241 (SAMA) or further administer nebulized bronchodilators and corticosteroids for intensified treatment while keeping the subject under observation until FEV1 recovers to within 90% of the baseline value before allowing the subject to leave.Question 6: What are the quality control requirements for the chemicalD000250 and Astograph MCT equipment?(1) chemicalD000250 Method Equipment Quality Control: The chemicalD000250 method for MCT uses a nebulizing inhalation device that requires standardized flowmeters, compressed air power source pressure and flow, and nebulizer aerosol output. Specific quality control methods are as follows:a. Flow and volume calibration of the quantitative nebulization device: Connect the flowmeter, an empty nebulization chamber, and a nebulization filter in sequence, attaching the compressed air source to the bottom of the chamber to ensure airtight connections. Then, attach a 3 L calibration syringe to the subject's breathing interface and simulate the flow during nebulization (typically low flow:<2 L/s) to calibrate the flow and volume. If calibration results exceed the acceptable range of the device's technical standards, investigate and address potential issues such as air leaks or increased resistance due to a damp filter, then recalibrate. Cleaning the flowmeter or replacing the filter can change the resistance in the breathing circuit, requiring re-calibration of the flow.b. Testing the compressed air power source: Regularly test the device, connecting the components as mentioned above. Then, block the opening of the nebulization device with a stopper or hand, start the compressed air power source, and test its pressure and flow. If the test results do not meet the technical standards, professional maintenance of the equipment may be required.c. Verification of aerosol output of the nebulization chamber: Regularly verify all nebulization chambers used in provocation tests. Steps include adding a certain amount of chemicalD012965 to the chamber, weighing and recording the chamber's weight (including chemicalD012965), connecting the nebulizer to the quantitative nebulization device, setting the nebulization time, starting nebulization, then weighing and recording the post-nebulization weight. Calculate the unit time aerosol output using the formula [(weight before nebulization-weight after nebulization)/nebulization time]. Finally, set the nebulization plan for the provocation test based on the aerosol output, considering the chemicalD016210 concentration, single inhalation nebulization duration, number of nebulization, and cumulative dose to ensure precise dosing of the inhaled chemicalD016210.(2) Astograph method equipment quality control: Astograph method equipment for MCT consists of a respiratory resistance monitoring device and a nebulization medication device. Perform zero-point calibration, volume calibration, impedance verification, and nebulization chamber checks daily before tests to ensure the resistance measurement system and nebulization system diseaseD003291 properly. Calibration is needed every time the equipment is turned on, and more frequently if there are significant changes in environmental conditions.a. Zero-point calibration: Perform zero-point calibration before testing each subject. Ensure the nebulization chamber is properly installed and plugged with no air leaks.b. Volume calibration: Use a 3 L calibration syringe to calibrate the flow sensor at a low flow rate (approximately 1 L/s).c. Resistance verification: Connect low impedance tubes (1.9-2.2 cmH2O L-1 s-1) and high impedance tubes (10.2-10.7 cmH2O L-1 s-1) to the device interface for verification.d. Bypass check: Start the bypass check and record the bypass value; a value>150 ml/s is normal.e. Nebulization chamber check: Check each of the 12 nebulization chambers daily, especially those containing bronchodilators, to ensure normal spraying. The software can control each nebulization chamber to produce spray automatically for a preset duration (e.g., 2 seconds). Observe the formation of chemicalD014867 droplets on the chamber walls, indicating normal spraying. If no nebulization occurs, check for incorrect connections or blockages.Question 7: How to set up and select the chemicalD000250 method in MCT?The software program of the aerosol provocation system in the quantitative nebulization method can independently set the nebulizer output, concentration of the chemicalD016210 agent, administration time, and number of administrations and combine these parameters to create the challenge test process. In principle, the concentration of the chemicalD016210 agent should increase from low to high, and the dose should increase from small to large. According to the standard, a 2-fold or 4-fold incremental challenge process is generally used. In clinical practice, the dose can be simplified for subjects with good baseline lung diseaseD003291 and no history of diseaseD012135, such as using a recommended 2-concentration, 5-step method (25 and 50 g/L) and (6.25 and 25 g/L). Suppose FEV1 decreases by more than 10% compared to the baseline during the test to ensure subject safety. In that case, the incremental dose of the chemicalD016210 agent can be reduced, and the inhalation program can be adjusted appropriately. If the subject's baseline lung diseaseD003291 declines or has recent daytime or nighttime symptoms such as diseaseD012135 or diseaseD002637, a low concentration, low dose incremental process should be selected.Question 8: What are the precautions for the operation process of the Astograph method in MCT?(1) Test equipment: The Astograph method utilizes the forced oscillation technique, applying a sinusoidal oscillating pressure at the mouthpiece during calm breathing. Subjects inhale nebulized chemicalD016210 of increasing concentrations while continuous monitoring of respiratory resistance (Rrs) plots the changes, assessing airway reactivity and sensitivity. The nebulization system employs jet nebulization technology, comprising a compressed air pump and 12 nebulization cups. The first cup contains chemicalD012965, cups 2 to 11 contain increasing concentrations of chemicalD016210, and the 12th cup contains a bronchodilator solution.(2) Provocation process: Prepare 10 solutions of chemicalD016210 provocant with gradually increasing concentrations.(3) Operational procedure: The oscillation frequency is usually set to 3 Hz (7 Hz for children) during the test. The subject breathes calmly, inhales chemicalD012965 solution nebulized first, and records the baseline resistance value (if the subject's baseline resistance value is higher than 10 cmH2O L-1 s-1, the challenge test should not be performed). Then, the subject gradually inhales increasing concentrations of chemicalD016210 solution. Each concentration solution is inhaled for 1 minute, and the nebulization system automatically switches to the next concentration for inhalation according to the set time. Each nebulizer cup contains 2-3 ml of solution, the output is 0.15 ml/min, and each concentration is inhaled for 1 minute. The dose-response curve is recorded automatically. Subjects should breathe tidally during the test, avoiding deep breaths and swallowing. Continue until Rrs significantly rises to more than double the baseline value, or if the subject experiences notable diseaseD012818 or other discomfort, such as diseaseD012135 in both lungs upon auscultation. At this point, the inhalation of the provocant should be stopped and the subject switchs to inhaling a bronchodilator until Rrs returns to pre-provocation levels. If there is no significant increase in Rrs, stop the test after inhaling the highest concentration of chemicalD016210.Question 9: How to interpret the results of the MCT?The method chosen for the MCT determines the specific indicators used for interpretation. The most commonly used indicator is FEV1, although other parameters such as Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and Rrs can also be used to assess airway hyperresponsiveness.Qualitative judgment: The test results can be classified as positive, suspiciously positive, or negative, based on a combination of the judgment indicators and changes in the subject's symptoms. If FEV1 decreases by>=20% compared to the baseline value after not completely inhaling at the highest concentration, the result can be judged as positive for chemicalD016210 bronchial challenge test. If the 9606 has obvious diseaseD012135 symptoms or diseaseD012135 is heard in both lungs, but the challenge test does not meet the positive criteria (the highest dose/concentration has been inhaled), and FEV1 decreases between 10% and 20% compared to the baseline level, the result can also be judged as positive. If FEV1 decreases between 15% and 20% compared to the baseline value without diseaseD004417 or diseaseD012135, the result can be judged as suspiciously positive. Astograph method: If Rrs rises to 2 times or more of the baseline resistance before reaching the highest inhalation concentration, or if the subject's lungs have diseaseD012135 and severe diseaseD003371, the challenge test can be judged as positive. Regardless of the result of the chemicalD016210 bronchial challenge test, factors that affect airway reactivity, such as drugs, seasons, climate, diurnal variations, and diseaseD012141, should be excluded.Quantitative judgment: When using the chemicalD000250 method, the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness can be graded based on PD20-FEV1 or PC20-FEV1. Existing evidence suggests that PD20 shows good consistency when different nebulizers, inhalation times, and starting concentrations of chemicalD016210 are used for bronchial provocation tests, whereas there is more variability with PC20. Therefore, PD20 is often recommended as the quantitative assessment indicator. The threshold value for PD20 with the chemicalD000250 method is 2.5 mg.The Astograph method often uses the minimum cumulative dose (Dmin value, in Units) to reflect airway sensitivity. Dmin is the minimum cumulative dose of chemicalD016210 required to produce a linear increase in Rrs. A dose of 1 g/L of the drug concentration inhaled for 1-minute equals 1 unit. It's important to note that with the continuous increase in inhaled provocant concentration, the concept of cumulative dose in the Astograph method should not be directly compared to other methods. Most diseaseD001249 9606 have a Dmin<10 Units, according to Japanese guidelines. The Astograph method, having been used in China for over twenty years, suggests a high likelihood of diseaseD001249 when Dmin<=6 Units, with a smaller Dmin value indicating a higher probability. When Dmin is between 6 and 10 Units, further differential diagnosis is advised to ascertain whether the condition is diseaseD001249.Precautions:A negative chemicalD016210 challenge test (MCT) does not entirely rule out diseaseD001249. The test may yield negative results due to the following reasons:(1) Prior use of medications that reduce airway responsiveness, such as beta2 agonists, anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, chemicalD013806, corticosteroids, etc., and insufficient washout time.(2) Failure to meet quality control standards in terms of pressure, flow rate, particle size, and nebulization volume of the aerosol delivery device.(3) Poor subject cooperation leads to inadequate inhalation of the chemicalD016210 agent.(4) Some exercise-induced diseaseD001249 9606 may not be sensitive to direct bronchial challenge tests like the chemicalD016210 challenge and require indirect bronchial challenge tests such as diseaseD006985, cold air, or exercise challenge to induce a positive response.(5) A few cases of occupational diseaseD001249 may only react to specific antigens or sensitizing agents, requiring specific allergen exposure to elicit a positive response.A positive MCT does not necessarily indicate diseaseD001249. Other conditions can also present with airway hyperresponsiveness and yield positive results in the challenge test, such as diseaseD065631, diseaseD029481, viral upper respiratory infections, diseaseD000542, diseaseD004802, diseaseD003550, diseaseD012507, diseaseD001987, diseaseD012128, post-cardiopulmonary transplant, diseaseD006333, and more. Furthermore, factors like smoking, air pollution, or exercise before the test may also result in a positive bronchial challenge test.Question 10: What are the standardized requirements for the MCT report?The report should include: (1) basic information about the subject; (2) examination data and graphics: present baseline data, measurement data after the last two challenge doses or concentrations in tabular form, and the percentage of actual measured values compared to the baseline; flow-volume curve and volume-time curve before and after challenge test; dose-response curve: showing the threshold for positive challenge; (3) opinions and conclusions of the report: including the operator's opinions, quality rating of the examination, and review opinions of the reviewing physician.Question 11: What are the adverse reactions and safety measures of MCT?During the MCT, the subject needs to repeatedly breathe forcefully and inhale bronchial challenge agents, which may induce or exacerbate diseaseD001986 and contraction and may even cause life-threatening situations. Medical staff should be fully aware of the indications, contraindications, medication use procedures, and emergency response plans for the MCT.

We aimed to evaluate the pulmonary impact of early diseaseD044882 by using 2-h standard oral chemicalD005947 tolerance testing (OGTT) and continuous chemicalD005947 monitoring (CGM) in people with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). METHODS: diseaseD003550 aged >=10 years old without known diseaseD003550 were included in a five-year prospective multicentre study. Annual evaluation of nutritional status, lung diseaseD003291, OGTT and CGM was set up. Associations between annual rate changes (Delta) in lung diseaseD003291, DeltaFEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) percentage predicted (pp) and DeltaFVC (forced vital capacity) pp., and annual rate changes in OGTT or CGM variables were estimated with a mixed model with a random effect for subject. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2016, 112 diseaseD003550 (age: 21 +- 11 years, BMI (body mass index) z-score: -0.55 +- 1.09, FEV1pp: 77 +- 24 %, 2-h OGTT chemicalD005947: 122 +- 44 mg/dL, AUC (area under curve) >140 mg/dL: 1 mg/dL/day (0.2, 3.0) were included. A total of 428 OGTTs and 480 CGMs were collected. The participants presented annual decline of FVCpp and FEV1pp at -1.0 % per year (-1.6, -0.4), p < 0.001 and - 1.9 % per year (-2.5, -1.3), p < 0.001 respectively without change in BMI z-score during the study. Variation of two-hour OGTT chemicalD005947 was not associated with declining lung diseaseD003291, as measured by DeltaFEV1pp (p = 0.94) and DeltaFVCpp (p = 0.90). Among CGM variables, only increase in AUC >140 mg/dL between two annual visits was associated with a decrease in DeltaFVCpp (p < 0.05) and DeltaFEV1pp (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study supports the fact that early diseaseD044882 revealed by CGM predict disease608852 decline in diseaseD003550, while 2-h standard OGTT chemicalD005947 is not associated with diseaseD008171.
38150545		diseaseD014777 diseaseD000402 promotes cell engraftment in an in vitro model of diseaseD003550 cell therapy.Cell therapy is a potential treatment for diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). However, cell engraftment into the airway epithelium is challenging. Here, we model cell engraftment in vitro using the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture system by injuring well-differentiated diseaseD003550 ALI cultures and delivering non-diseaseD003550 cells at the time of peak injury. Engraftment efficiency was quantified by measuring chimerism by droplet digital PCR and functional ion transport in Ussing chambers. Using this model, we found that 9606 bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) engraft more efficiently when they are cultured by conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) culture methods. Cell engraftment into the airway epithelium requires diseaseD000402, but the extent of injury needed is unknown. We compared three injury models and determined that severe injury with partial epithelial denudation facilitates long-term cell engraftment and functional ncbi1080 recovery up to 20% of wildtype function. The airway epithelium promptly regenerates in response to injury, creating competition for space and posing a barrier to effective engraftment. We examined competition dynamics by time-lapse confocal imaging and found that delivered cells accelerate airway regeneration by incorporating into the epithelium. Irradiating the repairing epithelium granted engrafting cells a competitive advantage by diminishing resident stem cell proliferation. Intentionally, causing severe injury to the diseaseD008171 of people with diseaseD003550 would be dangerous. However, naturally occurring events like diseaseD014777 can induce similar epithelial damage with patches of denuded epithelium. We found that diseaseD014777 preconditioning promoted effective engraftment of cells primed for diseaseD014777 resistance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cell therapy is a potential treatment for diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). Here, we model cell engraftment by injuring diseaseD003550 air-liquid interface cultures and delivering non-diseaseD003550 cells. Successful engraftment required severe diseaseD009375. Intentionally injuring the diseaseD008171 to this extent would be dangerous. However, naturally occurring events like diseaseD014777 induce similar epithelial damage. We found that diseaseD014777 preconditioning promoted the engraftment of cells primed for diseaseD014777 resistance leading to ncbi1080 functional recovery to 20% of the wildtype.
38327061		Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for non-diseaseD001987 in children.BACKGROUND: Pediatric diseaseD001987 is a common diseaseD012140 in children. The use of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for its treatment remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to compare and analyze the clinical efficacy of thoracoscopic surgery and thoracotomy in the treatment of pediatric diseaseD001987 and summarize the surgical treatment experience of VATS in children with diseaseD001987. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center cohort study. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 46 pediatric 9606 who underwent surgery with diseaseD001987 at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from May 2015 to May 2023. The 9606 were divided into two groups: the VATS group (25 cases) and the thoracotomy group (21 cases). Comparative analysis was performed on various parameters including basic clinical data, surgical methods, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, transfusion status, diseaseD010149, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, chest tube drainage time, length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and follow-up information. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups of 9606 in terms of age, weight, gender, etiology, duration of symptoms, site of onset, and comorbidities (p > 0.05). The operation time in the VATS group was longer than that in the thoracotomy group (p < 0.001). However, the VATS group had better outcomes in terms of intraoperative blood loss, transfusion status, diseaseD010149, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, chest tube drainage time, and length of hospital stay (p < 0.05). The incidence of diseaseD011183 in the VATS group was lower than that in the thoracotomy group, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.152). Follow-up data showed no statistically significant difference in the surgical treatment outcomes between the two groups (p = 0.493). CONCLUSION: The incidence of complications and mortality in surgical treatment of diseaseD001987 is acceptable. Compared with thoracotomy surgery, VATS has advantages such as smaller diseaseD014947, less diseaseD010146, faster recovery, and fewer complications. For suitable pediatric 9606 with diseaseD001987, VATS is a safe and effective surgical method.

38070531		A core outcome set for diseaseD001987 in children and adolescents for use in clinical research: an international consensus study.Improving the treatment of non-diseaseD003550 diseaseD001987 in children and adolescents requires high-quality research with outcomes that meet study objectives and are meaningful for 9606 and their parents and caregivers. In the absence of systematic reviews or agreement on the health outcomes that should be measured in paediatric diseaseD001987, we established an international, multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a core outcome set (COS) that incorporates 9606 and parent perspectives. We undertook a systematic review from which a list of 21 outcomes was constructed; these outcomes were used to inform the development of separate surveys for ranking by parents and 9606 and by health-care professionals. 562 participants (201 parents and 9606 from 17 countries, 361 health-care professionals from 58 countries) completed the surveys. Following two consensus meetings, agreement was reached on a ten-item COS with five outcomes that were deemed to be essential: quality of life, symptoms, exacerbation frequency, non-scheduled health-care visits, and hospitalisations. Use of this international consensus-based COS will ensure that studies have consistent, 9606-focused outcomes, facilitating research worldwide and, in turn, the development of evidence-based guidelines for improved clinical care and outcomes. Further research is needed to develop validated, accessible measurement instruments for several of the outcomes in this COS.
38270329	Positive_Correlation|chemicalD019314|diseaseC580055; Positive_Correlation|chemicalD019314|diseaseD003550	BMI increase during early childhood in boys with diseaseD003550 and diseaseC580055.BACKGROUND: Increase in body mass index (BMI) in early childhood (1-6 years) was found to be a contributing factor for impaired final height in boys with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). diseaseC580055 (before age 9 years in boys) may contribute to an impaired final height by triggering an early acceleration of bone age resulting in a compromised growth spurt during puberty. We aimed to analyze the timing of adrenarche in boys with diseaseD003550 and to associate BMI increase in early childhood to timing of adrenarche. METHODS: Boys with diseaseD003550, aged 8-9 years, visiting the diseaseD003550 expertize center Utrecht were included. Since 2018, anthropomorphic, pubertal and endocrine data were collected. diseaseC580055 in boys was defined as a chemicalD019314 (chemicalD019314) >= 1 micromol/L before the age of 9 years. RESULTS: Thirteen boys (mean age 8.55 +- 0.27 years) were enrolled. The median (IQR) chemicalD019314-level was 1.3 micromol/L (0.71-2.40). Eight boys (61.5%) had an early rise in chemicalD019314-levels >= 1 micromol/L. Mean increase in BMI Z-score between 1 and 6 years of age (DeltaBMI1-6 ) was -0.07 +- 0.86. A significant correlation was found between DeltaBMI1-6 and chemicalD019314-levels at the age of 8-9 years (r = 0.624, p = 0.040). In five boys with early rise in chemicalD019314, accelerated bone age was found (average 1.55 +- 0.96 years). CONCLUSION: In this small cohort, 61.5% of boys with diseaseD003550 between 8 and 9 years had an early rise of chemicalD019314, which was correlated to DeltaBMI1 -6 between 1 and 6 years. diseaseC580055 may be caused by DeltaBMI1 -6 .

38291686		Towards a Standardized Classification of the Hepatobiliary Manifestations in diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550): A Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN Position Paper.The broad spectrum of hepatobiliary involvement in diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) has been commonly referred to as diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550). However, differences in the definitions of diseaseD003550 have led to variations in reported prevalence, incidence rates, and standardized recommendations for diagnosis and therapies. Harmonizing the description of the spectrum of hepatobiliary involvement in all people with diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) is deemed essential for providing a reliable account of the natural history, which in turn supports the development of meaningful clinical outcomes in 9606 care and research. Recognizing this necessity, The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) commissioned and tasked a committee to develop and propose a systematic classification of the diseaseD003550 hepatobiliary manifestations to increase uniformity, accuracy, and comparability for clinical, registry, and research purposes. This report describes the committee's combined expert position statement on hepatobiliary involvement in diseaseD003550, which has been endorsed by NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN. We recommend using diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) as the updated term to describe and classify all hepatobiliary manifestations in all diseaseD003550. diseaseD003550 encompasses the current extensive spectrum of phenotypical, clinical, or diagnostic expressions of diseaseD017093 observed in diseaseD003550. We present a schematic categorization of diseaseD003550, which may also be used to track and classify the changes and development of diseaseD003550 in diseaseD003550 over time. The proposed classification for diseaseD003550 is based on expert consensus and has not been validated for clinical practice and research purposes. Achieving validation should be an important aim for future research.
38088381	Association|chemicalD009569|diseaseD002925	Device comparison study to measure nasal chemicalD009569 in relation to diseaseD002925.diseaseD002925 (diseaseD002925) is a genetic diseaseD012140 characterized by chronic diseaseD003371, recurrent diseaseD012141, and diseaseD000092562. The measurement of nasal chemicalD009569 (nNO) against resistance has been suggested as a sensitive screening method. However, current recommendations argue for the use of expensive, chemiluminescence devices to measure nNO. This study aimed to compare nNO measurement using three different devices in distinguishing diseaseD002925 9606 from healthy controls and diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) 9606 and to evaluate their diagnostic precision. The study included 16 controls, 16 diseaseD002925 9606, and 12 diseaseD003550 9606 matched for age and sex. nNO measurements were performed using a chemiluminescence device (Eco Medics CLD 88sp), and two devices based on electrochemical sensors (Medisoft FeNO+ and NIOX Vero) following standardized guidelines. Correlation estimation, Bland-Altman, ROC curve, and one-way ANOVA were used to assess device differences and diagnostic performance. Significantly lower nNO output values were observed in diseaseD002925 and diseaseD003550 9606 compared to controls during exhalation against resistance. The correlation analysis showed high agreement among the three devices. ROC curve analysis demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity at different cut-off values for all devices in distinguishing diseaseD002925 9606 from controls (optimal cut-offs: EcoMedics 73, Medisoft 92 and NIOX 87 (nl min-1)). Higher nNO output values were obtained with the Medisoft and NIOX devices as compared to the EcoMedics device, with a bias of-19 nl min-1(95% CI: -73-35) and -21 nl min-1(-73-31) accordingly. These findings indicate that all three tested devices can potentially serve as diagnostic tools for diseaseD002925 if device specific cut-off values are used. This last-mentioned aspect warrants further studies and consideration in defining optimal cut-offs for individual device.
38386889	Association|diseaseD010188|ncbi1990	An Updated Review of diseaseD010188 Prevalence finds diseaseD010188 to be More Common in General Population than Rates of diseaseD060085.diseaseD010188 (diseaseD010188) is frequently described as underscreened, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. The treatment for diseaseD010188 is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), which is costly, and provider confidence in prescribing may be one barrier to reducing undertreatment. The lack of interchangeability studies for prescription PERT and/or lack of efficacy studies of over-the-counter enzyme options may be another barrier. This paper reviewed the prevalence of diseaseD010188 in the general population and in diseaseD060085. Prevalence of diseaseD010188 in the general population is commonly estimated around 10-20%, and further research is needed to evaluate diseaseD010188 across all age groups and to better understand in which age group diseaseD010188 becomes more prevalent, as an age effect is often seen in diseaseD010188 prevalence studies. diseaseD010188 is perceived to be highly correlated with certain diseaseD060085, and the majority (~65%) of diseaseD010188 literature is related to a co-condition such as diseaseD003550, diseaseD010195, post-surgery, diseaseD009369, or diseaseD003920. It can be estimated that 85% of literature in identified diseaseD060085, or 56% of total diseaseD010188 literature, is on rarer diseaseD060085 which only represent <1% of diseaseD010188 overall. In contrast, there is very little research and literature on diseaseD010188 in the general population. The highest absolute rates of diseaseD010188 with diseaseD060085 are likely diseaseD003920 and possibly diseaseD043183 with diseaseD003967, yet they are among the least commonly researched in co-condition and diseaseD010188 studies. A lack of research on diseaseD010188 in the general population and in the more common diseaseD060085 may be contributing to the rates of underdiagnosis and underscreening, as well as undertreatment for those with low fecal ncbi1990 levels.
38272397	Negative_Correlation|chemicalC507253|diseaseD003550; Association|diseaseD003550|ncbi1080	Backbone cationized highly branched chemicalC507253s as enhanced delivery vectors in non-viral gene therapy.Gene therapy holds great potential for treating Lung diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) which is a fatal diseaseD009386 arising from mutations in the ncbi1080 (ncbi1080) gene, resulting in dysfunctional ncbi1080 protein. However, the advancement and clinical application of diseaseD003550 gene therapy systems have been hindered due to the absence of a highly efficient delivery vector. In this work, we introduce a new generation of highly branched chemicalC507253 (HPAE) gene delivery vectors for diseaseD003550 treatment. Building upon the classical chemical composition of HPAE, a novel backbone cationization strategy was developed to incorporate additional functional chemicalD000588 groups into HPAE without altering their branching degree. By carefully adjusting the type, proportion, and backbone distribution of the added cationic groups, a series of highly effective HPAE gene delivery vectors were successfully constructed for diseaseD003550 gene therapy. In vitro assessment results showed that the backbone cationized HPAEs with randomly distributed 10% proportion of 1-(3-aminopropyl)-4-methylpiperazine (E7) chemicalD000588 groups exhibited superior transfection performance than their counterparts. Furthermore, the top-performed backbone cationized HPAEs, when loaded with therapeutic plasmids, successfully reinstated ncbi1080 protein expression in the CFBE41o- disease model, achieving levels 20-23 times higher than that of normal 9606 bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Their therapeutic effectiveness significantly surpassed that of the currently advanced commercial vectors, Xfect and Lipofectamine 3000.
38356031		Excipients for Novel Inhaled Dosage Forms: An Overview.Pulmonary drug delivery is a form of local targeting to the lungs in 9606 with diseaseD012131 like diseaseD003550, diseaseD000081029 (diseaseD000081029), diseaseD001249, diseaseD000088562, and diseaseD008175. In addition, noninvasive pulmonary delivery also presents an attractive alternative to systemically administered therapeutics, not only for localized diseaseD012131 but also for systemic absorption. Pulmonary delivery offers the advantages of a relatively low dose, low incidence of systemic side effects, and rapid onset of action for some drugs compared to other systemic administration routes. While promising, inhaled delivery of therapeutics is often complex owing to factors encompassing mechanical barriers, chemical barriers, selection of inhalation device, and limited choice of dosage form excipients. There are very few excipients that are approved by the FDA for use in developing inhaled drug products. Depending upon the dosage form, and inhalation devices such as pMDIs, DPIs, and nebulizers, different excipients can be used to provide physical and chemical stability and to deliver the dose efficiently to the lungs. This review article focuses on discussing a variety of excipients that have been used in novel inhaled dosage forms as well as inhalation devices.
38269943		Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Deep-Learning Based Classification of diseaseD003550 Lung Changes in MRI.Algorithms increasing the transparence and explain ability of neural networks are gaining more popularity. Applying them to custom neural network architectures and complex medical problems remains challenging. In this work, several algorithms such as integrated gradients and grad came were used to generate additional explainable outputs for the classification of lung perfusion changes and mucus plugging in diseaseD003550 9606 on MRI. The algorithms are applied on top of an already existing deep learning-based classification pipeline. From six explain ability algorithms, four were implemented successfully and one yielded satisfactory results which might provide support to the radiologist. It was evident, that the areas relevant for the classification were highlighted, thus emphasizing the applicability of deep learning for classification of lung changes in diseaseD003550 9606. Using explainable concepts with deep learning could improve confidence of clinicians towards deep learning and introduction of more diagnostic decision support systems.
38179886	Association|chemicalD009584|diseaseD056151	Comparison of particles in exhaled air and multiple breath washout for assessment of small airway function in children with diseaseD003550.BACKGROUND: The introduction of modulator therapy for diseaseD003550 (diseaseD003550) has led to an increased interest in the detection of small diseaseD029424 (diseaseD056151) as sensitive marker of treatment response. The particles in exhaled air (PExA) method, which records exhaled particle mass (PEx ng/L) and number (PExNR), detects diseaseD056151 in adult 9606. Our primary aim was to investigate if PExA outcomes in children with diseaseD003550 are different when compared to controls and associated with more severe disease. Secondary aims were to assess feasibility and repeatability of PExA in children with diseaseD003550 and to correlate PExA to multiple breath chemicalD009584 washout (MBNW) as an established marker of diseaseD056151. METHODS: Thirteen healthy children (HC), 17 children with diseaseD003550 with normal lung function (diseaseD003550-N) (FEV1 z-score >= -1.64) and six with diseaseD000402 (diseaseD003550) (FEV1 z-score < -1.64) between 8 and 18 years performed MBNW followed by PExA and spirometry. Children with diseaseD003550 repeated the measurements after 3 months. RESULTS: PEx ng/L and PExNR/L per liter of exhaled breath were similar between the three groups. The lung clearance index (LCI) was significantly higher in both diseaseD003550-N and diseaseD003550 compared to HC. All participants, except one, were able to perform PExA. Coefficient of variation for PEx ng/l was (median) 0.38, range 0-1.25 and PExNR/l 0.38, 0-1.09. Correlation between LCI and PEx ng/l was low, rs 0.32 (p = .07). CONCLUSION: PExA is feasible in children. In contrast to LCI, PExA did not differentiate healthy children from children with diseaseD003550 suggesting it to be a less sensitive tool to detect diseaseD056151.
