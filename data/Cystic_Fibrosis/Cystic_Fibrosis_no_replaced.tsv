38167788	Towards personalized medicine for cystic fibrosis patients with rare mutations. 
38377145	Assessment of functional diversities in patients with Asthma, COPD, Asthma-COPD overlap, and Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the discriminating power of spirometric and plethysmographic lung function parameters to differenciate the diagnosis of asthma, ACO, COPD, and to define functional characteristics for more precise classification of obstructive lung diseases. From the databases of 4 centers, a total of 756 lung function tests (194 healthy subjects, 175 with asthma, 71 with ACO, 78 with COPD and 238 with CF) were collected, and gradients among combinations of target parameters from spirometry (forced expiratory volume one second: FEV1; FEV1/forced vital capacity: FEV1/FVC; forced expiratory flow between 25-75% FVC: FEF25-75), and plethysmography (effective, resistive airway resistance: sReff; aerodynamic work of breathing at rest: sWOB), separately for in- and expiration (sReffIN, sReffEX, sWOBin, sWOBex) as well as static lung volumes (total lung capacity: TLC; functional residual capacity: FRCpleth; residual volume: RV), the control of breathing (mouth occlusion pressure: P0.1; mean inspiratory flow: VT/TI; the inspiratory to total time ratio: TI/Ttot) and the inspiratory impedance (Zinpleth = P0.1/VT/TI) were explored. Linear discriminant analyses (LDA) were applied to identify discriminant functions and classification rules using recursive partitioning decision trees. LDA showed a high classification accuracy (sensitivity and specificity > 90%) for healthy subjects, COPD and CF. The accuracy dropped for asthma (~70%) and even more for ACO (~60%). The decision tree revealed that P0.1, sRtot, and VT/TI differentiate most between healthy and asthma (68.9%), COPD (82.1%), and CF (60.6%). Moreover, using sWOBex and Zinpleth ACO can be discriminated from asthma and COPD (60%). Thus, the functional complexity of obstructive lung diseases can be understood, if specific spirometric and plethysmographic parameters are used. Moreover, the newly described parameters of airway dynamics and the central control of breathing including Zinpleth may well serve as promising functional marker in the field of precision medicine.
38350918	High-sensitivity C-reactive protein level in stable-state bronchiectasis predicts exacerbation risk. BACKGROUND: Elevation of systemic inflammatory markers were found to correlate with increased disease extent, reduced lung function and higher risk of future severe exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although a significant correlation of circulating hs-CRP levels with HRCT scores and resting oxygen saturation in patients with stable-state non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis was suggested, there is little data on the relationship between hs-CRP and the prognosis of bronchiectasis and a lack of data on the role of hs-CRP in predicting bronchiectasis exacerbation. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on Chinese patients with non- CF bronchiectasis from 1st October to 31st December 2021. Baseline serum hs-CRP were obtained at stable-state. The follow-up period lasted for one year. Co-primary endpoints were the development of any bronchiectasis exacerbation and hospitalized bronchiectasis exacerbation. RESULTS: Totally 123 patients were included. Higher hs-CRP was associated with increased risk to develop any bronchiectasis exacerbation, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.254 (95% CI = 1.040-4.885, p = 0.039), and borderline significantly increased hospitalized bronchiectasis exacerbation with aOR of 1.985 (95% CI = 0.922-4.277, p = 0.080). CONCLUSION: Baseline serum hs-CRP level at stable-state can predict risk of bronchiectasis exacerbation, which is reflecting chronic low-grade inflammation in bronchiectasis.
38394229	Combination treatment to improve mucociliary transport of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. People with muco-obstructive pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often have acute or chronic respiratory infections that are difficult to treat due in part to the accumulation of hyperconcentrated mucus within the airway. Mucus accumulation and obstruction promote chronic inflammation and infection and reduce therapeutic efficacy. Bacterial aggregates in the form of biofilms exhibit increased resistance to mechanical stressors from the immune response (e.g., phagocytosis) and chemical treatments including antibiotics. Herein, combination treatments designed to disrupt the mechanical properties of biofilms and potentiate antibiotic efficacy are investigated against mucus-grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and optimized to 1) alter biofilm viscoelastic properties, 2) increase mucociliary transport rates, and 3) reduce bacterial viability. A disulfide bond reducing agent (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, TCEP), a surfactant (NP40), a biopolymer (hyaluronic acid, HA), a DNA degradation enzyme (DNase), and an antibiotic (tobramycin) are tested in various combinations to maximize biofilm disruption. The viscoelastic properties of biofilms are quantified with particle tracking microrheology and transport rates are quantified in a mucociliary transport device comprised of fully differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells. The combination of the NP40 with hyaluronic acid and tobramycin was the most effective at increasing mucociliary transport rates, decreasing the viscoelastic properties of mucus, and reducing bacterial viability. Multimechanistic targeting of biofilm infections may ultimately result in improved clinical outcomes, and the results of this study may be translated into future in vivo infection models.
38310629	Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor Population Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with Cystic Fibrosis: A First Step Toward Personalized Therapy. BACKGROUND: A major breakthrough in cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy was achievedAQ1 with CFTR modulators. The lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination is indicated for the treatment of CF in pediatric patients above 6 years old. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in these vulnerable pediatric populations are AQ2crucial to optimize treatment protocols. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The objectives of this study were to describe the population PK (PPK) of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in children with CF, and to identify factors associated with interindividual variability. The association between drug exposure and clinical response was also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 75 children were included in this PPK study, with 191 concentrations available for each compound and known metabolites (lumacaftor, ivacaftor, ivacaftor-M1, and ivacaftor-M6). PPK analysis was performed using Monolix software. A large interindividual variability was observed. The main sources of interpatient variability identified were patient bodyweight and hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase). Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) was statistically associated with the level of exposure to ivacaftor after 48 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first analysis of lumacaftor/ivacaftor PPK in children with CF. These data suggest that dose adjustment is required after identifying variability factors to optimize efficacy. The use of therapeutic drug monitoring as a basis for dose adjustment in children with CF may be useful.
38287360	Promising antibacterial efficacy of arenicin peptides against the emerging opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium abscessus. BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium abscessus, a fast-growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium, is an emerging opportunistic pathogen responsible for chronic bronchopulmonary infections in people with respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Due to its intrinsic polyresistance to a wide range of antibiotics, most treatments for M. abscessus pulmonary infections are poorly effective. In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) active against bacterial strains and less prompt to cause resistance, represent a good alternative to conventional antibiotics. Herein, we evaluated the effect of three arenicin isoforms, possessing two or four Cysteines involved in one (Ar-1, Ar-2) or two disulfide bonds (Ar-3), on the in vitro growth of M. abscessus. METHODS: The respective disulfide-free AMPs, were built by replacing the Cysteines with alpha-amino-n-butyric acid (Abu) residue. We evaluated the efficiency of the eight arenicin derivatives through their antimicrobial activity against M. abscessus strains, their cytotoxicity towards human cell lines, and their hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes. The mechanism of action of the Ar-1 peptide was further investigated through membrane permeabilization assay, electron microscopy, lipid insertion assay via surface pressure measurement, and the induction of resistance assay. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that Ar-1 was the safest peptide with no toxicity towards human cells and no hemolytic activity, and the most active against M. abscessus growth. Ar-1 acts by insertion into mycobacterial lipids, resulting in a rapid membranolytic effect that kills M. abscessus without induction of resistance. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present study emphasized Ar-1 as a potential new alternative to conventional antibiotics in the treatment of CF-associated bacterial infection related to M. abscessus.
38092672	Mutations in genes lpxL1, bamA, and pmrB impair the susceptibility of cystic fibrosis strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to murepavadin. Murepavadin is a peptidomimetic exhibiting specific inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas species. In the present study, its in vitro activity was assessed on 230 cystic fibrosis (CF) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 12 French hospitals, in comparison with 12 other antipseudomonal antibiotics. Although murepavadin is still in preclinical stage of development, 9.1% (n = 21) of strains had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >4 mg/L, a level at least 128-fold higher than the modal MIC value of the whole collection (<=0.06 mg/L). Whole-genome sequencing of these 21 strains along with more susceptible isogenic counterparts coexisting in the same patients revealed diverse mutations in genes involved in the synthesis (lpxL1 and lpxL2) or transport of lipopolysaccharides (bamA, lptD, and msbA), or encoding histidine kinases of two-component systems (pmrB and cbrA). Allelic replacement experiments with wild-type reference strain PAO1 confirmed that alteration of genes lpxL1, bamA, and/or pmrB can decrease the murepavadin susceptibility from 8- to 32-fold. Furthermore, we found that specific amino acid substitutions in histidine kinase PmrB (G188D, Q105P, and D45E) reduce the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to murepavadin, colistin, and tobramycin, three antibiotics used or intended to be used (murepavadin) in aerosols to treat colonized CF patients. Whether colistin or tobramycin may select mutants resistant to murepavadin or the opposite needs to be addressed by clinical studies.
38426679	Use of CFTR Modulators for Cystic Fibrosis in a Patient with Liver Transplant and ESRD on Hemodialysis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The most recent therapeutic approach to cystic fibrosis aims to correct structural and functional abnormalities of CFTR protein. CFTR modulators including ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor are used in patients with F508del mutation, with clinical improvement. To date, there are no experiences of CFTR modulator therapy in cystic fibrosis patients with organ transplantation and severe renal impairment. We report the case of a patient diagnosed with cystic fibrosis with F508del mutation, who underwent liver transplantation at the age of 19 and started hemodialysis at the age of 24 due to end-stage renal disease secondary to membranous glomerulonephritis. She was treated with Kaftrio (ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor) with clinical benefits on appetite, improvement of body mass index, and reduction of pulmonary exacerbations. A reduction of dosage to 75% of the standard dose was required due to alterations of the liver function. Conclusions. Use of CFTR modulators in patient with cystic fibrosis, liver transplant and end-stage renal disease could be considered safe but a clinical and laboratoristic monitoring of hepatic function is needed.
38088678	Respiratory system parameters in children with low severity cystic fibrosis: is there early involvement in relation to healthy peers? OBJECTIVE: To compare and analyze pulmonary function and respiratory mechanics parameters between healthy children and children with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical study included healthy children (HSG) and children with cystic fibrosis (CFG), aged 6-13 years, from teaching institutions and a reference center for cystic fibrosis in Florianopolis/SC, Brazil. The patients were paired by age and sex. Initially, an anthropometric evaluation was undertaken to pair the sample characteristics in both groups; the medical records of CFG were consulted for bacterial colonization, genotype, and disease severity (Schwachman-Doershuk Score - SDS) data. Spirometry and impulse oscillometry were used to assess pulmonary function. RESULTS: In total, 110 children were included, 55 in each group. In the CFG group, 58.2% were classified as excellent by SDS, 49.1% showed the DeltaF508 heterozygotic genotype, and 67.3% were colonized by some pathogens. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between both groups (p<0.05) in most pulmonary function parameters and respiratory mechanics. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cystic fibrosis showed obstructive ventilatory disorders and compromised peripheral airways compared with healthy children. These findings reinforce the early changes in pulmonary function and mechanics associated with this disease.
38253430	Rate and predictors of insufficient sweat volume in very young infants after pilocarpine gel iontophoresis: prospective, population-based study. OBJECTIVE: To verify the rate and predictors of 'quantity not sufficient' (QNS) among Brazilian infants younger than 3 months with positive newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis (CF). DESIGN: Prospective, population-based study. SETTING: Public Statewide Newborn Screening Programme where the incidence rate of CF is  1:11 000. PATIENTS: Subjects with positive two-tiered immunoreactive trypsinogen. INTERVENTIONS: Sweat induction and collection were performed in the same facility; one sweat sample was obtained per individual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The QNS rate and its predictors; analysis corresponded to the day of sweat collection. RESULTS: Among the 975 participants, QNS rates for 10 and 15 microL were 3.6% (95% CI 2.5% to 4.9%) and 8.3% (95% CI 6.6% to 10.2%). Infants weighing >3056 and >3845 g and with gestational age higher than 37 weeks had a greater likelihood (5.5 and 6.7, and 2.7 and 5.8 times more, respectively) of avoiding QNS than their peers. CONCLUSION: QNS rates fulfilled the requirements, but predictors differed from those recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundations guidelines.

38231535	NorA efflux pump mediates Staphylococcus aureus response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyocyanin toxicity. Endogenous transporters protect Staphylococcus aureus against antibiotics and also contribute to bacterial defense from environmental toxins. We evaluated the effect of overexpression of four efflux pumps, NorA, NorB, NorC, and Tet38, on S. aureus survival following exposure to pyocyanin (PYO) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, using a well diffusion assay. We measured the PYO-created inhibition zone and found that only an overexpression of NorA reduced S. aureus susceptibility to pyocyanin killing. The MICPYO of the NorA overexpressor increased threefold compared to that of wild-type RN6390 and was reduced 2.5-fold with reserpine, suggesting that increased NorA efflux caused PYO resistance. The PYO-created inhibition zone of a DeltanorA mutant was consistently larger than that of a plasmid-borne NorA overexpressor. PYO also produced a modest increase in norA expression (1.8-fold at 0.25 microg/mL PYO) that gradually decreased with increasing PYO concentrations. Well diffusion assays carried out using P. aeruginosa showed that DeltanorA mutant was less susceptible to killing by PYO-deficient mutants PA14phzM and PA14phzS than to killing by PA14. NorA overexpression led to reduced killing by all tested P. aeruginosa. We evaluated the NorA-PYO interaction using a collection of 22 clinical isolates from adult and pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, which included both S. aureus (CF-SA) and P. aeruginosa (CF-PA). We found that when isolated alone, CF-PA and CF-SA expressed varying levels of PYO and norA transcripts, but all four CF-PA/CF-SA pairs isolated concurrently from CF patients produced a low level of PYO and low norA transcript levels, respectively, suggesting a partial adaptation of the two bacteria in circumstances of persistent co-colonization.

38154821	Improved recognition of lung function decline as signal of cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation: a Cystic Fibrosis Learning Network Innovation Laboratory quality improvement initiative. INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a systemic autosomal recessive condition characterised by progressive lung disease. CF pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are episodes of worsening respiratory status, and frequent PEx are a risk factor for accelerated lung function decline, yet many people with CF (PwCF) go untreated at the time of decline. The goal of this quality improvement (QI) initiative was to improve recognition, treatment and follow-up of PEx in PwCF. METHODS: Using the Model for Improvement, the Cystic Fibrosis Learning Network (CFLN) initiated a QI innovation laboratory (iLab) with a global aim to decrease the rate of lung function decline in PwCF. The iLab standardised definitions for signals of PEx using a threshold for decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and/or changes in symptoms. The FEV1 decline signal was termed FIES (FEV1-indicated exacerbation signal). Processes for screening and recognition of FIES and/or symptom changes, a treatment algorithm and follow-up in the presence of a signal were tested concurrently in multiple settings. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific aim is to increase the per cent of PwCF assessed for a PEx signal at ambulatory encounters and to increase the per cent of recommendations to follow-up within 6 weeks for PwCF experiencing a PEx signal. RESULTS: FIES recognition increased from 18.6% to 73.4% across all teams during the iLab, and every team showed an improvement. Of PwCF assessed, 15.8% experienced an FIES event (>10% decline in FEV1 per cent predicted (FEV1pp)). Follow-up within 6 weeks was recommended for an average of 70.5% of those assessed for FIES and had an FEV1pp decline greater than 5%. CONCLUSION: The CFLN iLab successfully defined and implemented a process to recognise and follow-up PEx signals. This process has the potential to be spread to the larger CF community. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of these processes on PwCF outcomes.
38307319	Severity of bronchiectasis predicts use of and adherence to high frequency chest wall oscillation therapy - Analysis from the United States Bronchiectasis and NTM research registry. BACKGROUND: High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is a form of airway clearance therapy that has been available since the mid-1990s and is routinely used by patients suffering from retained pulmonary secretions. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), neuromuscular disease (NMD), and other disorders, including bronchiectasis (BE) and COPD (without BE), are commonly prescribed this therapy. Limited evidence exists describing HFCWO use in the BE population, its impact on long-term management of disease, and the specific patient populations most likely to benefit from this therapy. This study sought to characterize the clinical characteristics of patients with BE who have documented use of HFCWO at baseline and 1-year follow-up. METHODS: An analysis from a large national database registry of patients with BE was performed. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients receiving HFCWO therapy at baseline are reported. Patients were stratified into two groups based on continued or discontinued use of HFCWO therapy at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Over half (54.8 %) of patients who reported using HFCWO therapy had a Modified Bronchiectasis Severity Index (m-BSI) classified as severe, and the majority (81.4 %) experienced an exacerbation in the prior two years. Of patients with 1-year follow-up data, 73 % reported continued use of HFCWO. Compared to patients who discontinued therapy, these patients were more severe at baseline and at follow-up suggesting that patients with more severe disease are more likely to continue HFCWO therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have more severe disease and continue to experience exacerbations and hospitalizations are more likely to continue HFCWO therapy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NA.
38422338	Clinical determinants of the modified incremental step test in adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: This study primarily aimed to investigate the clinical determinants of the Modified Incremental Step Test (MIST) in adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). A secondary objective was to compare the cardiopulmonary responses after the MIST and Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT), two commonly adopted symptom-limited maximum field tests in chronic respiratory diseases. METHODS: Forty-six patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis participated in this cross-sectional study. MIST and ISWT were performed to determine exercise capacity, while disease severity, fatigue, and quality of life were assessed using the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), respectively. Quadriceps muscle strength was evaluated using a hand-held dynamometer, walking speed with a wireless inertial sensing device, and the level of physical activity (steps/day) with a pedometer. RESULTS: The BSI score, quadriceps muscle strength, daily step count, and the SGRQ total score explained 61.9% of the variance in the MIST (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.67, AR2 = 0.619). The BSI score (r = -0.412, p = 0.004), quadriceps muscle strength (r = 0.574, p = 0.001), daily step count (r = 0.523, p < 0.001), walking speed (r = 0.402, p = 0.006), FSS score (r = -0.551, p < 0.001), and SGRQ total score (r = -0.570, p < 0.001) correlated with the MIST. The patients achieved higher heart rates (HR), HR%, desaturation, dyspnea, and leg fatigue in the MIST compared to the ISWT (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity, quadriceps muscle strength, physical activity level, and quality of life were determinants of MIST. The advantages of the MIST, including higher cardiopulmonary response than ISWT and greater portability, which facilitates its use in various settings, make MIST the preferred choice for investigating symptom-limited exercise capacity in patients with NCFB.

38469782	Development of a Low Cost Semiquantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for Molecular Diagnosis of Williams Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Williams Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is a well-recognized and common genetic cause of congenital heart defects, developmental delay, hypercalcemia, and characteristic facial features. It is caused by a 1.5 - 1.8 Mb heterozygous deletion of chromosome 7q11.23 with loss of around 28 coding genes. The aim of this study was to develop a low-cost, semi-quantitative PCR (sqPCR) method to detect the chromosome 7q11.23 deletion. METHODS: Twenty-four suspected WBS cases were recruited following ethical clearance and informed consent. Blood was obtained, DNA extracted and spectrophotometrically quantified using standard methods. To detect the deletion by dosage analysis, a target region within a gene located in the WBS commonly deleted region of 7q11.23 was amplified together with a control region in a duplex sqPCR assay. The control region was telomeric to the WBS commonly deleted region and was located in chromosome 7q31.2. The two target regions within the deleted region namely a locus within ELN and a marker in the intergenic region between FZD9 and FKBP6 and designated IFF, were amplified in separate duplex sqPCR assays. The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene was used as the control for normalization. Included in the assay were a non-deleted and deleted individuals' samples. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were identified to have the deletion while five did not. All 24 patients' results were confirmed by whole exome sequencing and 11 also by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained indicates the sqPCR assay developed in this study to be an accurate and reliable diagnostic test for WBS. Most Sri Lankan patients with WBS are diagnosed clinically, as many parents of affected WBS children are unable to afford currently available molecular diagnostic testing. This low cost sqPCR test is therefore likely to benefit Sri Lankan WBS patients, by enabling genetic testing for confirming or refuting a clinical diagnosis of WBS and may be of use in other low and middle income countries.
38153868	The cost of simplifying treatments for cystic fibrosis: Implications of the SIMPLIFY trial. BACKGROUND: Dornase alfa and hypertonic saline are mucoactive therapies that can improve respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). A recent randomized control trial showed that participants with well-preserved pulmonary function taking elexacaftor + tezacaftor + ivacaftor (ETI) who discontinued dornase alfa or hypertonic saline for 6 weeks had no clinically meaningful decline in lung function. This may prompt discussions with care providers regarding ongoing use of these medications. OBJECTIVE: To compare the costs of outpatient medications between people taking ETI who continued or discontinued (1) dornase alfa or (2) hypertonic saline from 2 clinical trials and project cost differences in the US CF population if these 2 medications were used only intermittently for symptom relief instead of chronically. METHODS: The SIMPLIFY study was 2 parallel multicenter trials that randomized participants 1:1 to either continue or discontinue therapy. To estimate costs, we used data from the Merative MarketScan Databases to identify people with CF from 2020 to 2021. Our primary outcomes were differences in costs of outpatient prescription drugs among those who continued vs discontinued dornase alfa and, separately, hypertonic saline. We obtained adjusted differences in median costs. To estimate the annual cost savings if the population of people with CF taking ETI used these medications only intermittently, we multiplied the proportion of people in MarketScan with CF diagnoses who were taking each of these medications by the median cost savings per year and subtracted the cost of "rescue" use. RESULTS: A total of 392 participants from the dornase alfa trial and 273 from the hypertonic saline trial were included in analyses. The adjusted difference in median medication costs was not significant for the hypertonic saline trial, but we observed a significantly decreased 6-week cost of medications in the dornase alfa trial (adjusted median difference in costs between discontinue and continue of $5,860 (95% CI = $4,870-$6,850); P < 0.0001). We estimated that two-thirds of people with CF use ETI and dornase alfa in the United States; if they discontinued dornase alfa except for intermittent use, the resulting annual savings would be $1.21 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Although the costs of dornase alfa and hypertonic saline are smaller compared with ETI, reduction in use would lead to substantial prescription drug cost savings and reduce the treatment burden. However, individual benefits of these therapies should be considered, and decisions regarding changes in therapy remain an important discussion between people with CF and their providers. Study registration number: NCT04378153.
38379863	Continuous glucose monitoring and advanced glycation endproducts for prediction of clinical outcomes and development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes in adults with CF. Introductions: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is associated with pulmonary decline, compromised nutritional status, and earlier mortality. Onset is often insidious, so screening for early detection of glycemic abnormalities is important. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been validated in people with CF and has been shown to detect early glycemic variability otherwise missed on 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). We previously reported that CGM measures of hyperglycemia and glycemic variability are superior to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in distinguishing those with and without CFRD. However, little is known about the long-term predictive value of CGM measures of glycemia for both the development of CFRD and their effect on key clinical outcomes such as weight maintenance and pulmonary function. In addition, there have been no studies investigating advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) assessed by skin autofluorescence in people with CF. Methods: In this prospective observational study, CGM and HbA1c were measured at 2 to 3 time points 3 months apart in 77 adults with CF. Participants who did not have CFRD at the time of enrollment underwent OGTT at the baseline visit, and all participants had AGE readings at baseline. Follow up data including anthropometric measures, pulmonary function and CFRD status were collected by review of medical records 1- and 2-years after the baseline visits. We applied multivariable linear regression models correlating glycemic measures to change in key clinical outcomes (weight, BMI, FEV1) accounting for age, gender and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) use. We also conducted logistic regression analyses comparing baseline glycemic data to development of CFRD during the 2-year follow up period. Results: Of the 77 participants, 25 had pre-existing CFRD at the time of enrollment, and six participants were diagnosed with CFRD by the OGTT performed at the baseline visit. When adjusting for age, gender, and ETI use, multiple CGM measures correlated with weight and BMI decline after one year but not after two years. CGM and HbA1c at baseline did not predict decline in FEV1 (p>0.05 for all). In the 46 participants without a diagnosis of CFRD at baseline, two participants were diagnosed with CFRD over the following two years, but CGM measures at baseline did not predict progression to CFRD. Baseline AGE values were higher in individuals with CFRD and correlated with multiple measures of dysglycemia (HbA1c, AG, SD, CV, TIR, % time >140, >180, >250) as well as weight. AGE values also correlated with FEV1 decline at year 1 and weight decline at year 1 and year 2. Conclusions: Several key CGM measures of hyperglycemia and glycemic variability were predictive of future decline in weight and BMI over one year in this population of adults with CF with and without CFRD. None of the baseline glycemic variables predicted progression to CFRD over 2 years. To our knowledge, this is the first report correlating AGE levels with key clinical and glycemic measures in CF. Limitations of these analyses include the small number of participants who developed CFRD (n=2) during the follow up period and the initiation of ETI by many participants, affecting their trajectory in weight and pulmonary function. These results provide additional data supporting the potential role for CGM in identifying clinically significant dysglycemia in CF. Future studies are needed to investigate CGM as a diagnostic and screening tool for CFRD and to understand the implications of AGE measures in this patient population.
38133654	Liver magnetic resonance elastography and fat fraction in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis versus healthy children. BACKGROUND: Liver involvement is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). While liver biopsy is the gold standard for demonstrating involvement, its invasiveness prompts a search for noninvasive alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate liver involvement in pediatric patients with CF (versus healthy controls) using magnetic resonance (MR) elastography/spectroscopy and to correlate the imaging findings with clinical/laboratory characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective cross-sectional study conducted between April 2020 and March 2022 in patients with CF versus healthy controls. Patients with CF were divided into two subgroups: those with CF-related liver disease and those without. MR images were acquired on a 1.5-tesla machine. Kilopascal (kPa) values were derived from processing MR elastography images. MR spectroscopy was used to measure liver fat fraction, as an indication of hepatosteatosis. Groups were compared using either the Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to compare qualitative variables. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with CF (12 +- 3.3 years, 32 boys) and 24 healthy volunteers (11.1 +- 2.4 years, 15 boys) were included in the study. Median liver stiffness (P=0.003) and fat fraction (P=0.03) were higher in the CF patients than in the controls. Median liver stiffness values were higher in CF patients with CF-related liver disease than in those without CF-related liver disease (P=0.002). Liver stiffness values of CF patients with high alanine aminotransferase (ALT), high gamma-glutamyl transferase, and thrombocytopenia were found to be higher than those without (P=0.004, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Only the high ALT group showed a high fat fraction (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CF had higher liver stiffness than the control group, and patients with CF-related liver disease had higher liver stiffness than both the CF patients without CF-related liver disease and the control group. Patients with CF had a higher fat fraction than the control group. Noninvasive assessment of liver involvement using MR elastography/spectroscopy can support the diagnosis of CF-related liver disease and the follow-up of patients with CF.
38269412	Signal-correction errors in the EasyOne Pro LAB multiple-breath washout device significantly impact outcomes in children and adults. Multiple-breath washout (MBW) is an established technique to assess functional residual capacity (FRC) and ventilation inhomogeneity in the lung. Indirect calculation of nitrogen concentration requires accurate measurement of gas concentrations. To investigate the accuracy of the CO2 concentration and molar mass (MM) values used for the indirect calculation of nitrogen concentration in a commercial MBW device [EasyOne Pro LAB (EOPL), ndd Medizintechnik AG, Switzerland] and its impact on outcomes. We used high-precision gas mixtures to evaluate CO2 and MM sensor output in vivo and in vitro. We developed updated algorithms to correct observed errors and assessed the impact on MBW outcomes and FRC measurement accuracy compared with body plethysmography. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER)-based adjustment of the measured CO2 signal used in the EOPL led to an overestimated CO2 signal (range -0.1% to 1.0%). In addition, an uncorrected dependence on humidity was identified. These combined effects resulted in an overestimation of expired nitrogen concentrations (range -0.7% to 2.6%), and consequently MBW outcomes. Corrected algorithms reduced the mean (SD) cumulative expired volume by 15.8% (9.7%), FRC by 6.6% (3.0%), and lung clearance index by 9.9% (7.6%). Differences in FRC between the EOPL and body plethysmography further increased. Inadequate signal correction causes RER- and humidity-dependent expired nitrogen concentration errors and overestimation of test outcomes. Updated algorithms reduce average signal error, however, RER values far from the population average still cause measurement errors. Despite improved signal accuracy, the updated algorithm increased the difference in FRC between the EOPL and body plethysmography.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated the accuracy of the molar mass (MM) and CO2 sensors of a commercial multiple-breath washout device (ndd Medizintechnik AG, Switzerland). We identified humidity and respiratory exchange ratio-dependent errors that in most measurements resulted in an overestimation of expired nitrogen concentrations, and consequently, MBW results. Functional residual capacity and lung clearance index decreased by 6.6% and 9.9%, respectively. Despite improved signal accuracy, the difference in FRC between the EOPL and body plethysmography increased.
38169175	ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guideline on nutrition care for cystic fibrosis. BACKGROUND: Nutritional status is paramount in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and is directly correlated with morbidity and mortality. The first ESPEN-ESPGHAN-ECFS guidelines on nutrition care for infants, children, and adults with CF were published in 2016. An update to these guidelines is presented. METHODS: The study was developed by an international multidisciplinary working group in accordance with officially accepted standards. Literature since 2016 was reviewed, PICO questions were discussed and the GRADE system was utilized. Statements were discussed and submitted for on-line voting by the Working Group and by all ESPEN members. RESULTS: The Working Group updated the nutritional guidelines including assessment and management at all ages. Supplementation of vitamins and pancreatic enzymes remains largely the same. There are expanded chapters on pregnancy, CF-related liver disease, and CF-related diabetes, bone disease, nutritional and mineral supplements, and probiotics. There are new chapters on nutrition with highly effective modulator therapies and nutrition after organ transplantation.
38214406	Impact of habitual physical activity and exercise capacity on quality of life in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis. BACKGROUND: The influence of habitual physical activity and exercise capacity on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is poorly characterized. This study investigated the influence of habitual physical activity, exercise capacity, lung function, and body mass index (BMI) on HRQoL in adolescent and adult pwCF. METHOD: Subjects were fitted with an accelerometer to determine habitual physical activity (steps/day), including time spent at different intensities, for up to 4 weeks. Then bicycle ergometry (maximal exercise capacity; Wpeak), lung function (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s, ppFEV1 ), BMI, and response to the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) were determined. RESULTS: Sixty-five pwCF participated in the study. Physically active pwCF had significantly higher ppFEV1 (p < .001) and exercise capacity (p < .001) than inactive pwCF, and had significantly higher scores on the CFQ-R physical (p = .006), emotional (p = .015), role (p = .008), health (p = .006), and weight (p = .004) subscales. On multiple linear regression analysis, ppFEV1 and, to a lesser extent, exercise capacity, were the most important determinants of HRQoL in pwCF. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity did not influence any of the CFQ-R subscales, whereas time spent in vigorous-intensity influenced CFQ-R scores for role (p = .007), body (p = .001), health (p = .009), and weight (p = .01). CONCLUSION: HRQoL in adolescent and adult pwCF was influenced by several factors. Avoiding sedentary behavior and spending time in vigorous-intensity levels positively influenced HRQoL, whereas the total number of steps per day played only a minor role in determining HRQoL. Both ppFEV1 and exercise capacity markedly influenced HRQoL.
38251578	Antibody prevalence after three or more COVID-19 vaccine doses in individuals who are immunosuppressed in the UK: a cross-sectional study from MELODY. BACKGROUND: In the UK, additional COVID-19 vaccine booster doses and treatments are offered to people who are immunosuppressed to protect against severe COVID-19, but how best to choose the individuals that receive these vaccine booster doses and treatments is unclear. We investigated the association between seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with demographic, disease, and treatment-related characteristics after at least three COVID-19 vaccines in three cohorts of people who are immunosuppressed. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study using UK national disease registries, we identified, contacted, and recruited recipients of solid organ transplants, participants with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and participants with lymphoid malignancies who were 18 years or older, resident in the UK, and who had received at least three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. The study was open to recruitment from Dec 7, 2021, to June 26, 2022. Participants received a lateral flow immunoassay test for SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies to complete at home, and an online questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the mutually adjusted odds of seropositivity against each characteristic. FINDINGS: Between Feb 14 and June 26, 2022, we screened 101 972 people (98 725 invited, 3247 self-enrolled) and recruited 28 411 (27 9%) to the study. 23 036 (81 1%) recruited individuals provided serological data. Of these, 9927 (43 1%) were recipients of solid organ transplants, 6516 (28 3%) had rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and 6593 (28 6%) had lymphoid malignancies. 10 485 (45 5%) participants were men and 12 535 (54 4%) were women (gender was not reported for 16 [<0 1%] participants), and 21661 (94 0%) participants were of White ethnicity. The median age of participants with solid organ transplants was 60 years (SD 50-67), with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases was 65 years (54-73), and with lymphoid malignancy was 69 years (61-75). Of the 23 036 participants with serological data, 6583 (28 6%) had received three vaccine doses, 14 234 (61 8%) had received four vaccine doses, and 2219 (9 6%) had received five or more vaccine doses. IgG anti-spike antibodies were undetectable in 2310 (23 3%) of 9927 patients with solid organ transplants, 922 (14 1%) of 6516 patients with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and 1366 (20 7%) of 6593 patients with lymphoid malignancies. In all groups, seropositivity was associated with younger age, higher number of vaccine doses (ie, five vs three), and previous COVID-19. Immunosuppressive medication reduced the likelihood of seropositivity: the lowest odds of seropositivity were found in recipients of solid organ transplants receiving a combination of an anti-proliferative agent, a calcineurin inhibitor, and steroids, and those with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases or lymphoid malignancies treated with anti-CD20 therapies. INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in five recipients of solid organ transplants, individuals with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and individuals with lymphoid malignancies have no detectable IgG anti-spike antibodies despite three or more vaccine doses, but this proportion decreases with sequential booster doses. Choice of immunosuppressant and disease type is strongly associated with serological response. Antibody testing using lateral flow immunoassay tests could enable rapid identification of individuals who are most likely to benefit from additional COVID-19 interventions.

38168683	Polymyxin B and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid act synergistically against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Polymyxin B and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid are antimicrobials possessing antibiofilm activity. They act by displacement and chelation, respectively, of divalent cations in bacterial membranes and may therefore act synergistically when applied in combination. If so, this combination of agents may be useful for the treatment of diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), in which biofilms are present on the respiratory epithelium. We used checkerboard assays to investigate the synergy between these agents using reference strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 in planktonic form. We then determined the efficacy of each agent against biofilms of both species grown on 96-pin lids and proceeded to combination testing against the P. aeruginosa reference strain and 10 clinical isolates from patients with CF. Synergism was observed for planktonic forms of both species and for biofilms of P. aeruginosa. The susceptibility of biofilms of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates to these agents was variable compared to the laboratory reference strain. This combination of agents may be useful in the management of biofilm-associated conditions, particularly those amenable to topical therapies. These results provide a basis upon which the antimicrobial and antibiofilm efficacy of preparations containing these agents may be enhanced.IMPORTANCEBacteria living in biofilms produce a protective matrix which makes them difficult to kill. Patients with severe respiratory disease often have biofilms. Polymyxin B is an antibiotic commonly used in topical medications, such as eye drops and nasal sprays. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used widely as a preservative in medication but also has antimicrobial properties. It has been hypothesized that Polymyxin B and EDTA could have a synergistic relationship: when used in combination their antimicrobial effect is enhanced. Here, we evaluated the levels at which Polymyxin B and EDTA work together to kill common pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. We found that Polymyxin B and EDTA were synergistic. This synergy may be useful in the management of planktonic infection with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, or biofilm infection with P. aeruginosa. This synergy may be beneficial in the treatment of respiratory biofilms, in which P. aeruginosa biofilms are common.
38109903	Impact of Reanalysis of Nitrogen Multiple-Breath Washout on its Relationship with Chest Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings in Clinically Stable and Pulmonary Exacerbated Children with Cystic Fibrosis. RATIONALE: Multiple-breath washout (MBW)-derived lung clearance index (LCI) detects lung disease in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Correction of a cross-talk error in the software of the MBW device Exhalyzer D in a new software version has generated significant interest regarding its impact on previous MBW findings. Since LCI and chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlated before in CF children, this study aims to reassess previous MBW data after correction. PATIENTS/METHODS: Reanalysis of the main findings from a previously published study comparing MBW and MRI in a pediatric CF cohort by reassessment of nitrogen (N2) MBW of 61 stable children with CF, 75 age-matched healthy controls (HC), and 15 CF children with pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) in the corrected software version. RESULTS: The corrected LCI (N2LCIcor) decreased in the entire cohort (-17.0 (11.2)%), HC (-8.5 (8.2)%), stable CF children (-22.2 (11.1)%), and within the PEx group at baseline, at PEx and after antibiotic therapy (-21.5 (7.3)%; -22.5 (6.1)%; -21.4 (6.6)%; all P<0.01). N2LCIcor and N2LCIpre correlated with chest MRI scores in stable CF (r=0.70 to 0.84; all P<0.01) without a significant difference between N2LCIcor and N2LCIpre. Change in LCI from baseline to PEx and from PEx to after therapy decreased from N2LCIpre to N2LCIcor, but these changes remained significant (all P=0.001). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that N2LCIcor is significantly lower than N2LCIpre, but key results published in the original study demonstrating N2MBW and MRI as complementary methods for clinical surveillance in children with CF remain unaffected.
38206973	Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Pulmonary and Paranasal Sinus Abnormalities in Children with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Compared to Children with Cystic Fibrosis. Rationale: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are characterized by inherited impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic progressive lung disease as well as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The diseases share morphological and functional commonalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lungs and paranasal sinuses, but comparative MRI studies are lacking. Objectives: To determine whether PCD shows different associations of pulmonary and paranasal sinus abnormalities on MRI and lung function test results in children (infants to adolescents) compared with children with CF. Methods: Eighteen children with PCD (median age, 9.5 [IQR, 3.4-12.7] yr; range, 0-18 yr) and 36 age-matched CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator-naive children with CF (median age, 9.4 [3.4-13.2] yr; range, 0-18 yr) underwent same-session chest and paranasal sinus MRI as well as spirometry (to determine forced expiratory volume in 1 s percent predicted) and multiple-breath washout (to determine lung clearance index z-score). Pulmonary and paranasal sinus abnormalities were assessed using previously validated chest MRI and CRS-MRI scoring systems. Results: Mean chest MRI global score was similar in children with PCD and CF (15.0 [13.5-20.8] vs. 15.0 [9.0-15.0]; P = 0.601). Consolidations were more prevalent and severe in children with PCD (56% vs. 25% and 1.0 [0.0-2.8] vs. 0.0 [0.0-0.3], respectively; P < 0.05). The chest MRI global score correlated moderately with forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted in children with PCD and children with CF (r = -0.523 and -0.687; P < 0.01) and with lung clearance index in children with CF (r = 0.650; P < 0.001) but not in PCD (r = 0.353; P = 0.196). CRS-MRI sum score and mucopyocele subscore were lower in children with PCD than in children with CF (27.5 [26.3-32.0] vs. 37.0 [37.8-40.0] and 2.0 [0.0-2.0] vs. 7.5 [4.8-9.0], respectively; P < 0.01). CRS-MRI sum score did not correlate with chest MRI score in PCD (r = 0.075-0.157; P = 0.557-0.788) but correlated moderately with MRI morphology score in CF (r = 0.437; P < 0.01). Conclusions: MRI detects differences in lung and paranasal sinus abnormalities between children with PCD and those with CF. Lung disease does not correlate with CRS in PCD but correlates in CF.
38336730	Antimicrobial resistance survey and whole-genome analysis of nosocomial P. Aeruginosa isolated from eastern Province of China in 2016-2021. BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major Gram-negative pathogen that can exacerbate lung infections in the patients with cystic fibrosis, which can ultimately lead to death. METHODS: From 2016 to 2021, 103 strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from hospitals and 20 antibiotics were used for antimicrobial susceptibility determination. Using next-generation genome sequencing technology, these strains were sequenced and analyzed in terms of serotypes, ST types, and resistance genes for epidemiological investigation. RESULTS: The age distribution of patients ranged from 10 days to 94 years with a median age of 69 years old. The strains were mainly isolated from sputum (72 strains, 69.9%) and blood (14 strains, 13.6%). The size of these genomes ranged from 6.2 Mb to 7.4 Mb, with a mean value of 6.5 Mb. In addition to eight antibiotics that show inherent resistance to P. aeruginosa, the sensitivity rates for colistin, amikacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, aztreonam, imipenem, cefepime and levofloxacin were 100%, 95.15%, 86.41%, 72.82%, 71.84%, 69.90%, 55.34%, 52.43%, 50.49%, 50.49%, 49.51% and 47.57% respectively, and the carriage rate of MDR strains was 30.69% (31/101). Whole-genome analysis showed that a total of 50 ST types were identified, with ST244 (5/103) and ST1076 (4/103) having a more pronounced distribution advantage. Serotype predictions showed that O6 accounted for 29.13% (30/103), O11 for 23.30% (24/103), O2 for 18.45% (19/103), and O1 for 11.65% (12/103) of the highest proportions. Notably, we found a significantly higher proportion of ExoU in P. aeruginosa strains of serotype O11 than in other cytotoxic exoenzyme positive strains. In addition to this, a total of 47 crpP genes that mediate resistance to fluoroquinolones antibiotics were found distributed on 43 P. aeruginosa strains, and 10 new variants of CrpP were identified, named 1.33, 1.34, 1.35, 1.36, 1.37, 1.38, 1.39, 1.40, 1.41 and 7.1. CONCLUSIONS: We investigated the antibiotic susceptibility of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and genomically enriched the diversity of P. aeruginosa for its prophylactic and therapeutic value.
38286409	Necessity of Tobramycin trough Levels in Once Daily Iv-Treatment in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis. BACKGROUND: Once daily intravenous (iv) treatment with tobramycin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is frequently monitored by measuring tobramycin trough levels (TLs). Although the necessity of these TLs is recently questioned in pwCF without renal impairment, no study has evaluated this so far. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the frequency of increased tobramycin TLs in pwCF treated with a once daily tobramycin dosing protocol. METHODS: Patient records of all consecutive once daily iv tobramycin courses in 35 pwCF between 07/2009 and 07/2019 were analyzed for tobramycin level, renal function, co-medication and comorbidity. RESULTS: Eight elevated TLs (2.9% of 278 courses) were recorded in four patients, two with normal renal function. One of these resolved without adjustment of tobramycin dosages suggesting a test timing or laboratory error. In the other patient the elevated tobramycin level decreased after tobramycin dosage adjustment. Six of the elevated levels occurred in two patients with chronic renal failure. In 15 other patients with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (36 courses) but normal range creatinine no case of elevated tobramycin trough levels was detected. Neither cumulative tobramycin dosages nor concomitant diabetes or nutritional status were risk factors for elevated TLs. CONCLUSION: Our data show that elevated tobramycin TLs are rare but cannot be excluded, so determination of tobramycin TLs is still recommended for safety.
38169359	[Cystic fibrosis carrier screening: a Health technology assessment.] This project of Health technology assessment was aimed at defining the impacts of offering a cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening to the general population, compared to the current situation, where the test is offered to individuals at high-risk to give birth to a child with CF. Results revealed: i) a lack of robust and updated data; ii) a return on investment up to six years from the screening's introduction, despite important economic and organizational efforts; iii) a general positive attitude of healthcare professionals, people with CF, families and general population; iv) possible issues related to the social impact.
38400672	Peri-operative and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation in patients with cystic fibrosis. INTRODUCTION: There is a lack of data regarding the peri-operative and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Herein, we report the peri-operative and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation in CF patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All CF patients who received a kidney transplant at the national kidney transplant center between 1993 and 2022 were identified. Recipients of the contralateral donor kidney were selected as a control group. Primary outcomes included 1-, 5-, and 10- year death-censored graft survival and overall survival. Secondary outcomes included peri-operative morbidity, acute graft rejection, delayed graft function (DGF), and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Fourteen patients received a kidney transplant over the study period. Median age at transplantation was 35 (IQR 31, 40) years. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year death-censored graft survival was 92, 74, and 74% in the CF group compared to 100, 92, and 92% in the control group (p = .44). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival in the CF group was 85, 66, and 57% compared to 100, 92, and 82% in the control group (p = .036). There was no significant difference in peri-operative outcomes including LOS (10 vs. 11 days, p = .84), ICU admission (1 vs. 0 patients, p > .99), acute rejection episodes (2 vs. 1 patients, p > .99), and DGF (1 vs. 2 patients, p = .60). CONCLUSION: CF patients have good long-term graft survival, however, overall survival was worse compared to a matched cohort. These data provide important information for transplant surgeons when considering suitable donor allografts in this unique patient population.
38411018	A prospective study to assess the impact of a novel CFTR therapy combination on body composition in patients with cystic fibrosis with F508del mutation. BACKGROUND & AIM: Malnutrition is a prevalent condition in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and can result in worsening of pulmonary function and other comorbidities. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies are improving the CF-related care and outcomes. Body Mass Index (BMI) is the most commonly used parameter to assess nutritional status, albeit it is a very unspecific indicator. Hence, current guidelines recommend body composition analysis as a part of nutritional assessment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) treatment on body composition and respiratory function. METHODS: We recruited patients with CF from University Hospital La Princesa, with follow-up in the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit. All patients were eligible to initiate ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy. Body composition was assessed with a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and spirometry data were obtained before and after 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Our study sample was composed of 36 patients with CF. We observed a significant increase in BMI after 6 months of treatment (p < 0.001), as well as an increase in fat mass (p = 0.008) and visceral fat area (p = 0.026). The other body composition parameters did not yield significant changes. Overall, %FEV1 increased from 72.67 % (+-17.39) to 84.74 % (+-18.18) after 6 months of treatment. Interestingly, we found an inverse correlation between %FEV1 and fat mass (r = -0,476; p = 0,0058), %FEV1 and age (r = -0,411; p = 0,0196) and between %FEV1 and visceral fat area (r = -0,515; p = 0,0025). On the contrary, we found a direct correlation between %FEV1 and body cell mass (r = 0,367; p = 0,038). CONCLUSIONS: Novel CFTR modulators are emerging for the treatment of CF. Specifically, triple combination with ELX/TEZ/IVA has shown to effectively improve both pulmonary and nutritional status in patients with CF with F508del mutation. Body composition should be a part of the routine assessment for patients with CF.
38059634	Population pharmacokinetics and target attainment analysis of vancomycin after intermittent dosing in adults with cystic fibrosis. Vancomycin is the first-line agent to treat pulmonary infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). However, there is no consensus on vancomycin initial dosing in this population among health institutions, and there is a large variability in initial dosing across the United States. In this study, we characterized the pharmacokinetics (PK) of vancomycin in PwCF using a population PK approach. The clinical PK data to develop the population PK model were obtained from vancomycin therapeutic monitoring data from PwCF undergoing treatment for infections due to MRSA. The population PK model was then used to perform comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the probability of target attainment (PTA) of 12 different initial dosing scenarios. The area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio >=400 mg*h/L and <650 mg*h/L were used as efficacy and toxicity targets for PTA analysis. A total of 181 vancomycin plasma concentrations were included in the analysis. A one-compartment model with first-order elimination best described the data. Weight significantly influenced the vancomycin PK (P < 0.05). In the final model, clearance was estimated as 5.52 L/h/70 kg, and the volume of distribution was 31.5 L/70 kg. The PTA analysis showed that at MIC = 1 microg/mL, doses 1,500 q8h and 2,000 q12h showed the highest %PTA in achieving both efficacy and toxicity targets. The PTA results from this study may potentially inform the initial dosing regimens of vancomycin to treat pulmonary infections due to MRSA in PwCF.
38266939	Inhaled dry powder liposomal azithromycin for treatment of chronic lower respiratory tract infection. A dry powder inhaled liposomal azithromycin formulation was developed for the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Key properties including liposome size, charge and encapsulation efficiency powder size, shape, glass transition temperature (Tg), water content and in vitro respiratory deposition were determined. Antimicrobial activity against cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory pathogens was determined by MIC, MBC and biofilm assays. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies were performed using A549 cells. The average liposome size was 105 nm, charge was 55 mV and encapsulation efficiency was 75 %. The mean powder particle size d[v,50] of 4.54 microm and Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) was 5.23 microm with a mean Tg of 76 C and water content of 2.1 %. These excellent physicochemical characteristics were maintained over one year. Liposomal loaded azithromycin demonstrated enhanced activity against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates grown in biofilm. The formulation was rapidly delivered into bacterial cells with > 75 % uptake in 1 h. Rapid uptake into A549 cells via a cholesterol-dependent endocytosis pathway with no cytotoxic effects apparent. These data demonstrate that this formulation could offer benefits over current treatment regimens for people with chronic respiratory infection.
38236037	Time-dependent pharmacodynamics of amikacin on Mycobacterium abscessus growth and resistance emergence. Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary disease is increasing in prevalence globally, particularly for individuals with cystic fibrosis. These infections are challenging to treat due to a high rate of resistance. Amikacin is critical to treatment, but the development of toxicity, amikacin resistance, and treatment failure are significant challenges. Amikacin has been characterized previously as peak-dependent and extended-interval dosing is commonly used. In our hollow fiber infection model of M. abscessus, amikacin exhibited time-dependent rather than the expected peak-dependent pharmacodynamics. Humanized amikacin exposures with more frequent, short-interval dosing (continuous infusion or every 12 hours) yielded improved microbiological response compared to extended-interval dosing (every 24 hours or 1-3 times per week). Short-interval dosing inhibited growth with a mean (SD) maximum Deltalog10 colony forming units of -4.06 (0.52), significantly more than extended-interval dosing (P = 0.0013) every 24 hours, -2.40 (0.58), or 1-3 times per week, -2.39 (0.38). Growth recovery, an indicator of resistance emergence, occurred at 6.56 (0.70) days with short-interval dosing but was significantly earlier with extended-interval dosing (P = 0.0032) every 24 hours, 3.88 (0.85) days, and 1-3 times per week, 3.27 (1.72) days. Microbiological response correlated best with the pharmacodynamic index of %T > minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), with an EC80 for growth inhibition of ~40%T > MIC. We used a previously published population model of amikacin to determine the probability of achieving 40%T > MIC and show that current dosing strategies are far below this target, which may partially explain why treatment failure remains so high for these infections. These data support a cautious approach to infrequent amikacin dosing for the treatment of M. abscessus.IMPORTANCEPulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is increasing worldwide, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis. MABSC is challenging to treat due to high levels of antibiotic resistance. Treatment requires 2-4 antibiotics over more than 12 months and has a significant risk of toxicity but still fails to eradicate infection in over 50% of patients with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotic dosing strategies have been largely informed by common bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The "pharmacodynamic" effects of amikacin, a backbone of MABSC treatment, were thought to be related to maximum "peak" drug concentration, leading to daily or three times weekly dosing. However, we found that amikacin MABSC kill and growth recovery, an indicator of antibiotic resistance, are dependent on how long amikacin concentrations are above the minimum inhibitory concentration, not how high the peak concentration is. Therefore, we recommend a re-evaluation of amikacin dosing to determine if increased frequency can improve efficacy.
38135160	Nanoparticle-based platforms for targeted drug delivery to the pulmonary system as therapeutics to curb cystic fibrosis: A review. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder of the respiratory system caused by mutation of the Cystic Fibrosis Trans-Membrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene that affects a huge number of people worldwide. It results in difficulty breathing due to a large accumulation of mucus in the respiratory tract, resulting in serious bacterial infections, and subsequent death. Traditional drug-based treatments face hindered penetration at the site of action due to the thick mucus layer. Nanotechnology offers possibilities for developing advanced and effective treatment platforms by focusing on drugs that can penetrate the dense mucus layer, fighting against the underlying bacterial infections, and targeting the genetic cause of the disease. In this review, current nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery platforms for CF, challenges in therapeutics, and future prospects have been highlighted. The effectiveness of the different types of nano-based systems conjugated with various drugs to combat the symptoms and the challenges of treating CF are brought into focus. The toxic effects of these nano-medicines and the various factors that are responsible for their effectiveness are also highlighted.
38054992	Risk of CFTR-related disorders and cystic fibrosis in an Italian cohort of CRMS/CFSPID subjects in preschool and school age. The identification of cystic fibrosis screening-positive, inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID) in infants is a controversial outcome of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF). Today, despite improvements in the knowledge of CFSPID and the description of several cohorts, little data are available on cohorts with a follow-up period of more than 6 years. In this study, we report the outcomes of an Italian cohort of CFSPID individuals with CFSPID or formerly CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RD) (CFSPID > CFTR-RD) or diagnosed with CF (CFSPID > CF). This was an observational and multicentre Italian study collecting clinical data on CFSPID born between the period January 1, 2011, and December 13, 2019. A total of 268 participants were included: 243 with persistent CFSPID, 7 with CFSPID > CFTR-RD, and 18 with CFSPID > CF. The trend of sweat chloride (SC) values, percentage of definitive diagnoses, lung function in school-aged children, and development of CF-related complications were evaluated. At the end of the observation period, almost 80% of the individuals with CFSPID did not have a conclusive diagnosis. A total of 29 children (10.8%) transitioned to a diagnosis of CF for pathological SC values (>= 60 mmol/L) or multi-organ involvement, and 18 (6.7%) to CFTR-RD. Children who were followed up for > 6 years (median age, 7.5 years; range, 6.04-10.5) had normal lung function and were pancreatic sufficient, and the evolution in CF was only present in two cases. CONCLUSION: Most Italian preschool and school-aged children with CFSPID did not have a conclusive diagnosis, and progression to CF was unlikely in children > 6 years of age. An annual follow-up could be indicated to identify early evolution in clinical features consistent with a CFTR-RD. WHAT IS KNOWN:   Cystic Fibrosis newborn screening identifies also subjects with an inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID).   Over time a variable percentage of CFSPIDs will be diagnosed as CF.   Little data is available on CFSPIDs with a follow-up period of more than six years. WHAT IS NEW:   80% of Italian preschool and school-age CFSPIDs not have a conclusive diagnosis.   Italian preschool and school-age CFSPIDs have normal lung function and are pancreatic sufficient.   Annual follow-up after 6 years is recommended in CFSPID with abnormal LCI2.5 or with a CF-causing variant in trans with a VVCC.
38057039	Effect of 18 months elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on body mass index and glycemic control in adults with cystic fibrosis. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition and cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) are common comorbidities in cystic fibrosis (CF). Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulators have shown beneficial effects on respiratory status. This study aims to determine the effect of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) on body mass index (BMI) and glycemic control. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study of a cohort of 17 adult CF patients was conducted at the CF reference center of Ghent University Hospital. BMI evolution was analyzed 18 months before and 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after the start of ETI. The evolution of insulin dependence and the 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results were described until 36 months after start of ETI, in a small subgroup of ten patients with CFRD or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). RESULTS: A significant increase in mean BMI of 1.2 kg/m2 (+-1.3 SD) was observed. Most weight gain was observed in the first 3 months after starting treatment. This effect was sustained during the observed period of 18 months. Six patients had insulin dependent CFRD, of which three were able to stop insulin after starting ETI. Two patients with CFRD treated with dietary measures showed an initial normalization of the 2 h OGTT, but deterioration at 36 month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: After initiation of ETI an increase in BMI was observed in adults with CF. ETI can have a beneficial impact on glucose metabolism in patients with CFRD, leading to a possible need for reduction or cessation of insulin therapy.
38431897	[Experience with COVID-19 infection and immunization in a group of adult patients with cystic fibrosis]. 
38132670	Phenotypes of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa hypermutator lineage that emerged during prolonged mechanical ventilation in a patient without cystic fibrosis. Hypermutator lineages of Pseudomonas aeruginosa arise frequently during the years of airway infection experienced by patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis but are rare in the absence of chronic infection and structural lung disease. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of patients have remained mechanically ventilated for extended periods of time. These patients are prone to acquire bacterial pathogens that persist for many weeks and have the opportunity to evolve within the pulmonary environment. However, little is known about what types of adaptations occur in these bacteria and whether these adaptations mimic those observed in chronic infections. We describe a COVID-19 patient with a secondary P. aeruginosa lung infection in whom the causative bacterium persisted for >50 days. Over the course of this infection, a hypermutator lineage of P. aeruginosa emerged and co-existed with a non-hypermutator lineage. Compared to the parental lineage, the hypermutator lineage evolved to be less cytotoxic and less virulent. Genomic analyses of the hypermutator lineage identified numerous mutations, including in the mismatch repair gene mutL and other genes frequently mutated in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Together, these findings demonstrate that hypermutator lineages can emerge when P. aeruginosa persists following acute infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and that these lineages have the potential to affect patient outcomes.IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa may evolve to accumulate large numbers of mutations in the context of chronic infections such as those that occur in individuals with cystic fibrosis. However, these "hypermutator" lineages are rare following acute infections. Here, we describe a non-cystic fibrosis patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who remained mechanically ventilated for months. The patient became infected with a strain of P. aeruginosa that evolved to become a hypermutator. We demonstrate that hypermutation led to changes in cytotoxicity and virulence. These findings are important because they demonstrate that P. aeruginosa hypermutators can emerge following acute infections and that they have the potential to affect patient outcomes in this setting.
38441982	In vitro activity of human defensins HNP-1 and hBD-3 against multidrug-resistant ESKAPE Gram-negatives of clinical origin and selected peptidoglycan recycling-defective mutants. The use of immune compounds as antimicrobial adjuvants is a classic idea recovering timeliness in the current antibiotic resistance scenario. However, the activity of certain antimicrobial peptides against ESKAPE Gram-negatives has not been sufficiently investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the activities of human defensins HNP-1 and hBD-3 alone or combined with permeabilizing/peptidoglycan-targeting agents against clinical ESKAPE Gram-negatives [Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Enterobacter cloacae (EC), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and acute/chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)]. Lethal concentrations (LCs) of HNP-1 and hBD-3 were determined in four collections of multidrug resistant EC, AB, KP, and PA clinical strains (10-36 isolates depending on the collection). These defensins act through membrane permeabilization plus peptidoglycan building blockade, enabling that alterations in peptidoglycan recycling may increase their activity, which is why different recycling-defective mutants were also included. Combinations with physiological lysozyme and subinhibitory colistin for bactericidal activities determination, and with meropenem for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were also assessed. HNP-1 showed undetectable activity (LC > 32 mg/L for all strains). hBD-3 showed appreciable activities: LC ranges 2-16, 8-8, 8->32, and 8->32 mg/L for AB, EC, KP, and PA, being PA strains from cystic fibrosis significantly more resistant than acute origin ones. None of the peptidoglycan recycling-defective mutants showed greater susceptibility to HNP-1/hBD-3. Combination with colistin or lysozyme did not change their bactericidal power, and virtually neither did meropenem + hBD-3 compared to meropenem MICs. This is the first study comparatively analyzing the HNP-1/hBD-3 activities against the ESKAPE Gram-negatives, and demonstrates interesting bactericidal capacities of hBD-3 mostly against AB and EC. IMPORTANCE: In the current scenario of critical need for new antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant bacteria, all options must be considered, including classic ideas such as the use of purified immune compounds. However, information regarding the activity of certain human defensins against ESKAPE Gram-negatives was incomplete. This is the first study comparatively assessing the in vitro activity of two membrane-permeabilizing/peptidoglycan construction-blocking defensins (HNP-1 and hBD-3) against relevant clinical collections of ESKAPE Gram-negatives, alone or in combination with permeabilizers, additional peptidoglycan-targeting attacks, or the blockade of its recycling. Our data suggest that hBD-3 has a notable bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae strains that should be considered as potential adjuvant option. Our results suggest for the first time an increased resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from chronic infection compared to acute origin ones, and provide new clues about the predominant mode of action of hBD-3 against Gram-negatives (permeabilization rather than peptidoglycan-targeting).
38275615	Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency: A Genetic Screening in Sicilian Patients with Neurological Disorders. Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADCd) is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder caused by AADC deficiency, an enzyme encoded by the DDC gene. Since the enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of serotonin and dopamine, its deficiency determines the lack of these neurotransmitters, but also of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Onset is early and the key signs are hypotonia, movement disorders (oculogyric crises, dystonia and hypokinesia), developmental delay and autonomic dysfunction. Taiwan is the site of a potential founder variant (IVS6+4A>T) with a predicted incidence of 1/32,000 births, while only 261 patients with this deficit have been described worldwide. Actually, the number of affected persons could be greater, given that the spectrum of clinical manifestations is broad and still little known. In our study we selected 350 unrelated patients presenting with different neurological disorders including heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders, cognitive deficit, behavioral disorders and autism spectrum disorder, for which the underlying etiology had not yet been identified. Molecular investigation of the DDC gene was carried out with the aim of identifying affected patients and/or carriers. Our study shows a high frequency of carriers (2.57%) in Sicilian subjects with neurological deficits, with a higher concentration in northern and eastern Sicily. Assuming these data as representative of the general Sicilian population, the risk may be comparable to some rare diseases included in the newborn screening programs such as spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria.
38179878	Impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor on lipid and fat-soluble vitamin levels and association with body mass index. INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators improve gastrointestinal absorption of nutrients and may result in changes in body mass index (BMI), serum lipids, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. We hypothesized that serum lipids and vitamin levels would increase with CFTR modulator therapy and that greater increase in lipids and vitamin levels would be related to greater increase in BMI. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the impact of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on nutritional parameters, serum lipids, and fat-soluble vitamin levels. Pre-ETI values (<2 years prior) and post-ETI values (>1 month after) were compared. Linear regression was used to evaluate whether change in BMI is associated with the change in lipid and/or vitamin levels and whether modulator duration is associated with the degree of rise in lipid and/or vitamin levels. RESULTS: Adults and adolescents with CF (n = 137) were evaluated before and 31-300 days after starting ETI. Median BMI (adults 21.9 vs. 23.5 kg/m2 ; adolescents 48 vs. 63 percentile) increased after initiation of ETI. Total cholesterol (126 vs. 154 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (63 vs. 78 mg/dL), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (84 vs. 102 mg/dL), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (43 vs. 49 mg/dL) increased after ETI, while triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein did not change. Median values for vitamin D (34.5 vs. 38.0 ng/mL) and vitamin A (40.1 vs. 47.9 microg/dL) increased, while vitamin E did not change significantly. There was no significant correlation between BMI change or duration of modulator therapy with vitamin levels or lipid changes. CONCLUSION: After initiation of ETI therapy, serum lipids increased in our population, but most values remained within the normal range. Vitamins A and D levels increased post-ETI and no changes were noted in vitamin E. No significant correlation between the degree of BMI change and the magnitude of increase in lipids or vitamin levels was found.
38128948	Self-reported engagement in everyday activities following bilateral lung transplantation in paediatric cystic fibrosis: a single centre study. INTRODUCTION: Following lung transplantation, it is unknown how children/adolescents self-assess their performance in everyday activities, importance of these activities, and whether resumption of everyday activities influences self-reported quality of life. The aim was to examine the effect of bilateral lung transplantation on children's/adolescent's perception of engagement in everyday activities over the first 18 months post-transplant. METHODS: A multiple-single-case-study pre-post test design was conducted at a National Paediatric Lung Transplant Service. Participants were aged under 18 years and were 3 months post first bilateral lung transplant at the time of recruitment. Outcomes were self-reported quality of life (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Transplant Module and engagement in meaningful life roles (Child Occupational Self-Assessment (COSA) Scale) measured at 3 months and 18 months post-transplant from participants, and their parent(s) (PedsQL). Analysis included paired between-time differences and descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Seven participants were recruited to the trial with a mean age of 13 (SD 4) years and a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The total mean scores on PedsQL remained stable between 3 months and 18 months for both participants and parents. The PedsQL transplant module total mean scores of participants significantly increased from 3 months (M=66.58, SD=11.83) to 18 months (M=80.25, SD=11.56), t(5) = 2.91, p=0.03 whereas parents' scores remained stable. COSA responses reported 'big problems' with self-care tasks, family engagement and coping with worries at 3 months. At 18 months, the 'big problem' activities shifted to community engagement and independence. CONCLUSION: Time influences self-reported quality of life and engagement in meaningful life roles for children/adolescents and their parents 3 months to 18 months post-lung transplant. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing on occupational roles and occupational performance of children and adolescents when designing post-transplant interventions, suggesting a key role for occupational therapy after transplantation.
38309533	Novel time-saving OGTT sparing HbA1c-HOMA2 based algorithm for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. AIMS: The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) faces several challenges. We propose a novel screening algorithm to alleviate the burden of cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Through a retrospective cross-sectional single-centre study, HbA1c and HOMA2 indices were assessed in multiple models as alternative diagnostic tools from OGTT data. We sought to establish specific thresholds for CFRD screening with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as gold standard. We evaluated various straightforward or sequential approaches, in terms of diagnostic accuracy while also quantify the potential reduction in OGTTs through these different methods. RESULTS: HOMA indices were recovered in 72 patients. We devised a composite index that combines HbA1c and HOMA-B: Diabetes Predicting Index in cystic fibrosis (DIPIc) = (HbA1c(%) x 3.455) - (HOMA-B(%) x  0.020) - 19.294. This index yields the highest screening accuracy according to receiver-operating characteristics curves. Using a stepwise algorithm that incorporates DIPIc decreases the requirement for annual OGTTs. A CFRD exclusion cutoff less than -1.7445 (sensitivity 98 %), in conjunction with a CFRD diagnostic threshold greater than 0.4543 (specificity 98 %) allows for 71 % OGTT sparing. CONCLUSION: The composite index DIPIc is a suitable, less invasive screening method for CFRD, which enables to avoid many OGTTs.
38114870	An overview of CFTR mutation profiles and assisted reproductive technology outcomes in Chinese patients with congenital obstructive azoospermia. PURPOSE: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common causative gene attributed to congenital obstructive azoospermia (OA). The aim of this study was to conduct an epidemiological survey of congenital OA patients, to screen for CFTR mutations, and to follow their pregnancy outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART). METHODS: This cohort study enrolled congenital OA patients undergoing ART and whole-exome sequencing from January 2018 to September 2023. Semen parameters, sex hormones, and seminal plasma biochemistry were evaluated. CFTR mutations identified in OA patients were analyzed. In addition, the laboratory outcomes, clinical outcomes, and neonatal outcomes were compared between OA patients carrying two CFTR mutations and the others after surgical sperm extraction-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients with congenital OA were enrolled. CFTR mutations were identified in 35 (46.1%) congenital OA patients. A total of 60 CFTR mutation sites of 27 types were identified, and 10 of them were novel. The average frequency was 1.71 (60/35) per person. The most common mutation was c.1210-11T > G (25%, 15/60). After ICSI treatment, there were no statistically significant differences in laboratory outcomes, clinical outcomes, and neonatal outcomes between OA patients carrying two CFTR mutations (n = 25) and other OA patients (n = 51). CONCLUSION: Apart from the IVS9-5T mutation, the genetic mutation pattern of CFTR in Chinese OA patients is heterogeneous, which is significantly different from that of Caucasians. Although carrying two CFTR mutations or not had no effect on the pregnancy outcomes in OA patients after ICSI, genetic counseling is still recommended for such patients.
38233941	Lung clearance index short-term variability in cystic fibrosis: a pre-post pulmonary exacerbation study. BACKGROUND: Multiple Breath washout (MBW) represents an important tool to detect early a possible pulmonary exacerbation especially in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) disease. Lung clearance index (LCI) is the most commonly reported multiple breath washout (MBW) index and in the last years was used as management measure for evaluation. Our aim was to analyze clinical utility of LCI index variability in pulmonary exacerbation in CF after intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. METHODS: A single-center study was conducted at CF Unit of Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital among hospitalized > 3 years patients for pulmonary exacerbations and treated with antibiotic IV treatment for 14 days. MBW and spirometry were evaluated within 72 h of admission to hospital and at the end of hospitalization. Descriptive analysis was conducted and correlations between quantitative variables were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (M22/F35) with an average age 18.56 (+- 8.54) years were enrolled. LCI2.5 was significantly reduced at the end of antibiotic treatment in both pediatric and adult populations with an average reduction of -6,99%; 37/57 patients denoted an improvement, 20/57 are stable or worsened in LCI2.5 values and 4/57 (7.02%) had a significant deterioration (> 15%) at end of treatment. On the contrary a significative elevation of FEV1 and FVC were found, respectively of + 7,30% and of + 5,46%. A positive good correlection among LCI 2.5 and Scond (rho = + 0,615, p = 0.000) and LCI 2.5 and Sacin (rho = + 0,649, p = 0.000) and a negative strong correlation between FEV1 and LCI 2.5 were found in post treatment period. A similar modification of LCI 2.5 and FEV1 was noticed in both adult and pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: LCI may have a role in the routine clinical care of both adult and pediatric CF patients as a good tool to assess response to IV antibiotic end-therapy in the same way as FEV1.
38458782	Using reference equations to standardise incremental shuttle walk test performance in children and young people with chronic conditions and facilitate the evaluation of exercise capacity and disease severity. AIMS: The aim was to evaluate whether standardised exercise performance during the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) can be used to assess disease severity in children and young people (CYP) with chronic conditions, through (1) identifying the most appropriate paediatric normative reference equation for the ISWT, (2) assessing how well CYP with haemophilia and cystic fibrosis (CF) perform against the values predicted by the best fit reference equation and (3) evaluating the association between standardised ISWT performance and disease severity. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out using existing data from two independent studies (2018-2019) at paediatric hospitals in London,UK. CYP with haemophilia (n=35) and CF (n=134) aged 5-18 years were included. Published reference equations for standardising ISWT were evaluated through a comparison of populations, and Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the level of agreement between distances predicted by each equation. Associations between ISWT and disease severity were assessed with linear regression. RESULTS: Three relevant reference equations were identified for the ISWT that standardised performance based on age, sex and body mass index (Vardhan, Lanza, Pinho). A systematic proportional bias of standardised ISWT was observed in all equations, most pronounced with Vardhan and Lanza; the male Pinho equation was identified as most appropriate. On average, CYP with CF and haemophilia performed worse than predicted by the Pihno equation, although the range was wide. Standardised ISWT, and not ISWT distance alone, was significantly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s in CYP with CF. Standardised ISWT in CYP with haemophilia was slightly associated with haemophilia joint health score, but this was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: ISWT performance may be useful in a clinic to identify those with worsening disease, but only when performance is standardised against a healthy reference population. The development of validated global reference equations is necessary for more robust assessment.
38426830	Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing for Prognostication in Advanced Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease and Beyond. 
38268067	Effects of a remotely supervised resistance training program on muscle strength and body composition in adults with cystic fibrosis: Randomized controlled trial. INTRODUCTION: Among the limited studies on physical exercise interventions in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), few have specifically addressed the improvement of peripheral muscle strength and body fat-free mass. The aim of this study was to examine the impacts of a remotely supervised, individualized 8-week resistance training program of moderate to high intensity on strength and body composition in these subjects. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial performed in adults with CF. The exercise group (EX) performed three 1-h resistance training sessions per week over 8 weeks. The control group (CON) followed the physical activity recommendations of their physician. The main outcomes were muscle strength and body composition, with secondary measures including pulmonary function and quality of life. Two-way repeated measures analysis was used. RESULTS: In 23 participants (age 32.13 +- 7.72 years), the intervention showed a significant beneficial effect on leg press strength, with a large effect size, both in absolute (p = 0.011;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.281) and relative (p = 0.007;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.310) terms. Large intervention effects were observed on total fat mass (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.415), body adiposity index (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.436), and fat mass index (p < 0.001;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.445), all showing reduction in the EX group. In addition, significant large size effects were detected on total fat-free mass (p = 0.046;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.177), trunk fat-free mass (p = 0.039;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.188), and fat-free mass index (p = 0.048;   eta p 2  $$ { eta}_{ mathrm{p}}^2 $$   = 0.174), all favoring exercise. No significant effects were observed on pulmonary function and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week remotely supervised resistance training program, with moderate to high intensity, effectively improved lower limb muscle strength and body composition.
38346040	Ceragenin-mediated disruption of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. BACKGROUND: Microbial biofilms, as a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease and other chronic infections, remain a desirable target for antimicrobial therapy. These biopolymer-based viscoelastic structures protect pathogenic organisms from immune responses and antibiotics. Consequently, treatments directed at disrupting biofilms represent a promising strategy for combating biofilm-associated infections. In CF patients, the viscoelasticity of biofilms is determined mainly by their polymicrobial nature and species-specific traits, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa filamentous (Pf) bacteriophages. Therefore, we examined the impact of microbicidal ceragenins (CSAs) supported by mucolytic agents-DNase I and poly-aspartic acid (pASP), on the viability and viscoelasticity of mono- and bispecies biofilms formed by Pf-positive and Pf-negative P. aeruginosa strains co-cultured with Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans. METHODS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceragenins against P. aeruginosa in mono- and dual-species cultures was assessed by determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC). Inhibition of P. aeruginosa mono- and dual-species biofilms formation by ceragenins alone and in combination with DNase I or poly-aspartic acid (pASP) was estimated by the crystal violet assay. Additionally, the viability of the biofilms was measured by colony-forming unit (CFU) counting. Finally, the biofilms' viscoelastic properties characterized by shear storage (G') and loss moduli (G"), were analyzed with a rotational rheometer. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that ceragenin CSA-13 inhibits biofilm formation and increases its fluidity regardless of the Pf-profile and species composition; however, the Pf-positive biofilms are characterized by elevated viscosity and elasticity parameters. CONCLUSION: Due to its microbicidal and viscoelasticity-modifying properties, CSA-13 displays therapeutic potential in biofilm-associated infections, especially when combined with mucolytic agents.
38254935	Russian Regional Differences in Allele Frequencies of CFTR Gene Variants: Genetic Monitoring of Infertile Couples. A male factor, commonly associated with poor semen quality, is revealed in about 50% of infertile couples. CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conduction Regulator) variants are one of the common genetic causes of azoospermia-related male infertility. Notably, the spectrum and frequency of pathogenic CFTR variants vary between populations and geographical regions. In this work, we made an attempt to evaluate the allele frequency (AF) of 12 common CFTR variants in infertile Russian men and healthy individuals from different districts of Russia. Because of the limited number of population-based studies on Russian individuals, we characterized the population AFs based on data from the Registry of Russian cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In addition to the CF patient registry, we estimated the local frequencies of the same set of variants based on the results of genotyping of CF patients in local biocollections (from St. Petersburg and Yugra regions). AFs of common CFTR variants calculated based on registry and biocollection data showed good concordance with directly measured population AFs. The estimated region-specific frequencies of CFTR variants allowed us to uncover statistically significant regional differences in the frequencies of the F508del (c.1521_1523del; p.Phe508del) and CFTRdele2,3(21kb) (c.54-5940_273+10250del21kb; p.Ser18ArgfsX) variants. The data from population-based studies confirmed previous observations that F508del, CFTRdele2,3(21kb), and L138ins (c.413_415dup; p.Leu138dup)variants are the most abundant among infertile patients, and their frequencies are significantly lower in healthy individuals and should be taken into account during genetic monitoring of the reproductive health of Russian individuals.
38184455	Neurovascular complications post bronchial artery embolisation in patients with cystic fibrosis. A 7-year single centre retrospective review. Bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) is a treatment used to manage haemoptysis. We performed a 7-year review of BAE procedures for haemoptysis at our CF centre aiming to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of patients with neurovascular complications post-BAE. Our review suggests that whilst BAE is an effective method for controlling life-threatening haemoptysis, patients are at risk of developing neurovascular complications with long term residual symptoms, and therefore careful consideration should be given in offering BAE, especially to otherwise well patients with chronic small volume haemoptysis and managing teams should have a low threshold to image symptomatic patients.
38296344	Eradication treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in adults with bronchiectasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. INTRODUCTION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most commonly isolated pathogen in bronchiectasis and is associated with worse outcomes. Eradication treatment is recommended by guidelines, but the evidence base is limited. The expected success rate of eradication in clinical practice is not known. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched for studies investigating P. aeruginosa eradication treatment using antibiotics (systemic or inhaled) in patients with bronchiectasis. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients negative for P. aeruginosa at 12 months after eradication treatment. Cystic fibrosis was excluded. RESULTS: Six observational studies including 289 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis found a 12-month P. aeruginosa eradication rate of 40% (95% CI 34-45%; p<0.00001), with no significant heterogeneity (I2=0%). Combined systemic and inhaled antibiotic treatment was associated with a higher eradication rate (48%, 95% CI 41-55%) than systemic antibiotics alone (27%, 13-45%). CONCLUSION: Eradication treatment in bronchiectasis results in eradication of P. aeruginosa from sputum in ~40% of cases at 12 months. Combined systemic and inhaled antibiotics achieve higher eradication rates than systemic antibiotics alone.
38309959	[Standard technical specifications for methacholine chloride (Methacholine) bronchial challenge test (2023)]. The methacholine challenge test (MCT) is a standard evaluation method of assessing airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and its severity, and has significant clinical value in the diagnosis and treatment of bronchial asthma. A consensus working group consisting of experts from the Pulmonary Function and Clinical Respiratory Physiology Committee of the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians, the Task Force for Pulmonary Function of the Chinese Thoracic Society, and the Pulmonary Function Group of Respiratory Branch of the Chinese Geriatric Society jointly developed this consensus. Based on the "Guidelines for Pulmonary Function-Bronchial Provocation Test" published in 2014, the issues encountered in its use, and recent developments, the group has updated the Standard technical specifications of methacholine chloride (methacholine) bronchial challenge test (2023). Through an extensive collection of expert opinions, literature reviews, questionnaire surveys, and multiple rounds of online and offline discussions, the consensus addressed the eleven core issues in MCT's clinical practice, including indications, contraindications, preparation of provocative agents, test procedures and methods, quality control, safety management, interpretation of results, and reporting standards. The aim was to provide clinical pulmonary function practitioners in healthcare institutions with the tools to optimize the use of this technique to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.Summary of recommendationsQuestion 1: Who is suitable for conducting MCT? What are contraindications for performing MCT?Patients with atypical symptoms and a clinical suspicion of asthma, patients diagnosed with asthma requiring assessment of the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness, individuals with allergic rhinitis who are at risk of developing asthma, patients in need of evaluating the effectiveness of asthma treatment, individuals in occupations with high safety risks due to airway hyperresponsiveness, patients with chronic diseases prone to airway hyperresponsiveness, others requiring assessment of airway reactivity.Absolute contraindications: (1) Patients who are allergic to methacholine (MCh) or other parasympathomimetic drugs, with allergic reactions including rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face, tongue, and throat), severe dizziness, and dyspnea; (2) Patients with a history of life-threatening asthma attacks or those who have required mechanical ventilation for asthma attacks in the past three months; (3) Patients with moderate to severe impairment of baseline pulmonary function [Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) less than 60% of the predicted value or FEV1<1.0 L]; (4) Severe urticaria; (5) Other situations inappropriate for forced vital capacity (FVC) measurement, such as myocardial infarction or stroke in the past three months, poorly controlled hypertension, aortic aneurysm, recent eye surgery, or increased intracranial pressure.Relative contraindications: (1) Moderate or more severe impairment of baseline lung function (FEV1%pred<70%), but individuals with FEV1%pred>60% may still be considered for MCT with strict observation and adequate preparation; (2) Experiencing asthma acute exacerbation; (3) Poor cooperation with baseline lung function tests that do not meet quality control requirements; (4) Recent respiratory tract infection (<4 weeks); (5) Pregnant or lactating women; (6) Patients currently using cholinesterase inhibitors (for the treatment of myasthenia gravis); (7) Patients who have previously experienced airway spasm during pulmonary function tests, with a significant decrease in FEV1 even without the inhalation of provocative.Question 2: How to prepare and store the challenge solution for MCT?Before use, the drug must be reconstituted and then diluted into various concentrations for provocation. The dilution concentration and steps for MCh vary depending on the inhalation method and provocation protocol used. It is important to follow specific steps. Typically, a specified amount of diluent is added to the methacholine reagent bottle for reconstitution, and the mixture is shaken until the solution becomes clear. The diluent is usually physiological saline, but saline with phenol (0.4%) can also be used. Phenol can reduce the possibility of bacterial contamination, and its presence does not interfere with the provocation test. After reconstitution, other concentrations of MCh solution are prepared using the same diluent, following the dilution steps, and then stored separately in sterile containers. Preparers should carefully verify and label the concentration and preparation time of the solution and complete a preparation record form. The reconstituted and diluted MCh solution is ready for immediate use without the need for freezing. It can be stored for two weeks if refrigerated (2-8 C). The reconstituted solution should not be stored directly in the nebulizer reservoir to prevent crystallization from blocking the capillary opening and affecting aerosol output. The temperature of the solution can affect the production of the nebulizer and cause airway spasms in the subject upon inhaling cold droplets. Thus, refrigerated solutions should be brought to room temperature before use.Question 3: What preparation is required for subjects prior to MCT?(1) Detailed medical history inquiry and exclusion of contraindications.(2) Inquiring about factors and medications that may affect airway reactivity and assessing compliance with medication washout requirements: When the goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of asthma treatment, bronchodilators other than those used for asthma treatment do not need to be discontinued. Antihistamines and cromolyn have no effect on MCT responses, and the effects of a single dose of inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers are minimal, thus not requiring cessation before the test. For patients routinely using corticosteroids, whether to discontinue the medication depends on the objective of the test: if assisting in the diagnosis of asthma, differential diagnosis, aiding in step-down therapy for asthma, or exploring the effect of discontinuing anti-inflammatory treatment, corticosteroids should be stopped before the provocation test; if the patient is already diagnosed with asthma and the objective is to observe the level of airway reactivity under controlled medication conditions, then discontinuation is not necessary. Medications such as IgE monoclonal antibodies, IL-4Ralpha monoclonal antibodies, traditional Chinese medicine, and ethnic medicines may interfere with test results, and clinicians should decide whether to discontinue these based on the specific circumstances.(3) Explaining the test procedure and potential adverse reactions, and obtaining informed consent if necessary.Question 4: What are the methods of the MCT? And which ones are recommended in current clinical practice?Commonly used methods for MCT in clinical practice include the quantitative nebulization method (APS method), Forced Oscillalion method (Astograph method), 2-minute tidal breathing method (Cockcroft method), hand-held quantitative nebulization method (Yan method), and 5-breath method (Chai 5-breath method). The APS method allows for precise dosing of inhaled Methacholine, ensuring accurate and reliable results. The Astograph method, which uses respiratory resistance as an assessment indicator, is easy for subjects to perform and is the simplest operation. These two methods are currently the most commonly used clinical practice in China.Question 5: What are the steps involved in MCT?The MCT consists of the following four steps:(1) Baseline lung function test: After a 15-minute rest period, the subjects assumes a seated position and wear a nose clip for the measurement of pulmonary function indicators [such as FEV1 or respiratory resistance (Rrs)]. FEV1 should be measured at least three times according to spirometer quality control standards, ensuring that the best two measurements differ by less than 150 ml and recording the highest value as the baseline. Usually, if FEV1%pred is below 70%, proceeding with the challenge test is not suitable, and a bronchodilation test should be considered. However, if clinical assessment of airway reactivity is necessary and FEV1%pred is between 60% and 70%, the provocation test may still be conducted under close observation, ensuring the subject's safety. If FEV1%pred is below 60%, it is an absolute contraindication for MCT.(2) Inhalation of diluent and repeat lung function test for control values: the diluent, serving as a control for the inhaled MCh, usually does not significantly impact the subject's lung function. the higher one between baseline value and the post-dilution FEV1 is used as the reference for calculating the rate of FEV1 decline. If post-inhalation FEV1 decreases, there are usually three scenarios: (1)If FEV1 decreases by less than 10% compared to the baseline, the test can proceed, continue the test and administer the first dose of MCh. (2)If the FEV1 decreases by>=10% and<20%, indicating a heightened airway reactivity to the diluent, proceed with the lowest concentration (dose) of the provoking if FEV1%pred has not yet reached the contraindication criteria for the MCT. if FEV1%pred<60% and the risk of continuing the challenge test is considerable, it is advisable to switch to a bronchodilation test and indicate the change in the test results report. (3)If FEV1 decreases by>=20%, it can be directly classified as a positive challenge test, and the test should be discontinued, with bronchodilators administered to alleviate airway obstruction.(3) Inhalation of MCh and repeat lung function test to assess decline: prepare a series of MCh concentrations, starting from the lowest and gradually increasing the inhaled concentration (dose) using different methods. Perform pulmonary function tests at 30 seconds and 90 seconds after completing nebulization, with the number of measurements limited to 3-4 times. A complete Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) measurement is unnecessary during testing; only an acceptable FEV1 measurement is required. The interval between two consecutive concentrations (doses) generally should not exceed 3 minutes. If FEV1 declines by>=10% compared to the control value, reduce the increment of methacholine concentration (dose) and adjust the inhalation protocol accordingly. If FEV1 declines by>=20% or more compared to the control value or if the maximum concentration (amount) has been inhaled, the test should be stopped. After inhaling the MCh, close observation of the subject's response is necessary. If necessary, monitor blood oxygen saturation and auscultate lung breath sounds. The test should be promptly discontinued in case of noticeable clinical symptoms or signs.(4) Inhalation of bronchodilator and repeat lung function test to assess recovery: when the bronchial challenge test shows a positive response (FEV1 decline>=20%) or suspiciously positive, the subject should receive inhaled rapid-acting bronchodilators, such as short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) or short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA). Suppose the subject exhibits obvious symptoms of breathlessness, wheezing, or typical asthma manifestations, and wheezing is audible in the lungs, even if the positive criteria are not met. In that case, the challenge test should be immediately stopped, and rapid-acting bronchodilators should be administered. Taking salbutamol as an example, inhale 200-400 mug (100 mug per puff, 2-4 puffs, as determined by the physician based on the subject's condition). Reassess pulmonary function after 5-10 minutes. If FEV1 recovers to within 10% of the baseline value, the test can be concluded. However, if there is no noticeable improvement (FEV1 decline still>=10%), record the symptoms and signs and repeat the bronchodilation procedure as mentioned earlier. Alternatively, add Ipratropium bromide (SAMA) or further administer nebulized bronchodilators and corticosteroids for intensified treatment while keeping the subject under observation until FEV1 recovers to within 90% of the baseline value before allowing the subject to leave.Question 6: What are the quality control requirements for the APS and Astograph MCT equipment?(1) APS Method Equipment Quality Control: The APS method for MCT uses a nebulizing inhalation device that requires standardized flowmeters, compressed air power source pressure and flow, and nebulizer aerosol output. Specific quality control methods are as follows:a. Flow and volume calibration of the quantitative nebulization device: Connect the flowmeter, an empty nebulization chamber, and a nebulization filter in sequence, attaching the compressed air source to the bottom of the chamber to ensure airtight connections. Then, attach a 3 L calibration syringe to the subject's breathing interface and simulate the flow during nebulization (typically low flow:<2 L/s) to calibrate the flow and volume. If calibration results exceed the acceptable range of the device's technical standards, investigate and address potential issues such as air leaks or increased resistance due to a damp filter, then recalibrate. Cleaning the flowmeter or replacing the filter can change the resistance in the breathing circuit, requiring re-calibration of the flow.b. Testing the compressed air power source: Regularly test the device, connecting the components as mentioned above. Then, block the opening of the nebulization device with a stopper or hand, start the compressed air power source, and test its pressure and flow. If the test results do not meet the technical standards, professional maintenance of the equipment may be required.c. Verification of aerosol output of the nebulization chamber: Regularly verify all nebulization chambers used in provocation tests. Steps include adding a certain amount of saline to the chamber, weighing and recording the chamber's weight (including saline), connecting the nebulizer to the quantitative nebulization device, setting the nebulization time, starting nebulization, then weighing and recording the post-nebulization weight. Calculate the unit time aerosol output using the formula [(weight before nebulization-weight after nebulization)/nebulization time]. Finally, set the nebulization plan for the provocation test based on the aerosol output, considering the MCh concentration, single inhalation nebulization duration, number of nebulization, and cumulative dose to ensure precise dosing of the inhaled MCh.(2) Astograph method equipment quality control: Astograph method equipment for MCT consists of a respiratory resistance monitoring device and a nebulization medication device. Perform zero-point calibration, volume calibration, impedance verification, and nebulization chamber checks daily before tests to ensure the resistance measurement system and nebulization system function properly. Calibration is needed every time the equipment is turned on, and more frequently if there are significant changes in environmental conditions.a. Zero-point calibration: Perform zero-point calibration before testing each subject. Ensure the nebulization chamber is properly installed and plugged with no air leaks.b. Volume calibration: Use a 3 L calibration syringe to calibrate the flow sensor at a low flow rate (approximately 1 L/s).c. Resistance verification: Connect low impedance tubes (1.9-2.2 cmH2O L-1 s-1) and high impedance tubes (10.2-10.7 cmH2O L-1 s-1) to the device interface for verification.d. Bypass check: Start the bypass check and record the bypass value; a value>150 ml/s is normal.e. Nebulization chamber check: Check each of the 12 nebulization chambers daily, especially those containing bronchodilators, to ensure normal spraying. The software can control each nebulization chamber to produce spray automatically for a preset duration (e.g., 2 seconds). Observe the formation of water droplets on the chamber walls, indicating normal spraying. If no nebulization occurs, check for incorrect connections or blockages.Question 7: How to set up and select the APS method in MCT?The software program of the aerosol provocation system in the quantitative nebulization method can independently set the nebulizer output, concentration of the methacholine agent, administration time, and number of administrations and combine these parameters to create the challenge test process. In principle, the concentration of the methacholine agent should increase from low to high, and the dose should increase from small to large. According to the standard, a 2-fold or 4-fold incremental challenge process is generally used. In clinical practice, the dose can be simplified for subjects with good baseline lung function and no history of wheezing, such as using a recommended 2-concentration, 5-step method (25 and 50 g/L) and (6.25 and 25 g/L). Suppose FEV1 decreases by more than 10% compared to the baseline during the test to ensure subject safety. In that case, the incremental dose of the methacholine agent can be reduced, and the inhalation program can be adjusted appropriately. If the subject's baseline lung function declines or has recent daytime or nighttime symptoms such as wheezing or chest tightness, a low concentration, low dose incremental process should be selected.Question 8: What are the precautions for the operation process of the Astograph method in MCT?(1) Test equipment: The Astograph method utilizes the forced oscillation technique, applying a sinusoidal oscillating pressure at the mouthpiece during calm breathing. Subjects inhale nebulized MCh of increasing concentrations while continuous monitoring of respiratory resistance (Rrs) plots the changes, assessing airway reactivity and sensitivity. The nebulization system employs jet nebulization technology, comprising a compressed air pump and 12 nebulization cups. The first cup contains saline, cups 2 to 11 contain increasing concentrations of MCh, and the 12th cup contains a bronchodilator solution.(2) Provocation process: Prepare 10 solutions of MCh provocant with gradually increasing concentrations.(3) Operational procedure: The oscillation frequency is usually set to 3 Hz (7 Hz for children) during the test. The subject breathes calmly, inhales saline solution nebulized first, and records the baseline resistance value (if the subject's baseline resistance value is higher than 10 cmH2O L-1 s-1, the challenge test should not be performed). Then, the subject gradually inhales increasing concentrations of methacholine solution. Each concentration solution is inhaled for 1 minute, and the nebulization system automatically switches to the next concentration for inhalation according to the set time. Each nebulizer cup contains 2-3 ml of solution, the output is 0.15 ml/min, and each concentration is inhaled for 1 minute. The dose-response curve is recorded automatically. Subjects should breathe tidally during the test, avoiding deep breaths and swallowing. Continue until Rrs significantly rises to more than double the baseline value, or if the subject experiences notable respiratory symptoms or other discomfort, such as wheezing in both lungs upon auscultation. At this point, the inhalation of the provocant should be stopped and the subject switchs to inhaling a bronchodilator until Rrs returns to pre-provocation levels. If there is no significant increase in Rrs, stop the test after inhaling the highest concentration of MCh.Question 9: How to interpret the results of the MCT?The method chosen for the MCT determines the specific indicators used for interpretation. The most commonly used indicator is FEV1, although other parameters such as Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and Rrs can also be used to assess airway hyperresponsiveness.Qualitative judgment: The test results can be classified as positive, suspiciously positive, or negative, based on a combination of the judgment indicators and changes in the subject's symptoms. If FEV1 decreases by>=20% compared to the baseline value after not completely inhaling at the highest concentration, the result can be judged as positive for Methacholine bronchial challenge test. If the patient has obvious wheezing symptoms or wheezing is heard in both lungs, but the challenge test does not meet the positive criteria (the highest dose/concentration has been inhaled), and FEV1 decreases between 10% and 20% compared to the baseline level, the result can also be judged as positive. If FEV1 decreases between 15% and 20% compared to the baseline value without dyspnea or wheezing attacks, the result can be judged as suspiciously positive. Astograph method: If Rrs rises to 2 times or more of the baseline resistance before reaching the highest inhalation concentration, or if the subject's lungs have wheezing and severe coughing, the challenge test can be judged as positive. Regardless of the result of the Methacholine bronchial challenge test, factors that affect airway reactivity, such as drugs, seasons, climate, diurnal variations, and respiratory tract infections, should be excluded.Quantitative judgment: When using the APS method, the severity of airway hyperresponsiveness can be graded based on PD20-FEV1 or PC20-FEV1. Existing evidence suggests that PD20 shows good consistency when different nebulizers, inhalation times, and starting concentrations of MCh are used for bronchial provocation tests, whereas there is more variability with PC20. Therefore, PD20 is often recommended as the quantitative assessment indicator. The threshold value for PD20 with the APS method is 2.5 mg.The Astograph method often uses the minimum cumulative dose (Dmin value, in Units) to reflect airway sensitivity. Dmin is the minimum cumulative dose of MCh required to produce a linear increase in Rrs. A dose of 1 g/L of the drug concentration inhaled for 1-minute equals 1 unit. It's important to note that with the continuous increase in inhaled provocant concentration, the concept of cumulative dose in the Astograph method should not be directly compared to other methods. Most asthma patients have a Dmin<10 Units, according to Japanese guidelines. The Astograph method, having been used in China for over twenty years, suggests a high likelihood of asthma when Dmin<=6 Units, with a smaller Dmin value indicating a higher probability. When Dmin is between 6 and 10 Units, further differential diagnosis is advised to ascertain whether the condition is asthma.Precautions:A negative methacholine challenge test (MCT) does not entirely rule out asthma. The test may yield negative results due to the following reasons:(1) Prior use of medications that reduce airway responsiveness, such as beta2 agonists, anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, theophylline, corticosteroids, etc., and insufficient washout time.(2) Failure to meet quality control standards in terms of pressure, flow rate, particle size, and nebulization volume of the aerosol delivery device.(3) Poor subject cooperation leads to inadequate inhalation of the methacholine agent.(4) Some exercise-induced asthma patients may not be sensitive to direct bronchial challenge tests like the Methacholine challenge and require indirect bronchial challenge tests such as hyperventilation, cold air, or exercise challenge to induce a positive response.(5) A few cases of occupational asthma may only react to specific antigens or sensitizing agents, requiring specific allergen exposure to elicit a positive response.A positive MCT does not necessarily indicate asthma. Other conditions can also present with airway hyperresponsiveness and yield positive results in the challenge test, such as allergic rhinitis, chronic bronchitis, viral upper respiratory infections, allergic alveolitis, tropical eosinophilia, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, post-cardiopulmonary transplant, congestive heart failure, and more. Furthermore, factors like smoking, air pollution, or exercise before the test may also result in a positive bronchial challenge test.Question 10: What are the standardized requirements for the MCT report?The report should include: (1) basic information about the subject; (2) examination data and graphics: present baseline data, measurement data after the last two challenge doses or concentrations in tabular form, and the percentage of actual measured values compared to the baseline; flow-volume curve and volume-time curve before and after challenge test; dose-response curve: showing the threshold for positive challenge; (3) opinions and conclusions of the report: including the operator's opinions, quality rating of the examination, and review opinions of the reviewing physician.Question 11: What are the adverse reactions and safety measures of MCT?During the MCT, the subject needs to repeatedly breathe forcefully and inhale bronchial challenge agents, which may induce or exacerbate bronchospasm and contraction and may even cause life-threatening situations. Medical staff should be fully aware of the indications, contraindications, medication use procedures, and emergency response plans for the MCT.
38430625	Early glucose abnormalities revealed by continuous glucose monitoring associate with lung function decline in cystic fibrosis: A five-year prospective study. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is commonly associated with declining lung function and nutritional status. We aimed to evaluate the pulmonary impact of early glucose abnormalities by using 2-h standard oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). METHODS: PwCF aged >=10 years old without known CFRD were included in a five-year prospective multicentre study. Annual evaluation of nutritional status, lung function, OGTT and CGM was set up. Associations between annual rate changes (Delta) in lung function, DeltaFEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) percentage predicted (pp) and DeltaFVC (forced vital capacity) pp., and annual rate changes in OGTT or CGM variables were estimated with a mixed model with a random effect for subject. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2016, 112 PwCF (age: 21 +- 11 years, BMI (body mass index) z-score: -0.55 +- 1.09, FEV1pp: 77 +- 24 %, 2-h OGTT glucose: 122 +- 44 mg/dL, AUC (area under curve) >140 mg/dL: 1 mg/dL/day (0.2, 3.0) were included. A total of 428 OGTTs and 480 CGMs were collected. The participants presented annual decline of FVCpp and FEV1pp at -1.0 % per year (-1.6, -0.4), p < 0.001 and - 1.9 % per year (-2.5, -1.3), p < 0.001 respectively without change in BMI z-score during the study. Variation of two-hour OGTT glucose was not associated with declining lung function, as measured by DeltaFEV1pp (p = 0.94) and DeltaFVCpp (p = 0.90). Among CGM variables, only increase in AUC >140 mg/dL between two annual visits was associated with a decrease in DeltaFVCpp (p < 0.05) and DeltaFEV1pp (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study supports the fact that early glucose abnormalities revealed by CGM predict pulmonary function decline in PwCF, while 2-h standard OGTT glucose is not associated with pulmonary impairment.
38150545	Viral airway injury promotes cell engraftment in an in vitro model of cystic fibrosis cell therapy. Cell therapy is a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF). However, cell engraftment into the airway epithelium is challenging. Here, we model cell engraftment in vitro using the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture system by injuring well-differentiated CF ALI cultures and delivering non-CF cells at the time of peak injury. Engraftment efficiency was quantified by measuring chimerism by droplet digital PCR and functional ion transport in Ussing chambers. Using this model, we found that human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) engraft more efficiently when they are cultured by conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) culture methods. Cell engraftment into the airway epithelium requires airway injury, but the extent of injury needed is unknown. We compared three injury models and determined that severe injury with partial epithelial denudation facilitates long-term cell engraftment and functional CFTR recovery up to 20% of wildtype function. The airway epithelium promptly regenerates in response to injury, creating competition for space and posing a barrier to effective engraftment. We examined competition dynamics by time-lapse confocal imaging and found that delivered cells accelerate airway regeneration by incorporating into the epithelium. Irradiating the repairing epithelium granted engrafting cells a competitive advantage by diminishing resident stem cell proliferation. Intentionally, causing severe injury to the lungs of people with CF would be dangerous. However, naturally occurring events like viral infection can induce similar epithelial damage with patches of denuded epithelium. We found that viral preconditioning promoted effective engraftment of cells primed for viral resistance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cell therapy is a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we model cell engraftment by injuring CF air-liquid interface cultures and delivering non-CF cells. Successful engraftment required severe epithelial injury. Intentionally injuring the lungs to this extent would be dangerous. However, naturally occurring events like viral infection induce similar epithelial damage. We found that viral preconditioning promoted the engraftment of cells primed for viral resistance leading to CFTR functional recovery to 20% of the wildtype.
38327061	Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children. BACKGROUND: Pediatric bronchiectasis is a common respiratory disease in children. The use of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for its treatment remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to compare and analyze the clinical efficacy of thoracoscopic surgery and thoracotomy in the treatment of pediatric bronchiectasis and summarize the surgical treatment experience of VATS in children with bronchiectasis. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center cohort study. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 46 pediatric patients who underwent surgery with bronchiectasis at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from May 2015 to May 2023. The patients were divided into two groups: the VATS group (25 cases) and the thoracotomy group (21 cases). Comparative analysis was performed on various parameters including basic clinical data, surgical methods, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, transfusion status, postoperative pain, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, chest tube drainage time, length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and follow-up information. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients in terms of age, weight, gender, etiology, duration of symptoms, site of onset, and comorbidities (p > 0.05). The operation time in the VATS group was longer than that in the thoracotomy group (p < 0.001). However, the VATS group had better outcomes in terms of intraoperative blood loss, transfusion status, postoperative pain, postoperative mechanical ventilation time, chest tube drainage time, and length of hospital stay (p < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative complications in the VATS group was lower than that in the thoracotomy group, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.152). Follow-up data showed no statistically significant difference in the surgical treatment outcomes between the two groups (p = 0.493). CONCLUSION: The incidence of complications and mortality in surgical treatment of bronchiectasis is acceptable. Compared with thoracotomy surgery, VATS has advantages such as smaller trauma, less pain, faster recovery, and fewer complications. For suitable pediatric patients with bronchiectasis, VATS is a safe and effective surgical method.

38070531	A core outcome set for bronchiectasis in children and adolescents for use in clinical research: an international consensus study. Improving the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children and adolescents requires high-quality research with outcomes that meet study objectives and are meaningful for patients and their parents and caregivers. In the absence of systematic reviews or agreement on the health outcomes that should be measured in paediatric bronchiectasis, we established an international, multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a core outcome set (COS) that incorporates patient and parent perspectives. We undertook a systematic review from which a list of 21 outcomes was constructed; these outcomes were used to inform the development of separate surveys for ranking by parents and patients and by health-care professionals. 562 participants (201 parents and patients from 17 countries, 361 health-care professionals from 58 countries) completed the surveys. Following two consensus meetings, agreement was reached on a ten-item COS with five outcomes that were deemed to be essential: quality of life, symptoms, exacerbation frequency, non-scheduled health-care visits, and hospitalisations. Use of this international consensus-based COS will ensure that studies have consistent, patient-focused outcomes, facilitating research worldwide and, in turn, the development of evidence-based guidelines for improved clinical care and outcomes. Further research is needed to develop validated, accessible measurement instruments for several of the outcomes in this COS.
38270329	BMI increase during early childhood in boys with cystic fibrosis and early adrenarche. BACKGROUND: Increase in body mass index (BMI) in early childhood (1-6 years) was found to be a contributing factor for impaired final height in boys with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Early adrenarche (before age 9 years in boys) may contribute to an impaired final height by triggering an early acceleration of bone age resulting in a compromised growth spurt during puberty. We aimed to analyze the timing of adrenarche in boys with CF and to associate BMI increase in early childhood to timing of adrenarche. METHODS: Boys with CF, aged 8-9 years, visiting the CF expertize center Utrecht were included. Since 2018, anthropomorphic, pubertal and endocrine data were collected. Early adrenarche in boys was defined as a dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) >= 1 micromol/L before the age of 9 years. RESULTS: Thirteen boys (mean age 8.55 +- 0.27 years) were enrolled. The median (IQR) DHEAS-level was 1.3 micromol/L (0.71-2.40). Eight boys (61.5%) had an early rise in DHEAS-levels >= 1 micromol/L. Mean increase in BMI Z-score between 1 and 6 years of age (DeltaBMI1-6 ) was -0.07 +- 0.86. A significant correlation was found between DeltaBMI1-6 and DHEAS-levels at the age of 8-9 years (r = 0.624, p = 0.040). In five boys with early rise in DHEAS, accelerated bone age was found (average 1.55 +- 0.96 years). CONCLUSION: In this small cohort, 61.5% of boys with CF between 8 and 9 years had an early rise of DHEAS, which was correlated to DeltaBMI1 -6 between 1 and 6 years. Early adrenarche may be caused by DeltaBMI1 -6 .

38291686	Towards a Standardized Classification of the Hepatobiliary Manifestations in Cystic Fibrosis (CFHBI): A Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN Position Paper. The broad spectrum of hepatobiliary involvement in cystic fibrosis (CF) has been commonly referred to as cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD). However, differences in the definitions of CFLD have led to variations in reported prevalence, incidence rates, and standardized recommendations for diagnosis and therapies. Harmonizing the description of the spectrum of hepatobiliary involvement in all people with CF (pwCF) is deemed essential for providing a reliable account of the natural history, which in turn supports the development of meaningful clinical outcomes in patient care and research. Recognizing this necessity, The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) commissioned and tasked a committee to develop and propose a systematic classification of the CF hepatobiliary manifestations to increase uniformity, accuracy, and comparability for clinical, registry, and research purposes. This report describes the committee's combined expert position statement on hepatobiliary involvement in CF, which has been endorsed by NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN. We recommend using CFHBI (Cystic Fibrosis Hepato-Biliary Involvement) as the updated term to describe and classify all hepatobiliary manifestations in all pwCF. CFHBI encompasses the current extensive spectrum of phenotypical, clinical, or diagnostic expressions of liver involvement observed in pwCF. We present a schematic categorization of CFHBI, which may also be used to track and classify the changes and development of CFHBI in pwCF over time. The proposed classification for CFHBI is based on expert consensus and has not been validated for clinical practice and research purposes. Achieving validation should be an important aim for future research.
38088381	Device comparison study to measure nasal nitric oxide in relation to primary ciliary dyskinesia. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic respiratory disease characterized by chronic cough, recurrent respiratory infections, and rhinosinusitis. The measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) against resistance has been suggested as a sensitive screening method. However, current recommendations argue for the use of expensive, chemiluminescence devices to measure nNO. This study aimed to compare nNO measurement using three different devices in distinguishing PCD patients from healthy controls and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and to evaluate their diagnostic precision. The study included 16 controls, 16 PCD patients, and 12 CF patients matched for age and sex. nNO measurements were performed using a chemiluminescence device (Eco Medics CLD 88sp), and two devices based on electrochemical sensors (Medisoft FeNO+ and NIOX Vero) following standardized guidelines. Correlation estimation, Bland-Altman, ROC curve, and one-way ANOVA were used to assess device differences and diagnostic performance. Significantly lower nNO output values were observed in PCD and CF patients compared to controls during exhalation against resistance. The correlation analysis showed high agreement among the three devices. ROC curve analysis demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity at different cut-off values for all devices in distinguishing PCD patients from controls (optimal cut-offs: EcoMedics 73, Medisoft 92 and NIOX 87 (nl min-1)). Higher nNO output values were obtained with the Medisoft and NIOX devices as compared to the EcoMedics device, with a bias of-19 nl min-1(95% CI: -73-35) and -21 nl min-1(-73-31) accordingly. These findings indicate that all three tested devices can potentially serve as diagnostic tools for PCD if device specific cut-off values are used. This last-mentioned aspect warrants further studies and consideration in defining optimal cut-offs for individual device.
38386889	An Updated Review of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Prevalence finds EPI to be More Common in General Population than Rates of Co-Conditions. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is frequently described as underscreened, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. The treatment for EPI is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), which is costly, and provider confidence in prescribing may be one barrier to reducing undertreatment. The lack of interchangeability studies for prescription PERT and/or lack of efficacy studies of over-the-counter enzyme options may be another barrier. This paper reviewed the prevalence of EPI in the general population and in co-conditions. Prevalence of EPI in the general population is commonly estimated around 10-20%, and further research is needed to evaluate EPI across all age groups and to better understand in which age group EPI becomes more prevalent, as an age effect is often seen in EPI prevalence studies. EPI is perceived to be highly correlated with certain co-conditions, and the majority (~65%) of EPI literature is related to a co-condition such as cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, post-surgery, cancer, or diabetes. It can be estimated that 85% of literature in identified co-conditions, or 56% of total EPI literature, is on rarer co-conditions which only represent <1% of EPI overall. In contrast, there is very little research and literature on EPI in the general population. The highest absolute rates of EPI with co-conditions are likely diabetes and possibly irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, yet they are among the least commonly researched in co-condition and EPI studies. A lack of research on EPI in the general population and in the more common co-conditions may be contributing to the rates of underdiagnosis and underscreening, as well as undertreatment for those with low fecal elastase-1 levels.
38272397	Backbone cationized highly branched poly(beta-amino ester)s as enhanced delivery vectors in non-viral gene therapy. Gene therapy holds great potential for treating Lung Cystic Fibrosis (CF) which is a fatal hereditary condition arising from mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, resulting in dysfunctional CFTR protein. However, the advancement and clinical application of CF gene therapy systems have been hindered due to the absence of a highly efficient delivery vector. In this work, we introduce a new generation of highly branched poly(beta-amino ester) (HPAE) gene delivery vectors for CF treatment. Building upon the classical chemical composition of HPAE, a novel backbone cationization strategy was developed to incorporate additional functional amine groups into HPAE without altering their branching degree. By carefully adjusting the type, proportion, and backbone distribution of the added cationic groups, a series of highly effective HPAE gene delivery vectors were successfully constructed for CF disease gene therapy. In vitro assessment results showed that the backbone cationized HPAEs with randomly distributed 10% proportion of 1-(3-aminopropyl)-4-methylpiperazine (E7) amine groups exhibited superior transfection performance than their counterparts. Furthermore, the top-performed backbone cationized HPAEs, when loaded with therapeutic plasmids, successfully reinstated CFTR protein expression in the CFBE41o- disease model, achieving levels 20-23 times higher than that of normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Their therapeutic effectiveness significantly surpassed that of the currently advanced commercial vectors, Xfect and Lipofectamine 3000.
38356031	Excipients for Novel Inhaled Dosage Forms: An Overview. Pulmonary drug delivery is a form of local targeting to the lungs in patients with respiratory disorders like cystic fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), asthma, chronic pulmonary infections, and lung cancer. In addition, noninvasive pulmonary delivery also presents an attractive alternative to systemically administered therapeutics, not only for localized respiratory disorders but also for systemic absorption. Pulmonary delivery offers the advantages of a relatively low dose, low incidence of systemic side effects, and rapid onset of action for some drugs compared to other systemic administration routes. While promising, inhaled delivery of therapeutics is often complex owing to factors encompassing mechanical barriers, chemical barriers, selection of inhalation device, and limited choice of dosage form excipients. There are very few excipients that are approved by the FDA for use in developing inhaled drug products. Depending upon the dosage form, and inhalation devices such as pMDIs, DPIs, and nebulizers, different excipients can be used to provide physical and chemical stability and to deliver the dose efficiently to the lungs. This review article focuses on discussing a variety of excipients that have been used in novel inhaled dosage forms as well as inhalation devices.
38269943	Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Deep-Learning Based Classification of Cystic Fibrosis Lung Changes in MRI. Algorithms increasing the transparence and explain ability of neural networks are gaining more popularity. Applying them to custom neural network architectures and complex medical problems remains challenging. In this work, several algorithms such as integrated gradients and grad came were used to generate additional explainable outputs for the classification of lung perfusion changes and mucus plugging in cystic fibrosis patients on MRI. The algorithms are applied on top of an already existing deep learning-based classification pipeline. From six explain ability algorithms, four were implemented successfully and one yielded satisfactory results which might provide support to the radiologist. It was evident, that the areas relevant for the classification were highlighted, thus emphasizing the applicability of deep learning for classification of lung changes in CF patients. Using explainable concepts with deep learning could improve confidence of clinicians towards deep learning and introduction of more diagnostic decision support systems.
38179886	Comparison of particles in exhaled air and multiple breath washout for assessment of small airway function in children with cystic fibrosis. BACKGROUND: The introduction of modulator therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) has led to an increased interest in the detection of small airway disease (SAD) as sensitive marker of treatment response. The particles in exhaled air (PExA) method, which records exhaled particle mass (PEx ng/L) and number (PExNR), detects SAD in adult patients. Our primary aim was to investigate if PExA outcomes in children with CF are different when compared to controls and associated with more severe disease. Secondary aims were to assess feasibility and repeatability of PExA in children with CF and to correlate PExA to multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) as an established marker of SAD. METHODS: Thirteen healthy children (HC), 17 children with CF with normal lung function (CF-N) (FEV1 z-score >= -1.64) and six with airway obstruction (CF-AO) (FEV1 z-score < -1.64) between 8 and 18 years performed MBNW followed by PExA and spirometry. Children with CF repeated the measurements after 3 months. RESULTS: PEx ng/L and PExNR/L per liter of exhaled breath were similar between the three groups. The lung clearance index (LCI) was significantly higher in both CF-N and CF-AO compared to HC. All participants, except one, were able to perform PExA. Coefficient of variation for PEx ng/l was (median) 0.38, range 0-1.25 and PExNR/l 0.38, 0-1.09. Correlation between LCI and PEx ng/l was low, rs 0.32 (p = .07). CONCLUSION: PExA is feasible in children. In contrast to LCI, PExA did not differentiate healthy children from children with CF suggesting it to be a less sensitive tool to detect SAD.
