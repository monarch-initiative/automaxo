19620038	Purpura-associated congenital lymphedema. An 8-year-old girl referred to our Department for a two-month worsening of congenital primary lymphedema of the lower limb and for the appearance of several purpuric lesions on the right thigh and knee. We diagnosed a lichenoid pigmented purpura of Gougerot and Blum in a patient with Milroy disease, complicated by an insufficiency of anterior saphena. We treated the patient with topical steroids and compression stockings, until surgical intervention of phlebectomy. We report this case for the rarity of the disease, for the even more rare association with lichenoid pigmented purpura and for cutaneous immunopathological findings.
6983249	Use of isosulfan blue for identification of lymphatic vessels: experimental and clinical evaluation. Use of vital dyes for identification of lymphatic vessels before cannulation has heretofore not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The suitability of isosulfan blue, the 2,5 disulfonic acid isomer of Patent Blue, for this purpose was evaluated experimentally in the rat and clinically in 11 volunteers and 543 patients under an investigational new drug application. FDA approval for this drug has been obtained. Volunteers and patients received up to 15 mg of a 1% sterile, pyrogen-free solution per extremity (total dose of 0.4 mg/kg in the average patient). Excellent identification of lymphatic vessels was achieved in 100% of volunteers and in 97.4% of patients. In the other 2.6%, lymphatic vessels were not identified mainly due to congenital lymphatic vascular (Milroy) disease. Baseline blood chemistry in volunteers was not altered after administration of the dye. No adverse reactions were found in volunteers and minimal allergic reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients. Acute toxicity studies demonstrated an LD50 greater than 150 mg/kg in the rat. Isosulfan blue was excreted unchanged in the urine (7%) and feces. Comparable excretion was found in volunteers. Isosulfan blue is a safe and efficacious vital dye for lymphangiography.
36538874	Two novel variations p.(Ser1275Thr) and p.(Ser1275Arg) in FLT4 causing prenatal hereditary lymphedema type 1. BACKGROUND: Hereditary lymphedema 1 is a rare congenital condition, characterized by the development of chronic swelling in body parts. It is highly variable in expression and age of onset with different presentations: from feet edema to hydrops fetalis. This affection is genetically heterogeneous with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance due to a mutation in the FLT4 gene in most cases. CASES: In our study, we report on two fetuses harboring congenital lymphedema with FLT4 variation and review the prenatal confirmed ones of the literatures. Our cases were selected within fetuses explored by exome sequencing in a diagnosis setting. Prenatal ultrasonography showed hydrops fetalis in one case and an increased nuchal translucency with hydrothorax in the other. Comparative genomic hybridization array on amniocentesis was normal in both cases. Exome sequencing identified a variation p.(Ser1275Thr) and p.(Ser1275Arg) in fetus 1 and fetus 2 in the FLT4 gene, respectively. A de novo mutation at the same codon was reported in prenatal literature suggesting possible genotype phenotype correlation. CONCLUSION: Cystic hygroma/hydrops fetalis are possible manifestations of several disorders. This study illustrates how the integration of exome sequencing in prenatal clinical practice can facilitate the diagnosis and genetic counseling of heterogeneous developmental affections.
20447153	A new classification system for primary lymphatic dysplasias based on phenotype. Traditional classification systems for lymphoedema are of limited use for the diagnosis of specific forms of primary lymphoedema. The understanding of primary lymphoedema has been impeded by confusing terminology and a tendency to simply divide patients into three categories based on the age of onset: lymphoedema congenita manifests at or shortly after birth, lymphoedema praecox is apparent before the age of 35 years and lymphoedema tarda manifests thereafter. The clinical presentation in the spectrum of primary lymphoedema disorders is very variable; the phenotypes of primary lymphoedema conditions vary in the age of onset, site of the oedema, inheritance patterns, associated features and genetic causes. Different inheritance patterns are recognised and there are numerous associated anomalies. Some subgroups, such as Milroy disease and Lymphoedema distichiasis, are well characterised, but others are not. A new clinical classification for primary lymphoedema has been developed as a diagnostic algorithm. Its use is demonstrated on 333 probands referred to our lymphoedema clinic. Grouping patients by accurate phenotyping facilitates molecular investigations, understanding of inheritance patterns, and the natural history of different types of primary lymphoedema. Descriptions of the diagnostic categories, some of which have not been previously clearly defined as distinct clinical entities, are illustrated by clinical cases.
26312726	Stewart-Treves Syndrome of the Lower Extremity. Stewart-Treves syndrome is a rare cutaneous angiosarcoma that develops in long-standing chronic lymphedema. Though most commonly this angiosarcoma is a result of post mastectomy lymphoedema, it also develops in Milroy disease, idiopathic, congenital, traumatic and filarial lymphoedema. Despite the rarity of this syndrome and its poor prognosis, early diagnosis associated with radical surgery can provide improved survival. We report a case of angiosarcoma in the lower limb in a patient with chronic lymphedema associated with history of repeated erysipela episodes. 
17853615	Fluorescence microlymphography: diagnostic potential in lymphedema and basis for the measurement of lymphatic pressure and flow velocity. Fluorescence microlymphography (FML) is an almost atraumatic technique used to visualize the superficial skin network of initial lymphatics through the intact skin of man. Visualization was performed with an incident light fluorescence microscope following subepidermal injection of minute amounts of FITC-dextran 150,000 using microneedles. Emanating from the bright dye depot, the surrounding network of microvessels is filled, documentation performed by photography or video film. In congenital Milroy lymphedema, a lack of microlymphatics (aplasia) is typical while in other primary lymphedemas and in secondary lymphedema after mastectomy or irradiation of proximal lymph nodes, the network remains intact but the depicted area is enlarged. Lymphatic microangiopathy characterized by obliterations of capillary meshes or mesh segments develops in phleboedema with trophic skin changes, progressive systemic sclerosis and Fabry's disease. In lipedema, lymphatic microaneurysms are stained. Microlymphatic pressure may also be measured using FML. For this purpose, glass micropipettes are inserted into the capillaries by means of a micromanipulator and pressure is determined by the servo-nulling technique. Normal subjects produced significantly lower pressure (7.9 +/- 3.4 mmHg) compared to patients with primary lymphedema (15.0 +/- 5.1 mmHg, p<0.001). This characteristic lymphatic hypertension may be improved by complex physiotherapy or local application of prostaglandins. Additionally, a modification of the FML procedure can be used to measure lymphatic capillary flow velocity in controls and patients. FML is suited to confirm the clinical diagnosis of lymphedema, contributes to distinguish among various forms of edema, and is useful in clinical research. In addition, FML has also become a tool for experimental animal studies including the depiction of gastric microlymphatics, the measurement of flow velocity in the naked mouse tail, and in evaluation of lymphangiogenesis in a model of Milroy disease.
15689446	Milroy disease and the VEGFR-3 mutation phenotype. Primary congenital lymphoedema (Milroy disease) is a rare autosomal dominant condition for which a major causative gene defect has recently been determined. Mutations in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) gene have now been described in 13 families world-wide. This is a review of the condition based on the clinical findings in 71 subjects from 10 families. All 71 individuals have a mutation in VEGFR-3. Ninety per cent of the 71 individuals carrying a VEGFR-3 mutation showed signs of oedema, which was confined in all cases to the lower limbs. In all but two cases onset of swelling was from birth. Other symptoms and signs included cellulitis (20%), large calibre leg veins (23%), papillomatosis (10%), and upslanting toenails (10%). In males, hydrocoele was the next most common finding after oedema (37%). Thorough clinical examination of these patients indicates that there are few clinical signs in addition to lower limb oedema. Rigorous phenotyping of patients produces a high yield of VEGFR-3 mutations.
12558846	Verruciform xanthoma in association with milroy disease and leaky capillary syndrome. An 18-year-old Caucasian boy with Milroy disease involving the right leg presented with erythematous, smooth-topped, waxy papules on the dorsum of his right foot. A 12-year-old Caucasian girl with leaky capillary syndrome presented with hemorrhagic verrucous papules on the dorsum of the toes of both feet. Histopathologic analysis revealed changes consistent with xanthoma. Both patients were treated with leg compression, curettage, and electrodesiccation. Although similar papules have been described in the setting of lymphedema from other causes, this is the first report of verruciform xanthoma associated with Milroy disease or leaky capillary syndrome.
20536741	Lymphatic dysfunction, not aplasia, underlies Milroy disease. OBJECTIVE: Milroy disease is an inherited autosomal dominant lymphoedema caused by mutations in the gene for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3, also known as FLT4). The phenotype has to date been ascribed to lymphatic aplasia. We further investigated the structural and functional defects underlying the phenotype in humans. METHODS: The skin of the swollen foot and the non-swollen forearm was examined by (i) fluorescence microlymphangiography, to quantify functional initial lymphatic density in vivo; and (ii) podoplanin and LYVE-1 immunohistochemistry of biopsies, to quantify structural lymphatic density. Leg vein function was assessed by colour Doppler duplex ultrasound. RESULTS: Milroy patients exhibited profound (86-91%) functional failure of the initial lymphatics in the foot; the forearm was unimpaired. Dermal lymphatics were present in biopsies but density was reduced by 51-61% (foot) and 26-33% (forearm). Saphenous venous reflux was present in 9/10 individuals with VEGFR3 mutations, including two carriers. CONCLUSION: We propose that VEGFR3 mutations in humans cause lymphoedema through a failure of tissue protein and fluid absorption. This is due to a profound functional failure of initial lymphatics and is not explained by microlymphatic hypoplasia alone. The superficial venous valve reflux indicates the dual role of VEGFR-3 in lymphatic and venous development.
34681005	FLT4 Mutations Are Associated with Segmental Lymphatic Dysfunction and Initial Lymphatic Aplasia in Patients with Milroy Disease. This study explored mutations in the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 gene (FLT4) and lymphatic defects in patients with Milroy disease (MD). Twenty-nine patients with lower limb lymphedema were enrolled. Sixteen patients had a familial history of MD, while 13 patients exhibited sporadic MD. Clinical signs, FLT4 mutations, indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography findings, and skin tissue immunohistochemical staining results were evaluated. Twenty-eight variants in FLT4 were identified. Twelve of these have previously been reported, while 16 are novel. Of the 28 variants, 26 are missense mutations, and the remaining two comprise a splicing mutation and a non-frame shift mutation. Twenty-five variants are located in the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain; three are located in the extracellular immunoglobulin domain. Substantially delayed contrast-enhanced tortuous lymphatic vessels were visualized to the ankle or knee level in 15 of 23 patients who underwent ICG lymphography. No initial lymphatic vessels were visualized in skin specimens from four patients who did not exhibit lymphatic vessels during imaging analyses. No specific variant was identified in relation to the unique clinical phenotype. Segmental dysfunction of lymphatic vessels and initial lymphatic aplasia are present in MD patients with FLT4 mutations.
26275891	Exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: In the absence of aneuploidy or other pathogenic cytogenetic abnormality, fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT >= 3.5 mm) and/or other sonographic abnormalities have a greater incidence of genetic syndromes, but defining the underlying pathology can be challenging. Here, we investigate the value of whole exome sequencing in fetuses with sonographic abnormalities but normal microarray analysis. METHOD: Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from chorionic villi or amniocytes in 24 fetuses with unexplained ultrasound findings. In the first 14 cases sequencing was initially performed on fetal DNA only. For the remaining 10, the trio of fetus, mother and father was sequenced simultaneously. RESULTS: In 21% (5/24) cases, exome sequencing provided definitive diagnoses (Milroy disease, hypophosphatasia, achondrogenesis type 2, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Baraitser-Winter Syndrome). In a further case, a plausible diagnosis of orofaciodigital syndrome type 6 was made. In two others, a single mutation in an autosomal recessive gene was identified, but incomplete sequencing coverage precluded exclusion of the presence of a second mutation. CONCLUSION: Whole exome sequencing improves prenatal diagnosis in euploid fetuses with abnormal ultrasound scans. In order to expedite interpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be compromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes.
12224079	Prenatal diagnosis of Milroy's primary congenital lymphedema. Milroy's primary congenital lymphedema (PCL) (hereditary lymphedema type I, Milroy disease) is present at birth, and mostly affects the dorsal aspects of feet. It is mostly a life-long condition but does not affect longevity. Complications are rare except for chronic discomfort and warmness of affected areas. PCL is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance due to a mutation in the gene locus encoding for VEGFR3 with resultant dysgenesis of microlymphatic vessels. We report on two fetuses where ultrasonographic examination at 15 weeks of gestation showed significant edema of the dorsal aspects of both feet with no evidence of other major malformations. Whereas in one fetus the edema resolved completely, it persisted in the second fetus and proved after birth to be of lymphedematous nature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of early prenatal diagnosis of primary congenital lymphedema via fetal ultrasonographic examination and of spontaneous resolution of lymphedema during fetal life.
31165487	Surgical treatment of Milroy disease. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Milroy disease is a form of congenital primary lymphedema affecting the lower limbs. When conservative management is ineffective, surgical treatment becomes necessary. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) associated with extensive therapeutic lipectomy in the treatment of these patients. METHODS: In China Medical University Hospital, four patients have been diagnosed with Milroy disease and treated over an 8 year-period time. All patients presented with hereditary bilateral legs swelling since birth. All patients were treated with VLNT from the gastroepiploic region bilaterally associated with extensive therapeutic lipectomy. RESULTS: All procedures have been executed bilaterally and have been successful, without complications. The average follow-up of the patients was 20.2 +- 2.8 months. The limbs treated presented an average circumference reduction of a 4.0 +- 2.1 cm and patients did not experience cellulitis during follow-up. Patients expressed satisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: VLNT together with therapeutic lipectomy proved to be a reliable technique in moderate cases of Milroy disease, providing an alternative path for lymph drainage, and reducing the lymph load and the excess of subcutaneous adipose tissues, thus improving patients' quality of life.
3221210	[Hereditary congenital lymphedema with pseudosexual ambiguity]. A case of uncommon genital lymphedema in a newborn girl like a pseudo sexual ambiguity is reported. The karyotype was 46, XX. Lymphedema of the lower limbs in the patient and in the mother's family confirmed a None-Milroy disease. Different considerations about genetic counseling in hereditary lymphedema, isolated or associated with others anomalies, are developed.
31721633	Lymphoscintigraphic Abnormalities Associated with Milroy Disease and Lymphedema-Distichiasis Syndrome. Background: Primary lymphedema is genetically heterogeneous. Two of the most common forms of primary lymphedema are Milroy disease (MD) and lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (LDS). This study aims to look further into the pathogenesis of the two conditions by analyzing the lymphoscintigram images from affected individuals to ascertain if it is a useful diagnostic tool. Methods and Results: The lymphoscintigrams of patients with MD and LDS were analyzed, comparing the images and transport parameters of the two genotypes against a control population. Lymphoscintigrams were available for 12 MD and 16 LDS patients (all genetically proven diagnoses). Eight of the 12 (67%) lymph scans performed on patients with MD demonstrated little or no uptake from the initial lymphatics and poor visualization of the inguinal lymph nodes. These changes were consistent with a "functional aplasia," that is, the lymphatic vessels were present but appeared to be ineffective in absorbing the interstitial fluid into the lymphatic system. In patients with LDS the lymphoscintigraphic appearances were different. In 12 of the 16 scans (75%), the lymph scans were highly suggestive of lymphatic collector reflux. Quantification revealed a significantly reduced uptake of tracer within the inguinal lymph nodes and a higher residual activity in the feet at 2 hours in MD compared with LDS and compared with controls. Conclusion: Lymphoscintigraphic imaging and quantification can be characteristic in specific genetic forms of primary lymphedema and may be useful as an additional tool for in-depth phenotyping, leading to a more accurate diagnosis and providing insight into the underlying mechanism of disease.
2256646	[Meige-Milroy-Nonne disease. Report of a case in a six-month-old infant]. A case of Milroy disease is reported. This very infrequent condition is a familial disease characterized by the presence of lymphedema of the lower limbs. In our patient's family, we identified 12 affected members belonging to four generations.
28748022	[Primary congenital lymphedema: Milroy disease: the first case observed in the Department of Pediatrics at the University Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou]. Congenital lymphedema is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the child's interstitial spaces. Milroy disease is a rare, hereditary, autosomal dominant condition showing incomplete penetrance. We report the case of a 7-year old little girl with Milroy disease examined for erysipelas on congenital big right leg. A family history of large congenital member existed. Physical examination showed big oedematous right leg painful to palpation, with skin lichenification and erysipelas. Paraclinical assessment objectified cutaneous lymphedema with vascular involvement suggestive of ectasia of the right saphenous vein. Female karyotype showed no abnormalities, despite the small chromosomal rearrangements. Treatment was based on physiotherapy, bandages, compression stockings and psychotherapy. This first case in Burkina Faso testifies to the rarity of the pathology but especially to the diagnostic difficulties related to the inadequacy of paraclinical investigations.
25109169	A novel FLT4 mutation identified in a patient with Milroy disease. Milroy disease is an autosomal dominant disorder generally presenting with below the knee lymphedema at birth. It is linked to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the VEGFR3 protein which is encoded in the FLT4 gene. Here we report a case of Milroy disease in a patient with a dominant pattern of inheritance, classical physical findings, and lymphatic system imaging demonstrating lack of tracer transport in the lower limbs. Genetic analysis revealed a novel missense mutation compared to a summary of reported mutations causing Milroy Disease.
19289394	Recessive primary congenital lymphoedema caused by a VEGFR3 mutation. BACKGROUND: Heterozygous mutations in VEGFR3 have been identified in some familial cases with dominantly inherited primary congenital lymphoedema, known as Nonne-Milroy disease. Recessive cases of primary lymphoedema with a genetic cause are not known, except for two families with syndromic hypotrichosis-lymphoedema-telangiectasia, with a SOX18 mutation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we present the first case of isolated primary congenital lymphoedema with recessive inheritance, caused by a homozygous mutation in VEGFR3. The novel mutation is a transition from alanine-to-threonine in amino acid 855, located in the ATP binding domain of the VEGFR3 receptor. Assessment of receptor function showed impaired ligand induced internalisation and ERK1/2 activity. Moreover, receptor phosphorylation was reduced, although less so than for a kinase-dead VEGFR3 mutation, which causes Nonne-Milroy disease. CONCLUSION: A hypomorphic VEGFR3 mutation, with moderate effect on receptor function, in a homozygous state can result in insufficient lymphatic functioning. Thus, in addition to Nonne-Milroy disease with dominant inheritance, VEGFR3 alterations can cause isolated recessive primary congenital lymphoedema. These data expand our understanding of the aetiology of congenital lymphoedema and suggest that large scale screening of VEGFR3 in all primary lymphoedema patients is necessary.
22021048	Prenatal diagnosis of Milroy disease. 
29908552	Rare Variants in LAMA5 Gene associated with FLT4 and FOXC2 Mutations in Primary Lymphedema May Contribute to Severity. Mutations in the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4) and forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2) genes cause Milroy disease (MD) and lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (LDS),  respectively, but the mechanism underlying disease pathology remains unclear. Applying whole-exome sequencing to two families with MD, one LDS family, and one sporadic LDScase, we identified four rare variants in the laminin subunit alpha-5 gene (LAMA5) in subjects carrying novel and known missense FLT4 mutations and a 7-bp duplication and 1-bp insertion in FOXC2. Phenotyping was expanded in some individuals using magnetic resonance lymphangiography, indiocyanine green fluorescence lymphography, andimmunofluorescent lymphatic staining of skin tissue. Skin lymphatic staining showed the existence of dermal lymphatic vasculature in the MD case. Significant lymphatic dysfunction was observed in both MD and LDS patients. In the MD patient, tortuous lymphatics in the dorsum of the foot were slowly enhanced on indocyanine green fluorescentlymphography (ICG) imaging. Dilated lymph collectors with disruption and lymph leakage were observed in the familial LDS case on magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL). Numerous tortuous lymph collectors were visualized along the entire length of affected lower limbs on MRL imaging, and retrograde lymph flow was observed in the lymph collectors during ICG lymphography in the isolated LDS case. The finding of rare LAMA5 variants together with FLT4 andFOXC2 mutations suggests that these mutations may be co-responsible for these  disorders and most likely interfere with the function of lymphatics. Further, larger studies are needed to confirm these results.
26714373	A NOVEL FLT4 GENE MUTATION AND MR LYMPHANGIOGRAPHY IN A CHINESE FAMILY WITH MILROY DISEASE. Milroy disease is a congenital onset lymphedema linked to FLT4 gene mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. So far, a total of 59 different FLT4 variants have been identified. Here, we report a novel FLT4 gene mutation in a Chinese family with Milroy disease and present their clinical symptoms and MR lymphangiographic findings.
25896638	Antenatal presentation of hereditary lymphedema type I. Fetal edema can present as limited subcutaneous edema, fluid accumulation in body cavities or hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is the end stage of a variety of fetal/maternal disorders and nonimmune etiology represents more than 3/4 of cases. Lymphatic dysplasia may account for a subset of patients with nonimmune and "idiopathic" hydrops fetalis, fetal chylous ascites or chylothorax. We present two unrelated patients with antenatal features of hereditary lymphedema syndrome, in whom Milroy disease was diagnosed after birth. At least, 20 genes have been identified to cause primary lymphedema, with sometimes antenatal features. Hereditary lymphedema syndrome should be considered in cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis/fetal edema after ruling out the more common etiologies.
