It is highly variable in expression and age of onset with different presentations: from feet edema to hydrops fetalis. This affection is genetically heterogeneous with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance due to a mutation in the FLT4 gene in most cases. CASES: In our study, we report on two fetuses harboring congenital lymphedema with FLT4 variation and review the prenatal confirmed ones of the literatures. Our cases were selected within fetuses explored by exome sequencing in a diagnosis setting. Prenatal ultrasonography showed hydrops fetalis in one case and an increased nuchal translucency with hydrothorax in the other. Comparative genomic hybridization array on amniocentesis was normal in both cases. Exome sequencing identified a variation p.(Ser1275Thr) and p.(Ser1275Arg) in fetus 1 and fetus 2 in the FLT4 gene, respectively. A de novo mutation at the same codon was reported in prenatal literature suggesting possible genotype phenotype correlation. CONCLUSION: Cystic hygroma/hydrops fetalis are possible manifestations of several disorders. This study illustrates how the integration of exome sequencing in prenatal clinical practice can facilitate the diagnosis and genetic counseling of heterogeneous developmental affections.
26312726		Stewart-Treves Syndrome of the Lower Extremity.Stewart-Treves syndrome is a rare cutaneous angiosarcoma that develops in long-standing chronic lymphedema. Though most commonly this angiosarcoma is a result of post mastectomy lymphoedema, it also develops in Milroy disease, idiopathic, congenital, traumatic and filarial lymphoedema. Despite the rarity of this syndrome and its poor prognosis, early diagnosis associated with radical surgery can provide improved survival. We report a case of angiosarcoma in the lower limb in a patient with chronic lymphedema associated with history of repeated erysipela episodes.

Twenty-nine patients with lower limb lymphedema were enrolled. Sixteen patients had a familial history of MD, while 13 patients exhibited sporadic MD. Clinical signs, FLT4 mutations, indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography findings, and skin tissue immunohistochemical staining results were evaluated. Twenty-eight variants in FLT4 were identified. Twelve of these have previously been reported, while 16 are novel. Of the 28 variants, 26 are missense mutations, and the remaining two comprise a splicing mutation and a non-frame shift mutation. Twenty-five variants are located in the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain; three are located in the extracellular immunoglobulin domain. Substantially delayed contrast-enhanced tortuous lymphatic vessels were visualized to the ankle or knee level in 15 of 23 patients who underwent ICG lymphography. No initial lymphatic vessels were visualized in skin specimens from four patients who did not exhibit lymphatic vessels during imaging analyses. No specific variant was identified in relation to the unique clinical phenotype. Segmental dysfunction of lymphatic vessels and initial lymphatic aplasia are present in MD patients with FLT4 mutations.
26275891		Exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with sonographic abnormalities.OBJECTIVE: In the absence of aneuploidy or other pathogenic cytogenetic abnormality, fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT >= 3.5 mm) and/or other sonographic abnormalities have a greater incidence of genetic syndromes, but defining the underlying pathology can be challenging. Here, we investigate the value of whole exome sequencing in fetuses with sonographic abnormalities but normal microarray analysis. METHOD: Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from chorionic villi or amniocytes in 24 fetuses with unexplained ultrasound findings. In the first 14 cases sequencing was initially performed on fetal DNA only. For the remaining 10, the trio of fetus, mother and father was sequenced simultaneously. RESULTS: In 21% (5/24) cases, exome sequencing provided definitive diagnoses (Milroy disease, hypophosphatasia, achondrogenesis type 2, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Baraitser-Winter Syndrome). In a further case, a plausible diagnosis of orofaciodigital syndrome type 6 was made. In two others, a single mutation in an autosomal recessive gene was identified, but incomplete sequencing coverage precluded exclusion of the presence of a second mutation. CONCLUSION: Whole exome sequencing improves prenatal diagnosis in euploid fetuses with abnormal ultrasound scans. In order to expedite interpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be compromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes.
31165487		Surgical treatment of Milroy disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Milroy disease is a form of congenital primary lymphedema affecting the lower limbs. When conservative management is ineffective, surgical treatment becomes necessary. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) associated with extensive therapeutic lipectomy in the treatment of these patients. METHODS: In China Medical University Hospital, four patients have been diagnosed with Milroy disease and treated over an 8 year-period time. All patients presented with hereditary bilateral legs swelling since birth. All patients were treated with VLNT from the gastroepiploic region bilaterally associated with extensive therapeutic lipectomy. RESULTS: All procedures have been executed bilaterally and have been successful, without complications. The average follow-up of the patients was 20.2 +- 2.8 months. The limbs treated presented an average circumference reduction of a 4.0 +- 2.1 cm and patients did not experience cellulitis during follow-up. Patients expressed satisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: VLNT together with therapeutic lipectomy proved to be a reliable technique in moderate cases of Milroy disease, providing an alternative path for lymph drainage, and reducing the lymph load and the excess of subcutaneous adipose tissues, thus improving patients' quality of life.
31721633		Lymphoscintigraphic Abnormalities Associated with Milroy Disease and Lymphedema-Distichiasis Syndrome.Background: Primary lymphedema is genetically heterogeneous. Two of the most common forms of primary lymphedema are Milroy disease (MD) and lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (LDS). This study aims to look further into the pathogenesis of the two conditions by analyzing the lymphoscintigram images from affected individuals to ascertain if it is a useful diagnostic tool. Methods and Results: The lymphoscintigrams of patients with MD and LDS were analyzed, comparing the images and transport parameters of the two genotypes against a control population. Lymphoscintigrams were available for 12 MD and 16 LDS patients (all genetically proven diagnoses). Eight of the 12 (67%) lymph scans performed on patients with MD demonstrated little or no uptake from the initial lymphatics and poor visualization of the inguinal lymph nodes. These changes were consistent with a "functional aplasia," that is, the lymphatic vessels were present but appeared to be ineffective in absorbing the interstitial fluid into the lymphatic system. In patients with LDS the lymphoscintigraphic appearances were different. In 12 of the 16 scans (75%), the lymph scans were highly suggestive of lymphatic collector reflux. Quantification revealed a significantly reduced uptake of tracer within the inguinal lymph nodes and a higher residual activity in the feet at 2 hours in MD compared with LDS and compared with controls. Conclusion: Lymphoscintigraphic imaging and quantification can be characteristic in specific genetic forms of primary lymphedema and may be useful as an additional tool for in-depth phenotyping, leading to a more accurate diagnosis and providing insight into the underlying mechanism of disease.
28748022		[Primary congenital lymphedema: Milroy disease: the first case observed in the Department of Pediatrics at the University Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou].Congenital lymphedema is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the child's interstitial spaces. Milroy disease is a rare, hereditary, autosomal dominant condition showing incomplete penetrance. We report the case of a 7-year old little girl with Milroy disease examined for erysipelas on congenital big right leg. A family history of large congenital member existed. Physical examination showed big oedematous right leg painful to palpation, with skin lichenification and erysipelas. Paraclinical assessment objectified cutaneous lymphedema with vascular involvement suggestive of ectasia of the right saphenous vein. Female karyotype showed no abnormalities, despite the small chromosomal rearrangements. Treatment was based on physiotherapy, bandages, compression stockings and psychotherapy. This first case in Burkina Faso testifies to the rarity of the pathology but especially to the diagnostic difficulties related to the inadequacy of paraclinical investigations.

Applying whole-exome sequencing to two families with MD, one LDS family, and one sporadic LDScase, we identified four rare variants in the laminin subunit alpha-5 gene (LAMA5) in subjects carrying novel and known missense FLT4 mutations and a 7-bp duplication and 1-bp insertion in FOXC2. Phenotyping was expanded in some individuals using magnetic resonance lymphangiography, indiocyanine green fluorescence lymphography, andimmunofluorescent lymphatic staining of skin tissue. Skin lymphatic staining showed the existence of dermal lymphatic vasculature in the MD case. Significant lymphatic dysfunction was observed in both MD and LDS patients. In the MD patient, tortuous lymphatics in the dorsum of the foot were slowly enhanced on indocyanine green fluorescentlymphography (ICG) imaging. Dilated lymph collectors with disruption and lymph leakage were observed in the familial LDS case on magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL). Numerous tortuous lymph collectors were visualized along the entire length of affected lower limbs on MRL imaging, and retrograde lymph flow was observed in the lymph collectors during ICG lymphography in the isolated LDS case. The finding of rare LAMA5 variants together with FLT4 andFOXC2 mutations suggests that these mutations may be co-responsible for these  disorders and most likely interfere with the function of lymphatics. Further, larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

So far, a total of 59 different FLT4 variants have been identified. Here, we report a novel FLT4 gene mutation in a Chinese family with Milroy disease and present their clinical symptoms and MR lymphangiographic findings.
25896638		Antenatal presentation of hereditary lymphedema type I.Fetal edema can present as limited subcutaneous edema, fluid accumulation in body cavities or hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is the end stage of a variety of fetal/maternal disorders and nonimmune etiology represents more than 3/4 of cases. Lymphatic dysplasia may account for a subset of patients with nonimmune and "idiopathic" hydrops fetalis, fetal chylous ascites or chylothorax. We present two unrelated patients with antenatal features of hereditary lymphedema syndrome, in whom Milroy disease was diagnosed after birth. At least, 20 genes have been identified to cause primary lymphedema, with sometimes antenatal features. Hereditary lymphedema syndrome should be considered in cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis/fetal edema after ruling out the more common etiologies.
