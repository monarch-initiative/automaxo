It is highly variable in expression and age of onset with different presentations: from feet edema to hydrops fetalis. This affection is genetically heterogeneous with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance due to a mutation in the FLT4 gene in most cases. CASES: In our study, we report on two fetuses harboring congenital lymphedema with FLT4 variation and review the prenatal confirmed ones of the literatures. Our cases were selected within fetuses explored by exome sequencing in a diagnosis setting. Prenatal ultrasonography showed hydrops fetalis in one case and an increased nuchal translucency with hydrothorax in the other. Comparative genomic hybridization array on amniocentesis was normal in both cases. Exome sequencing identified a variation p.(Ser1275Thr) and p.(Ser1275Arg) in fetus 1 and fetus 2 in the FLT4 gene, respectively. A de novo mutation at the same codon was reported in prenatal literature suggesting possible genotype phenotype correlation. CONCLUSION: Cystic hygroma/hydrops fetalis are possible manifestations of several disorders.

Here, we investigate the value of whole exome sequencing in fetuses with sonographic abnormalities but normal microarray analysis.

In the first 14 cases sequencing was initially performed on fetal DNA only. For the remaining 10, the trio of fetus, mother and father was sequenced simultaneously. RESULTS: In 21% (5/24) cases, exome sequencing provided definitive diagnoses (Milroy disease, hypophosphatasia, achondrogenesis type 2, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome and Baraitser-Winter Syndrome).

Two of the most common forms of primary lymphedema are Milroy disease (MD) and lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (LDS). This study aims to look further into the pathogenesis of the two conditions by analyzing the lymphoscintigram images from affected individuals to ascertain if it is a useful diagnostic tool. Methods and Results: The lymphoscintigrams of patients with MD and LDS were analyzed, comparing the images and transport parameters of the two genotypes against a control population. Lymphoscintigrams were available for 12 MD and 16 LDS patients (all genetically proven diagnoses). Eight of the 12 (67%) lymph scans performed on patients with MD demonstrated little or no uptake from the initial lymphatics and poor visualization of the inguinal lymph nodes. These changes were consistent with a \"functional aplasia,\" that is, the lymphatic vessels were present but appeared to be ineffective in absorbing the interstitial fluid into the lymphatic system. In patients with LDS the lymphoscintigraphic appearances were different. In 12 of the 16 scans (75%), the lymph scans were highly suggestive of lymphatic collector reflux. Quantification revealed a significantly reduced uptake of tracer within the inguinal lymph nodes and a higher residual activity in the feet at 2 hours in MD compared with LDS and compared with controls. Conclusion: Lymphoscintigraphic imaging and quantification can be characteristic in specific genetic forms of primary lymphedema and may be useful as an additional tool for in-depth phenotyping, leading to a more accurate diagnosis and providing insight into the underlying mechanism of disease.",

Applying whole-exome sequencing to two families with MD, one LDS family, and one sporadic LDScase, we identified four rare variants in the laminin subunit alpha-5 gene (LAMA5) in subjects carrying novel and known missense FLT4 mutations and a 7-bp duplication and 1-bp insertion in FOXC2.

Skin lymphatic staining showed the existence of dermal lymphatic vasculature in the MD case. Significant lymphatic dysfunction was observed in both MD and LDS patients. In the MD patient, tortuous lymphatics in the dorsum of the foot were slowly enhanced on indocyanine green fluorescentlymphography (ICG) imaging. Dilated lymph collectors with disruption and lymph leakage were observed in the familial LDS case on magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL). Numerous tortuous lymph collectors were visualized along the entire length of affected lower limbs on MRL imaging, and retrograde lymph flow was observed in the lymph collectors during ICG lymphography in the isolated LDS case.

Applying whole-exome sequencing to two families with MD, one LDS family, and one sporadic LDScase, we identified four rare variants in the laminin subunit alpha-5 gene (LAMA5) in subjects carrying novel and known missense FLT4 mutations and a 7-bp duplication and 1-bp insertion in FOXC2. Phenotyping was expanded in some individuals using magnetic resonance lymphangiography, indiocyanine green fluorescence lymphography, andimmunofluorescent lymphatic staining of skin tissue. Skin lymphatic staining showed the existence of dermal lymphatic vasculature in the MD case. Significant lymphatic dysfunction was observed in both MD and LDS patients. In the MD patient, tortuous lymphatics in the dorsum of the foot were slowly enhanced on indocyanine green fluorescentlymphography (ICG) imaging. Dilated lymph collectors with disruption and lymph leakage were observed in the familial LDS case on magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL). Numerous tortuous lymph collectors were visualized along the entire length of affected lower limbs on MRL imaging, and retrograde lymph flow was observed in the lymph collectors during ICG lymphography in the isolated LDS case. The finding of rare LAMA5 variants together with FLT4 andFOXC2 mutations suggests that these mutations may be co-responsible for these  disorders and most likely interfere with the function of lymphatics. Further, larger studies are needed to confirm these results.",
