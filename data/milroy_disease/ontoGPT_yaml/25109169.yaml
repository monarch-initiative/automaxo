input_text: A novel FLT4 mutation identified in a patient with Milroy disease. Milroy
  disease is an autosomal dominant disorder generally presenting with below the knee
  lymphedema at birth. It is linked to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of
  the VEGFR3 protein which is encoded in the FLT4 gene. Here we report a case of Milroy
  disease in a patient with a dominant pattern of inheritance, classical physical
  findings, and lymphatic system imaging demonstrating lack of tracer transport in
  the lower limbs. Genetic analysis revealed a novel missense mutation compared to
  a summary of reported mutations causing Milroy Disease.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
