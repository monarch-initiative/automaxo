input_text: Prenatal diagnosis of Milroy's primary congenital lymphedema. Milroy's
  primary congenital lymphedema (PCL) (hereditary lymphedema type I, Milroy disease)
  is present at birth, and mostly affects the dorsal aspects of feet. It is mostly
  a life-long condition but does not affect longevity. Complications are rare except
  for chronic discomfort and warmness of affected areas. PCL is an autosomal dominant
  disease with incomplete penetrance due to a mutation in the gene locus encoding
  for VEGFR3 with resultant dysgenesis of microlymphatic vessels. We report on two
  fetuses where ultrasonographic examination at 15 weeks of gestation showed significant
  edema of the dorsal aspects of both feet with no evidence of other major malformations.
  Whereas in one fetus the edema resolved completely, it persisted in the second fetus
  and proved after birth to be of lymphedematous nature. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first report of early prenatal diagnosis of primary congenital lymphedema
  via fetal ultrasonographic examination and of spontaneous resolution of lymphedema
  during fetal life.
