input_text: 'Antenatal presentation of hereditary lymphedema type I.Fetal edema can
  present as limited subcutaneous edema, fluid accumulation in body cavities or hydrops
  fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is the end stage of a variety of fetal/maternal disorders
  and nonimmune etiology represents more than 3/4 of cases. Lymphatic dysplasia may
  account for a subset of patients with nonimmune and "idiopathic" hydrops fetalis,
  fetal chylous ascites or chylothorax. We present two unrelated patients with antenatal
  features of hereditary lymphedema syndrome, in whom Milroy disease was diagnosed
  after birth. At least, 20 genes have been identified to cause primary lymphedema,
  with sometimes antenatal features. Hereditary lymphedema syndrome should be considered
  in cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis/fetal edema after ruling out the more common
  etiologies. '
