input_text: Verruciform xanthoma in association with milroy disease and leaky capillary
  syndrome. An 18-year-old Caucasian boy with Milroy disease involving the right leg
  presented with erythematous, smooth-topped, waxy papules on the dorsum of his right
  foot. A 12-year-old Caucasian girl with leaky capillary syndrome presented with
  hemorrhagic verrucous papules on the dorsum of the toes of both feet. Histopathologic
  analysis revealed changes consistent with xanthoma. Both patients were treated with
  leg compression, curettage, and electrodesiccation. Although similar papules have
  been described in the setting of lymphedema from other causes, this is the first
  report of verruciform xanthoma associated with Milroy disease or leaky capillary
  syndrome.
