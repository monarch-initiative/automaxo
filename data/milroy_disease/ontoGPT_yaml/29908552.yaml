input_text: Rare Variants in LAMA5 Gene associated with FLT4 and FOXC2 Mutations in
  Primary Lymphedema May Contribute to Severity.Mutations in the Fms-related tyrosine
  kinase 4 (FLT4) and forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2) genes cause Milroy disease (MD)
  and lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (LDS),  respectively, but the mechanism underlying
  disease pathology remains unclear. Applying whole-exome sequencing to two families
  with MD, one LDS family, and one sporadic LDScase, we identified four rare variants
  in the laminin subunit alpha-5 gene (LAMA5) in subjects carrying novel and known
  missense FLT4 mutations and a 7-bp duplication and 1-bp insertion in FOXC2. Phenotyping
  was expanded in some individuals using magnetic resonance lymphangiography, indiocyanine
  green fluorescence lymphography, andimmunofluorescent lymphatic staining of skin
  tissue. Skin lymphatic staining showed the existence of dermal lymphatic vasculature
  in the MD case. Significant lymphatic dysfunction was observed in both MD and LDS
  patients. In the MD patient, tortuous lymphatics in the dorsum of the foot were
  slowly enhanced on indocyanine green fluorescentlymphography (ICG) imaging. Dilated
  lymph collectors with disruption and lymph leakage were observed in the familial
  LDS case on magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL). Numerous tortuous lymph collectors
  were visualized along the entire length of affected lower limbs on MRL imaging,
  and retrograde lymph flow was observed in the lymph collectors during ICG lymphography
  in the isolated LDS case. The finding of rare LAMA5 variants together with FLT4
  andFOXC2 mutations suggests that these mutations may be co-responsible for these  disorders
  and most likely interfere with the function of lymphatics. Further, larger studies
  are needed to confirm these results.
