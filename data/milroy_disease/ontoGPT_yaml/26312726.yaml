input_text: 'Stewart-Treves Syndrome of the Lower Extremity.Stewart-Treves syndrome
  is a rare cutaneous angiosarcoma that develops in long-standing chronic lymphedema.
  Though most commonly this angiosarcoma is a result of post mastectomy lymphoedema,
  it also develops in Milroy disease, idiopathic, congenital, traumatic and filarial
  lymphoedema. Despite the rarity of this syndrome and its poor prognosis, early diagnosis
  associated with radical surgery can provide improved survival. We report a case
  of angiosarcoma in the lower limb in a patient with chronic lymphedema associated
  with history of repeated erysipela episodes. '
