input_text: 'Two novel variations p.(Ser1275Thr) and p.(Ser1275Arg) in FLT4 causing
  prenatal hereditary lymphedema type 1.BACKGROUND: Hereditary lymphedema 1 is a rare
  congenital condition, characterized by the development of chronic swelling in body
  parts. It is highly variable in expression and age of onset with different presentations:
  from feet edema to hydrops fetalis. This affection is genetically heterogeneous
  with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance due to a mutation
  in the FLT4 gene in most cases. CASES: In our study, we report on two fetuses harboring
  congenital lymphedema with FLT4 variation and review the prenatal confirmed ones
  of the literatures. Our cases were selected within fetuses explored by exome sequencing
  in a diagnosis setting. Prenatal ultrasonography showed hydrops fetalis in one case
  and an increased nuchal translucency with hydrothorax in the other. Comparative
  genomic hybridization array on amniocentesis was normal in both cases. Exome sequencing
  identified a variation p.(Ser1275Thr) and p.(Ser1275Arg) in fetus 1 and fetus 2
  in the FLT4 gene, respectively. A de novo mutation at the same codon was reported
  in prenatal literature suggesting possible genotype phenotype correlation. CONCLUSION:
  Cystic hygroma/hydrops fetalis are possible manifestations of several disorders.
  This study illustrates how the integration of exome sequencing in prenatal clinical
  practice can facilitate the diagnosis and genetic counseling of heterogeneous developmental
  affections.'
