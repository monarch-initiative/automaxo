input_text: "[Primary congenital lymphedema: Milroy disease: the first case observed
  in the Department of Pediatrics at the University Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou].
  Congenital lymphedema is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the child's interstitial
  spaces. Milroy disease is a rare, hereditary, autosomal dominant condition showing
  incomplete penetrance. We report the case of a 7-year old little girl with Milroy
  disease examined for erysipelas on congenital big right leg. A family history of
  large congenital member existed. Physical examination showed big oedematous right
  leg painful to palpation, with skin lichenification and erysipelas. Paraclinical
  assessment objectified cutaneous lymphedema with vascular involvement suggestive
  of ectasia of the right saphenous vein. Female karyotype showed no abnormalities,
  despite the small chromosomal rearrangements. Treatment was based on physiotherapy,
  bandages, compression stockings and psychotherapy. This first case in Burkina Faso
  testifies to the rarity of the pathology but especially to the diagnostic difficulties
  related to the inadequacy of paraclinical investigations."
