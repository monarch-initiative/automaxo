input_text: "[Primary congenital lymphedema: Milroy disease: the first case observed
  in the Department of Pediatrics at the University Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou].Congenital
  lymphedema is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the child's interstitial spaces.
  Milroy disease is a rare, hereditary, autosomal dominant condition showing incomplete
  penetrance. We report the case of a 7-year old little girl with Milroy disease examined
  for erysipelas on congenital big right leg. A family history of large congenital
  member existed. Physical examination showed big oedematous right leg painful to
  palpation, with skin lichenification and erysipelas. Paraclinical assessment objectified
  cutaneous lymphedema with vascular involvement suggestive of ectasia of the right
  saphenous vein. Female karyotype showed no abnormalities, despite the small chromosomal
  rearrangements. Treatment was based on physiotherapy, bandages, compression stockings
  and psychotherapy. This first case in Burkina Faso testifies to the rarity of the
  pathology but especially to the diagnostic difficulties related to the inadequacy
  of paraclinical investigations."
