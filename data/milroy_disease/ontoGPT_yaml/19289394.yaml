input_text: 'Recessive primary congenital lymphoedema caused by a VEGFR3 mutation.
  BACKGROUND: Heterozygous mutations in VEGFR3 have been identified in some familial
  cases with dominantly inherited primary congenital lymphoedema, known as Nonne-Milroy
  disease. Recessive cases of primary lymphoedema with a genetic cause are not known,
  except for two families with syndromic hypotrichosis-lymphoedema-telangiectasia,
  with a SOX18 mutation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we present the first
  case of isolated primary congenital lymphoedema with recessive inheritance, caused
  by a homozygous mutation in VEGFR3. The novel mutation is a transition from alanine-to-threonine
  in amino acid 855, located in the ATP binding domain of the VEGFR3 receptor. Assessment
  of receptor function showed impaired ligand induced internalisation and ERK1/2 activity.
  Moreover, receptor phosphorylation was reduced, although less so than for a kinase-dead
  VEGFR3 mutation, which causes Nonne-Milroy disease. CONCLUSION: A hypomorphic VEGFR3
  mutation, with moderate effect on receptor function, in a homozygous state can result
  in insufficient lymphatic functioning. Thus, in addition to Nonne-Milroy disease
  with dominant inheritance, VEGFR3 alterations can cause isolated recessive primary
  congenital lymphoedema. These data expand our understanding of the aetiology of
  congenital lymphoedema and suggest that large scale screening of VEGFR3 in all primary
  lymphoedema patients is necessary.'
