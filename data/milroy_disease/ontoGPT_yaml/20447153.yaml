input_text: 'A new classification system for primary lymphatic dysplasias based on
  phenotype. Traditional classification systems for lymphoedema are of limited use
  for the diagnosis of specific forms of primary lymphoedema. The understanding of
  primary lymphoedema has been impeded by confusing terminology and a tendency to
  simply divide patients into three categories based on the age of onset: lymphoedema
  congenita manifests at or shortly after birth, lymphoedema praecox is apparent before
  the age of 35 years and lymphoedema tarda manifests thereafter. The clinical presentation
  in the spectrum of primary lymphoedema disorders is very variable; the phenotypes
  of primary lymphoedema conditions vary in the age of onset, site of the oedema,
  inheritance patterns, associated features and genetic causes. Different inheritance
  patterns are recognised and there are numerous associated anomalies. Some subgroups,
  such as Milroy disease and Lymphoedema distichiasis, are well characterised, but
  others are not. A new clinical classification for primary lymphoedema has been developed
  as a diagnostic algorithm. Its use is demonstrated on 333 probands referred to our
  lymphoedema clinic. Grouping patients by accurate phenotyping facilitates molecular
  investigations, understanding of inheritance patterns, and the natural history of
  different types of primary lymphoedema. Descriptions of the diagnostic categories,
  some of which have not been previously clearly defined as distinct clinical entities,
  are illustrated by clinical cases.'
