input_text: "Surgical treatment of Milroy disease. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Milroy
  disease is a form of congenital primary lymphedema affecting the lower limbs. When
  conservative management is ineffective, surgical treatment becomes necessary. The
  purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of vascularized lymph node
  transfer (VLNT) associated with extensive therapeutic lipectomy in the treatment
  of these patients. METHODS: In China Medical University Hospital, four patients
  have been diagnosed with Milroy disease and treated over an 8 year-period time.
  All patients presented with hereditary bilateral legs swelling since birth. All
  patients were treated with VLNT from the gastroepiploic region bilaterally associated
  with extensive therapeutic lipectomy. RESULTS: All procedures have been executed
  bilaterally and have been successful, without complications. The average follow-up
  of the patients was 20.2 +- 2.8 months. The limbs treated presented an average circumference
  reduction of a 4.0 +- 2.1 cm and patients did not experience cellulitis during follow-up.
  Patients expressed satisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: VLNT together with
  therapeutic lipectomy proved to be a reliable technique in moderate cases of Milroy
  disease, providing an alternative path for lymph drainage, and reducing the lymph
  load and the excess of subcutaneous adipose tissues, thus improving patients' quality
  of life."
