31165487	Surgical treatment of Milroy disease.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Milroy disease is a form of congenital primary lymphedema affecting the lower limbs. When conservative management is ineffective, surgical treatment becomes necessary. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) associated with extensive therapeutic lipectomy in the treatment of these patients. METHODS: In China Medical University Hospital, four patients have been diagnosed with Milroy disease and treated over an 8 year-period time. All patients presented with hereditary bilateral legs swelling since birth. All patients were treated with VLNT from the gastroepiploic region bilaterally associated with extensive therapeutic lipectomy. RESULTS: All procedures have been executed bilaterally and have been successful, without complications. The average follow-up of the patients was 20.2 +- 2.8 months. The limbs treated presented an average circumference reduction of a 4.0 +- 2.1 cm and patients did not experience cellulitis during follow-up. Patients expressed satisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: VLNT together with therapeutic lipectomy proved to be a reliable technique in moderate cases of Milroy disease, providing an alternative path for lymph drainage, and reducing the lymph load and the excess of subcutaneous adipose tissues, thus improving patients' quality of life.
28748022	[Primary congenital lymphedema: Milroy disease: the first case observed in the Department of Pediatrics at the University Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou].	Congenital lymphedema is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the child's interstitial spaces. Milroy disease is a rare, hereditary, autosomal dominant condition showing incomplete penetrance. We report the case of a 7-year old little girl with Milroy disease examined for erysipelas on congenital big right leg. A family history of large congenital member existed. Physical examination showed big oedematous right leg painful to palpation, with skin lichenification and erysipelas. Paraclinical assessment objectified cutaneous lymphedema with vascular involvement suggestive of ectasia of the right saphenous vein. Female karyotype showed no abnormalities, despite the small chromosomal rearrangements. Treatment was based on physiotherapy, bandages, compression stockings and psychotherapy. This first case in Burkina Faso testifies to the rarity of the pathology but especially to the diagnostic difficulties related to the inadequacy of paraclinical investigations.
