input_text: 'Newborn screening: what pediatricians should know.OBJECTIVE: To review
  the literature on the current situation of neonatal screening worldwide and in Brazil.
  To define the role of pediatricians in neonatal screening programs. SOURCES: Scientific
  articles selected by means of searches run on the medical websites MEDLINE, Cochrane,
  PubMed (MeSH) and MD Consult, using the keywords newborn screening, neonatal, pediatrics,
  diagnosis, primary care, ethics and their equivalents in Portuguese, in isolation
  and in combination, in addition to medical textbooks on genetics and inborn errors
  of metabolism, published between January 1998 and December 2007, the National Neonatal
  Screening Program technical standards and routines manual, and Ministry of Health
  decree 822/2001. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Published data demonstrate a great diversity
  in the number of diseases included in the neonatal screening programs of different
  countries. In Brazil, the National Neonatal Screening Program was set up in 2001,
  to screen for phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism, sickle-cell anemia and
  cystic fibrosis. Screening for a wider range of conditions using mass spectrometry
  is currently the subject of disagreement and discussion of financial and ethical
  issues. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal screening is one of the most important advances for
  the prevention of pediatric diseases. Nevertheless, implementation is complex, multidisciplinary
  and dependent on public health policies and, to date, there is no consensus on which
  diseases should be included. A large number of scientific and ethical questions
  need to be discussed in order to better define the screening panels to be implemented.
  Pediatricians have important roles to play in all stages of neonatal screening programs.'
