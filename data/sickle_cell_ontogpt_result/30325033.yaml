input_text: 'Red blood cell mechanical sensitivity improves in patients with sickle
  cell disease undergoing chronic transfusion after prolonged, subhemolytic shear
  exposure.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetically inherited hemoglobinopathy
  in which deoxygenated hemoglobin S polymerizes, leading to stiff red blood cells
  (RBCs) and inefficient microcirculatory blood flow. Transfusion therapy acts as
  primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in SCD. Whether blood transfusion
  alters the mechanical sensitivity (MS) of RBCs to prolonged subhemolytic shear stress
  (shear) is unknown. We hypothesized that individuals with SCD undergoing chronic
  blood transfusion would have improved sensitivity to shear, compared with patients
  not undergoing transfusion therapy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood suspensions
  from individuals with SCD not receiving (n = 15) and receiving (n = 15) chronic
  simple transfusion were conditioned to shear (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 Pa) for various
  durations (1, 4, 16, 32, and 64 sec), and then deformability of RBCs was immediately
  measured. Healthy young controls (n = 15) were included for reference. A surface
  mesh was interpolated using the data to determine the effect of blood transfusion
  on MS of RBCs. RESULTS: There was impaired RBC deformability to prolonged supraphysiologic
  shear in both SCD groups; however, MS improved in transfused patients when exposed
  to prolonged physiologic shear. Furthermore, in the transfused patients with SCD,
  the threshold above which subhemolytic damage occurs was similar to controls. CONCLUSION:
  We found that chronic transfusion therapy normalizes the MS threshold above which
  RBC subhemolytic damage occurs after prolonged shear exposure in SCD. An important
  and novel finding in transfused patients with SCD was the improvement in RBC deformability
  in response to prolonged shear exposure over the physiologic range.'
