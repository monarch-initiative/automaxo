Thirty-four GD patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) were analyzed for platelet count, chitotriosidase, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in plasma samples, and quantitative measurement of Lyso-Gb1 was performed in dried blood spots. In our ERT and SRT study cohorts, plasma lyso-GL1 correlated significantly with chito-triosidase (ERT: r = 0.55, p < 0.001; SRT: r = 0.83, p < 0.001) and TRAP (ERT: r = 0.34, p < 0.001; SRT: r = 0.88, p < 0.001), irrespective of treatment method. A platelet count increase was associated with a Lyso-Gb1 decrease in both treatment groups (ERT: p = 0.021; SRT: p = 0.028). The association of Lyso-Gb1 with evaluated markers was stronger in the SRT cohort. Our results indicate that ERT and SRT in combination or in a switch manner could offer the potential of individual drug effectiveness for particular GD symptoms. Combination of the key biomarker of GD, Lyso-Gb1, with other biomarkers can offer improved response assessment to long-term therapy.",

METHODS: Taliglucerase Alfa Surveillance (TALIAS), a multinational prospective Drug Registry of patients with GD, was established to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective) of taliglucerase alfa. We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females) treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January 7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of 567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment, most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Twelve of the 106 patients experienced serious AEs; two patients experienced four treatment-related serious AEs. Four patients died, although none of the deaths was considered to be related to taliglucerase alfa treatment by the treating physicians. Nine patients discontinued from the study, including the four who died. At baseline, patients with prior ERT had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts than treatment-naive patients, likely reflecting the therapeutic effects of prior treatments. During follow-up, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased in the treatment-naive patients and remained relatively constant or increased slightly in patients with prior ERT. Spleen and liver volumes decreased in treatment-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interim data showed no new or emergent safety signals. The overall interim data are consistent with the clinical program experience and known safety and effectiveness profile of taliglucerase alfa.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, in which biallelic pathogenic variants in the Glucosidase beta acid (GBA) gene result in defective functioning of glucosylceramidase that causes deposition of glucocerebroside in cells. GD has 3 major types namely, non-neuronopathic (type I), acute neuronopathic (type II), and chronic neuronopathic (type III). Definite treatment options are limited and expensive. They succumb early to the disease, if untreated. There is paucity of studies from the Indian subcontinent, which elicit the factors resulting in their premature mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care setting of South India to assess the clinical profile, mutation spectrum, and various management strategies (only supportive therapy, enzyme replacement therapy [ERT], substrate reduction therapy [SRT] haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT]), and mortality predictors of patients with GD from 2004 to 2019. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted. In silico predictions were performed for novel variants. RESULTS: There were 60 patients with all types of GD seen over the study period of 15 years. Their median age at diagnosis was 2 years. The median follow-up was for 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-8). The overall mortality rate was 35%; however, it was only 10% in those receiving definite treatment. Mortality was higher (47.5%) by more than 4 folds in those only on supportive therapy. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 6.3 years (IQR = 3.5-10.8) in the definite treatment group and 3.5 years (IQR = 1-5) in those on supportive therapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significant (p value 0.001) mortality difference between these groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found the neuronopathic type (OR = 5) and only supportive therapy (OR = 6.3) to be the independent risk factors for premature mortality. CONCLUSION: GD is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, if left untreated. ERT and SRT are the definitive treatments which increase the survival. In resource-limited settings like India, with higher prevalence of the neuronopathic type, HSCT may be a more suitable definitive treatment option, due to its one-time intervention and cost, assuming similar efficacy to ERT. However, the efficacy and safety of HSCT in GD needs to be established further by substantial patient numbers undergoing it.",

                    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a vast group of more than 50 clinically identified metabolic diseases. They are singly rare, but they affect collectively 1 on 5,000 live births. They result in most of the cases from an enzymatic defect within lysosomes, which causes the subsequent augmentation of unwanted substrates. This accumulation process leads to plenty of clinical signs, determined by the specific substrate and accumulation area. The majority of LSDs present a broad organ and tissue engagement. Brain, connective tissues, viscera and bones are usually afflicted. Among them, brain disease is markedly frequent (two-thirds of LSDs). The most clinically employed approach to treat LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is practiced by administering systemically the missed or defective enzyme. It represents a healthful strategy for 11 LSDs at the moment, but it solves the pathology only in the case of Gaucher disease. This approach, in fact, is not efficacious in the case of LSDs that have an effect on the central nervous system (CNS) due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, ERT suffers from several other weak points, such as low penetration of the exogenously administered enzyme to poorly vascularized areas, the development of immunogenicity and infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and, last but not least, the very high cost and lifelong needed. To ameliorate these weaknesses lot of efforts have been recently spent around the development of innovative nanotechnology-driven ERT strategies. They may boost the power of ERT and minimize adverse reactions by loading enzymes into biodegradable nanomaterials. Enzyme encapsulation into biocompatible liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles, for example, can protect enzymatic activity, eliminating immunologic reactions and premature enzyme degradation. It can also permit a controlled release of the payload, ameliorating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Additionally, the potential to functionalize the surface of the nanocarrier with targeting agents (antibodies or peptides), could promote the passage through biological barriers. In this review we examined the clinically applied ERTs, highlighting limitations that do not allow to completely cure the specific LSD. Later, we critically consider the nanotechnology-based ERT strategies that have beenin-vitroand/orin-vivotested to improve ERT efficacy.",

This study presents a novel approach for the lysosome-specific delivery of the beta-glucosidase (B8CYA8) enzyme by covalently conjugating lysosome-targeting mannose-6-phosphate functionalized glycopolypeptides (M6P-GP). We used a protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate developed through advanced protein engineering and bioconjugation techniques. By conjugating beta-glucosidase to M6P-GP that has a high affinity for the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPR) and lysosomal receptors, we enhance the enzyme's selective intracellular uptake and lysosome-specific localization. To attain maximum activity of the near-native enzyme after delivery, we have designed and synthesized an acetal linkage containing the pH-responsive linker maleimide-acetal-azide (MAA), which will cleave in the lysosomal acidic pH to detach the glycopolypeptide from the protein backbone. We demonstrated the efficient cellular uptake of the protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate and showed targeted lysosome delivery, leading to increased enzymatic activity compared to untreated cells. Our results proved that the approach mainly improves the specificity and efficiency of enzyme delivery, particularly into lysosomes, which may enable new methods for ERT. These findings suggest that protein-glycopolypeptide conjugates could represent a class of bioconjugates to design targeted enzyme therapies, offering a pathway to the effective treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) and potentially other related lysosomal storage disorders.",

Type 1 GD (GD1) is the most prevalent form of GD in Western countries; enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a treatment option for patients with GD1. To understand the economic value of the GD1 ERT velaglucerase alfa, a budget impact model (BIM) was developed from a United States (US) payer perspective. METHODS: We estimated the budget impact of velaglucerase alfa for a 10-million-member US health plan by comparing the annual total costs of therapy between a scenario using current velaglucerase alfa uptake to a projected scenario with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. Total drug costs for both scenarios were estimated as the sum of the product of the number of eligible patients on each treatment and the annual per-patient cost of each medication. Average per-patient costs for ERTs were calculated by adding the yearly drug acquisition, drug administration, and site-of-care markup costs. The budget impact was measured over years 1-3. RESULTS: An estimated 65 patients would receive velaglucerase alfa treatment in year 1, increasing to 90 patients by year 3. Across analyses, cost savings were realized with velaglucerase alfa compared with imiglucerase ($115,909) and taliglucerase alfa ($80,401). An annual total budget savings of $8.67 million could be realized for a hypothetical 10-million-member US health plan with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. The per-member per-month costs decreased by $0.0241 across years 1-3. CONCLUSIONS: BIM results show that increased velaglucerase alfa uptake for GD1 treatment is cost-saving for US health plans.",

METHODS: A prospective follow-up, semi-experimental multi-centre study was conducted in four hospitals to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ERT in GD1 patients. Twenty-five individuals with 266 glucocerebrosidase (GCase) observations in plasma and leukocytes and 14 individuals with 68 Spanish magnetic resonance imaging (S-MRI) observations were enrolled. RESULTS: A two concatenated compartment model with zero-order endogenous production and first-order distribution (CL1  = 3.85 x 10-1 L/d) and elimination (CL2  = 1.25 L/d) allowed GCase observations in plasma and leukocytes to be described, respectively. An exponential time dependency (kT  = 6.14 x 10-1 d-1 ) effect on CL1 was incorporated. The final exposure-efficacy model was a longitudinal logistic regression model with a first-order Markov element. An Emax function (EC50  = 15.73 U/L and Emax  = 2.33) linked steady-state concentrations of GCase in leukocytes to the probability of transition across the different S-MRI stages. CONCLUSION: A population pharmacokinetic model successfully characterized the leukocyte activity-time profiles of GCase following intravenous administration of ERT in GD1 patients together with an exposure-efficacy relationship in bone marrow using Markovian elements. The information obtained from this study could be of high clinical relevance in individualization of ERT in GD1 patients, as this could lead to anticipative decision-making regarding clinical response in bone and optimal dosing strategy.",

Yet, many endure years-long diagnostic odysseys. We report the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify patients with GD from electronic health records. METHODS: We utilized Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset (2007-2019) for feature engineering and algorithm training/testing, based on clinical characteristics of GD. Two algorithms were selected: one based on age of feature occurrence (age-based), and one based on occurrence of features (prevalence-based). Performance was compared with an adaptation of the available clinical diagnostic algorithm for identifying patients with diagnosed GD. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms were compared with diagnosed GD patients. RESULTS: Splenomegaly was the most important predictor for diagnosed GD with both algorithms, followed by geographical location (northeast USA), thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, bone density disorders, and bone pain. Overall, 1204 and 2862 patients, respectively, would need to be assessed with the age- and prevalence-based algorithms, compared with 20,743 with the clinical diagnostic algorithm, to identify 28 patients with diagnosed GD in the integrated dataset. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms had similar clinical manifestations as diagnosed GD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The age-based algorithm identified younger patients, while the prevalence-based identified patients with advanced clinical manifestations. Their combined use better captures GD heterogeneity. The two algorithms were about 10-20-fold more efficient at identifying GD patients than the clinical diagnostic algorithm. Application of these algorithms could shorten diagnostic delay by identifying undiagnosed GD patients.",

Yet, many endure years-long diagnostic odysseys. We report the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify patients with GD from electronic health records. METHODS: We utilized Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset (2007-2019) for feature engineering and algorithm training/testing, based on clinical characteristics of GD. Two algorithms were selected: one based on age of feature occurrence (age-based), and one based on occurrence of features (prevalence-based). Performance was compared with an adaptation of the available clinical diagnostic algorithm for identifying patients with diagnosed GD. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms were compared with diagnosed GD patients. RESULTS: Splenomegaly was the most important predictor for diagnosed GD with both algorithms, followed by geographical location (northeast USA), thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, bone density disorders, and bone pain. Overall, 1204 and 2862 patients, respectively, would need to be assessed with the age- and prevalence-based algorithms, compared with 20,743 with the clinical diagnostic algorithm, to identify 28 patients with diagnosed GD in the integrated dataset. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms had similar clinical manifestations as diagnosed GD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The age-based algorithm identified younger patients, while the prevalence-based identified patients with advanced clinical manifestations. Their combined use better captures GD heterogeneity. The two algorithms were about 10-20-fold more efficient at identifying GD patients than the clinical diagnostic algorithm. Application of these algorithms could shorten diagnostic delay by identifying undiagnosed GD patients.",

We evaluated the \"real-world\" effectiveness of first-line imiglucerase on long-term bone outcomes in Italian patients in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry. METHODS: Patients treated with imiglucerase for >=2 years and with bone assessments at baseline and during follow-up were selected. Data on bone pain, bone crises, marrow infiltration, avascular necrosis, infarction, lytic lesions, Erlenmeyer flask deformity, bone fractures, mineral density, and imiglucerase dosage were evaluated. RESULTS: Data on bone manifestations were available for 73 of 229 patients (31.9 %). Bone crises frequency decreased significantly from baseline to the most recent follow-up (p < 0.001), with some improvement observed in bone pain prevalence. Bone pain and bone crises prevalence decreased significantly from baseline at 2 to <4 and 4 to <6 years (all p < 0.05). A low median (25th, 75th percentile) baseline imiglucerase dosage was identified in patients reporting bone pain or bone crises (15.0 [13.7, 30.0] and 22.8 [17.5, 36.0] U/kg once every 2 weeks, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the management of GD in Italy, with regards to imiglucerase dosage, is suboptimal and confirms the need for clinicians to monitor and correctly treat bone disease according to best practice guidelines.",

Type 1 GD (GD1) is the most prevalent form of GD in Western countries; enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a treatment option for patients with GD1. To understand the economic value of the GD1 ERT velaglucerase alfa, a budget impact model (BIM) was developed from a United States (US) payer perspective. METHODS: We estimated the budget impact of velaglucerase alfa for a 10-million-member US health plan by comparing the annual total costs of therapy between a scenario using current velaglucerase alfa uptake to a projected scenario with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. Total drug costs for both scenarios were estimated as the sum of the product of the number of eligible patients on each treatment and the annual per-patient cost of each medication. Average per-patient costs for ERTs were calculated by adding the yearly drug acquisition, drug administration, and site-of-care markup costs. The budget impact was measured over years 1-3. RESULTS: An estimated 65 patients would receive velaglucerase alfa treatment in year 1, increasing to 90 patients by year 3. Across analyses, cost savings were realized with velaglucerase alfa compared with imiglucerase ($115,909) and taliglucerase alfa ($80,401). An annual total budget savings of $8.67 million could be realized for a hypothetical 10-million-member US health plan with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. The per-member per-month costs decreased by $0.0241 across years 1-3. CONCLUSIONS: BIM results show that increased velaglucerase alfa uptake for GD1 treatment is cost-saving for US health plans.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic-uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) is a severe illness predominantly affecting young children, with limited treatment options beyond supportive care. Eliglustat, approved for Gaucher disease, shows potential in reducing Shiga toxin binding to target glomerular endothelial cells in vitro, prompting interest as a treatment for STEC-HUS. However, it remains unknown what dose is likely to be effective and safe for treatment of STEC-HUS in the pediatric population. We hypothesize that effective and safe levels of eliglustat can be reached in children. METHODS: We identified pharmacokinetic targets of efficacy for treatment and prophylaxis of STEC-HUS based on a preclinical model and human cardiac safety data. Then, we developed oral and intravenous dosing regimens using population pharmacokinetic (popPK) simulations based on an existing model enriched to allow extrapolation to a simulated virtual pediatric population. These dosing regimens were then confirmed using a verified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. RESULTS: We simulated, using popPK data, oral and intravenous dosing regimens resulting in adequate target exposure in > 90% of all patients, with minimal expected risk for cardiotoxicity. Confirmation of these dosing regimens with PBPK modeling resulted in very similar exposure, with lower interindividual variability and minimal toxicity potential. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, we developed oral and intravenous eliglustat dosing regimens that are likely safe and effective for treatment of STEC-HUS and prophylaxis in case of outbreaks of STEC infections. Clinical evaluation of these dosing regimens in children suspected of or diagnosed with STEC-HUS is required and should include assessment of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety (e.g., ECG monitoring).",

Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb1. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations of CHITO and lyso-Gb1; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing lyso-Gb1 levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role of lyso-Gb1 as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for these patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by a lack of sufficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme known as glucocerebrosidase, which leads to an accumulation of glucocerebroside, a fatty substance, in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and rarely, the lungs or central nervous system. While there are several treatments available for people with Type 1 Gaucher disease and the visceral aspects of Type 3 Gaucher disease, no cure is present for any type of Gaucher disease. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate the safety and efficacy of gene therapy in Gaucher disease, which has the potential to become a new type of (curative) treatment in the future. Gene therapy is a relatively new therapeutic approach, and with the desire to keep the community informed about new treatment developments, the International Gaucher Alliance (IGA) set-up a Gaucher disease specific survey to gauge current perceptions. The survey aimed to benchmark understanding of, and the educational needs surrounding, gene therapy among the Gaucher disease community. BODY: An international, online survey was developed, comprising twelve questions ranging from multiple choice, Likert scale, single tick-box, ranking and open questions. The survey was developed following three patient and caregiver focus groups and underwent review from members of the IGA for readability and accuracy before going live to respondents. The survey was available for two months and shared to audiences via specific Gaucher community channels. CONCLUSION: Over 100 patients and parents/caregivers from the Gaucher disease community completed the survey, including people living with Type 1 Gaucher disease (52.88%), people living with Type 3 Gaucher disease (3.85%), parents/caregivers of people living with Type 1, 2 or 3 Gaucher disease (39.42%), and other (3.85%) who were defined as parents of multiple people with Gaucher disease. The survey uncovered various commonalities in perception of gene therapy among all groups, with large knowledge gaps identified on the mode of action, the usefulness of gene therapy and overall understanding of the therapeutic area. This survey provides an overview of the type of information that could be valuable to the Gaucher disease community when developing educational materials.",

Yet, many endure years-long diagnostic odysseys. We report the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify patients with GD from electronic health records. METHODS: We utilized Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset (2007-2019) for feature engineering and algorithm training/testing, based on clinical characteristics of GD. Two algorithms were selected: one based on age of feature occurrence (age-based), and one based on occurrence of features (prevalence-based). Performance was compared with an adaptation of the available clinical diagnostic algorithm for identifying patients with diagnosed GD. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms were compared with diagnosed GD patients. RESULTS: Splenomegaly was the most important predictor for diagnosed GD with both algorithms, followed by geographical location (northeast USA), thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, bone density disorders, and bone pain. Overall, 1204 and 2862 patients, respectively, would need to be assessed with the age- and prevalence-based algorithms, compared with 20,743 with the clinical diagnostic algorithm, to identify 28 patients with diagnosed GD in the integrated dataset. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms had similar clinical manifestations as diagnosed GD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The age-based algorithm identified younger patients, while the prevalence-based identified patients with advanced clinical manifestations. Their combined use better captures GD heterogeneity. The two algorithms were about 10-20-fold more efficient at identifying GD patients than the clinical diagnostic algorithm. Application of these algorithms could shorten diagnostic delay by identifying undiagnosed GD patients.",

METHODS: Based on the National Health System data, a retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed (polymerase chain reactionpositive) COVID-19 infection (n = 149 618) was investigated. The adverse outcomes between patients with GD (n = 39) and those without GD (n = 149 579) were compared with crude and propensity score-matched (PSM) groups. The outcomes were hospitalisation, the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: The patients with GD were significantly older and had a higher frequency of hypertension (HT), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidaemia, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure and cancer. Although hospitalisation rates in Gaucher patients were found to be higher in crude analyses, the PSM models (model 1, age and gender matched; model 2, matched for age, gender, HT, T2DM and cancer) revealed no difference for the outcomes between patients with GD and the general population.

Although hospitalisation rates in Gaucher patients were found to be higher in crude analyses, the PSM models (model 1, age and gender matched; model 2, matched for age, gender, HT, T2DM and cancer) revealed no difference for the outcomes between patients with GD and the general population. According to multivariate regression analyses, having a diagnosis of GD was not a significant predictor for hospitalisation (P = 0.241), ICU admission/mechanical ventilation (P = 0.403) or mortality (P = 0.231).

                    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a vast group of more than 50 clinically identified metabolic diseases. They are singly rare, but they affect collectively 1 on 5,000 live births. They result in most of the cases from an enzymatic defect within lysosomes, which causes the subsequent augmentation of unwanted substrates. This accumulation process leads to plenty of clinical signs, determined by the specific substrate and accumulation area. The majority of LSDs present a broad organ and tissue engagement. Brain, connective tissues, viscera and bones are usually afflicted. Among them, brain disease is markedly frequent (two-thirds of LSDs). The most clinically employed approach to treat LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is practiced by administering systemically the missed or defective enzyme. It represents a healthful strategy for 11 LSDs at the moment, but it solves the pathology only in the case of Gaucher disease. This approach, in fact, is not efficacious in the case of LSDs that have an effect on the central nervous system (CNS) due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, ERT suffers from several other weak points, such as low penetration of the exogenously administered enzyme to poorly vascularized areas, the development of immunogenicity and infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and, last but not least, the very high cost and lifelong needed. To ameliorate these weaknesses lot of efforts have been recently spent around the development of innovative nanotechnology-driven ERT strategies. They may boost the power of ERT and minimize adverse reactions by loading enzymes into biodegradable nanomaterials. Enzyme encapsulation into biocompatible liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles, for example, can protect enzymatic activity, eliminating immunologic reactions and premature enzyme degradation. It can also permit a controlled release of the payload, ameliorating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Additionally, the potential to functionalize the surface of the nanocarrier with targeting agents (antibodies or peptides), could promote the passage through biological barriers. In this review we examined the clinically applied ERTs, highlighting limitations that do not allow to completely cure the specific LSD. Later, we critically consider the nanotechnology-based ERT strategies that have beenin-vitroand/orin-vivotested to improve ERT efficacy.",

Liver fibrosis is a long-term complication of GD, potentially leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently no validated clinical tools for the monitoring of liver fibrosis in patients with GD. In this study, we aim at assessing the validity of common fibrosis-predicting scores, developed for other diseases, for the use in GD, using transient elastography as a gold-standard, as well as developing the first GD-specific liver fibrosis predicting score. We enrolled 19 adult patients with GD who had been on treatment for a minimum of 1 year on enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy and who had no evidence of any other liver disease except GD or metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is a common comorbidity of GD. We analyzed the correlation between liver stiffness and genotype, treatment modality (imiglucerase or other therapies), clinical severity, and clinical laboratory tests. We found that the common liver fibrosis scores APRI, FIB-4, and NFS did not accurately predict liver fibrosis in people with GD. We also found that male sex, the DS3 score, AST, and GGT levels significantly correlated with liver stiffness, and used these to create a simple but accurate fibrosis-predicting score specifically for GD (the \"Gaucher liver fibrosis score\", or GLFS), with high accuracy (AUC = 0.8571, p = 0.0206). We believe that our new GLFS may be used in clinical practice to help prioritize GD patients for closer monitoring of liver fibrosis.",

Velaglucerasa alfa is a recombinant glucocerebrosidase used for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of GD. Due to its limited stability and bioavailability, the use of nanosized systems carrying Velaglucerase alfa is proposed as a novel strategy to improve ERT for GD. Highly stable and low-dispersed Velaglucerase-loaded Eudragit nanoparticles (NPs) (NPs: Vela); 150-160 nm mean size, polydispersity index <0. 15, zeta potential around -32 mV, and 95 % Velaglucerase alfa encapsulation efficiency were obtained. Crystallographic structural analysis by Small Angle X-ray Scattering, confirmed that Velaglucerase alfa was incorporated into the nanoparticle matrix. In vitro studies revealed that NPs: Vela preferentially interact with immunoglobulins and fibrinogen, and a positive enzyme release from NPs:Vela was observed at acidic pH; while no release was observed in neutral conditions. A positive internalization of NPs:Vela in GD mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) was also verified, increasing enzyme cellular activity compared to non-treated cells. Confocal microscopy verified that NPs:Vela colocalized with lysosomes, but no effect of NPs: Vela in the mineralization of MSC was observed. Finally, the viability of GD cell lines is not affected by NPs: Vela, in comparison with Velaglucerase alone, that negatively affects the viability of the target cells. This nanocarrier system for Velaglucerase alfa delivery in lysosomes, initially proposed to improve ERT for GD, may also serve as a starting point to address pathophysiological mechanisms in GD and other lysosomal disorders.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene therapy is currently in development for several monogenetic diseases including lysosomal storage disorders. Limited evidence is available on patient preferences for gene therapy in this population. In this study, we compare gene therapy-related risk tolerance between people affected by three lysosomal storage diseases currently faced with different therapeutic options and prognoses. METHODS: A survey including the probabilistic threshold technique was developed in which respondents were asked to choose between gene therapy and the current standard of care. The attributes included to establish participants' risk tolerance were previously identified in focus groups of affected people or their representatives, namely: risk of mild side effects, severe side effects, the need for additional medication, and the likelihood of long-term effectiveness. The survey was distributed among people receiving outpatient care for type 1 Gaucher disease (good prognosis with current treatment options), Fabry disease (varying prognosis with current treatment options, XY-genotype on average more severely affected than XX), and parents representing people with severe forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B (poor prognosis, no disease-specific therapy available). RESULTS: A total of 85 surveys were completed (15 Gaucher disease respondents, 62 Fabry disease respondents (17 self-identifying male), eight parents of ten people with mucopolysaccharidosis type III). Disease groups with higher disease severity trended towards higher risk tolerance: Gaucher disease respondents were most cautious and predominantly preferred the current standard of care as opposed to MPS III representatives who were more risk tolerant. Respondents with Fabry disease were most heterogeneous in their risk tolerance, with male participants being more risk tolerant than female participants. Long-term effectiveness was the attribute in which respondents tolerated the least risk. CONCLUSIONS: People affected by a lysosomal storage disease associated with a poorer prognosis and less effective current treatment options trended towards more risk tolerance when choosing between gene therapy and the current standard of care. This study shows the importance of involvement of patient preferences before and during the development process of new treatment modalities such as gene therapy for rare diseases, to ensure that innovative therapies align with the wishes and needs of people affected by these diseases.",

                    "abstract": "Lysosomal enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) holds potential for treating lysosomal storage disorders, but achieving targeted delivery of deficient therapeutic enzymes remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel approach for the lysosome-specific delivery of the beta-glucosidase (B8CYA8) enzyme by covalently conjugating lysosome-targeting mannose-6-phosphate functionalized glycopolypeptides (M6P-GP). We used a protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate developed through advanced protein engineering and bioconjugation techniques. By conjugating beta-glucosidase to M6P-GP that has a high affinity for the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPR) and lysosomal receptors, we enhance the enzyme's selective intracellular uptake and lysosome-specific localization. To attain maximum activity of the near-native enzyme after delivery, we have designed and synthesized an acetal linkage containing the pH-responsive linker maleimide-acetal-azide (MAA), which will cleave in the lysosomal acidic pH to detach the glycopolypeptide from the protein backbone. We demonstrated the efficient cellular uptake of the protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate and showed targeted lysosome delivery, leading to increased enzymatic activity compared to untreated cells. Our results proved that the approach mainly improves the specificity and efficiency of enzyme delivery, particularly into lysosomes, which may enable new methods for ERT. These findings suggest that protein-glycopolypeptide conjugates could represent a class of bioconjugates to design targeted enzyme therapies, offering a pathway to the effective treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) and potentially other related lysosomal storage disorders.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of Gaucher disease (GD) allows for disease-specific treatment before significant symptoms arise, preventing/delaying onset of complications. Yet, many endure years-long diagnostic odysseys. We report the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify patients with GD from electronic health records. METHODS: We utilized Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset (2007-2019) for feature engineering and algorithm training/testing, based on clinical characteristics of GD. Two algorithms were selected: one based on age of feature occurrence (age-based), and one based on occurrence of features (prevalence-based). Performance was compared with an adaptation of the available clinical diagnostic algorithm for identifying patients with diagnosed GD. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms were compared with diagnosed GD patients. RESULTS: Splenomegaly was the most important predictor for diagnosed GD with both algorithms, followed by geographical location (northeast USA), thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, bone density disorders, and bone pain. Overall, 1204 and 2862 patients, respectively, would need to be assessed with the age- and prevalence-based algorithms, compared with 20,743 with the clinical diagnostic algorithm, to identify 28 patients with diagnosed GD in the integrated dataset. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms had similar clinical manifestations as diagnosed GD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The age-based algorithm identified younger patients, while the prevalence-based identified patients with advanced clinical manifestations. Their combined use better captures GD heterogeneity. The two algorithms were about 10-20-fold more efficient at identifying GD patients than the clinical diagnostic algorithm. Application of these algorithms could shorten diagnostic delay by identifying undiagnosed GD patients.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders are rare diseases caused by the accumulation of substrates of the metabolic pathway within lysosomes and peroxisomes, respectively. Owing to the rarity of these diseases, the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide survey to estimate the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. METHODS: A nationwide survey was conducted following the \"Manual of nationwide epidemiological survey for understanding patient number and clinical epidemiology of rare diseases (3rd version)\". A questionnaire asking for detailed information, such as disease phenotypes and medical history, was created and sent to 504 institutions with doctors who have experience in treating patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders. Result A total of 303 completed questionnaires were collected from 504 institutions (response rate: 60.1%). The number of patients was estimated by calculating the rate/frequency of overlap. The estimated number of patients was 1658 (+-264.8) for Fabry disease, 72 (+-11.3) for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 275 (+-49.9) for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 211 (+-31.3) for Gaucher disease, 124 (+-25.8) for Pompe disease, 83 (+-44.3) for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 57 (+-9.4) for Niemann-Pick type C, and 262 (+-42.3) for adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition the birth prevalence was calculated using the estimated number of patients and birth year data for each disease, and was 1.25 for Fabry disease, 0.09 for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 0.38 for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 0.19 for Gaucher disease, 0.14 for Pompe disease, 0.16 for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 0.16 for Niemann-Pick type C, and 0.20 for adrenoleukodystrophy. DISCUSSION: Among the diseases analyzed, the disease with the highest prevalence was Fabry disease, followed by mucopolysaccharidosis II, adrenoleukodystrophy, Gaucher disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. In particular, the high prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis II and Gaucher disease type II was a feature characteristic of Japan. CONCLUSION: We estimated the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. The details of the age at diagnosis and treatment methods for each disease were clarified, and will be useful for the early diagnosis of these patients and to provide appropriate treatments. Furthermore, our results suggest that supportive care and the development of an environment that can provide optimal medical care is important in the future.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase which leads to an accumulation of glucosylceramide in the macrophages. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia) and bone disorders are the main symptoms. The diagnosis is often delayed, leading to unnecessary investigations and treatments, and delaying the specific treatment. The primary objective of our study was to establish, in patients who had a diagnostic delay of more than one year, the reported misdiagnoses before the final diagnosis. The secondary objectives were to investigate the risk factors associated with error and delayed diagnosis. METHODS: Retrospective study including patients with Gaucher disease from the French Gaucher Disease Registry. Collection of data by a single investigator from a standardized form. RESULTS: Among 83 patients with a known diagnostic delay, 13 patients (15 %) had one or two misdiagnoses. These included osteo-articular diagnoses (osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, arthritis, osteochondritis, rheumatic fever, n=8), haematological diagnoses (gestational thrombocytopenia, immunological thrombocytopenia, n=4), infectious diagnoses (visceral leishmaniasis, mononucleosis, n=2) and hemochromatosis. The osteo-articular and infectious diagnoses concerned the child and the adolescent while the haematological diagnoses and the hemochromatosis concerned the adult. No factors were found associated with misdiagnoses. Patients with a diagnostic delay greater than one year were less likely to have hepatosplenomegaly as the first symptom. CONCLUSION: There is a risk of diagnostic error related to phenotypic heterogeneity and lack of specificity of Gaucher disease symptoms. This study helps to better identify the misdiagnoses associated with Gaucher disease.",

This disorder exhibits an earlier onset, a more severe course, and a higher dementia prevalence compared to idiopathic PD. While the pathogenesis remains debated between loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms, targeted therapies are emerging. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs), like high-dose Ambroxol, aim to mitigate enzyme misfolding-a primary driver of this disorder-rather than addressing metabolic deficiencies seen in Gaucher disease. Despite failed trials of substrate reduction therapies, current clinical trials with Ambroxol and other PCs highlight promising avenues for disease modification. This commentary advocates for increased awareness of Sidransky syndrome to advance diagnostic strategies, promote genetic testing, and refine targeted treatments, with the potential to transform care for GBA1-related PD and prodromal stages of the disease.",

Published clinical trials (CT) and LDS treatment guidelines were reviewed to select efficacy variables. Data to measure them (and adverse effects) were obtained from the medical history. RESULTS: No CTs have been found in which efficacy is evaluated with final variables, all have been surrogated. Twenty-two patients were included: eight with Gaucher disease, six with Niemann-PickC disease, two with Hunter disease, one with Morquio-A disease, and five with Pompe disease. Eight patients have responded to ERT and one to SRT with eliglustat. ERT has not been associated with adverse effects. Miglustat has produced tolerance problems, requiring a change in a patient. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness was variable according to the pathology. Regarding safety, manageable adverse reactions to SRT were associated with dosage adjustments.",

METHODS: A prospective follow-up, semi-experimental multi-centre study was conducted in four hospitals to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ERT in GD1 patients. Twenty-five individuals with 266 glucocerebrosidase (GCase) observations in plasma and leukocytes and 14 individuals with 68 Spanish magnetic resonance imaging (S-MRI) observations were enrolled. RESULTS: A two concatenated compartment model with zero-order endogenous production and first-order distribution (CL1  = 3.85 x 10-1 L/d) and elimination (CL2  = 1.25 L/d) allowed GCase observations in plasma and leukocytes to be described, respectively. An exponential time dependency (kT  = 6.14 x 10-1 d-1 ) effect on CL1 was incorporated. The final exposure-efficacy model was a longitudinal logistic regression model with a first-order Markov element. An Emax function (EC50  = 15.73 U/L and Emax  = 2.33) linked steady-state concentrations of GCase in leukocytes to the probability of transition across the different S-MRI stages. CONCLUSION: A population pharmacokinetic model successfully characterized the leukocyte activity-time profiles of GCase following intravenous administration of ERT in GD1 patients together with an exposure-efficacy relationship in bone marrow using Markovian elements. The information obtained from this study could be of high clinical relevance in individualization of ERT in GD1 patients, as this could lead to anticipative decision-making regarding clinical response in bone and optimal dosing strategy.",

The condition is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, hematological abnormalities, and bone disease in both non-neuronopathic type 1 (GD1) and neuronopathic type 3 (GD3). Interestingly, GBA1 variants were found to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) in GD1 patients. We performed a comprehensive study regarding the two most disease-specific biomarkers, glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb1) and alpha-synuclein for GD and PD, respectively. A total of 65 patients with GD treated with ERT (47 GD1 patients and 18 GD3 patients), 19 GBA1 pathogenic variant carriers (including 10 L444P carriers), and 16 healthy subjects were involved in the study. Lyso-Gb1 was assessed by dried blood spot testing. The level of alpha-synuclein as an mRNA transcript, total, and oligomer protein concentration were measured with real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. alpha-synuclein mRNA level was found significantly elevated in GD3 patients and L444P carriers. GD1 patients, along with GBA1 carriers of an unknown or unconfirmed variant, as well as healthy controls, have the same low level of alpha-synuclein mRNA. There was no correlation found between the level of alpha-synuclein mRNA and age in GD patients treated with ERT, whereas there was a positive correlation in L444P carriers.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive condition. Type 1 GD (GD1) is the most prevalent form of GD in Western countries; enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a treatment option for patients with GD1. To understand the economic value of the GD1 ERT velaglucerase alfa, a budget impact model (BIM) was developed from a United States (US) payer perspective. METHODS: We estimated the budget impact of velaglucerase alfa for a 10-million-member US health plan by comparing the annual total costs of therapy between a scenario using current velaglucerase alfa uptake to a projected scenario with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. Total drug costs for both scenarios were estimated as the sum of the product of the number of eligible patients on each treatment and the annual per-patient cost of each medication. Average per-patient costs for ERTs were calculated by adding the yearly drug acquisition, drug administration, and site-of-care markup costs. The budget impact was measured over years 1-3. RESULTS: An estimated 65 patients would receive velaglucerase alfa treatment in year 1, increasing to 90 patients by year 3. Across analyses, cost savings were realized with velaglucerase alfa compared with imiglucerase ($115,909) and taliglucerase alfa ($80,401). An annual total budget savings of $8.67 million could be realized for a hypothetical 10-million-member US health plan with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. The per-member per-month costs decreased by $0.0241 across years 1-3. CONCLUSIONS: BIM results show that increased velaglucerase alfa uptake for GD1 treatment is cost-saving for US health plans.",

We perform a structural analysis of variants within three inherited lysosomal storage disorders, comparing variants responsive to pharmacological chaperone treatment to those unresponsive to such treatment. We find that predicted DeltaDeltaG of mutation is higher on average for variants unresponsive to treatment, in the case of datasets for both Fabry disease and Pompe disease, in line with previous findings. Using both a single decision tree and an advanced machine learning approach based on the larger Fabry dataset, we correctly predict responsiveness of three Gaucher disease variants, and we provide predictions for untested variants. Many variants are predicted to be responsive to treatment, suggesting that drug-based treatments may be effective for a number of variants in Gaucher disease. In our analysis, we observe dependence on a topological feature reporting on contact arrangements which is likely connected to the order of folding of protein residues, and we provide a potential justification for this observation based on steady-state cellular kinetics.",

                    "title": "Challenges in Gaucher disease: Perspectives from an expert panel.",
                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

This study evaluates bone health in adult GD type 1 patients, focusing on skeletal complications, bone mineral density (BMD), and biochemical markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of adult GD type 1 patients followed up at Ege University Pediatric Metabolism Department were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: This study included 32 patients with GD type 1, comprising 11 males (34.4%) and 21 females (65.6%). The median age at diagnosis was 20.5 years (min: 3-max:65), and at enrolment, it was 35 years (min:18-max:71). Most patients (93.8%) had organomegaly, and 93.8% had cytopenia. Common genetic variants were p.Asn409Ser (60.9%), p.Leu483Pro (7.8%), and p.Asp448His(4.7%). All patients were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for a median of 11 years (min:2-max:18). Bone complications included pathologic fractures in six patients (19%) and avascular necrosis in 12 patients (37.5%). Bone pain was reported by 93.7% of patients at admission and persisted in 59.4% during follow-up. DXA scans showed abnormal bone mineral density (BMD) in 62.5% of patients initially, with a significantly low bone density in 3.1% and reduced bone density in 59.3%. BMD improved with treatment, as evidenced by a significant increase in Z scores (p < 0.05). Elevated chitotriosidase (75%), ferritin (50%), and immunoglobulin G (21.9%) levels were noted but did not correlate with BMD. Seven patients (22%) were splenectomized, all with bone issues. DISCUSSION: Bone health in GD involves multiple factors beyond biochemical markers. While ERT improves BMD, bone pain and fractures remain significant issues. Comprehensive management, including regular BMD monitoring and better vitamin D supplementation adherence, is crucial. Further research is needed to improve treatments for bone complications in GD.",

Owing to the rarity of these diseases, the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide survey to estimate the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. METHODS: A nationwide survey was conducted following the \"Manual of nationwide epidemiological survey for understanding patient number and clinical epidemiology of rare diseases (3rd version)\". A questionnaire asking for detailed information, such as disease phenotypes and medical history, was created and sent to 504 institutions with doctors who have experience in treating patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders. Result A total of 303 completed questionnaires were collected from 504 institutions (response rate: 60.1%). The number of patients was estimated by calculating the rate/frequency of overlap. The estimated number of patients was 1658 (+-264.8) for Fabry disease, 72 (+-11.3) for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 275 (+-49.9) for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 211 (+-31.3) for Gaucher disease, 124 (+-25.8) for Pompe disease, 83 (+-44.3) for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 57 (+-9.4) for Niemann-Pick type C, and 262 (+-42.3) for adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition the birth prevalence was calculated using the estimated number of patients and birth year data for each disease, and was 1.25 for Fabry disease, 0.09 for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 0.38 for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 0.19 for Gaucher disease, 0.14 for Pompe disease, 0.16 for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 0.16 for Niemann-Pick type C, and 0.20 for adrenoleukodystrophy. DISCUSSION: Among the diseases analyzed, the disease with the highest prevalence was Fabry disease, followed by mucopolysaccharidosis II, adrenoleukodystrophy, Gaucher disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. In particular, the high prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis II and Gaucher disease type II was a feature characteristic of Japan. CONCLUSION: We estimated the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. The details of the age at diagnosis and treatment methods for each disease were clarified, and will be useful for the early diagnosis of these patients and to provide appropriate treatments. Furthermore, our results suggest that supportive care and the development of an environment that can provide optimal medical care is important in the future.",

Eliglustat, approved for Gaucher disease, shows potential in reducing Shiga toxin binding to target glomerular endothelial cells in vitro, prompting interest as a treatment for STEC-HUS. However, it remains unknown what dose is likely to be effective and safe for treatment of STEC-HUS in the pediatric population. We hypothesize that effective and safe levels of eliglustat can be reached in children. METHODS: We identified pharmacokinetic targets of efficacy for treatment and prophylaxis of STEC-HUS based on a preclinical model and human cardiac safety data. Then, we developed oral and intravenous dosing regimens using population pharmacokinetic (popPK) simulations based on an existing model enriched to allow extrapolation to a simulated virtual pediatric population. These dosing regimens were then confirmed using a verified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. RESULTS: We simulated, using popPK data, oral and intravenous dosing regimens resulting in adequate target exposure in > 90% of all patients, with minimal expected risk for cardiotoxicity. Confirmation of these dosing regimens with PBPK modeling resulted in very similar exposure, with lower interindividual variability and minimal toxicity potential. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, we developed oral and intravenous eliglustat dosing regimens that are likely safe and effective for treatment of STEC-HUS and prophylaxis in case of outbreaks of STEC infections. Clinical evaluation of these dosing regimens in children suspected of or diagnosed with STEC-HUS is required and should include assessment of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety (e.g., ECG monitoring).",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has revolutionised the management of patients with Gaucher disease (GD). In 2018, we published the safety and efficacy of rapid 10-min infusion of velaglucerase alfa in previously treated patients, mostly on low-dose therapy. AIM: To improve quality of life (QoL) for patients needing lifelong bi-weekly infusions by introducing a 10-min infusion instead of 1 h per label in patients naive to ERT and on high-dose therapy. METHODS: Fifteen naive patients were enrolled; all received bi-weekly infusions of 60 units/kgBW velaglucerase alfa; the infusion rate was gradually reduced in the hospital, followed by home infusions. Each infusion was followed for safety. Efficacy parameters were assessed every 3 months. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires were collected at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Ten-minute rapid infusions were well tolerated without related severe adverse events (SAEs). Two patients experienced a non-related SAE and another a possibly related AE. In three patients, the infusion rate was increased to 30 or 60 min (two because of suboptimal response and one because of AE). Two patients dropped out because of an unwillingness to attend follow-up visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 13 remaining patients reached the 24-month end-point. The platelet counts increased by a median (range) of 68.38% (12.5-300%) and the lyso-Gb1 levels decreased by 62.6% (32.9-89.9%). CONCLUSION: Home therapy with rapid infusion of high-dose velaglucerase alfa was a safe, effective and preferable alternative for patients with GD naive to treatment. We believe that shortening the infusion time improves the QoL of patients with GD who have a lifelong commitment to intravenous therapy.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare disorder linked to the absence/deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. GD can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). The aim of this systematic review (SR) is to assess the effectiveness of drugs used for GD treatment. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in April 2021. The search strategies encompassed the name of the disease and of the drug treatments. Manual search was also conducted. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Observational and interventional longitudinal studies evaluating ERT and SRT for GD were included. Single mean meta-analyses were conducted for each drug using R. DATA SYNTHESIS: The initial search retrieved 2246 articles after duplicates were removed. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 68 reports were included. The studies evaluated imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, taliglucerase alfa, miglustat, and eliglustat. The results showed that ERT is effective as a treatment in both naive and experienced patients. Miglustat did not significantly improve blood outcomes in naive patients and resulted in a decrease in the platelet levels of experienced patients. Eliglustat was mainly assessed for experienced patients and resulted in stable outcome values. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This extensive SR confirms the effectiveness of GD treatments in short- and long-term follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: The results were favorable for all ERTs and for eliglustat. Based on the assessed evidence, miglustat did not achieved expressive results. However, all evidence should be interpreted considering its limitations and does not replace well-conducted randomized trials.",

                    "title": "Challenges in Gaucher disease: Perspectives from an expert panel.",
                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

Of interest, we reported an absence of statistical difference in terms of response regarding glucosylsphingosine reduction in relation to naive or prior exposure to ERT (P = 0.296), which was confirmed also when patients were placed in naive and treated groups for <5 vs >5 years (P = 0.667).

The condition is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, hematological abnormalities, and bone disease in both non-neuronopathic type 1 (GD1) and neuronopathic type 3 (GD3). Interestingly, GBA1 variants were found to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) in GD1 patients. We performed a comprehensive study regarding the two most disease-specific biomarkers, glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb1) and alpha-synuclein for GD and PD, respectively. A total of 65 patients with GD treated with ERT (47 GD1 patients and 18 GD3 patients), 19 GBA1 pathogenic variant carriers (including 10 L444P carriers), and 16 healthy subjects were involved in the study. Lyso-Gb1 was assessed by dried blood spot testing. The level of alpha-synuclein as an mRNA transcript, total, and oligomer protein concentration were measured with real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. alpha-synuclein mRNA level was found significantly elevated in GD3 patients and L444P carriers. GD1 patients, along with GBA1 carriers of an unknown or unconfirmed variant, as well as healthy controls, have the same low level of alpha-synuclein mRNA.

Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is successfully applied using mannose-exposed conjugated glucocerebrosidase, the lower stability of the enzyme in blood demands periodic intravenous administration that adds to the high cost of treatment. In this work, the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase was encapsulated inside virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) from brome mosaic virus (BMV), and their surface was functionalized with mannose groups for targeting to macrophages. The VLP nanoreactors showed significant GCase catalytic activity. Moreover, the Michaelis-Menten constants for the free GCase enzyme (KM =0.29 mM) and the functionalized nanoreactors (KM =0.32 mM) were similar even after chemical modification. Importantly, the stability of enzymes under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37  C) was enhanced by  11-fold after encapsulation; this is beneficial for obtaining a higher blood circulation half-life, which may decrease the cost of therapy by reducing the requirement of multiple intravenous injections. Finally, the mannose receptor targeted enzymatic nanoreactors showed enhanced internalization into macrophage cells. Thus, the catalytic activity and cell targeting suggest the potential of these nanoreactors in ERT of Gaucher's disease.",

                    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a vast group of more than 50 clinically identified metabolic diseases. They are singly rare, but they affect collectively 1 on 5,000 live births. They result in most of the cases from an enzymatic defect within lysosomes, which causes the subsequent augmentation of unwanted substrates. This accumulation process leads to plenty of clinical signs, determined by the specific substrate and accumulation area. The majority of LSDs present a broad organ and tissue engagement. Brain, connective tissues, viscera and bones are usually afflicted. Among them, brain disease is markedly frequent (two-thirds of LSDs). The most clinically employed approach to treat LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is practiced by administering systemically the missed or defective enzyme. It represents a healthful strategy for 11 LSDs at the moment, but it solves the pathology only in the case of Gaucher disease. This approach, in fact, is not efficacious in the case of LSDs that have an effect on the central nervous system (CNS) due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, ERT suffers from several other weak points, such as low penetration of the exogenously administered enzyme to poorly vascularized areas, the development of immunogenicity and infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and, last but not least, the very high cost and lifelong needed. To ameliorate these weaknesses lot of efforts have been recently spent around the development of innovative nanotechnology-driven ERT strategies. They may boost the power of ERT and minimize adverse reactions by loading enzymes into biodegradable nanomaterials. Enzyme encapsulation into biocompatible liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles, for example, can protect enzymatic activity, eliminating immunologic reactions and premature enzyme degradation. It can also permit a controlled release of the payload, ameliorating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Additionally, the potential to functionalize the surface of the nanocarrier with targeting agents (antibodies or peptides), could promote the passage through biological barriers. In this review we examined the clinically applied ERTs, highlighting limitations that do not allow to completely cure the specific LSD. Later, we critically consider the nanotechnology-based ERT strategies that have beenin-vitroand/orin-vivotested to improve ERT efficacy.",

Enzyme replacement therapy alleviates visceral signs and symptoms but has no effect on neurological features. Ambroxol has been suggested as an enzyme enhancement agent. Some studies have confirmed its effectiveness in preventing the progression of neurological manifestations of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. In this study, we report two GD3 siblings in whom ambroxol combined with enzyme replacement therapy was initiated at different stages of the disease. We demonstrate the enzyme enhancement effect of ambroxol on L444P/H225Q;D409H glucocerebrosidase activity through results of fibroblast studies and long-term clinical outcomes of the two patients. The sibling diagnosed at the age of four-and-a-half years with significant neurological involvement manifested relatively rapid improvement on ambroxol treatment, followed by stabilization of further course. The younger sibling, in whom the treatment was started at seven weeks, displayed attention deficit and low average cognitive functioning at the age of seven years, but did not manifest other neurological symptoms. The difference in neurological outcomes indicates that ambroxol delayed or even halted the evolution of neurological manifestations in the younger sibling. This observation suggests that early initiation of ambroxol treatment may arrest neurological involvement in some GD3 patients.",

Enzyme replacement therapy alleviates visceral signs and symptoms but has no effect on neurological features. Ambroxol has been suggested as an enzyme enhancement agent. Some studies have confirmed its effectiveness in preventing the progression of neurological manifestations of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. In this study, we report two GD3 siblings in whom ambroxol combined with enzyme replacement therapy was initiated at different stages of the disease. We demonstrate the enzyme enhancement effect of ambroxol on L444P/H225Q;D409H glucocerebrosidase activity through results of fibroblast studies and long-term clinical outcomes of the two patients. The sibling diagnosed at the age of four-and-a-half years with significant neurological involvement manifested relatively rapid improvement on ambroxol treatment, followed by stabilization of further course. The younger sibling, in whom the treatment was started at seven weeks, displayed attention deficit and low average cognitive functioning at the age of seven years, but did not manifest other neurological symptoms. The difference in neurological outcomes indicates that ambroxol delayed or even halted the evolution of neurological manifestations in the younger sibling. This observation suggests that early initiation of ambroxol treatment may arrest neurological involvement in some GD3 patients.",

The disease is divided into three types based on neurocognitive involvement with GD1 having no involvement while the acute (GD2) and chronic (GD3) are neuronopathic. The non-neurological symptoms of GD3 are well treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) which has replaced hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ERT is unable to prevent neurological progression as the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In this retrospective study, we report the general, neurocognitive, and biochemical outcomes of three siblings with GD3 after treatment with ERT or HSCT. Two were treated with HSCT (named HSCT1 and HSCT2) and one with ERT (ERT1). All patients were homozygous for the c.1448 T > C, (p.Leu483Pro) variant in the GBA1 gene associated with GD3. ERT1 experienced neurocognitive progression with development of seizures, oculomotor apraxia, perceptive hearing loss and mental retardation. HSCT1 had no neurological manifestations, while HSCT2 developed perceptive hearing loss and low IQ. Chitotriosidase concentrations were normal in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HSCT1 and HSCT2, but both were markedly elevated in ERT1. We report a better neurological outcome and a normalization of chitotriosidase in the two siblings treated with HSCT compared to the ERT-treated sibling. With the advancements in HSCT over the past 25 years, we may reconsider using HSCT in GD3 to achieve a better neurological outcome and limit disease progression.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease (nGD) describes the condition of a subgroup of patients with the Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD), Gaucher disease with involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) which results from inherited deficiency of beta-glucosylceramidase. Although systemic manifestations of disease are now corrected by augmentation with macrophage-targeted therapeutic enzyme (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT), neurological disease progresses unpredictably as a result of failure of therapeutic enzyme to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Without therapy, the systemic and neurological effects of the disease progress and shorten life: investigators, principally in Sweden and the UK, pioneered bone marrow transplantation (BMT; Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation HSCT) to supply healthy marrow-derived macrophages and other cells, to correct the peripheral disease. Here we report the first long-term follow-up (over 20 years in all cases) of nine patients in the UK and Sweden who underwent HSCT in the 1970s and 1980s. This retrospective, multicentre observational study was undertaken to determine whether there are neurological features of Gaucher disease that can be corrected by HSCT and the extent to which deterioration continues after the procedure. Since intravenous administration of ERT is approved for patients with the neuronopathic disease and ameliorates many of the important systemic manifestations but fails to correct the neurological features, we also consider the current therapeutic positioning of HSCT in this disorder. RESULTS: In the nine patients here reported, neurological disease continued to progress after transplantation, manifesting as seizures, cerebellar disease and abnormalities of tone and reflexes. CONCLUSIONS: Although neurological disease progressed in this cohort of patients, there may be a future role for HSCT in the treatment of nGD. The procedure has the unique advantage of providing a life-long source of normally functioning macrophages in the bone marrow, and possibly other sites, after a single administration. HSCT moreover, clearly ameliorates systemic disease and this may be advantageous-especially where sustained provision of high-cost ERT cannot be guaranteed. Given the remaining unmet needs of patients with neuronopathic Gaucher disease and the greatly improved safety profile of the transplant procedure, HSCT could be considered to provide permanent correction of systemic disease, including bone disease not ameliorated by ERT, when combined with emerging therapies directed at the neurological manifestations of disease; this could include ex-vivo gene therapy approaches.",

Macrophage-independent dyserythropoiesis and abnormal iron metabolism have been shown. We evaluated hematological and iron status at diagnosis (T0) and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on erythropoiesis and iron utilization over 5-year follow-up in type 1 GD patients and in an ex vivo model of erythropoiesis from CD34 + peripheral blood cells. At T0, 41% of patients had anemia and 51% hyperferritinemia. Hemoglobin increased from 12.6 (T0) to 13.9 g/dL (T6), GFD15, a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased from 5401 to 710 pg/ml, and serum ferritin decreased from 614 to 140 mcg/L (p < 0.001). In parallel, transferrin saturation (TSAT) increased. Hepcidin, although in the normal range, decreased from T0 to T6. Ex vivo studies showed that ERT restores the erythroid cells derived from CD34 + impaired ability to differentiate. During ERT, an increase in TFRC expression, consistent with the ability of erythroid precursors to uptake iron, and a reduction in HAMP and concomitant increase in SLC40A1 were observed. This is the largest study with a longitudinal follow-up evaluating erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, combining clinical and ex vivo data in GD. Iron dysregulation likely contributes to anemia, and ERT, by improving iron distribution, improves erythropoiesis.",

Enzyme replacement therapy is ineffective for neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD). High-dose ambroxol has been administered as an alternative treatment for a group of patients with nGD. However, little is known about the clinical indication and the long-term outcome of patients after ambroxol therapy. We herein report a case of a female patient who presented with a progressive disease of GD type 2 from 11 months of age and had the pathogenic variants of p.L483P (formerly defined as p.L444P) and p.R502H (p.R463H) in GBA1. A combined treatment of imiglucerase with ambroxol started improving the patient's motor activity in 1 week, while it kept the long-lasting effect of preventing the deteriorating phenotype for 30 months. A literature review identified 40 patients with nGD, who had received high-dose ambroxol therapy. More than 65% of these patients favorably responded to the molecular chaperone therapy, irrespective of p.L483P homozygous, heterozygous or the other genotypes. These results highlight the long-lasting effect of ambroxol-based chaperone therapy for patients with an expanding spectrum of mutations in GBA1.",

The study population included all patients identified as having GD between 1998, and April 2022, in these two hospitals for review. A total of 42 individuals were included, six of whom were diagnosed by NBS. RESULTS: Our cohort presented a higher proportion of GD3 individuals, both by clinical suspicion and by NBS diagnosis, than that reported worldwide. The major subtypes that were recognized following NBS diagnosis were GD2 and GD3. The majority of GD patients carry at least one p.Leu483Pro variant. The 5-year survival rates were 0% for GD2 patients and 100% for patients with other subtypes. Patients diagnosed during the post-NBS era were free of symptoms on initial presentation, except for those with the GD2 subtype. For those diagnosed earlier, ERT was shown to be effective in terms of improved hemograms and prevented bone crises. However, the neurological symptoms in GD3 patients progressed despite ERT intervention. CONCLUSION: ERT is essential in reversing the hematological presentations and preventing the skeletal complications of GD. Timely diagnosis of GD with NBS allows for early intervention with ERT to prevent disease progression and complications. However, the need for effective intervention for neurological dysfunction remains unmet.",

We aimed to evaluate the immunity status and reveal the course of COVID-19 in patients with LSDs. RESULTS: The median age of 110 patients with LSDs was 129 months (range: 21-655), and all but one patient with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III were regularly receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In 53.6% (n = 56) of the patients (23 patients with Gaucher disease [10 type III, 13 type I], 26 patients with MPS [8 type VI, 11 type IVA, 1 type III, 3 type II, and 3 type I], and 7 patients with Pompe disease), an abnormality in at least one of the autoimmunity or immunodeficiency parameters was reported. Furthermore, 12 (57%) of 21 Gaucher cases (7 type III, 5 type I), 18 (40.9%) of 44 MPS cases (9 type IVA, 5 type VI, 1 type I, 2 type II, and 1 type III), and six (66%) of nine Pompe cases were reported to involve abnormalities in at least one of the parameters related to immunodeficiency. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgA levels were reported to be lower, and there were abnormalities in the lymphocyte counts and subgroups in the MPS group. ANA was reported to be positive in one patient with Gaucher type III, anti-DNA in two patients with Gaucher type I and one patient with MPS type VI, antithyroglobulin in two patients with Gaucher type I, anti-TPO in one patient with Gaucher type I, TRAB in one patient with Gaucher type I, antiphospholipid IgM in three patients with Gaucher type III and one patient with Gaucher type I, anticardiolipin IgM in one patient with Gaucher type I, one patient with Gaucher type III, and one patient with MPS type II. However, no clinical presentation was consistent with the laboratory results except for one patient with Gaucher type I disease with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Two of the four patients who survived the COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms had a diagnosis of Gaucher type I, and no abnormality was detected in their laboratory tests. The other two patients had a diagnosis of MPS types VI and II. Immune dysfunction was detected in the patient with a diagnosis of MPS type II. Four of our patients were discharged without any sequelae. CONCLUSION: Problems with immunity did not cause any noticeable clinical results. Being well protected by reducing social contact might have played a role. However, we believe that it should be borne in mind that cardiac and pulmonary involvement, as well as immune dysfunction in LSDs, may cause an increased need for intensive care because of secondary bacterial infections.",

                    "abstract": "Historically, disease burden and treatment responses in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) was assessed by monitoring clinical data, laboratory, imaging, chitotriosidase (CHITO), and other biomarkers; however, these biomarkers lack specificity and CHITO is uninformative in patients heterozygous or homozygous for the CHIT1 c.1049_1072dup24 variant. Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb1. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations of CHITO and lyso-Gb1; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing lyso-Gb1 levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role of lyso-Gb1 as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for these patients.",

The mean age at diagnosis was 32.46+-12.68 months. Anemia was noted at diagnosis in 50%, thrombocytopenia in 30.7%, severe splenomegaly in 58.7%, severe hepatomegaly in 11.9%, and skeletal findings were detected in 24.3% of the patients. The most prevalent GD type was type 3 (54.5%). Twenty-two of type 3 patients had no neurological manifestations at diagnosis, and 12 developed variable central nervous system manifestations during follow-up. The most common neurological features were limited eye movements, oculomotor apraxia, and squint. Of the 60 patients for whom genotypes were obtained, homozygous L444P was the most common (n=35/60, 58.3%). Treatment with ERT (imiglucerase) revealed significant improvements in blood indices, organ volumes, and growth parameters (P<0.05). Ten (11.7%) type 3 patients did not develop any neurological manifestations under ERT over 20 years. Mortality was 16%, and the 20-year OS was 73.3%. We conclude that in Egypt, type 3 is the most prevalent phenotype of GD, and homozygous L444P is the predominant GBA genotype of GD. Early age at diagnosis and treatment with ERT over 20 years revealed significant improvements in disease manifestations, with an OS of 73.3%.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease (nGD) describes the condition of a subgroup of patients with the Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD), Gaucher disease with involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) which results from inherited deficiency of beta-glucosylceramidase. Although systemic manifestations of disease are now corrected by augmentation with macrophage-targeted therapeutic enzyme (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT), neurological disease progresses unpredictably as a result of failure of therapeutic enzyme to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Without therapy, the systemic and neurological effects of the disease progress and shorten life: investigators, principally in Sweden and the UK, pioneered bone marrow transplantation (BMT; Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation HSCT) to supply healthy marrow-derived macrophages and other cells, to correct the peripheral disease. Here we report the first long-term follow-up (over 20 years in all cases) of nine patients in the UK and Sweden who underwent HSCT in the 1970s and 1980s. This retrospective, multicentre observational study was undertaken to determine whether there are neurological features of Gaucher disease that can be corrected by HSCT and the extent to which deterioration continues after the procedure. Since intravenous administration of ERT is approved for patients with the neuronopathic disease and ameliorates many of the important systemic manifestations but fails to correct the neurological features, we also consider the current therapeutic positioning of HSCT in this disorder. RESULTS: In the nine patients here reported, neurological disease continued to progress after transplantation, manifesting as seizures, cerebellar disease and abnormalities of tone and reflexes. CONCLUSIONS: Although neurological disease progressed in this cohort of patients, there may be a future role for HSCT in the treatment of nGD. The procedure has the unique advantage of providing a life-long source of normally functioning macrophages in the bone marrow, and possibly other sites, after a single administration. HSCT moreover, clearly ameliorates systemic disease and this may be advantageous-especially where sustained provision of high-cost ERT cannot be guaranteed. Given the remaining unmet needs of patients with neuronopathic Gaucher disease and the greatly improved safety profile of the transplant procedure, HSCT could be considered to provide permanent correction of systemic disease, including bone disease not ameliorated by ERT, when combined with emerging therapies directed at the neurological manifestations of disease; this could include ex-vivo gene therapy approaches.",

                    "title": "Challenges in Gaucher disease: Perspectives from an expert panel.",
                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

GD can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). The aim of this systematic review (SR) is to assess the effectiveness of drugs used for GD treatment. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in April 2021. The search strategies encompassed the name of the disease and of the drug treatments. Manual search was also conducted. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Observational and interventional longitudinal studies evaluating ERT and SRT for GD were included. Single mean meta-analyses were conducted for each drug using R. DATA SYNTHESIS: The initial search retrieved 2246 articles after duplicates were removed. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 68 reports were included. The studies evaluated imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, taliglucerase alfa, miglustat, and eliglustat. The results showed that ERT is effective as a treatment in both naive and experienced patients. Miglustat did not significantly improve blood outcomes in naive patients and resulted in a decrease in the platelet levels of experienced patients. Eliglustat was mainly assessed for experienced patients and resulted in stable outcome values. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This extensive SR confirms the effectiveness of GD treatments in short- and long-term follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: The results were favorable for all ERTs and for eliglustat. Based on the assessed evidence, miglustat did not achieved expressive results. However, all evidence should be interpreted considering its limitations and does not replace well-conducted randomized trials.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variants of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), resulting in the impairment of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme function and the accumulation of a glycolipid substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within lysosomes. Current therapeutic approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy cannot fully rescue GD pathologies, especially neurological symptoms. Meanwhile, delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of affected human cells is a promising strategy for treating neuropathic LSDs. RESULT: Here, we describe a novel approach to restore GCase enzyme in cells from neuropathic GD patients by producing extracellular vesicle (EVs)-containing GCase from cells overexpressing GBA1 gene. Lentiviral vectors containing modified GBA1 were introduced into HEK293T cells to produce a stable cell line that provides a sustainable source of functional GCase enzyme. The GBA1-overexpressing cells released EV-containing GCase enzyme, that is capable of entering into and localizing in the endocytic compartment of recipient cells, including THP-1 macrophage, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, and macrophages and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of neuropathic GD patients. Importantly, the recipient cells exhibit higher GCase enzyme activity. CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe types of LSDs. It involves delivering lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of human cells affected by conditions such as GDs with neurological symptoms, as well as potentially other neurological disorders impacting lysosomes.",

                    "abstract": "Treatment options for Type 1 Gaucher Disease (GD1) include enzyme replacement therapy and oral substrate reduction therapy. The criteria for treatment initiation vary across regions. Recent retrospective studies have highlighted the natural progression of never-treated GD1, suggesting that some patients remain asymptomatic or stable for extended periods. However, there is no data on long-term prospective follow-up. We conducted a prospective study following a cross-sectional analysis of 36 never-treated, non-splenectomised GD1 patients from the French Gaucher Disease Registry (FGDR). The objective was to describe the natural disease progression, tracking clinical, radiological, and biological characteristics over time. Thirty-six non-splenectomised and never-treated patients (19 women and 17 men) diagnosed with Gaucher Disease were prospectively followed for an additional median duration of 6.5 (5-8.3) years. Of the cohort, 17 remained untreated, 10 initiated treatment, and 7 were lost to follow-up. Although never-treated patients tended to be older at the time of first symptoms, diagnosis, and last follow-up compared to those who received treatment, the difference was not significant in this small cohort. At last follow-up, never-treated patients had no worsening of most of their symptoms. No significant changes were observed in platelets, chitotriosidase, and lyso-Gb1. In this prospective cohort, we highlight that patients with mild GD can remain untreated with no disease progression, offering insights into cost-effective management strategies. Identifying such patients is still challenging.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, leading to beta-glucocerebrosidase deficiency and glucosylceramide accumulation. Methods: We analyzed short- and long-term dynamics of lyso-glucosylceramide (lyso-Gb1) in a large cohort of GD patients undergoing enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Results: Eight-years analysis of lyso-Gb1 revealed statistically insignificant variability in the biomarker across the years and relatively high individual variability in patients' results. GD type 1 (GD1) patients exhibited higher variability compared to GD type 3 (GD3) patients (coefficients of variation: 34% and 23%, respectively; p-value = 0.0003). We also investigated the short-term response of the biomarker to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), measuring lyso-Gb1 right before and 30 min after treatment administration. We tested 20 GD patients (16 GD1, 4 GD3) and observed a rapid and significant reduction in lyso-Gb1 levels (average decrease of 17%; p-value < 0.0001). This immediate response reaffirms the efficacy of ERT in reducing substrate accumulation in GD patients but, on the other hand, suggests the biomarker's instability between the infusions. Conclusions: These findings underscore lyso-Gb1's potential as a reliable biomarker for monitoring efficacy of treatment. However, individual variability and dry blood spot (DBS) testing limitations urge a further refinement in clinical application. Our study contributes valuable insights into GD patient management, emphasizing the evolving role of biomarkers in personalized medicine.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by GBA1 mutations resulting in glucosylceramide accumulation in macrophages. GD is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone complications, and neurological complications. Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a deacylated form of glucosylceramide, has been identified as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment response in GD. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma lyso-Gb1 and therapeutic goals for GD (improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis), as well as disease type and GBA1 mutation type, in Japanese patients with GD receiving velaglucerase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Furthermore, this study compared the plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration observed in Japanese patients included in this study with that observed in a previous non-Japanese clinical study. RESULTS: This non-interventional, open-label, multicenter observational cohort study (October 2020 to March 2021) included a total of 20 patients (of any age) with GD (type 1: n = 8; type 2: n = 9; type 3: n = 3) treated with velaglucerase alfa for >= 3 months. Median (minimum-maximum) duration of velaglucerase alfa treatment was 49.5 (3-107) months. A total of 14 (70.0%) patients achieved all therapeutic goals (i.e., 100% achievement; improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis). Overall, median (minimum-maximum) lyso-Gb1 concentration was 24.3 (2.1-150) ng/mL. Although not statistically significant, numerically lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentrations were observed in patients with 100% achievement compared with those without; no statistically significant difference in plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration was observed between patients with different disease type or mutation type. Furthermore, lyso-Gb1 concentrations observed in Japanese patients were numerically lower than that observed in a previous study of non-Japanese patients with GD receiving ERT. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, high achievement rates of therapeutic goals with low lyso-Gb1 concentration were observed, demonstrating a correlation between therapeutic goals and lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration in Japanese patients with GD treated with velaglucerase alfa. This study further suggests that plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration may be a useful biomarker for treatment response in patients with GD.",

                    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is the most frequent sphingolipidosis, caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the GBA1 gene encoding for beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase, E.C. 3.2.1.45). The condition is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, hematological abnormalities, and bone disease in both non-neuronopathic type 1 (GD1) and neuronopathic type 3 (GD3). Interestingly, GBA1 variants were found to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) in GD1 patients. We performed a comprehensive study regarding the two most disease-specific biomarkers, glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb1) and alpha-synuclein for GD and PD, respectively. A total of 65 patients with GD treated with ERT (47 GD1 patients and 18 GD3 patients), 19 GBA1 pathogenic variant carriers (including 10 L444P carriers), and 16 healthy subjects were involved in the study. Lyso-Gb1 was assessed by dried blood spot testing. The level of alpha-synuclein as an mRNA transcript, total, and oligomer protein concentration were measured with real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. alpha-synuclein mRNA level was found significantly elevated in GD3 patients and L444P carriers. GD1 patients, along with GBA1 carriers of an unknown or unconfirmed variant, as well as healthy controls, have the same low level of alpha-synuclein mRNA. There was no correlation found between the level of alpha-synuclein mRNA and age in GD patients treated with ERT, whereas there was a positive correlation in L444P carriers.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone diseases, with or without neurological symptoms. Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for GD, has been used for diagnosis and monitoring the response to treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for the non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD (type 2 and 3) accounts for 60%-70% of the Asian affected population. METHODS: We explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 3 (GD3). RESULTS: Four patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The types of donor were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three haploidentical. The age at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 3.8-15 years in the patients with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration of 3-14 years. All patients had successful HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in one patient. The enzyme activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became lower than the pathological value. All of the patients are still alive and physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school. None of the patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after HSCT, but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: ERT followed by HSCT could be considered as an alternative treatment for patients with GD3 who have a high risk of fatal neurological progression.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 31 patients with type I GD (21 patients with intact spleen and 10 patients with a history of splenectomy) over 18 years. Efficacy was assessed by the change in hemoglobin level (primary endpoint), platelet count, spleen and liver volumes, prevalence of bone marrow infiltration, and the number of patients with quiet hip disease according to magnetic resonance imaging (secondary endpoints). Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as by the incidence of production of imiglucerase binding and neutralizing antibodies (IgG, IgE). The mean follow-up duration was 54 weeks. RESULTS: The study did not show a statistically significant change in hemoglobin levels, platelet count, or spleen and liver volumes. There was an upward tendency in platelet count in the overall group (p=0.1) and patients after splenectomy (p=0.08). The prevalence of specific bone marrow infiltration and the number of patients with quiet hip disease remained unchanged. During the safety analysis, one adverse reaction, a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase, was reported, which resolved spontaneously by the end of the study. The immunogenicity analysis showed the initial presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in 5 (16.7%) of the 30 examined patients. At the end of the study, ADAs were detected in only 3 (10%) patients. The detected ADAs had a low titer and no neutralizing activity, and they did not affect the treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Long-term therapy with the imiglucerase biosimilar was associated with a stable course of GD without progression. It was characterized by a good safety profile and low immunogenicity.",

LSDs affect 1 in 5000 live births, albeit every LSD itself has a low incidence. The most common LSDs are Fabry disease and Gaucher disease. The underlying cause mainly is an enzyme deficiency but may also be due to defects in transport or activation proteins, which result in progressive intra- and extra-lysosomal accumulation of undegraded storage material. The lysosomes play a key role in degradation and cellular recycling of macromolecules. Besides disturbance of cellular function, substrate accumulation may result in secondary toxic and/or inflammatory processes.

The aim of this work was to establish a management guide to address the main clinical problems before, during and after pregnancy and to provide key information to healthcare professionals, patients, and families. GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of scientific evidence and develop recommendations was incorporated to elaborate this guide. For final recommendations, a structured consensus 2-round process was carried out using the Delphi method with a Gaucher expert panel. After this process, nine recommendations were elaborated related to pre-pregnant status and genetic counseling and for management during pregnancy, seven related to childbirth, and eight focused on management after delivery and breastfeeding. Regarding the quality of the evidence, values and preferences of patients were also considered. A consensus guide to define and standardize pregnancy management in Gaucher disease considering the best available evidence, complemented by experts' opinions, could be a relevant tool to help patients, nurses, midwives and physicians with little experience in Gaucher disease who do not have access to guidance from Gaucher disease treatment centers of excellence.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Gaucher Disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme deficiency. Gaucher cells transformed from the macrophages by progressive sphingolipid accumulation and infiltrate bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other organs. The accumulation of substrate causes inflammation, compromised cellular homeostasis, and disturbed autophagy. It has been hypothesized that this proinflammatory state of GD leads cytokines and chemokines release. As a result of inflammatory process, the cellular dysfunction caused by disruption of cellular signaling, organelle dysfunction, or autoimmune antibodies may affect endocrine profile of GD patients such as hormone levels, lipid profile, and bone mineral density status. METHODS: A total of 13 patients confirmed to have GD, 12 non-neuronopathic type and one subacute neuronopathic type, were enrolled in our study. RESULTS: The median treatment duration in the enzyme therapy was 13.33 years (9-26 years). At least one endocrinological abnormality was detected in blood tests of nine patients. Hyperinsulinism was the most common finding although fasting blood glucose levels HgbA1c levels were normal in all patients. Two patients had osteopenia, and osteoporosis was detected in two patients. Low HDL levels were detected in six patients, but HDL levels below 23 mg/dL associated with disease severity have been detected in two patients who have not receiving enzyme replacement therapy. None of patients had thyroidal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: This study had revealed endocrinological abnormalities in GD patients that have not led any severe morbidity in our patients. However, thyroid hormone abnormalities, insulin resistance, or lipid profile abnormalities may cause unpredictable comorbidities. Endocrinological assessment in GD patients in routine follow-up may prevent possible clinical manifestation in long term as well as can define efficacy of ERT on endocrine abnormalities.",

Velaglucerasa alfa is a recombinant glucocerebrosidase used for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of GD. Due to its limited stability and bioavailability, the use of nanosized systems carrying Velaglucerase alfa is proposed as a novel strategy to improve ERT for GD. Highly stable and low-dispersed Velaglucerase-loaded Eudragit nanoparticles (NPs) (NPs: Vela); 150-160 nm mean size, polydispersity index <0. 15, zeta potential around -32 mV, and 95 % Velaglucerase alfa encapsulation efficiency were obtained. Crystallographic structural analysis by Small Angle X-ray Scattering, confirmed that Velaglucerase alfa was incorporated into the nanoparticle matrix. In vitro studies revealed that NPs: Vela preferentially interact with immunoglobulins and fibrinogen, and a positive enzyme release from NPs:Vela was observed at acidic pH; while no release was observed in neutral conditions. A positive internalization of NPs:Vela in GD mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) was also verified, increasing enzyme cellular activity compared to non-treated cells. Confocal microscopy verified that NPs:Vela colocalized with lysosomes, but no effect of NPs: Vela in the mineralization of MSC was observed. Finally, the viability of GD cell lines is not affected by NPs: Vela, in comparison with Velaglucerase alone, that negatively affects the viability of the target cells. This nanocarrier system for Velaglucerase alfa delivery in lysosomes, initially proposed to improve ERT for GD, may also serve as a starting point to address pathophysiological mechanisms in GD and other lysosomal disorders.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Gaucher Disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme deficiency. Gaucher cells transformed from the macrophages by progressive sphingolipid accumulation and infiltrate bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other organs. The accumulation of substrate causes inflammation, compromised cellular homeostasis, and disturbed autophagy. It has been hypothesized that this proinflammatory state of GD leads cytokines and chemokines release. As a result of inflammatory process, the cellular dysfunction caused by disruption of cellular signaling, organelle dysfunction, or autoimmune antibodies may affect endocrine profile of GD patients such as hormone levels, lipid profile, and bone mineral density status. METHODS: A total of 13 patients confirmed to have GD, 12 non-neuronopathic type and one subacute neuronopathic type, were enrolled in our study. RESULTS: The median treatment duration in the enzyme therapy was 13.33 years (9-26 years). At least one endocrinological abnormality was detected in blood tests of nine patients. Hyperinsulinism was the most common finding although fasting blood glucose levels HgbA1c levels were normal in all patients. Two patients had osteopenia, and osteoporosis was detected in two patients. Low HDL levels were detected in six patients, but HDL levels below 23 mg/dL associated with disease severity have been detected in two patients who have not receiving enzyme replacement therapy. None of patients had thyroidal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: This study had revealed endocrinological abnormalities in GD patients that have not led any severe morbidity in our patients. However, thyroid hormone abnormalities, insulin resistance, or lipid profile abnormalities may cause unpredictable comorbidities. Endocrinological assessment in GD patients in routine follow-up may prevent possible clinical manifestation in long term as well as can define efficacy of ERT on endocrine abnormalities.",

Management of pregnancies in Gaucher patients is further complicated by using of enzyme replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the available scientific evidence is not conclusive because there are not proper clinical trials on this issue. The aim of this work was to establish a management guide to address the main clinical problems before, during and after pregnancy and to provide key information to healthcare professionals, patients, and families. GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of scientific evidence and develop recommendations was incorporated to elaborate this guide. For final recommendations, a structured consensus 2-round process was carried out using the Delphi method with a Gaucher expert panel. After this process, nine recommendations were elaborated related to pre-pregnant status and genetic counseling and for management during pregnancy, seven related to childbirth, and eight focused on management after delivery and breastfeeding. Regarding the quality of the evidence, values and preferences of patients were also considered. A consensus guide to define and standardize pregnancy management in Gaucher disease considering the best available evidence, complemented by experts' opinions, could be a relevant tool to help patients, nurses, midwives and physicians with little experience in Gaucher disease who do not have access to guidance from Gaucher disease treatment centers of excellence.",

Both types were represented equally (GD1/GD3 = 20/18). L444P (35.5%) was the most common mutant allele while L444P/L444P (34.2%) was the most common genotype overall. Compound heterozygosity of N370S and L444P homozygosity were the dominant genotypes in Turkish children with GD1 and GD3, respectively. None of the patients had moderate to severe thrombocytopenia at last follow-up while the percent of patients with anemia decreased from 60% to 5.7% (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in mean liver (from 2.2 to 1.6 MN, p < 0.001) and spleen (from 15.5 to 7.6 MN, p < 0.001) volumes were observed in the first year of ERT. Linear growth was ameliorated as shown by the decrease in the percent of patients having short stature from 34.3% to 13.3% (p < 0.01) at year 5. Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteopenia and scoliosis were common skeletal findings. Although none of the patients had lung disease at diagnosis, 20% developed radiological findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement. This single center experience is the first comprehensive study from Turkey not only reporting clinical and genetic characteristics of GD patients but also providing information on the outcomes of ERT in two different sub-types of GD. Genotypic background of Turkish children with GD is similar to western populations. Although visceral and hematological therapeutic goals are reached as early as one year of ERT in both sub-types, achieving normal growth takes several more years than suggested in significant number of children with GD.",

It is typically characterized by clinical manifestations including anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone lesions, and (in more severe forms) neurological impairment. However, less-commonly reported and often under-recognized manifestations exist, which potentially have a significant impact on patient outcomes. Greater efforts are needed to understand, recognize, and manage these manifestations. OBJECTIVES: This review provides a synthesis of published information about three under-recognized GD manifestations (pulmonary involvement, lymphadenopathy, and Gaucheroma) and recommends diagnostic, management, and treatment strategies based on the available literature and author experience. The authors aim to raise awareness about these serious, progressive, and sometimes life-threatening conditions, which are often diagnosed late in life. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the incidence, pathophysiology, prognostic factors, and optimal management of pulmonary involvement, lymphadenopathy, and Gaucheroma in patients with GD. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has shown limited efficacy for the prevention and treatment of these manifestations. More research is needed to evaluate the potential effect of substrate reduction therapy (SRT) with glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors, and to develop additional approaches to treat these GD manifestations. Improvements in data collection registries and international data-sharing are required to better understand the impact of these manifestations on GD patients, help develop effective management strategies, and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.",

Heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes have been observed within GD types and across ethnicities. Enzyme replacement therapy is generally recommended for patients with type 1 GD, the least severe form of GD. In Japan, velaglucerase alfa has a broad indication covering type 1, 2 or 3 GD.  METHODS: All patients with type 1, 2, or 3 GD administered velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion after its launch date in Japan in 2014, were enrolled in a non-interventional, observational post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Individual patient data were reported via case report forms (CRFs). Key safety endpoints investigated included the incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), the safety of velaglucerase alfa in patients with types 2 and 3 GD, from patients under one year of age to elderly patients (>= 65 years of age). Long-term efficacy was also assessed.  RESULTS: In total, 53 patients with GD were registered. CRFs were available for 41 (77.4%) patients at the 6-year interim analysis. Fourteen adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in seven patients. All reported ADRs occurred in patients with type 2 GD. ADRs were reported by 63.6% (7/11) of patients with type 2 GD. Ten ADRs were reported in five patients aged < 4 years. No elderly patients experienced any ADR during the surveillance period. Five ADRs occurring in three (10.0%) patients were classified as IRRs, with one case of vomiting (moderate severity) resulting in treatment discontinuation. Ten serious adverse events were reported in five (16.7%) patients. Three fatal events were considered to be unrelated to treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Platelet counts increased after the administration of velaglucerase alfa and were generally maintained within the normal range over the administration period. Among eleven patients tested for neutralizing anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies, two (18.2%) were assessed as positive results.  CONCLUSION: PMS data from patients with types 1-3 GD in Japan indicate that long-term treatment with velaglucerase alfa was well-tolerated and associated with increased platelet counts, which is consistent with observations made in studies outside of Japan.

The disease is divided into three types based on neurocognitive involvement with GD1 having no involvement while the acute (GD2) and chronic (GD3) are neuronopathic. The non-neurological symptoms of GD3 are well treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) which has replaced hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ERT is unable to prevent neurological progression as the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In this retrospective study, we report the general, neurocognitive, and biochemical outcomes of three siblings with GD3 after treatment with ERT or HSCT. Two were treated with HSCT (named HSCT1 and HSCT2) and one with ERT (ERT1). All patients were homozygous for the c.1448 T > C, (p.Leu483Pro) variant in the GBA1 gene associated with GD3. ERT1 experienced neurocognitive progression with development of seizures, oculomotor apraxia, perceptive hearing loss and mental retardation. HSCT1 had no neurological manifestations, while HSCT2 developed perceptive hearing loss and low IQ. Chitotriosidase concentrations were normal in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HSCT1 and HSCT2, but both were markedly elevated in ERT1. We report a better neurological outcome and a normalization of chitotriosidase in the two siblings treated with HSCT compared to the ERT-treated sibling. With the advancements in HSCT over the past 25 years, we may reconsider using HSCT in GD3 to achieve a better neurological outcome and limit disease progression.",

                    "abstract": "Gaucher disease (GD) is the most frequent sphingolipidosis, caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the GBA1 gene encoding for beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase, E.C. 3.2.1.45). The condition is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, hematological abnormalities, and bone disease in both non-neuronopathic type 1 (GD1) and neuronopathic type 3 (GD3). Interestingly, GBA1 variants were found to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) in GD1 patients. We performed a comprehensive study regarding the two most disease-specific biomarkers, glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb1) and alpha-synuclein for GD and PD, respectively. A total of 65 patients with GD treated with ERT (47 GD1 patients and 18 GD3 patients), 19 GBA1 pathogenic variant carriers (including 10 L444P carriers), and 16 healthy subjects were involved in the study. Lyso-Gb1 was assessed by dried blood spot testing. The level of alpha-synuclein as an mRNA transcript, total, and oligomer protein concentration were measured with real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. alpha-synuclein mRNA level was found significantly elevated in GD3 patients and L444P carriers. GD1 patients, along with GBA1 carriers of an unknown or unconfirmed variant, as well as healthy controls, have the same low level of alpha-synuclein mRNA. There was no correlation found between the level of alpha-synuclein mRNA and age in GD patients treated with ERT, whereas there was a positive correlation in L444P carriers.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficient glucocerebrosidase activity that results from biallelic mutations in the GBA1 gene. Its phenotypic variability allows GD to be classified into 3 subtypes based on the presence and extent of neurological manifestations. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been available for all patients with GD in Taiwan since 1998. Newborn screening (NBS) for GD has been available since 2015. This study attempted to unveil the clinical features of patients diagnosed with GD during different eras in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the health records of two tertiary hospitals responsible for two-thirds of the patients with GD in Taiwan were used. The study population included all patients identified as having GD between 1998, and April 2022, in these two hospitals for review. A total of 42 individuals were included, six of whom were diagnosed by NBS. RESULTS: Our cohort presented a higher proportion of GD3 individuals, both by clinical suspicion and by NBS diagnosis, than that reported worldwide. The major subtypes that were recognized following NBS diagnosis were GD2 and GD3. The majority of GD patients carry at least one p.Leu483Pro variant. The 5-year survival rates were 0% for GD2 patients and 100% for patients with other subtypes. Patients diagnosed during the post-NBS era were free of symptoms on initial presentation, except for those with the GD2 subtype. For those diagnosed earlier, ERT was shown to be effective in terms of improved hemograms and prevented bone crises. However, the neurological symptoms in GD3 patients progressed despite ERT intervention. CONCLUSION: ERT is essential in reversing the hematological presentations and preventing the skeletal complications of GD. Timely diagnosis of GD with NBS allows for early intervention with ERT to prevent disease progression and complications. However, the need for effective intervention for neurological dysfunction remains unmet.",

Management of pregnancies in Gaucher patients is further complicated by using of enzyme replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the available scientific evidence is not conclusive because there are not proper clinical trials on this issue. The aim of this work was to establish a management guide to address the main clinical problems before, during and after pregnancy and to provide key information to healthcare professionals, patients, and families. GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of scientific evidence and develop recommendations was incorporated to elaborate this guide. For final recommendations, a structured consensus 2-round process was carried out using the Delphi method with a Gaucher expert panel. After this process, nine recommendations were elaborated related to pre-pregnant status and genetic counseling and for management during pregnancy, seven related to childbirth, and eight focused on management after delivery and breastfeeding. Regarding the quality of the evidence, values and preferences of patients were also considered. A consensus guide to define and standardize pregnancy management in Gaucher disease considering the best available evidence, complemented by experts' opinions, could be a relevant tool to help patients, nurses, midwives and physicians with little experience in Gaucher disease who do not have access to guidance from Gaucher disease treatment centers of excellence.",

Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1) has been shown to be a reliable, key, specific, and sensitive biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response in clinical studies of patients with GD. We evaluated the change in lyso-Gb1 concentration over time following enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed GD using real-world data from the Gaucher Outcome Survey disease registry. METHODS: Data for patients aged >= 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of GD and at least two lyso-Gb1 assessments were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were stratified by treatment status at baseline (time of first lyso-Gb1 assessment). Lyso-Gb1 concentrations were measured from dried blood spot (DBS) samples by Centogene AG. Assessments included change in lyso-Gb1 concentration, hemoglobin concentration, platelet counts, and spleen and liver volume from baseline to the last lyso-Gb1 assessment. RESULTS: Of 2007 patients enrolled in the Gaucher Outcome Survey as of February 25, 2022, 435 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study: 318 treated ('all treated'; 277 receiving treatment at baseline, 41 treatment naive at baseline), 38 receiving treatment at baseline who stopped treatment before the last lyso-Gb1 assessment, and 79 untreated. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations decreased from baseline to the last lyso-Gb1 assessment for all treated patients (median change - 8.6 ng/mL), and increased for untreated patients (median change 25.0 ng/mL) and those who stopped treatment (median change 19.5 ng/mL). Decreases were greater for all treatment-naive than previously treated patients (median change - 120.5 vs. - 3.3 ng/mL) and for velaglucerase alfa-treated patients vs. the overall treated cohort (-32.6 vs. - 8.6 ng/mL). Small improvements in hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and spleen volume were observed for treated patients but not untreated/stopped treatment cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, changes in lyso-Gb1 concentrations from DBS were reflective of responses to enzyme replacement therapy initiation or withdrawal in most patients. These findings confirm that the use of DBS samples for routine monitoring of lyso-Gb1 concentrations in patients with GD is feasible in real-world settings and may be useful to assess treatment response.",

Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1) has been shown to be a reliable, key, specific, and sensitive biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response in clinical studies of patients with GD. We evaluated the change in lyso-Gb1 concentration over time following enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed GD using real-world data from the Gaucher Outcome Survey disease registry. METHODS: Data for patients aged >= 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of GD and at least two lyso-Gb1 assessments were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were stratified by treatment status at baseline (time of first lyso-Gb1 assessment). Lyso-Gb1 concentrations were measured from dried blood spot (DBS) samples by Centogene AG. Assessments included change in lyso-Gb1 concentration, hemoglobin concentration, platelet counts, and spleen and liver volume from baseline to the last lyso-Gb1 assessment. RESULTS: Of 2007 patients enrolled in the Gaucher Outcome Survey as of February 25, 2022, 435 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study: 318 treated ('all treated'; 277 receiving treatment at baseline, 41 treatment naive at baseline), 38 receiving treatment at baseline who stopped treatment before the last lyso-Gb1 assessment, and 79 untreated. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations decreased from baseline to the last lyso-Gb1 assessment for all treated patients (median change - 8.6 ng/mL), and increased for untreated patients (median change 25.0 ng/mL) and those who stopped treatment (median change 19.5 ng/mL). Decreases were greater for all treatment-naive than previously treated patients (median change - 120.5 vs. - 3.3 ng/mL) and for velaglucerase alfa-treated patients vs. the overall treated cohort (-32.6 vs. - 8.6 ng/mL). Small improvements in hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and spleen volume were observed for treated patients but not untreated/stopped treatment cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, changes in lyso-Gb1 concentrations from DBS were reflective of responses to enzyme replacement therapy initiation or withdrawal in most patients. These findings confirm that the use of DBS samples for routine monitoring of lyso-Gb1 concentrations in patients with GD is feasible in real-world settings and may be useful to assess treatment response.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 31 patients with type I GD (21 patients with intact spleen and 10 patients with a history of splenectomy) over 18 years. Efficacy was assessed by the change in hemoglobin level (primary endpoint), platelet count, spleen and liver volumes, prevalence of bone marrow infiltration, and the number of patients with quiet hip disease according to magnetic resonance imaging (secondary endpoints). Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as by the incidence of production of imiglucerase binding and neutralizing antibodies (IgG, IgE). The mean follow-up duration was 54 weeks. RESULTS: The study did not show a statistically significant change in hemoglobin levels, platelet count, or spleen and liver volumes. There was an upward tendency in platelet count in the overall group (p=0.1) and patients after splenectomy (p=0.08). The prevalence of specific bone marrow infiltration and the number of patients with quiet hip disease remained unchanged. During the safety analysis, one adverse reaction, a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase, was reported, which resolved spontaneously by the end of the study. The immunogenicity analysis showed the initial presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in 5 (16.7%) of the 30 examined patients. At the end of the study, ADAs were detected in only 3 (10%) patients. The detected ADAs had a low titer and no neutralizing activity, and they did not affect the treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Long-term therapy with the imiglucerase biosimilar was associated with a stable course of GD without progression. It was characterized by a good safety profile and low immunogenicity.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Gaucher Disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme deficiency. Gaucher cells transformed from the macrophages by progressive sphingolipid accumulation and infiltrate bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other organs. The accumulation of substrate causes inflammation, compromised cellular homeostasis, and disturbed autophagy. It has been hypothesized that this proinflammatory state of GD leads cytokines and chemokines release. As a result of inflammatory process, the cellular dysfunction caused by disruption of cellular signaling, organelle dysfunction, or autoimmune antibodies may affect endocrine profile of GD patients such as hormone levels, lipid profile, and bone mineral density status. METHODS: A total of 13 patients confirmed to have GD, 12 non-neuronopathic type and one subacute neuronopathic type, were enrolled in our study. RESULTS: The median treatment duration in the enzyme therapy was 13.33 years (9-26 years). At least one endocrinological abnormality was detected in blood tests of nine patients. Hyperinsulinism was the most common finding although fasting blood glucose levels HgbA1c levels were normal in all patients. Two patients had osteopenia, and osteoporosis was detected in two patients. Low HDL levels were detected in six patients, but HDL levels below 23 mg/dL associated with disease severity have been detected in two patients who have not receiving enzyme replacement therapy. None of patients had thyroidal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: This study had revealed endocrinological abnormalities in GD patients that have not led any severe morbidity in our patients. However, thyroid hormone abnormalities, insulin resistance, or lipid profile abnormalities may cause unpredictable comorbidities. Endocrinological assessment in GD patients in routine follow-up may prevent possible clinical manifestation in long term as well as can define efficacy of ERT on endocrine abnormalities.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited real-world data from routine clinical care are available on the safety and effectiveness of treatment with taliglucerase alfa in patients with Gaucher disease (GD). METHODS: Taliglucerase Alfa Surveillance (TALIAS), a multinational prospective Drug Registry of patients with GD, was established to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective) of taliglucerase alfa. We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females) treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January 7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of 567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment, most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Twelve of the 106 patients experienced serious AEs; two patients experienced four treatment-related serious AEs. Four patients died, although none of the deaths was considered to be related to taliglucerase alfa treatment by the treating physicians. Nine patients discontinued from the study, including the four who died. At baseline, patients with prior ERT had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts than treatment-naive patients, likely reflecting the therapeutic effects of prior treatments. During follow-up, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased in the treatment-naive patients and remained relatively constant or increased slightly in patients with prior ERT. Spleen and liver volumes decreased in treatment-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interim data showed no new or emergent safety signals. The overall interim data are consistent with the clinical program experience and known safety and effectiveness profile of taliglucerase alfa.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 31 patients with type I GD (21 patients with intact spleen and 10 patients with a history of splenectomy) over 18 years. Efficacy was assessed by the change in hemoglobin level (primary endpoint), platelet count, spleen and liver volumes, prevalence of bone marrow infiltration, and the number of patients with quiet hip disease according to magnetic resonance imaging (secondary endpoints). Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as by the incidence of production of imiglucerase binding and neutralizing antibodies (IgG, IgE). The mean follow-up duration was 54 weeks. RESULTS: The study did not show a statistically significant change in hemoglobin levels, platelet count, or spleen and liver volumes. There was an upward tendency in platelet count in the overall group (p=0.1) and patients after splenectomy (p=0.08). The prevalence of specific bone marrow infiltration and the number of patients with quiet hip disease remained unchanged. During the safety analysis, one adverse reaction, a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase, was reported, which resolved spontaneously by the end of the study. The immunogenicity analysis showed the initial presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in 5 (16.7%) of the 30 examined patients. At the end of the study, ADAs were detected in only 3 (10%) patients. The detected ADAs had a low titer and no neutralizing activity, and they did not affect the treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Long-term therapy with the imiglucerase biosimilar was associated with a stable course of GD without progression. It was characterized by a good safety profile and low immunogenicity.",

An increase in the number of preclinical and clinical studies in the last decade has demonstrated that pharmacological chaperones are a feasible alternative to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for individuals with LSDs. A systematic search was performed to retrieve and critically assess the evidence from preclinical and clinical applications of pharmacological chaperones in the treatment of LSDs and to elucidate the mechanisms by which they could be effective in clinical practice. Publications were screened according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Fifty-two articles evaluating 12 small molecules for the treatment of seven LSDs are included in this review. Overall, a substantial amount of preclinical and clinical data support the potential of pharmacological chaperones as treatments for Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Pompe disease. Most of the available clinical evidence evaluated migalastat for the treatment of Fabry disease. There was a lack of consistency in the terminology used to describe pharmacological chaperones in the literature. Therefore, the new small molecule chaperone (SMC) classification system is proposed to inform a standardized approach for new, emerging small molecule therapies in LSDs.",

Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb1.

The disease is divided into three types based on neurocognitive involvement with GD1 having no involvement while the acute (GD2) and chronic (GD3) are neuronopathic. The non-neurological symptoms of GD3 are well treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) which has replaced hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ERT is unable to prevent neurological progression as the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In this retrospective study, we report the general, neurocognitive, and biochemical outcomes of three siblings with GD3 after treatment with ERT or HSCT. Two were treated with HSCT (named HSCT1 and HSCT2) and one with ERT (ERT1). All patients were homozygous for the c.1448 T > C, (p.Leu483Pro) variant in the GBA1 gene associated with GD3. ERT1 experienced neurocognitive progression with development of seizures, oculomotor apraxia, perceptive hearing loss and mental retardation. HSCT1 had no neurological manifestations, while HSCT2 developed perceptive hearing loss and low IQ. Chitotriosidase concentrations were normal in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HSCT1 and HSCT2, but both were markedly elevated in ERT1. We report a better neurological outcome and a normalization of chitotriosidase in the two siblings treated with HSCT compared to the ERT-treated sibling. With the advancements in HSCT over the past 25 years, we may reconsider using HSCT in GD3 to achieve a better neurological outcome and limit disease progression.",

PLE is a difficult-to-treat complication of GD. To date, only a few pediatric GD cases with PLE and massive mesenteric lymphadenopathies have been reported. CASE: Here, we report a girl with chronic neuronopathic GD, whose disease course was complicated by massive mesenteric lymphadenopathies with resultant protein losing enteropathy despite a regular and appropriate enzyme replacement therapy of 60 IU/kg/biweekly until the development of mesenteric lymphadenopathies and 120 IU/kg/biweekly thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: PLE is a devastating and life threatening complication of GD developing despite long term use of high dose ERT. Clinicians should be alert for this complication particularly in GD patients presenting with progressive abdominal distension, edema, ascites and diarrhea or in patients who have already developed mesenteric lymphadenopathies. Timely diagnosis may allow early intervention with previously suggested surgical or medical treatment options. Although there is no specific and effective treatment, surgical and aggressive medical interventions in addition to ERT were reported to relieve diarrhea and halt progression of mesenteric lymphadenopathies.",

                    "abstract": "Data from 38 children were retrospectively analyzed to determine the patient characteristics of Turkish children with Gaucher disease (GD) and evaluate the impact of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in a pediatric cohort consisting of two different sub-types of the disease, Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) and type 3 (GD3). Both types were represented equally (GD1/GD3 = 20/18). L444P (35.5%) was the most common mutant allele while L444P/L444P (34.2%) was the most common genotype overall. Compound heterozygosity of N370S and L444P homozygosity were the dominant genotypes in Turkish children with GD1 and GD3, respectively. None of the patients had moderate to severe thrombocytopenia at last follow-up while the percent of patients with anemia decreased from 60% to 5.7% (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in mean liver (from 2.2 to 1.6 MN, p < 0.001) and spleen (from 15.5 to 7.6 MN, p < 0.001) volumes were observed in the first year of ERT. Linear growth was ameliorated as shown by the decrease in the percent of patients having short stature from 34.3% to 13.3% (p < 0.01) at year 5. Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteopenia and scoliosis were common skeletal findings. Although none of the patients had lung disease at diagnosis, 20% developed radiological findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement. This single center experience is the first comprehensive study from Turkey not only reporting clinical and genetic characteristics of GD patients but also providing information on the outcomes of ERT in two different sub-types of GD. Genotypic background of Turkish children with GD is similar to western populations. Although visceral and hematological therapeutic goals are reached as early as one year of ERT in both sub-types, achieving normal growth takes several more years than suggested in significant number of children with GD.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 31 patients with type I GD (21 patients with intact spleen and 10 patients with a history of splenectomy) over 18 years. Efficacy was assessed by the change in hemoglobin level (primary endpoint), platelet count, spleen and liver volumes, prevalence of bone marrow infiltration, and the number of patients with quiet hip disease according to magnetic resonance imaging (secondary endpoints). Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as by the incidence of production of imiglucerase binding and neutralizing antibodies (IgG, IgE). The mean follow-up duration was 54 weeks. RESULTS: The study did not show a statistically significant change in hemoglobin levels, platelet count, or spleen and liver volumes. There was an upward tendency in platelet count in the overall group (p=0.1) and patients after splenectomy (p=0.08). The prevalence of specific bone marrow infiltration and the number of patients with quiet hip disease remained unchanged. During the safety analysis, one adverse reaction, a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase, was reported, which resolved spontaneously by the end of the study. The immunogenicity analysis showed the initial presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in 5 (16.7%) of the 30 examined patients. At the end of the study, ADAs were detected in only 3 (10%) patients. The detected ADAs had a low titer and no neutralizing activity, and they did not affect the treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Long-term therapy with the imiglucerase biosimilar was associated with a stable course of GD without progression. It was characterized by a good safety profile and low immunogenicity.",

Type 1 GD (GD1) is the most prevalent form of GD in Western countries; enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a treatment option for patients with GD1. To understand the economic value of the GD1 ERT velaglucerase alfa, a budget impact model (BIM) was developed from a United States (US) payer perspective. METHODS: We estimated the budget impact of velaglucerase alfa for a 10-million-member US health plan by comparing the annual total costs of therapy between a scenario using current velaglucerase alfa uptake to a projected scenario with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. Total drug costs for both scenarios were estimated as the sum of the product of the number of eligible patients on each treatment and the annual per-patient cost of each medication. Average per-patient costs for ERTs were calculated by adding the yearly drug acquisition, drug administration, and site-of-care markup costs. The budget impact was measured over years 1-3. RESULTS: An estimated 65 patients would receive velaglucerase alfa treatment in year 1, increasing to 90 patients by year 3. Across analyses, cost savings were realized with velaglucerase alfa compared with imiglucerase ($115,909) and taliglucerase alfa ($80,401). An annual total budget savings of $8.67 million could be realized for a hypothetical 10-million-member US health plan with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. The per-member per-month costs decreased by $0.0241 across years 1-3. CONCLUSIONS: BIM results show that increased velaglucerase alfa uptake for GD1 treatment is cost-saving for US health plans.",

RESULTS: No CTs have been found in which efficacy is evaluated with final variables, all have been surrogated. Twenty-two patients were included: eight with Gaucher disease, six with Niemann-PickC disease, two with Hunter disease, one with Morquio-A disease, and five with Pompe disease. Eight patients have responded to ERT and one to SRT with eliglustat. ERT has not been associated with adverse effects. Miglustat has produced tolerance problems, requiring a change in a patient. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness was variable according to the pathology. Regarding safety, manageable adverse reactions to SRT were associated with dosage adjustments.",

Gaucher disease, caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, belongs to this class of disorders, and it is considered the most common among the Lysosomal Storage Diseases. The two main therapeutic approaches are the Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and the Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT). ERT, consisting in replacing the defective enzyme by administering a recombinant enzyme, is effective in alleviating the visceral symptoms, hallmarks of the most common subtype of the disease whereas it has no effects when symptoms involve CNS, since the recombinant protein is unable to significantly cross the Blood Brain Barrier. The SRT strategy involves inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), the enzyme responsible for the production of the associated storage molecule. The rational design of new inhibitors of GCS has been hampered by the lack of either the crystal structure of the enzyme or an in-silico model of the active site which could provide important information regarding the interactions of potential inhibitors with the target, but, despite this, interesting results have been obtained and are herein reviewed.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Gaucher Disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme deficiency. Gaucher cells transformed from the macrophages by progressive sphingolipid accumulation and infiltrate bone marrow, spleen, liver, and other organs. The accumulation of substrate causes inflammation, compromised cellular homeostasis, and disturbed autophagy. It has been hypothesized that this proinflammatory state of GD leads cytokines and chemokines release. As a result of inflammatory process, the cellular dysfunction caused by disruption of cellular signaling, organelle dysfunction, or autoimmune antibodies may affect endocrine profile of GD patients such as hormone levels, lipid profile, and bone mineral density status. METHODS: A total of 13 patients confirmed to have GD, 12 non-neuronopathic type and one subacute neuronopathic type, were enrolled in our study. RESULTS: The median treatment duration in the enzyme therapy was 13.33 years (9-26 years). At least one endocrinological abnormality was detected in blood tests of nine patients. Hyperinsulinism was the most common finding although fasting blood glucose levels HgbA1c levels were normal in all patients. Two patients had osteopenia, and osteoporosis was detected in two patients. Low HDL levels were detected in six patients, but HDL levels below 23 mg/dL associated with disease severity have been detected in two patients who have not receiving enzyme replacement therapy. None of patients had thyroidal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: This study had revealed endocrinological abnormalities in GD patients that have not led any severe morbidity in our patients. However, thyroid hormone abnormalities, insulin resistance, or lipid profile abnormalities may cause unpredictable comorbidities. Endocrinological assessment in GD patients in routine follow-up may prevent possible clinical manifestation in long term as well as can define efficacy of ERT on endocrine abnormalities.",

                    "abstract": "Data from 38 children were retrospectively analyzed to determine the patient characteristics of Turkish children with Gaucher disease (GD) and evaluate the impact of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in a pediatric cohort consisting of two different sub-types of the disease, Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) and type 3 (GD3). Both types were represented equally (GD1/GD3 = 20/18). L444P (35.5%) was the most common mutant allele while L444P/L444P (34.2%) was the most common genotype overall. Compound heterozygosity of N370S and L444P homozygosity were the dominant genotypes in Turkish children with GD1 and GD3, respectively. None of the patients had moderate to severe thrombocytopenia at last follow-up while the percent of patients with anemia decreased from 60% to 5.7% (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in mean liver (from 2.2 to 1.6 MN, p < 0.001) and spleen (from 15.5 to 7.6 MN, p < 0.001) volumes were observed in the first year of ERT. Linear growth was ameliorated as shown by the decrease in the percent of patients having short stature from 34.3% to 13.3% (p < 0.01) at year 5. Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteopenia and scoliosis were common skeletal findings. Although none of the patients had lung disease at diagnosis, 20% developed radiological findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement. This single center experience is the first comprehensive study from Turkey not only reporting clinical and genetic characteristics of GD patients but also providing information on the outcomes of ERT in two different sub-types of GD. Genotypic background of Turkish children with GD is similar to western populations. Although visceral and hematological therapeutic goals are reached as early as one year of ERT in both sub-types, achieving normal growth takes several more years than suggested in significant number of children with GD.",

Liver fibrosis is a long-term complication of GD, potentially leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently no validated clinical tools for the monitoring of liver fibrosis in patients with GD. In this study, we aim at assessing the validity of common fibrosis-predicting scores, developed for other diseases, for the use in GD, using transient elastography as a gold-standard, as well as developing the first GD-specific liver fibrosis predicting score. We enrolled 19 adult patients with GD who had been on treatment for a minimum of 1 year on enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy and who had no evidence of any other liver disease except GD or metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is a common comorbidity of GD. We analyzed the correlation between liver stiffness and genotype, treatment modality (imiglucerase or other therapies), clinical severity, and clinical laboratory tests. We found that the common liver fibrosis scores APRI, FIB-4, and NFS did not accurately predict liver fibrosis in people with GD. We also found that male sex, the DS3 score, AST, and GGT levels significantly correlated with liver stiffness, and used these to create a simple but accurate fibrosis-predicting score specifically for GD (the \"Gaucher liver fibrosis score\", or GLFS), with high accuracy (AUC = 0.8571, p = 0.0206). We believe that our new GLFS may be used in clinical practice to help prioritize GD patients for closer monitoring of liver fibrosis.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone diseases, with or without neurological symptoms. Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for GD, has been used for diagnosis and monitoring the response to treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for the non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD (type 2 and 3) accounts for 60%-70% of the Asian affected population. METHODS: We explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 3 (GD3). RESULTS: Four patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The types of donor were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three haploidentical. The age at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 3.8-15 years in the patients with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration of 3-14 years. All patients had successful HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in one patient. The enzyme activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became lower than the pathological value. All of the patients are still alive and physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school. None of the patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after HSCT, but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: ERT followed by HSCT could be considered as an alternative treatment for patients with GD3 who have a high risk of fatal neurological progression.",

The condition is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, hematological abnormalities, and bone disease in both non-neuronopathic type 1 (GD1) and neuronopathic type 3 (GD3). Interestingly, GBA1 variants were found to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) in GD1 patients. We performed a comprehensive study regarding the two most disease-specific biomarkers, glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb1) and alpha-synuclein for GD and PD, respectively. A total of 65 patients with GD treated with ERT (47 GD1 patients and 18 GD3 patients), 19 GBA1 pathogenic variant carriers (including 10 L444P carriers), and 16 healthy subjects were involved in the study. Lyso-Gb1 was assessed by dried blood spot testing. The level of alpha-synuclein as an mRNA transcript, total, and oligomer protein concentration were measured with real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. alpha-synuclein mRNA level was found significantly elevated in GD3 patients and L444P carriers. GD1 patients, along with GBA1 carriers of an unknown or unconfirmed variant, as well as healthy controls, have the same low level of alpha-synuclein mRNA. There was no correlation found between the level of alpha-synuclein mRNA and age in GD patients treated with ERT, whereas there was a positive correlation in L444P carriers.",

GD is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone complications, and neurological complications. Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a deacylated form of glucosylceramide, has been identified as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment response in GD. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma lyso-Gb1 and therapeutic goals for GD (improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis), as well as disease type and GBA1 mutation type, in Japanese patients with GD receiving velaglucerase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Furthermore, this study compared the plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration observed in Japanese patients included in this study with that observed in a previous non-Japanese clinical study. RESULTS: This non-interventional, open-label, multicenter observational cohort study (October 2020 to March 2021) included a total of 20 patients (of any age) with GD (type 1: n = 8; type 2: n = 9; type 3: n = 3) treated with velaglucerase alfa for >= 3 months. Median (minimum-maximum) duration of velaglucerase alfa treatment was 49.5 (3-107) months. A total of 14 (70.0%) patients achieved all therapeutic goals (i.e., 100% achievement; improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis). Overall, median (minimum-maximum) lyso-Gb1 concentration was 24.3 (2.1-150) ng/mL. Although not statistically significant, numerically lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentrations were observed in patients with 100% achievement compared with those without; no statistically significant difference in plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration was observed between patients with different disease type or mutation type. Furthermore, lyso-Gb1 concentrations observed in Japanese patients were numerically lower than that observed in a previous study of non-Japanese patients with GD receiving ERT. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, high achievement rates of therapeutic goals with low lyso-Gb1 concentration were observed, demonstrating a correlation between therapeutic goals and lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration in Japanese patients with GD treated with velaglucerase alfa. This study further suggests that plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration may be a useful biomarker for treatment response in patients with GD.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 31 patients with type I GD (21 patients with intact spleen and 10 patients with a history of splenectomy) over 18 years. Efficacy was assessed by the change in hemoglobin level (primary endpoint), platelet count, spleen and liver volumes, prevalence of bone marrow infiltration, and the number of patients with quiet hip disease according to magnetic resonance imaging (secondary endpoints). Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as by the incidence of production of imiglucerase binding and neutralizing antibodies (IgG, IgE). The mean follow-up duration was 54 weeks. RESULTS: The study did not show a statistically significant change in hemoglobin levels, platelet count, or spleen and liver volumes. There was an upward tendency in platelet count in the overall group (p=0.1) and patients after splenectomy (p=0.08). The prevalence of specific bone marrow infiltration and the number of patients with quiet hip disease remained unchanged. During the safety analysis, one adverse reaction, a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase, was reported, which resolved spontaneously by the end of the study. The immunogenicity analysis showed the initial presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in 5 (16.7%) of the 30 examined patients. At the end of the study, ADAs were detected in only 3 (10%) patients. The detected ADAs had a low titer and no neutralizing activity, and they did not affect the treatment effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Long-term therapy with the imiglucerase biosimilar was associated with a stable course of GD without progression. It was characterized by a good safety profile and low immunogenicity.",

                    "abstract": "Historically, disease burden and treatment responses in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) was assessed by monitoring clinical data, laboratory, imaging, chitotriosidase (CHITO), and other biomarkers; however, these biomarkers lack specificity and CHITO is uninformative in patients heterozygous or homozygous for the CHIT1 c.1049_1072dup24 variant. Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb1. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations of CHITO and lyso-Gb1; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing lyso-Gb1 levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role of lyso-Gb1 as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for these patients.",

The mean age at diagnosis was 32.46+-12.68 months. Anemia was noted at diagnosis in 50%, thrombocytopenia in 30.7%, severe splenomegaly in 58.7%, severe hepatomegaly in 11.9%, and skeletal findings were detected in 24.3% of the patients. The most prevalent GD type was type 3 (54.5%). Twenty-two of type 3 patients had no neurological manifestations at diagnosis, and 12 developed variable central nervous system manifestations during follow-up. The most common neurological features were limited eye movements, oculomotor apraxia, and squint. Of the 60 patients for whom genotypes were obtained, homozygous L444P was the most common (n=35/60, 58.3%). Treatment with ERT (imiglucerase) revealed significant improvements in blood indices, organ volumes, and growth parameters (P<0.05). Ten (11.7%) type 3 patients did not develop any neurological manifestations under ERT over 20 years. Mortality was 16%, and the 20-year OS was 73.3%. We conclude that in Egypt, type 3 is the most prevalent phenotype of GD, and homozygous L444P is the predominant GBA genotype of GD. Early age at diagnosis and treatment with ERT over 20 years revealed significant improvements in disease manifestations, with an OS of 73.3%.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone diseases, with or without neurological symptoms. Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for GD, has been used for diagnosis and monitoring the response to treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for the non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD (type 2 and 3) accounts for 60%-70% of the Asian affected population. METHODS: We explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 3 (GD3). RESULTS: Four patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The types of donor were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three haploidentical. The age at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 3.8-15 years in the patients with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration of 3-14 years. All patients had successful HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in one patient. The enzyme activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became lower than the pathological value. All of the patients are still alive and physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school. None of the patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after HSCT, but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: ERT followed by HSCT could be considered as an alternative treatment for patients with GD3 who have a high risk of fatal neurological progression.",

We report a case of perinatal lethal Gaucher disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) who survived for 9 months and present a literature review of perinatal lethal Gaucher disease cases. The prognosis of perinatal lethal Gaucher disease is poor, and ERT is only effective in visceral manifestation.

Macrophage-independent dyserythropoiesis and abnormal iron metabolism have been shown. We evaluated hematological and iron status at diagnosis (T0) and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on erythropoiesis and iron utilization over 5-year follow-up in type 1 GD patients and in an ex vivo model of erythropoiesis from CD34 + peripheral blood cells. At T0, 41% of patients had anemia and 51% hyperferritinemia. Hemoglobin increased from 12.6 (T0) to 13.9 g/dL (T6), GFD15, a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased from 5401 to 710 pg/ml, and serum ferritin decreased from 614 to 140 mcg/L (p < 0.001). In parallel, transferrin saturation (TSAT) increased. Hepcidin, although in the normal range, decreased from T0 to T6. Ex vivo studies showed that ERT restores the erythroid cells derived from CD34 + impaired ability to differentiate. During ERT, an increase in TFRC expression, consistent with the ability of erythroid precursors to uptake iron, and a reduction in HAMP and concomitant increase in SLC40A1 were observed. This is the largest study with a longitudinal follow-up evaluating erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, combining clinical and ex vivo data in GD. Iron dysregulation likely contributes to anemia, and ERT, by improving iron distribution, improves erythropoiesis.",

                    "abstract": "Data from 38 children were retrospectively analyzed to determine the patient characteristics of Turkish children with Gaucher disease (GD) and evaluate the impact of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in a pediatric cohort consisting of two different sub-types of the disease, Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) and type 3 (GD3). Both types were represented equally (GD1/GD3 = 20/18). L444P (35.5%) was the most common mutant allele while L444P/L444P (34.2%) was the most common genotype overall. Compound heterozygosity of N370S and L444P homozygosity were the dominant genotypes in Turkish children with GD1 and GD3, respectively. None of the patients had moderate to severe thrombocytopenia at last follow-up while the percent of patients with anemia decreased from 60% to 5.7% (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in mean liver (from 2.2 to 1.6 MN, p < 0.001) and spleen (from 15.5 to 7.6 MN, p < 0.001) volumes were observed in the first year of ERT. Linear growth was ameliorated as shown by the decrease in the percent of patients having short stature from 34.3% to 13.3% (p < 0.01) at year 5. Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteopenia and scoliosis were common skeletal findings. Although none of the patients had lung disease at diagnosis, 20% developed radiological findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement. This single center experience is the first comprehensive study from Turkey not only reporting clinical and genetic characteristics of GD patients but also providing information on the outcomes of ERT in two different sub-types of GD. Genotypic background of Turkish children with GD is similar to western populations. Although visceral and hematological therapeutic goals are reached as early as one year of ERT in both sub-types, achieving normal growth takes several more years than suggested in significant number of children with GD.",

The mean age at diagnosis was 32.46+-12.68 months. Anemia was noted at diagnosis in 50%, thrombocytopenia in 30.7%, severe splenomegaly in 58.7%, severe hepatomegaly in 11.9%, and skeletal findings were detected in 24.3% of the patients. The most prevalent GD type was type 3 (54.5%). Twenty-two of type 3 patients had no neurological manifestations at diagnosis, and 12 developed variable central nervous system manifestations during follow-up. The most common neurological features were limited eye movements, oculomotor apraxia, and squint. Of the 60 patients for whom genotypes were obtained, homozygous L444P was the most common (n=35/60, 58.3%). Treatment with ERT (imiglucerase) revealed significant improvements in blood indices, organ volumes, and growth parameters (P<0.05). Ten (11.7%) type 3 patients did not develop any neurological manifestations under ERT over 20 years. Mortality was 16%, and the 20-year OS was 73.3%. We conclude that in Egypt, type 3 is the most prevalent phenotype of GD, and homozygous L444P is the predominant GBA genotype of GD. Early age at diagnosis and treatment with ERT over 20 years revealed significant improvements in disease manifestations, with an OS of 73.3%.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by GBA1 mutations resulting in glucosylceramide accumulation in macrophages. GD is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone complications, and neurological complications. Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a deacylated form of glucosylceramide, has been identified as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment response in GD. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma lyso-Gb1 and therapeutic goals for GD (improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis), as well as disease type and GBA1 mutation type, in Japanese patients with GD receiving velaglucerase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Furthermore, this study compared the plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration observed in Japanese patients included in this study with that observed in a previous non-Japanese clinical study. RESULTS: This non-interventional, open-label, multicenter observational cohort study (October 2020 to March 2021) included a total of 20 patients (of any age) with GD (type 1: n = 8; type 2: n = 9; type 3: n = 3) treated with velaglucerase alfa for >= 3 months. Median (minimum-maximum) duration of velaglucerase alfa treatment was 49.5 (3-107) months. A total of 14 (70.0%) patients achieved all therapeutic goals (i.e., 100% achievement; improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis). Overall, median (minimum-maximum) lyso-Gb1 concentration was 24.3 (2.1-150) ng/mL. Although not statistically significant, numerically lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentrations were observed in patients with 100% achievement compared with those without; no statistically significant difference in plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration was observed between patients with different disease type or mutation type. Furthermore, lyso-Gb1 concentrations observed in Japanese patients were numerically lower than that observed in a previous study of non-Japanese patients with GD receiving ERT. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, high achievement rates of therapeutic goals with low lyso-Gb1 concentration were observed, demonstrating a correlation between therapeutic goals and lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration in Japanese patients with GD treated with velaglucerase alfa. This study further suggests that plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration may be a useful biomarker for treatment response in patients with GD.",

METHODS: Taliglucerase Alfa Surveillance (TALIAS), a multinational prospective Drug Registry of patients with GD, was established to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective) of taliglucerase alfa. We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females) treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January 7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of 567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment, most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Twelve of the 106 patients experienced serious AEs; two patients experienced four treatment-related serious AEs. Four patients died, although none of the deaths was considered to be related to taliglucerase alfa treatment by the treating physicians. Nine patients discontinued from the study, including the four who died. At baseline, patients with prior ERT had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts than treatment-naive patients, likely reflecting the therapeutic effects of prior treatments. During follow-up, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased in the treatment-naive patients and remained relatively constant or increased slightly in patients with prior ERT. Spleen and liver volumes decreased in treatment-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interim data showed no new or emergent safety signals. The overall interim data are consistent with the clinical program experience and known safety and effectiveness profile of taliglucerase alfa.",

                    "abstract": "This study analyzes the general disease characteristics, impact of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), and overall survival (OS) of 156 Egyptian patients with Gaucher disease (GD) enrolled on hormone replacement from 1998 to 2017. The mean age at diagnosis was 32.46+-12.68 months. Anemia was noted at diagnosis in 50%, thrombocytopenia in 30.7%, severe splenomegaly in 58.7%, severe hepatomegaly in 11.9%, and skeletal findings were detected in 24.3% of the patients. The most prevalent GD type was type 3 (54.5%). Twenty-two of type 3 patients had no neurological manifestations at diagnosis, and 12 developed variable central nervous system manifestations during follow-up. The most common neurological features were limited eye movements, oculomotor apraxia, and squint. Of the 60 patients for whom genotypes were obtained, homozygous L444P was the most common (n=35/60, 58.3%). Treatment with ERT (imiglucerase) revealed significant improvements in blood indices, organ volumes, and growth parameters (P<0.05). Ten (11.7%) type 3 patients did not develop any neurological manifestations under ERT over 20 years. Mortality was 16%, and the 20-year OS was 73.3%. We conclude that in Egypt, type 3 is the most prevalent phenotype of GD, and homozygous L444P is the predominant GBA genotype of GD. Early age at diagnosis and treatment with ERT over 20 years revealed significant improvements in disease manifestations, with an OS of 73.3%.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by GBA1 mutations resulting in glucosylceramide accumulation in macrophages. GD is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone complications, and neurological complications. Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a deacylated form of glucosylceramide, has been identified as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment response in GD. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma lyso-Gb1 and therapeutic goals for GD (improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis), as well as disease type and GBA1 mutation type, in Japanese patients with GD receiving velaglucerase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Furthermore, this study compared the plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration observed in Japanese patients included in this study with that observed in a previous non-Japanese clinical study. RESULTS: This non-interventional, open-label, multicenter observational cohort study (October 2020 to March 2021) included a total of 20 patients (of any age) with GD (type 1: n = 8; type 2: n = 9; type 3: n = 3) treated with velaglucerase alfa for >= 3 months. Median (minimum-maximum) duration of velaglucerase alfa treatment was 49.5 (3-107) months. A total of 14 (70.0%) patients achieved all therapeutic goals (i.e., 100% achievement; improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis). Overall, median (minimum-maximum) lyso-Gb1 concentration was 24.3 (2.1-150) ng/mL. Although not statistically significant, numerically lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentrations were observed in patients with 100% achievement compared with those without; no statistically significant difference in plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration was observed between patients with different disease type or mutation type. Furthermore, lyso-Gb1 concentrations observed in Japanese patients were numerically lower than that observed in a previous study of non-Japanese patients with GD receiving ERT. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, high achievement rates of therapeutic goals with low lyso-Gb1 concentration were observed, demonstrating a correlation between therapeutic goals and lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration in Japanese patients with GD treated with velaglucerase alfa. This study further suggests that plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration may be a useful biomarker for treatment response in patients with GD.",

Both types were represented equally (GD1/GD3 = 20/18). L444P (35.5%) was the most common mutant allele while L444P/L444P (34.2%) was the most common genotype overall. Compound heterozygosity of N370S and L444P homozygosity were the dominant genotypes in Turkish children with GD1 and GD3, respectively. None of the patients had moderate to severe thrombocytopenia at last follow-up while the percent of patients with anemia decreased from 60% to 5.7% (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in mean liver (from 2.2 to 1.6 MN, p < 0.001) and spleen (from 15.5 to 7.6 MN, p < 0.001) volumes were observed in the first year of ERT. Linear growth was ameliorated as shown by the decrease in the percent of patients having short stature from 34.3% to 13.3% (p < 0.01) at year 5. Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteopenia and scoliosis were common skeletal findings. Although none of the patients had lung disease at diagnosis, 20% developed radiological findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement. This single center experience is the first comprehensive study from Turkey not only reporting clinical and genetic characteristics of GD patients but also providing information on the outcomes of ERT in two different sub-types of GD. Genotypic background of Turkish children with GD is similar to western populations. Although visceral and hematological therapeutic goals are reached as early as one year of ERT in both sub-types, achieving normal growth takes several more years than suggested in significant number of children with GD.",

Clinical findings are quite variable and some patients may remain asymptomatic lifelong. However, even when patients have mild symptoms, there is a significant increase in their quality of life with enzyme replacement therapy. We aimed to reveal the relationship between a rare mutation in the Glucosylceramidase Beta (GBA) gene and clinical signs and symptoms. Another aim of the study was to show the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on the quality of life, even in patients with mild symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a 46-year-old male diagnosed with Gaucher disease based on splenic Gaucheromas incidentally discovered in a cardiac computerized tomography scan. In GBA gene analysis, the extremely rare R87W mutation was detected in a homozygous state. In retrospect, the patient had nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and bone pain for a long time, which were substantially ameliorated by enzyme replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: In patients with adult-onset Gaucher disease, the symptoms may be mild, causing significant diagnostic delay. Gaucher disease may be included in the differential diagnosis of abdominal malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve quality of life and prevent unnecessary procedures.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder classically subdivided into type 1 (non-neuronopathic) GD, and types 2 and 3 (neuronopathic) GD. It is typically characterized by clinical manifestations including anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone lesions, and (in more severe forms) neurological impairment. However, less-commonly reported and often under-recognized manifestations exist, which potentially have a significant impact on patient outcomes. Greater efforts are needed to understand, recognize, and manage these manifestations. OBJECTIVES: This review provides a synthesis of published information about three under-recognized GD manifestations (pulmonary involvement, lymphadenopathy, and Gaucheroma) and recommends diagnostic, management, and treatment strategies based on the available literature and author experience. The authors aim to raise awareness about these serious, progressive, and sometimes life-threatening conditions, which are often diagnosed late in life. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the incidence, pathophysiology, prognostic factors, and optimal management of pulmonary involvement, lymphadenopathy, and Gaucheroma in patients with GD. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has shown limited efficacy for the prevention and treatment of these manifestations. More research is needed to evaluate the potential effect of substrate reduction therapy (SRT) with glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors, and to develop additional approaches to treat these GD manifestations. Improvements in data collection registries and international data-sharing are required to better understand the impact of these manifestations on GD patients, help develop effective management strategies, and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.",

Macrophage-independent dyserythropoiesis and abnormal iron metabolism have been shown. We evaluated hematological and iron status at diagnosis (T0) and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on erythropoiesis and iron utilization over 5-year follow-up in type 1 GD patients and in an ex vivo model of erythropoiesis from CD34 + peripheral blood cells. At T0, 41% of patients had anemia and 51% hyperferritinemia. Hemoglobin increased from 12.6 (T0) to 13.9 g/dL (T6), GFD15, a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased from 5401 to 710 pg/ml, and serum ferritin decreased from 614 to 140 mcg/L (p < 0.001). In parallel, transferrin saturation (TSAT) increased. Hepcidin, although in the normal range, decreased from T0 to T6. Ex vivo studies showed that ERT restores the erythroid cells derived from CD34 + impaired ability to differentiate. During ERT, an increase in TFRC expression, consistent with the ability of erythroid precursors to uptake iron, and a reduction in HAMP and concomitant increase in SLC40A1 were observed. This is the largest study with a longitudinal follow-up evaluating erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, combining clinical and ex vivo data in GD. Iron dysregulation likely contributes to anemia, and ERT, by improving iron distribution, improves erythropoiesis.",

Clinical findings are quite variable and some patients may remain asymptomatic lifelong. However, even when patients have mild symptoms, there is a significant increase in their quality of life with enzyme replacement therapy. We aimed to reveal the relationship between a rare mutation in the Glucosylceramidase Beta (GBA) gene and clinical signs and symptoms. Another aim of the study was to show the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on the quality of life, even in patients with mild symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a 46-year-old male diagnosed with Gaucher disease based on splenic Gaucheromas incidentally discovered in a cardiac computerized tomography scan. In GBA gene analysis, the extremely rare R87W mutation was detected in a homozygous state. In retrospect, the patient had nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and bone pain for a long time, which were substantially ameliorated by enzyme replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: In patients with adult-onset Gaucher disease, the symptoms may be mild, causing significant diagnostic delay. Gaucher disease may be included in the differential diagnosis of abdominal malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve quality of life and prevent unnecessary procedures.",

A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

                    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a vast group of more than 50 clinically identified metabolic diseases. They are singly rare, but they affect collectively 1 on 5,000 live births. They result in most of the cases from an enzymatic defect within lysosomes, which causes the subsequent augmentation of unwanted substrates. This accumulation process leads to plenty of clinical signs, determined by the specific substrate and accumulation area. The majority of LSDs present a broad organ and tissue engagement. Brain, connective tissues, viscera and bones are usually afflicted. Among them, brain disease is markedly frequent (two-thirds of LSDs). The most clinically employed approach to treat LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is practiced by administering systemically the missed or defective enzyme. It represents a healthful strategy for 11 LSDs at the moment, but it solves the pathology only in the case of Gaucher disease. This approach, in fact, is not efficacious in the case of LSDs that have an effect on the central nervous system (CNS) due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, ERT suffers from several other weak points, such as low penetration of the exogenously administered enzyme to poorly vascularized areas, the development of immunogenicity and infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and, last but not least, the very high cost and lifelong needed. To ameliorate these weaknesses lot of efforts have been recently spent around the development of innovative nanotechnology-driven ERT strategies. They may boost the power of ERT and minimize adverse reactions by loading enzymes into biodegradable nanomaterials. Enzyme encapsulation into biocompatible liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles, for example, can protect enzymatic activity, eliminating immunologic reactions and premature enzyme degradation. It can also permit a controlled release of the payload, ameliorating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Additionally, the potential to functionalize the surface of the nanocarrier with targeting agents (antibodies or peptides), could promote the passage through biological barriers. In this review we examined the clinically applied ERTs, highlighting limitations that do not allow to completely cure the specific LSD. Later, we critically consider the nanotechnology-based ERT strategies that have beenin-vitroand/orin-vivotested to improve ERT efficacy.",

Agalsidase alfa for Fabry disease and velaglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease are two ERT options with demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability.

This analysis explored the safety profiles of self-administered agalsidase alfa (202 patients) and velaglucerase alfa (30 patients) versus HCP-supported infusions using data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) and Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) registries. RESULTS: The frequency of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) adverse events (AEs) recorded in the two registries was lower in patients self-administering (FOS: 4.5%, GOS: 0%) versus patients receiving HCP-supported infusions (FOS: 13.6%, GOS: 1.6%).

In patients self-administering agalsidase alfa, cardiac disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (19 [9.4%] patients) and serious AEs (12 [5.9%]) and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported IRRs (3 [1.5%]).

                    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder and the most common lysosomal disease caused by the deficiency of enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is successfully applied using mannose-exposed conjugated glucocerebrosidase, the lower stability of the enzyme in blood demands periodic intravenous administration that adds to the high cost of treatment. In this work, the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase was encapsulated inside virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) from brome mosaic virus (BMV), and their surface was functionalized with mannose groups for targeting to macrophages. The VLP nanoreactors showed significant GCase catalytic activity. Moreover, the Michaelis-Menten constants for the free GCase enzyme (KM =0.29 mM) and the functionalized nanoreactors (KM =0.32 mM) were similar even after chemical modification. Importantly, the stability of enzymes under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37  C) was enhanced by  11-fold after encapsulation; this is beneficial for obtaining a higher blood circulation half-life, which may decrease the cost of therapy by reducing the requirement of multiple intravenous injections. Finally, the mannose receptor targeted enzymatic nanoreactors showed enhanced internalization into macrophage cells. Thus, the catalytic activity and cell targeting suggest the potential of these nanoreactors in ERT of Gaucher's disease.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited real-world data from routine clinical care are available on the safety and effectiveness of treatment with taliglucerase alfa in patients with Gaucher disease (GD). METHODS: Taliglucerase Alfa Surveillance (TALIAS), a multinational prospective Drug Registry of patients with GD, was established to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective) of taliglucerase alfa. We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females) treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January 7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of 567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment, most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Twelve of the 106 patients experienced serious AEs; two patients experienced four treatment-related serious AEs. Four patients died, although none of the deaths was considered to be related to taliglucerase alfa treatment by the treating physicians. Nine patients discontinued from the study, including the four who died. At baseline, patients with prior ERT had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts than treatment-naive patients, likely reflecting the therapeutic effects of prior treatments. During follow-up, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased in the treatment-naive patients and remained relatively constant or increased slightly in patients with prior ERT. Spleen and liver volumes decreased in treatment-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interim data showed no new or emergent safety signals. The overall interim data are consistent with the clinical program experience and known safety and effectiveness profile of taliglucerase alfa.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, in which biallelic pathogenic variants in the Glucosidase beta acid (GBA) gene result in defective functioning of glucosylceramidase that causes deposition of glucocerebroside in cells. GD has 3 major types namely, non-neuronopathic (type I), acute neuronopathic (type II), and chronic neuronopathic (type III). Definite treatment options are limited and expensive. They succumb early to the disease, if untreated. There is paucity of studies from the Indian subcontinent, which elicit the factors resulting in their premature mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care setting of South India to assess the clinical profile, mutation spectrum, and various management strategies (only supportive therapy, enzyme replacement therapy [ERT], substrate reduction therapy [SRT] haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT]), and mortality predictors of patients with GD from 2004 to 2019. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted. In silico predictions were performed for novel variants. RESULTS: There were 60 patients with all types of GD seen over the study period of 15 years. Their median age at diagnosis was 2 years. The median follow-up was for 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-8). The overall mortality rate was 35%; however, it was only 10% in those receiving definite treatment. Mortality was higher (47.5%) by more than 4 folds in those only on supportive therapy. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 6.3 years (IQR = 3.5-10.8) in the definite treatment group and 3.5 years (IQR = 1-5) in those on supportive therapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significant (p value 0.001) mortality difference between these groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found the neuronopathic type (OR = 5) and only supportive therapy (OR = 6.3) to be the independent risk factors for premature mortality. CONCLUSION: GD is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, if left untreated. ERT and SRT are the definitive treatments which increase the survival. In resource-limited settings like India, with higher prevalence of the neuronopathic type, HSCT may be a more suitable definitive treatment option, due to its one-time intervention and cost, assuming similar efficacy to ERT. However, the efficacy and safety of HSCT in GD needs to be established further by substantial patient numbers undergoing it.",

Methods: We analyzed short- and long-term dynamics of lyso-glucosylceramide (lyso-Gb1) in a large cohort of GD patients undergoing enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Results: Eight-years analysis of lyso-Gb1 revealed statistically insignificant variability in the biomarker across the years and relatively high individual variability in patients' results. GD type 1 (GD1) patients exhibited higher variability compared to GD type 3 (GD3) patients (coefficients of variation: 34% and 23%, respectively; p-value = 0.0003). We also investigated the short-term response of the biomarker to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), measuring lyso-Gb1 right before and 30 min after treatment administration. We tested 20 GD patients (16 GD1, 4 GD3) and observed a rapid and significant reduction in lyso-Gb1 levels (average decrease of 17%; p-value < 0.0001). This immediate response reaffirms the efficacy of ERT in reducing substrate accumulation in GD patients but, on the other hand, suggests the biomarker's instability between the infusions. Conclusions: These findings underscore lyso-Gb1's potential as a reliable biomarker for monitoring efficacy of treatment. However, individual variability and dry blood spot (DBS) testing limitations urge a further refinement in clinical application. Our study contributes valuable insights into GD patient management, emphasizing the evolving role of biomarkers in personalized medicine.",

Treatment options for these disorders include replacing the deficient enzymes via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Agalsidase alfa for Fabry disease and velaglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease are two ERT options with demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability. ERT infusions administered by a health care provider (HCP) in the clinic/hospital, or at the patient's home are considered HCP-supported infusions. Self-administration of ERT (by patient, partner, relative, or caregiver) is optional in patients who tolerate the HCP-supported infusions at home and have a suitable home environment. This analysis explored the safety profiles of self-administered agalsidase alfa (202 patients) and velaglucerase alfa (30 patients) versus HCP-supported infusions using data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) and Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) registries. RESULTS: The frequency of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) adverse events (AEs) recorded in the two registries was lower in patients self-administering (FOS: 4.5%, GOS: 0%) versus patients receiving HCP-supported infusions (FOS: 13.6%, GOS: 1.6%). In the FOS registry, AE rates per 100 patient-years (100PY) of follow-up were similar between the self-administration (7.99) and HCP-supported infusion (6.78) groups. In patients self-administering agalsidase alfa, cardiac disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (19 [9.4%] patients) and serious AEs (12 [5.9%]) and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported IRRs (3 [1.5%]). In the GOS registry, AE rates per 100PY were similar between self-administration (4.97) and HCP-supported infusion (4.67) groups. In patients self-administering velaglucerase alfa, skin and subcutaneous disorders (4 [13.3%]) and infections and infestations (2 [6.7%]) were the most reported AEs and serious AEs, respectively, and no IRRs were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that self-administration of agalsidase alfa or velaglucerase alfa infusions are not associated with additional safety risks compared with HCP-supported infusions and are a suitable option for qualifying patients.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) can be treated with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT is being administered either in specialized clinics or in the home care setting. Studies indicate that home-based ERT can be considered safe and positively effects patient reported outcomes. Due to the higher level of individual care required by nurses when administering ERT at home, questions arise whether this will result in additional costs for health care systems. Since cost data to the German health care system are currently unavailable, this study aims to assess home care ERT costs of LSD patients. METHODS: The longitudinal study assessed the direct costs of home-based ERT for patients with LSD diseases Fabry, Pompe, Gaucher, and MPS I from 2019 to 2021 on a patient-by-patient basis by evaluating the healthcare documentation. Costs assessed included ERT drug and further administration equipment, time needed to prepare, administer, and post-process the infusion, and travel expenses of nursing staff. RESULTS: Data from 62 patients was analyzed: of these, 29 (46.8%) with Fabry disease, 19 (30.6%) with Pompe disease, 10 (16.1%) with Gaucher disease, and 4 (6.5%) with MPS I. Patients ranged in age from 3 to 79 (mean 40 years); 42% of patients reported comorbidities (19.4% with hypertension, and 10% with heart disease). Mean total ERT-related costs were $369,047 per year across all patients. Approximately 98.5% of these costs were attributable to the infusion therapy and administration itself ($363,880), and approximately 1.5% were attributable to personnel and travel costs. Patients with Pompe disease incurred the highest average annual costs ($483,907) and patients with Fabry disease the lowest ($264,896). Cost differences among underlying LSDs were due primarily to ERT drug costs; the drug infused for Fabry disease costs about half as much as that for Gaucher or for Pompe disease. Despite MPS I patients requiring about twice as many infusions, significantly lower drug costs for this disease resulted in the second lowest total mean costs of all LSD subtypes analyzed. CONCLUSION: As total costs are almost entirely driven by infusion-related material, especially the ERT drug, moving ERT into the home environment is not expected to increase costs.",

It is typically characterized by clinical manifestations including anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone lesions, and (in more severe forms) neurological impairment. However, less-commonly reported and often under-recognized manifestations exist, which potentially have a significant impact on patient outcomes. Greater efforts are needed to understand, recognize, and manage these manifestations. OBJECTIVES: This review provides a synthesis of published information about three under-recognized GD manifestations (pulmonary involvement, lymphadenopathy, and Gaucheroma) and recommends diagnostic, management, and treatment strategies based on the available literature and author experience. The authors aim to raise awareness about these serious, progressive, and sometimes life-threatening conditions, which are often diagnosed late in life. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the incidence, pathophysiology, prognostic factors, and optimal management of pulmonary involvement, lymphadenopathy, and Gaucheroma in patients with GD. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has shown limited efficacy for the prevention and treatment of these manifestations. More research is needed to evaluate the potential effect of substrate reduction therapy (SRT) with glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors, and to develop additional approaches to treat these GD manifestations. Improvements in data collection registries and international data-sharing are required to better understand the impact of these manifestations on GD patients, help develop effective management strategies, and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, results from GBA1 variants causing glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) helps with systemic symptoms, neurological complications in GD2 and GD3 persist due to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) limiting ERT efficacy. Ambroxol, a BBB-permeable chaperone, enhances GCase activity. Our review explores high-dose ambroxol's therapeutic potential, both preclinical and clinical, in GD2 and GD3. METHODS: PubMed was searched for studies published before March 2023, including clinical, animal, and in vitro studies focusing on the effect of high-dose ambroxol in GD2 and GD3. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Nine in vitro, three animal, and eight clinical studies were included, demonstrating varied responses to ambroxol across diverse outcome measures. In vitro and animal studies demonstrated reduced endoplasmatic reticulum stress due to the relocation of GCase from the ER to the lysosomes. In vitro cell lines exhibited varying degrees of increased GCase activity. Clinical trials observed reduced lyso-GL1 levels in plasma (41-89%) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (26-97%), alongside increased GCase activity in GD3 patients. Ambroxol exhibited varying effects on neurological outcomes and development. No severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: High-dose ambroxol shows promise in managing neurological manifestations in GD3, albeit with uncertainties resulting from genetic heterogeneity and variable response. Further clinical trials, are essential for elucidating dosage-response relationships and refining treatment outcomes and strategies for neuronopathic GD.",

This study evaluates bone health in adult GD type 1 patients, focusing on skeletal complications, bone mineral density (BMD), and biochemical markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of adult GD type 1 patients followed up at Ege University Pediatric Metabolism Department were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: This study included 32 patients with GD type 1, comprising 11 males (34.4%) and 21 females (65.6%). The median age at diagnosis was 20.5 years (min: 3-max:65), and at enrolment, it was 35 years (min:18-max:71). Most patients (93.8%) had organomegaly, and 93.8% had cytopenia. Common genetic variants were p.Asn409Ser (60.9%), p.Leu483Pro (7.8%), and p.Asp448His(4.7%). All patients were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for a median of 11 years (min:2-max:18). Bone complications included pathologic fractures in six patients (19%) and avascular necrosis in 12 patients (37.5%). Bone pain was reported by 93.7% of patients at admission and persisted in 59.4% during follow-up. DXA scans showed abnormal bone mineral density (BMD) in 62.5% of patients initially, with a significantly low bone density in 3.1% and reduced bone density in 59.3%. BMD improved with treatment, as evidenced by a significant increase in Z scores (p < 0.05). Elevated chitotriosidase (75%), ferritin (50%), and immunoglobulin G (21.9%) levels were noted but did not correlate with BMD. Seven patients (22%) were splenectomized, all with bone issues. DISCUSSION: Bone health in GD involves multiple factors beyond biochemical markers. While ERT improves BMD, bone pain and fractures remain significant issues. Comprehensive management, including regular BMD monitoring and better vitamin D supplementation adherence, is crucial. Further research is needed to improve treatments for bone complications in GD.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fabry disease and Gaucher disease are rare genetic disorders characterized by defective degradation of glycosphingolipids caused by enzymatic deficiencies in alpha-galactosidase A and beta-glucocerebrosidase, respectively, and often require life-long treatment. Treatment options for these disorders include replacing the deficient enzymes via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Agalsidase alfa for Fabry disease and velaglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease are two ERT options with demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability. ERT infusions administered by a health care provider (HCP) in the clinic/hospital, or at the patient's home are considered HCP-supported infusions. Self-administration of ERT (by patient, partner, relative, or caregiver) is optional in patients who tolerate the HCP-supported infusions at home and have a suitable home environment. This analysis explored the safety profiles of self-administered agalsidase alfa (202 patients) and velaglucerase alfa (30 patients) versus HCP-supported infusions using data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) and Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) registries. RESULTS: The frequency of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) adverse events (AEs) recorded in the two registries was lower in patients self-administering (FOS: 4.5%, GOS: 0%) versus patients receiving HCP-supported infusions (FOS: 13.6%, GOS: 1.6%). In the FOS registry, AE rates per 100 patient-years (100PY) of follow-up were similar between the self-administration (7.99) and HCP-supported infusion (6.78) groups. In patients self-administering agalsidase alfa, cardiac disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (19 [9.4%] patients) and serious AEs (12 [5.9%]) and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported IRRs (3 [1.5%]). In the GOS registry, AE rates per 100PY were similar between self-administration (4.97) and HCP-supported infusion (4.67) groups. In patients self-administering velaglucerase alfa, skin and subcutaneous disorders (4 [13.3%]) and infections and infestations (2 [6.7%]) were the most reported AEs and serious AEs, respectively, and no IRRs were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that self-administration of agalsidase alfa or velaglucerase alfa infusions are not associated with additional safety risks compared with HCP-supported infusions and are a suitable option for qualifying patients. Further research is warranted to support these findings and to explore further the long-term safety and efficacy of ERT self-administration. FOS trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03289065.

This prospective clinical trial assessed the oxidant-antioxidant status in Egyptian patients with GD and the efficacy and safety and of vitamin E as an adjuvant antioxidant therapy. Forty children and adolescents with GD on stable doses of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) were enrolled. Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography were performed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes (reduced glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], and peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2]) were assessed. Patients were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with GD were randomized either to receive oral vitamin E for 6 months or not. All patients with GD had significantly higher MDA levels with lower levels of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Vitamin E and PRDX2 were negatively correlated to severity score index (SSI), lyso GL1, and MDA. After 6 months of vitamin E supplementation, SSI and liver and spleen volumes and liver stiffness were significantly lower. Lyso GL1 and MDA were significantly decreased post-vitamin E therapy while antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher compared with baseline levels and with patients without vitamin E therapy. Oxidative stress is related to disease severity in pediatric patients with GD. A 6-month vitamin E supplementation for those patients represents a safe therapeutic adjuvant agent increasing the efficacy of ERT, reducing oxidative stress, and improving outcomes.",

The 17-year-old female presented with 5 months of right knee pain with associated mass on exam. She was diagnosed with ES with pulmonary metastasis. The patient was treated with 17 alternating cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide and etoposide chemotherapy followed by tumor resection and radiation per standard protocol. As part of her staging work-up, bone marrow biopsy was performed, significant for Gaucher cells. After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient began to experience severe delays averaging 30 days between cycles compared to 17.29 days observed in Children's Oncology Group data. Given her bone marrow biopsy findings and chemotherapy delays GD screening was obtained and the patient was diagnosed with GD following genetic confirmation. Due to delays in chemotherapy decreasing chance of remission, the patient was referred to Genetics for aggressive management with imiglucerase and eliglustat. After initiation of therapy the period between chemotherapy cycles decreased to 23 days on average, with a 21% increase in platelet count during therapy. The patient was able to complete ES therapy achieving remission. GD is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, as seen in our patient with ES. GD patients experience prolonged hematologic cytopenia during cancer treatment. Combining Enzyme and Substrate Reduction Therapies should be investigated as an option to improve chemotherapy adherence in GD patients.",

METHODS: A prospective follow-up, semi-experimental multi-centre study was conducted in four hospitals to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ERT in GD1 patients. Twenty-five individuals with 266 glucocerebrosidase (GCase) observations in plasma and leukocytes and 14 individuals with 68 Spanish magnetic resonance imaging (S-MRI) observations were enrolled. RESULTS: A two concatenated compartment model with zero-order endogenous production and first-order distribution (CL1  = 3.85 x 10-1 L/d) and elimination (CL2  = 1.25 L/d) allowed GCase observations in plasma and leukocytes to be described, respectively. An exponential time dependency (kT  = 6.14 x 10-1 d-1 ) effect on CL1 was incorporated. The final exposure-efficacy model was a longitudinal logistic regression model with a first-order Markov element. An Emax function (EC50  = 15.73 U/L and Emax  = 2.33) linked steady-state concentrations of GCase in leukocytes to the probability of transition across the different S-MRI stages. CONCLUSION: A population pharmacokinetic model successfully characterized the leukocyte activity-time profiles of GCase following intravenous administration of ERT in GD1 patients together with an exposure-efficacy relationship in bone marrow using Markovian elements. The information obtained from this study could be of high clinical relevance in individualization of ERT in GD1 patients, as this could lead to anticipative decision-making regarding clinical response in bone and optimal dosing strategy.",

We evaluated the \"real-world\" effectiveness of first-line imiglucerase on long-term bone outcomes in Italian patients in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry. METHODS: Patients treated with imiglucerase for >=2 years and with bone assessments at baseline and during follow-up were selected. Data on bone pain, bone crises, marrow infiltration, avascular necrosis, infarction, lytic lesions, Erlenmeyer flask deformity, bone fractures, mineral density, and imiglucerase dosage were evaluated. RESULTS: Data on bone manifestations were available for 73 of 229 patients (31.9 %). Bone crises frequency decreased significantly from baseline to the most recent follow-up (p < 0.001), with some improvement observed in bone pain prevalence. Bone pain and bone crises prevalence decreased significantly from baseline at 2 to <4 and 4 to <6 years (all p < 0.05). A low median (25th, 75th percentile) baseline imiglucerase dosage was identified in patients reporting bone pain or bone crises (15.0 [13.7, 30.0] and 22.8 [17.5, 36.0] U/kg once every 2 weeks, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the management of GD in Italy, with regards to imiglucerase dosage, is suboptimal and confirms the need for clinicians to monitor and correctly treat bone disease according to best practice guidelines.",

                    "abstract": "Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder and the most common lysosomal disease caused by the deficiency of enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is successfully applied using mannose-exposed conjugated glucocerebrosidase, the lower stability of the enzyme in blood demands periodic intravenous administration that adds to the high cost of treatment. In this work, the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase was encapsulated inside virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) from brome mosaic virus (BMV), and their surface was functionalized with mannose groups for targeting to macrophages. The VLP nanoreactors showed significant GCase catalytic activity. Moreover, the Michaelis-Menten constants for the free GCase enzyme (KM =0.29 mM) and the functionalized nanoreactors (KM =0.32 mM) were similar even after chemical modification. Importantly, the stability of enzymes under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37  C) was enhanced by  11-fold after encapsulation; this is beneficial for obtaining a higher blood circulation half-life, which may decrease the cost of therapy by reducing the requirement of multiple intravenous injections. Finally, the mannose receptor targeted enzymatic nanoreactors showed enhanced internalization into macrophage cells. Thus, the catalytic activity and cell targeting suggest the potential of these nanoreactors in ERT of Gaucher's disease.",

Socio-ethical considerations of justified applications for PGT are part of an ongoing debate. Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene, causing Gaucher disease (GD), have emerged as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) in both patients and carriers. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist between different GBA1 pathogenic variants and the risk to develop PD: mild pathogenic variants increase the risk of developing PD by ~3-fold, while severe pathogenic variants increase this risk by ~15-fold, occurring at a younger age. A woman with GD, a compound heterozygote of N370S (now commonly described as c.1226A>G (N409S)-mild pathogenic variant) and 84insG (severe pathogenic variant), had PGT consulting before planned in vitro-fertilization. Her mother, an 84insG carrier, had early-onset PD. GBA1 sequencing of her spouse was negative. We discussed the selection for N370S carrier embryos to reduce PD risk. This case report demonstrates the expansion of PGT for late-onset conditions. These novel indications will increase the number of subjects who would be candidates for PGT. The medical and bioethical considerations of these cases should be acknowledged by the professional community and discussed with couples during genetic counseling.",

The attributes included to establish participants' risk tolerance were previously identified in focus groups of affected people or their representatives, namely: risk of mild side effects, severe side effects, the need for additional medication, and the likelihood of long-term effectiveness. The survey was distributed among people receiving outpatient care for type 1 Gaucher disease (good prognosis with current treatment options), Fabry disease (varying prognosis with current treatment options, XY-genotype on average more severely affected than XX), and parents representing people with severe forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B (poor prognosis, no disease-specific therapy available). RESULTS: A total of 85 surveys were completed (15 Gaucher disease respondents, 62 Fabry disease respondents (17 self-identifying male), eight parents of ten people with mucopolysaccharidosis type III). Disease groups with higher disease severity trended towards higher risk tolerance: Gaucher disease respondents were most cautious and predominantly preferred the current standard of care as opposed to MPS III representatives who were more risk tolerant. Respondents with Fabry disease were most heterogeneous in their risk tolerance, with male participants being more risk tolerant than female participants. Long-term effectiveness was the attribute in which respondents tolerated the least risk. CONCLUSIONS: People affected by a lysosomal storage disease associated with a poorer prognosis and less effective current treatment options trended towards more risk tolerance when choosing between gene therapy and the current standard of care. This study shows the importance of involvement of patient preferences before and during the development process of new treatment modalities such as gene therapy for rare diseases, to ensure that innovative therapies align with the wishes and needs of people affected by these diseases.",

The 17-year-old female presented with 5 months of right knee pain with associated mass on exam. She was diagnosed with ES with pulmonary metastasis. The patient was treated with 17 alternating cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide and etoposide chemotherapy followed by tumor resection and radiation per standard protocol. As part of her staging work-up, bone marrow biopsy was performed, significant for Gaucher cells. After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient began to experience severe delays averaging 30 days between cycles compared to 17.29 days observed in Children's Oncology Group data. Given her bone marrow biopsy findings and chemotherapy delays GD screening was obtained and the patient was diagnosed with GD following genetic confirmation. Due to delays in chemotherapy decreasing chance of remission, the patient was referred to Genetics for aggressive management with imiglucerase and eliglustat. After initiation of therapy the period between chemotherapy cycles decreased to 23 days on average, with a 21% increase in platelet count during therapy. The patient was able to complete ES therapy achieving remission. GD is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, as seen in our patient with ES. GD patients experience prolonged hematologic cytopenia during cancer treatment. Combining Enzyme and Substrate Reduction Therapies should be investigated as an option to improve chemotherapy adherence in GD patients.",

RESULTS: 24 children, (mucopolysaccharidosis - 13, Gaucher disease - 4, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy - 4, metachromatic leukodystrophy - 2, Krabbe disease - 1) were included. Donors were matched family donors in 24%, matched unrelated donors in 34%, and haploidentical fathers in 42% of the transplants, with engraftment in 91% of children. Overall survival was 72% (55-100%) with a median follow-up of 76.5 (10-120 ) months, and progression-free survival of 68% (MPS-76%, X-ALD -60%, Gaucher disease - 50%, and 100% in MLD and Krabbe disease).

We enrolled 40 patients: 28 ERT- or SRT-treated, and 12 naive. There were no severe adverse effects (AEs). There were 24 dropouts, mostly due to AEs (n = 12), all transient, and COVID-19 (n = 7). Among the 16 completers, 5 (31.2%) had a >20% increase in platelet count, 6 (37.5%) had a >0.2 increase in T-score, and 3 (18.7%) had a >20% decrease in Lyso-Gb1. This study expands the number of patients exposed to high-dose ABX, showing good safety and satisfactory efficacy, and provides an additional rationale for adding off-label ABX to the arsenal of therapies that could be offered to patients with GD1 and a suboptimal response or those unable to receive ERT or SRT.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Gaucher disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, results from GBA1 variants causing glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) helps with systemic symptoms, neurological complications in GD2 and GD3 persist due to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) limiting ERT efficacy. Ambroxol, a BBB-permeable chaperone, enhances GCase activity. Our review explores high-dose ambroxol's therapeutic potential, both preclinical and clinical, in GD2 and GD3. METHODS: PubMed was searched for studies published before March 2023, including clinical, animal, and in vitro studies focusing on the effect of high-dose ambroxol in GD2 and GD3. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Nine in vitro, three animal, and eight clinical studies were included, demonstrating varied responses to ambroxol across diverse outcome measures. In vitro and animal studies demonstrated reduced endoplasmatic reticulum stress due to the relocation of GCase from the ER to the lysosomes. In vitro cell lines exhibited varying degrees of increased GCase activity. Clinical trials observed reduced lyso-GL1 levels in plasma (41-89%) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (26-97%), alongside increased GCase activity in GD3 patients. Ambroxol exhibited varying effects on neurological outcomes and development. No severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: High-dose ambroxol shows promise in managing neurological manifestations in GD3, albeit with uncertainties resulting from genetic heterogeneity and variable response. Further clinical trials, are essential for elucidating dosage-response relationships and refining treatment outcomes and strategies for neuronopathic GD.",

Gaucher disease (GD) is a prototype rare disease that shares with SARS-CoV-2 a disruption of the lysosomal pathway. MATERIALS-METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 11 patients with Type 1 GD who developed COVID-19 between March 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: Seven male and 4 female patients with Type 1 GD developed COVID-19. One was a pediatric patient (8 years old) while the remainder were adults, median age of 44 years old (range 21 to 64 years old). Two patients required hospitalization though none required intensive care or intubation. All 11 patients recovered from COVID-19 and there were no reported deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our case series suggests that GD patients acquired COVID-19 at a similar frequency as the general population, though experienced a milder overall course despite harboring underlying immune system dysfunction and other known co-morbidities that confer high risk of adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Socio-ethical considerations of justified applications for PGT are part of an ongoing debate. Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene, causing Gaucher disease (GD), have emerged as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) in both patients and carriers. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist between different GBA1 pathogenic variants and the risk to develop PD: mild pathogenic variants increase the risk of developing PD by ~3-fold, while severe pathogenic variants increase this risk by ~15-fold, occurring at a younger age. A woman with GD, a compound heterozygote of N370S (now commonly described as c.1226A>G (N409S)-mild pathogenic variant) and 84insG (severe pathogenic variant), had PGT consulting before planned in vitro-fertilization. Her mother, an 84insG carrier, had early-onset PD. GBA1 sequencing of her spouse was negative. We discussed the selection for N370S carrier embryos to reduce PD risk. This case report demonstrates the expansion of PGT for late-onset conditions. These novel indications will increase the number of subjects who would be candidates for PGT. The medical and bioethical considerations of these cases should be acknowledged by the professional community and discussed with couples during genetic counseling.",

A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper-free strain promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes beta-glucocerebrosidase and acid alpha-glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best beta-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene-based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4-fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne-presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare disorder linked to the absence/deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. GD can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). The aim of this systematic review (SR) is to assess the effectiveness of drugs used for GD treatment. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in April 2021. The search strategies encompassed the name of the disease and of the drug treatments. Manual search was also conducted. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Observational and interventional longitudinal studies evaluating ERT and SRT for GD were included. Single mean meta-analyses were conducted for each drug using R. DATA SYNTHESIS: The initial search retrieved 2246 articles after duplicates were removed. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 68 reports were included. The studies evaluated imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, taliglucerase alfa, miglustat, and eliglustat. The results showed that ERT is effective as a treatment in both naive and experienced patients. Miglustat did not significantly improve blood outcomes in naive patients and resulted in a decrease in the platelet levels of experienced patients. Eliglustat was mainly assessed for experienced patients and resulted in stable outcome values. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This extensive SR confirms the effectiveness of GD treatments in short- and long-term follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: The results were favorable for all ERTs and for eliglustat. Based on the assessed evidence, miglustat did not achieved expressive results. However, all evidence should be interpreted considering its limitations and does not replace well-conducted randomized trials.",

In 2018, we published the safety and efficacy of rapid 10-min infusion of velaglucerase alfa in previously treated patients, mostly on low-dose therapy. AIM: To improve quality of life (QoL) for patients needing lifelong bi-weekly infusions by introducing a 10-min infusion instead of 1 h per label in patients naive to ERT and on high-dose therapy. METHODS: Fifteen naive patients were enrolled; all received bi-weekly infusions of 60 units/kgBW velaglucerase alfa; the infusion rate was gradually reduced in the hospital, followed by home infusions. Each infusion was followed for safety. Efficacy parameters were assessed every 3 months. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires were collected at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Ten-minute rapid infusions were well tolerated without related severe adverse events (SAEs). Two patients experienced a non-related SAE and another a possibly related AE. In three patients, the infusion rate was increased to 30 or 60 min (two because of suboptimal response and one because of AE). Two patients dropped out because of an unwillingness to attend follow-up visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 13 remaining patients reached the 24-month end-point. The platelet counts increased by a median (range) of 68.38% (12.5-300%) and the lyso-Gb1 levels decreased by 62.6% (32.9-89.9%). CONCLUSION: Home therapy with rapid infusion of high-dose velaglucerase alfa was a safe, effective and preferable alternative for patients with GD naive to treatment. We believe that shortening the infusion time improves the QoL of patients with GD who have a lifelong commitment to intravenous therapy.",

Enzyme replacement therapy alleviates visceral signs and symptoms but has no effect on neurological features. Ambroxol has been suggested as an enzyme enhancement agent. Some studies have confirmed its effectiveness in preventing the progression of neurological manifestations of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. In this study, we report two GD3 siblings in whom ambroxol combined with enzyme replacement therapy was initiated at different stages of the disease. We demonstrate the enzyme enhancement effect of ambroxol on L444P/H225Q;D409H glucocerebrosidase activity through results of fibroblast studies and long-term clinical outcomes of the two patients. The sibling diagnosed at the age of four-and-a-half years with significant neurological involvement manifested relatively rapid improvement on ambroxol treatment, followed by stabilization of further course. The younger sibling, in whom the treatment was started at seven weeks, displayed attention deficit and low average cognitive functioning at the age of seven years, but did not manifest other neurological symptoms. The difference in neurological outcomes indicates that ambroxol delayed or even halted the evolution of neurological manifestations in the younger sibling. This observation suggests that early initiation of ambroxol treatment may arrest neurological involvement in some GD3 patients.",

METHODS: A prospective follow-up, semi-experimental multi-centre study was conducted in four hospitals to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ERT in GD1 patients. Twenty-five individuals with 266 glucocerebrosidase (GCase) observations in plasma and leukocytes and 14 individuals with 68 Spanish magnetic resonance imaging (S-MRI) observations were enrolled. RESULTS: A two concatenated compartment model with zero-order endogenous production and first-order distribution (CL1  = 3.85 x 10-1 L/d) and elimination (CL2  = 1.25 L/d) allowed GCase observations in plasma and leukocytes to be described, respectively. An exponential time dependency (kT  = 6.14 x 10-1 d-1 ) effect on CL1 was incorporated. The final exposure-efficacy model was a longitudinal logistic regression model with a first-order Markov element. An Emax function (EC50  = 15.73 U/L and Emax  = 2.33) linked steady-state concentrations of GCase in leukocytes to the probability of transition across the different S-MRI stages. CONCLUSION: A population pharmacokinetic model successfully characterized the leukocyte activity-time profiles of GCase following intravenous administration of ERT in GD1 patients together with an exposure-efficacy relationship in bone marrow using Markovian elements. The information obtained from this study could be of high clinical relevance in individualization of ERT in GD1 patients, as this could lead to anticipative decision-making regarding clinical response in bone and optimal dosing strategy.",

Heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes have been observed within GD types and across ethnicities. Enzyme replacement therapy is generally recommended for patients with type 1 GD, the least severe form of GD. In Japan, velaglucerase alfa has a broad indication covering type 1, 2 or 3 GD.  METHODS: All patients with type 1, 2, or 3 GD administered velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion after its launch date in Japan in 2014, were enrolled in a non-interventional, observational post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Individual patient data were reported via case report forms (CRFs). Key safety endpoints investigated included the incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), the safety of velaglucerase alfa in patients with types 2 and 3 GD, from patients under one year of age to elderly patients (>= 65 years of age). Long-term efficacy was also assessed.  RESULTS: In total, 53 patients with GD were registered. CRFs were available for 41 (77.4%) patients at the 6-year interim analysis. Fourteen adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in seven patients. All reported ADRs occurred in patients with type 2 GD. ADRs were reported by 63.6% (7/11) of patients with type 2 GD. Ten ADRs were reported in five patients aged < 4 years. No elderly patients experienced any ADR during the surveillance period. Five ADRs occurring in three (10.0%) patients were classified as IRRs, with one case of vomiting (moderate severity) resulting in treatment discontinuation. Ten serious adverse events were reported in five (16.7%) patients. Three fatal events were considered to be unrelated to treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Platelet counts increased after the administration of velaglucerase alfa and were generally maintained within the normal range over the administration period. Among eleven patients tested for neutralizing anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies, two (18.2%) were assessed as positive results.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by reduced lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes have been observed within GD types and across ethnicities. Enzyme replacement therapy is generally recommended for patients with type 1 GD, the least severe form of GD. In Japan, velaglucerase alfa has a broad indication covering type 1, 2 or 3 GD.  METHODS: All patients with type 1, 2, or 3 GD administered velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion after its launch date in Japan in 2014, were enrolled in a non-interventional, observational post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Individual patient data were reported via case report forms (CRFs). Key safety endpoints investigated included the incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), the safety of velaglucerase alfa in patients with types 2 and 3 GD, from patients under one year of age to elderly patients (>= 65 years of age). Long-term efficacy was also assessed.  RESULTS: In total, 53 patients with GD were registered. CRFs were available for 41 (77.4%) patients at the 6-year interim analysis. Fourteen adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in seven patients. All reported ADRs occurred in patients with type 2 GD. ADRs were reported by 63.6% (7/11) of patients with type 2 GD. Ten ADRs were reported in five patients aged < 4 years. No elderly patients experienced any ADR during the surveillance period. Five ADRs occurring in three (10.0%) patients were classified as IRRs, with one case of vomiting (moderate severity) resulting in treatment discontinuation. Ten serious adverse events were reported in five (16.7%) patients. Three fatal events were considered to be unrelated to treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Platelet counts increased after the administration of velaglucerase alfa and were generally maintained within the normal range over the administration period. Among eleven patients tested for neutralizing anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies, two (18.2%) were assessed as positive results.  CONCLUSION: PMS data from patients with types 1-3 GD in Japan indicate that long-term treatment with velaglucerase alfa was well-tolerated and associated with increased platelet counts, which is consistent with observations made in studies outside of Japan.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variants of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), resulting in the impairment of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme function and the accumulation of a glycolipid substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within lysosomes. Current therapeutic approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy cannot fully rescue GD pathologies, especially neurological symptoms. Meanwhile, delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of affected human cells is a promising strategy for treating neuropathic LSDs. RESULT: Here, we describe a novel approach to restore GCase enzyme in cells from neuropathic GD patients by producing extracellular vesicle (EVs)-containing GCase from cells overexpressing GBA1 gene. Lentiviral vectors containing modified GBA1 were introduced into HEK293T cells to produce a stable cell line that provides a sustainable source of functional GCase enzyme. The GBA1-overexpressing cells released EV-containing GCase enzyme, that is capable of entering into and localizing in the endocytic compartment of recipient cells, including THP-1 macrophage, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, and macrophages and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of neuropathic GD patients. Importantly, the recipient cells exhibit higher GCase enzyme activity. CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe types of LSDs. It involves delivering lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of human cells affected by conditions such as GDs with neurological symptoms, as well as potentially other neurological disorders impacting lysosomes.",

                    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a vast group of more than 50 clinically identified metabolic diseases. They are singly rare, but they affect collectively 1 on 5,000 live births. They result in most of the cases from an enzymatic defect within lysosomes, which causes the subsequent augmentation of unwanted substrates. This accumulation process leads to plenty of clinical signs, determined by the specific substrate and accumulation area. The majority of LSDs present a broad organ and tissue engagement. Brain, connective tissues, viscera and bones are usually afflicted. Among them, brain disease is markedly frequent (two-thirds of LSDs). The most clinically employed approach to treat LSDs is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is practiced by administering systemically the missed or defective enzyme. It represents a healthful strategy for 11 LSDs at the moment, but it solves the pathology only in the case of Gaucher disease. This approach, in fact, is not efficacious in the case of LSDs that have an effect on the central nervous system (CNS) due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, ERT suffers from several other weak points, such as low penetration of the exogenously administered enzyme to poorly vascularized areas, the development of immunogenicity and infusion-associated reactions (IARs), and, last but not least, the very high cost and lifelong needed. To ameliorate these weaknesses lot of efforts have been recently spent around the development of innovative nanotechnology-driven ERT strategies. They may boost the power of ERT and minimize adverse reactions by loading enzymes into biodegradable nanomaterials. Enzyme encapsulation into biocompatible liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles, for example, can protect enzymatic activity, eliminating immunologic reactions and premature enzyme degradation. It can also permit a controlled release of the payload, ameliorating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Additionally, the potential to functionalize the surface of the nanocarrier with targeting agents (antibodies or peptides), could promote the passage through biological barriers. In this review we examined the clinically applied ERTs, highlighting limitations that do not allow to completely cure the specific LSD. Later, we critically consider the nanotechnology-based ERT strategies that have beenin-vitroand/orin-vivotested to improve ERT efficacy.",

We examined the long-term effect of eliglustat treatment on bone outcomes in clinical trials in adults with Gaucher disease type 1. METHODS: Data from 4 completed phase 2 and 3 trials were evaluated in treatment-naive patients or patients switching to eliglustat from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). RESULTS: Overall, 319 of 393 (81%) eliglustat-treated patients remained in their trials until completion or commercial eliglustat became available. Mean eliglustat treatment duration ranged from 3.3 to 6.5 years. In treatment-naive patients and ERT-switch patients, frequency and severity of bone pain decreased during eliglustat treatment. Mean lumbar spine T-scores shifted from abnormal to normal in treatment-naive patients and remained in the healthy reference range or improved modestly in ERT-switch patients. Mean total bone marrow burden score shifted from marked-to-severe to moderate in treatment-naive patients and remained moderate in ERT-switch patients. MIP-1beta (marker of active bone disease) was elevated at baseline and decreased to the healthy reference range in treatment-naive patients and remained in the healthy reference range among ERT-switch patients. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the long-term efficacy of eliglustat on skeletal complications of Gaucher disease in treatment-naive and ERT-switch patients.",

                    "abstract": "Historically, disease burden and treatment responses in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) was assessed by monitoring clinical data, laboratory, imaging, chitotriosidase (CHITO), and other biomarkers; however, these biomarkers lack specificity and CHITO is uninformative in patients heterozygous or homozygous for the CHIT1 c.1049_1072dup24 variant. Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb1. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations of CHITO and lyso-Gb1; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing lyso-Gb1 levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role of lyso-Gb1 as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for these patients.",

                    "abstract": "Lysosomal enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) holds potential for treating lysosomal storage disorders, but achieving targeted delivery of deficient therapeutic enzymes remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel approach for the lysosome-specific delivery of the beta-glucosidase (B8CYA8) enzyme by covalently conjugating lysosome-targeting mannose-6-phosphate functionalized glycopolypeptides (M6P-GP). We used a protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate developed through advanced protein engineering and bioconjugation techniques. By conjugating beta-glucosidase to M6P-GP that has a high affinity for the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPR) and lysosomal receptors, we enhance the enzyme's selective intracellular uptake and lysosome-specific localization. To attain maximum activity of the near-native enzyme after delivery, we have designed and synthesized an acetal linkage containing the pH-responsive linker maleimide-acetal-azide (MAA), which will cleave in the lysosomal acidic pH to detach the glycopolypeptide from the protein backbone. We demonstrated the efficient cellular uptake of the protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate and showed targeted lysosome delivery, leading to increased enzymatic activity compared to untreated cells. Our results proved that the approach mainly improves the specificity and efficiency of enzyme delivery, particularly into lysosomes, which may enable new methods for ERT. These findings suggest that protein-glycopolypeptide conjugates could represent a class of bioconjugates to design targeted enzyme therapies, offering a pathway to the effective treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) and potentially other related lysosomal storage disorders.",

We perform a structural analysis of variants within three inherited lysosomal storage disorders, comparing variants responsive to pharmacological chaperone treatment to those unresponsive to such treatment. We find that predicted DeltaDeltaG of mutation is higher on average for variants unresponsive to treatment, in the case of datasets for both Fabry disease and Pompe disease, in line with previous findings. Using both a single decision tree and an advanced machine learning approach based on the larger Fabry dataset, we correctly predict responsiveness of three Gaucher disease variants, and we provide predictions for untested variants. Many variants are predicted to be responsive to treatment, suggesting that drug-based treatments may be effective for a number of variants in Gaucher disease. In our analysis, we observe dependence on a topological feature reporting on contact arrangements which is likely connected to the order of folding of protein residues, and we provide a potential justification for this observation based on steady-state cellular kinetics.",

Skeletal involvement is one of the main features of GD, causing morbidity and impacting long-term quality of life in patients with type 1 GD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize bone marrow infiltration in patients with type 1 GD followed at the Gaucher Disease Referral Center of Porto Alegre, Brazil, and to assess whether the Bone Marrow Burden score (BMB) correlates with clinical or laboratory parameters. We also evaluated whether the BMB score is a suitable parameter for long-term follow-up of patients with type 1 GD. METHODS: All included patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging for BMB score calculation at baseline, 1 year, and every other year thereafter or as clinically indicated from 2012 to 2018. RESULTS: The BMB score tended to decrease during the first 5 years of treatment, at a rate of -1.08 points per year; after the 5-year mark, BMB tended to remain stable. CONCLUSIONS: The BMB score is useful for response monitoring in the first five years of treatment. We recommend that, after 5 years of treatment, MRI for BMB evaluation should only be performed in non-adherent patients or in those who develop symptoms of acute skeletal disease.",

                    "abstract": "Background: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, leading to beta-glucocerebrosidase deficiency and glucosylceramide accumulation. Methods: We analyzed short- and long-term dynamics of lyso-glucosylceramide (lyso-Gb1) in a large cohort of GD patients undergoing enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Results: Eight-years analysis of lyso-Gb1 revealed statistically insignificant variability in the biomarker across the years and relatively high individual variability in patients' results. GD type 1 (GD1) patients exhibited higher variability compared to GD type 3 (GD3) patients (coefficients of variation: 34% and 23%, respectively; p-value = 0.0003). We also investigated the short-term response of the biomarker to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), measuring lyso-Gb1 right before and 30 min after treatment administration. We tested 20 GD patients (16 GD1, 4 GD3) and observed a rapid and significant reduction in lyso-Gb1 levels (average decrease of 17%; p-value < 0.0001). This immediate response reaffirms the efficacy of ERT in reducing substrate accumulation in GD patients but, on the other hand, suggests the biomarker's instability between the infusions. Conclusions: These findings underscore lyso-Gb1's potential as a reliable biomarker for monitoring efficacy of treatment. However, individual variability and dry blood spot (DBS) testing limitations urge a further refinement in clinical application. Our study contributes valuable insights into GD patient management, emphasizing the evolving role of biomarkers in personalized medicine.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic-uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) is a severe illness predominantly affecting young children, with limited treatment options beyond supportive care. Eliglustat, approved for Gaucher disease, shows potential in reducing Shiga toxin binding to target glomerular endothelial cells in vitro, prompting interest as a treatment for STEC-HUS. However, it remains unknown what dose is likely to be effective and safe for treatment of STEC-HUS in the pediatric population. We hypothesize that effective and safe levels of eliglustat can be reached in children. METHODS: We identified pharmacokinetic targets of efficacy for treatment and prophylaxis of STEC-HUS based on a preclinical model and human cardiac safety data. Then, we developed oral and intravenous dosing regimens using population pharmacokinetic (popPK) simulations based on an existing model enriched to allow extrapolation to a simulated virtual pediatric population. These dosing regimens were then confirmed using a verified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. RESULTS: We simulated, using popPK data, oral and intravenous dosing regimens resulting in adequate target exposure in > 90% of all patients, with minimal expected risk for cardiotoxicity. Confirmation of these dosing regimens with PBPK modeling resulted in very similar exposure, with lower interindividual variability and minimal toxicity potential. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, we developed oral and intravenous eliglustat dosing regimens that are likely safe and effective for treatment of STEC-HUS and prophylaxis in case of outbreaks of STEC infections. Clinical evaluation of these dosing regimens in children suspected of or diagnosed with STEC-HUS is required and should include assessment of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety (e.g., ECG monitoring).",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by reduced lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes have been observed within GD types and across ethnicities. Enzyme replacement therapy is generally recommended for patients with type 1 GD, the least severe form of GD. In Japan, velaglucerase alfa has a broad indication covering type 1, 2 or 3 GD.  METHODS: All patients with type 1, 2, or 3 GD administered velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion after its launch date in Japan in 2014, were enrolled in a non-interventional, observational post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Individual patient data were reported via case report forms (CRFs). Key safety endpoints investigated included the incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), the safety of velaglucerase alfa in patients with types 2 and 3 GD, from patients under one year of age to elderly patients (>= 65 years of age). Long-term efficacy was also assessed.  RESULTS: In total, 53 patients with GD were registered. CRFs were available for 41 (77.4%) patients at the 6-year interim analysis. Fourteen adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in seven patients. All reported ADRs occurred in patients with type 2 GD. ADRs were reported by 63.6% (7/11) of patients with type 2 GD. Ten ADRs were reported in five patients aged < 4 years. No elderly patients experienced any ADR during the surveillance period. Five ADRs occurring in three (10.0%) patients were classified as IRRs, with one case of vomiting (moderate severity) resulting in treatment discontinuation. Ten serious adverse events were reported in five (16.7%) patients. Three fatal events were considered to be unrelated to treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Platelet counts increased after the administration of velaglucerase alfa and were generally maintained within the normal range over the administration period. Among eleven patients tested for neutralizing anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies, two (18.2%) were assessed as positive results.  CONCLUSION: PMS data from patients with types 1-3 GD in Japan indicate that long-term treatment with velaglucerase alfa was well-tolerated and associated with increased platelet counts, which is consistent with observations made in studies outside of Japan.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficient glucocerebrosidase activity that results from biallelic mutations in the GBA1 gene. Its phenotypic variability allows GD to be classified into 3 subtypes based on the presence and extent of neurological manifestations. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been available for all patients with GD in Taiwan since 1998. Newborn screening (NBS) for GD has been available since 2015. This study attempted to unveil the clinical features of patients diagnosed with GD during different eras in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the health records of two tertiary hospitals responsible for two-thirds of the patients with GD in Taiwan were used. The study population included all patients identified as having GD between 1998, and April 2022, in these two hospitals for review. A total of 42 individuals were included, six of whom were diagnosed by NBS. RESULTS: Our cohort presented a higher proportion of GD3 individuals, both by clinical suspicion and by NBS diagnosis, than that reported worldwide. The major subtypes that were recognized following NBS diagnosis were GD2 and GD3. The majority of GD patients carry at least one p.Leu483Pro variant. The 5-year survival rates were 0% for GD2 patients and 100% for patients with other subtypes. Patients diagnosed during the post-NBS era were free of symptoms on initial presentation, except for those with the GD2 subtype. For those diagnosed earlier, ERT was shown to be effective in terms of improved hemograms and prevented bone crises. However, the neurological symptoms in GD3 patients progressed despite ERT intervention. CONCLUSION: ERT is essential in reversing the hematological presentations and preventing the skeletal complications of GD. Timely diagnosis of GD with NBS allows for early intervention with ERT to prevent disease progression and complications. However, the need for effective intervention for neurological dysfunction remains unmet.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic-uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) is a severe illness predominantly affecting young children, with limited treatment options beyond supportive care. Eliglustat, approved for Gaucher disease, shows potential in reducing Shiga toxin binding to target glomerular endothelial cells in vitro, prompting interest as a treatment for STEC-HUS. However, it remains unknown what dose is likely to be effective and safe for treatment of STEC-HUS in the pediatric population. We hypothesize that effective and safe levels of eliglustat can be reached in children. METHODS: We identified pharmacokinetic targets of efficacy for treatment and prophylaxis of STEC-HUS based on a preclinical model and human cardiac safety data. Then, we developed oral and intravenous dosing regimens using population pharmacokinetic (popPK) simulations based on an existing model enriched to allow extrapolation to a simulated virtual pediatric population. These dosing regimens were then confirmed using a verified physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. RESULTS: We simulated, using popPK data, oral and intravenous dosing regimens resulting in adequate target exposure in > 90% of all patients, with minimal expected risk for cardiotoxicity. Confirmation of these dosing regimens with PBPK modeling resulted in very similar exposure, with lower interindividual variability and minimal toxicity potential. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, we developed oral and intravenous eliglustat dosing regimens that are likely safe and effective for treatment of STEC-HUS and prophylaxis in case of outbreaks of STEC infections. Clinical evaluation of these dosing regimens in children suspected of or diagnosed with STEC-HUS is required and should include assessment of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety (e.g., ECG monitoring).",

The criteria for treatment initiation vary across regions. Recent retrospective studies have highlighted the natural progression of never-treated GD1, suggesting that some patients remain asymptomatic or stable for extended periods. However, there is no data on long-term prospective follow-up. We conducted a prospective study following a cross-sectional analysis of 36 never-treated, non-splenectomised GD1 patients from the French Gaucher Disease Registry (FGDR). The objective was to describe the natural disease progression, tracking clinical, radiological, and biological characteristics over time. Thirty-six non-splenectomised and never-treated patients (19 women and 17 men) diagnosed with Gaucher Disease were prospectively followed for an additional median duration of 6.5 (5-8.3) years. Of the cohort, 17 remained untreated, 10 initiated treatment, and 7 were lost to follow-up. Although never-treated patients tended to be older at the time of first symptoms, diagnosis, and last follow-up compared to those who received treatment, the difference was not significant in this small cohort. At last follow-up, never-treated patients had no worsening of most of their symptoms. No significant changes were observed in platelets, chitotriosidase, and lyso-Gb1. In this prospective cohort, we highlight that patients with mild GD can remain untreated with no disease progression, offering insights into cost-effective management strategies. Identifying such patients is still challenging.",

Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb1. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations of CHITO and lyso-Gb1; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing lyso-Gb1 levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role of lyso-Gb1 as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for these patients.",

Type 1 GD (GD1) is the most prevalent form of GD in Western countries; enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a treatment option for patients with GD1. To understand the economic value of the GD1 ERT velaglucerase alfa, a budget impact model (BIM) was developed from a United States (US) payer perspective. METHODS: We estimated the budget impact of velaglucerase alfa for a 10-million-member US health plan by comparing the annual total costs of therapy between a scenario using current velaglucerase alfa uptake to a projected scenario with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. Total drug costs for both scenarios were estimated as the sum of the product of the number of eligible patients on each treatment and the annual per-patient cost of each medication. Average per-patient costs for ERTs were calculated by adding the yearly drug acquisition, drug administration, and site-of-care markup costs. The budget impact was measured over years 1-3. RESULTS: An estimated 65 patients would receive velaglucerase alfa treatment in year 1, increasing to 90 patients by year 3. Across analyses, cost savings were realized with velaglucerase alfa compared with imiglucerase ($115,909) and taliglucerase alfa ($80,401). An annual total budget savings of $8.67 million could be realized for a hypothetical 10-million-member US health plan with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake.

                    "abstract": "Lysosomal enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) holds potential for treating lysosomal storage disorders, but achieving targeted delivery of deficient therapeutic enzymes remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel approach for the lysosome-specific delivery of the beta-glucosidase (B8CYA8) enzyme by covalently conjugating lysosome-targeting mannose-6-phosphate functionalized glycopolypeptides (M6P-GP). We used a protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate developed through advanced protein engineering and bioconjugation techniques. By conjugating beta-glucosidase to M6P-GP that has a high affinity for the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPR) and lysosomal receptors, we enhance the enzyme's selective intracellular uptake and lysosome-specific localization. To attain maximum activity of the near-native enzyme after delivery, we have designed and synthesized an acetal linkage containing the pH-responsive linker maleimide-acetal-azide (MAA), which will cleave in the lysosomal acidic pH to detach the glycopolypeptide from the protein backbone. We demonstrated the efficient cellular uptake of the protein-glycopolypeptide conjugate and showed targeted lysosome delivery, leading to increased enzymatic activity compared to untreated cells. Our results proved that the approach mainly improves the specificity and efficiency of enzyme delivery, particularly into lysosomes, which may enable new methods for ERT. These findings suggest that protein-glycopolypeptide conjugates could represent a class of bioconjugates to design targeted enzyme therapies, offering a pathway to the effective treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) and potentially other related lysosomal storage disorders.",

We perform a structural analysis of variants within three inherited lysosomal storage disorders, comparing variants responsive to pharmacological chaperone treatment to those unresponsive to such treatment. We find that predicted DeltaDeltaG of mutation is higher on average for variants unresponsive to treatment, in the case of datasets for both Fabry disease and Pompe disease, in line with previous findings. Using both a single decision tree and an advanced machine learning approach based on the larger Fabry dataset, we correctly predict responsiveness of three Gaucher disease variants, and we provide predictions for untested variants. Many variants are predicted to be responsive to treatment, suggesting that drug-based treatments may be effective for a number of variants in Gaucher disease. In our analysis, we observe dependence on a topological feature reporting on contact arrangements which is likely connected to the order of folding of protein residues, and we provide a potential justification for this observation based on steady-state cellular kinetics.",

This disorder exhibits an earlier onset, a more severe course, and a higher dementia prevalence compared to idiopathic PD. While the pathogenesis remains debated between loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms, targeted therapies are emerging. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs), like high-dose Ambroxol, aim to mitigate enzyme misfolding-a primary driver of this disorder-rather than addressing metabolic deficiencies seen in Gaucher disease. Despite failed trials of substrate reduction therapies, current clinical trials with Ambroxol and other PCs highlight promising avenues for disease modification. This commentary advocates for increased awareness of Sidransky syndrome to advance diagnostic strategies, promote genetic testing, and refine targeted treatments, with the potential to transform care for GBA1-related PD and prodromal stages of the disease.",

Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors reduce GSL production and have potential to treat multiple GSL storage diseases. AL01211 is a potent, oral GCS inhibitor being developed for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. AL01211 has minimal central nervous system penetration, allowing for treatment of peripheral organs without risking CNS-associated adverse effects. AL01211 was evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study with single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) arms, to determine safety, pharmacokinetics including food effect, and pharmacodynamic effects on associated GSLs. In the SAD arm, AL01211 showed a Tmax of approximately 3.5 hours, mean clearance (CL/F) of 130.1 L/h, and t1/2  of 39.3 hours. Consuming a high-fat meal prior to dose administration reduced exposures 3.5-5.5-fold, indicating a food effect. In the MAD arm, AL01211 had an approximately 2-fold accumulation, reaching steady-state levels by 10 days. Increasing exposure inversely correlated with a decrease in GSL with plasma glucosylceramide and globotriacylceramide reduction from baseline levels, reaching 78% and 52% by day 14, respectively. AL01211 was generally well-tolerated with no AL01211 associated serious adverse events, thus supporting its further clinical development.",

METHODS: A prospective follow-up, semi-experimental multi-centre study was conducted in four hospitals to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ERT in GD1 patients. Twenty-five individuals with 266 glucocerebrosidase (GCase) observations in plasma and leukocytes and 14 individuals with 68 Spanish magnetic resonance imaging (S-MRI) observations were enrolled. RESULTS: A two concatenated compartment model with zero-order endogenous production and first-order distribution (CL1  = 3.85 x 10-1 L/d) and elimination (CL2  = 1.25 L/d) allowed GCase observations in plasma and leukocytes to be described, respectively. An exponential time dependency (kT  = 6.14 x 10-1 d-1 ) effect on CL1 was incorporated. The final exposure-efficacy model was a longitudinal logistic regression model with a first-order Markov element. An Emax function (EC50  = 15.73 U/L and Emax  = 2.33) linked steady-state concentrations of GCase in leukocytes to the probability of transition across the different S-MRI stages. CONCLUSION: A population pharmacokinetic model successfully characterized the leukocyte activity-time profiles of GCase following intravenous administration of ERT in GD1 patients together with an exposure-efficacy relationship in bone marrow using Markovian elements. The information obtained from this study could be of high clinical relevance in individualization of ERT in GD1 patients, as this could lead to anticipative decision-making regarding clinical response in bone and optimal dosing strategy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variants of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), resulting in the impairment of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme function and the accumulation of a glycolipid substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within lysosomes. Current therapeutic approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy cannot fully rescue GD pathologies, especially neurological symptoms. Meanwhile, delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of affected human cells is a promising strategy for treating neuropathic LSDs. RESULT: Here, we describe a novel approach to restore GCase enzyme in cells from neuropathic GD patients by producing extracellular vesicle (EVs)-containing GCase from cells overexpressing GBA1 gene. Lentiviral vectors containing modified GBA1 were introduced into HEK293T cells to produce a stable cell line that provides a sustainable source of functional GCase enzyme. The GBA1-overexpressing cells released EV-containing GCase enzyme, that is capable of entering into and localizing in the endocytic compartment of recipient cells, including THP-1 macrophage, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, and macrophages and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of neuropathic GD patients. Importantly, the recipient cells exhibit higher GCase enzyme activity. CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe types of LSDs. It involves delivering lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of human cells affected by conditions such as GDs with neurological symptoms, as well as potentially other neurological disorders impacting lysosomes.",

The criteria for treatment initiation vary across regions. Recent retrospective studies have highlighted the natural progression of never-treated GD1, suggesting that some patients remain asymptomatic or stable for extended periods. However, there is no data on long-term prospective follow-up. We conducted a prospective study following a cross-sectional analysis of 36 never-treated, non-splenectomised GD1 patients from the French Gaucher Disease Registry (FGDR). The objective was to describe the natural disease progression, tracking clinical, radiological, and biological characteristics over time. Thirty-six non-splenectomised and never-treated patients (19 women and 17 men) diagnosed with Gaucher Disease were prospectively followed for an additional median duration of 6.5 (5-8.3) years. Of the cohort, 17 remained untreated, 10 initiated treatment, and 7 were lost to follow-up. Although never-treated patients tended to be older at the time of first symptoms, diagnosis, and last follow-up compared to those who received treatment, the difference was not significant in this small cohort. At last follow-up, never-treated patients had no worsening of most of their symptoms. No significant changes were observed in platelets, chitotriosidase, and lyso-Gb1. In this prospective cohort, we highlight that patients with mild GD can remain untreated with no disease progression, offering insights into cost-effective management strategies. Identifying such patients is still challenging.",

                    "title": "Challenges in Gaucher disease: Perspectives from an expert panel.",
                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

Thirty-four GD patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) were analyzed for platelet count, chitotriosidase, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in plasma samples, and quantitative measurement of Lyso-Gb1 was performed in dried blood spots. In our ERT and SRT study cohorts, plasma lyso-GL1 correlated significantly with chito-triosidase (ERT: r = 0.55, p < 0.001; SRT: r = 0.83, p < 0.001) and TRAP (ERT: r = 0.34, p < 0.001; SRT: r = 0.88, p < 0.001), irrespective of treatment method. A platelet count increase was associated with a Lyso-Gb1 decrease in both treatment groups (ERT: p = 0.021; SRT: p = 0.028). The association of Lyso-Gb1 with evaluated markers was stronger in the SRT cohort. Our results indicate that ERT and SRT in combination or in a switch manner could offer the potential of individual drug effectiveness for particular GD symptoms. Combination of the key biomarker of GD, Lyso-Gb1, with other biomarkers can offer improved response assessment to long-term therapy.",

In 2018, we published the safety and efficacy of rapid 10-min infusion of velaglucerase alfa in previously treated patients, mostly on low-dose therapy. AIM: To improve quality of life (QoL) for patients needing lifelong bi-weekly infusions by introducing a 10-min infusion instead of 1 h per label in patients naive to ERT and on high-dose therapy. METHODS: Fifteen naive patients were enrolled; all received bi-weekly infusions of 60 units/kgBW velaglucerase alfa; the infusion rate was gradually reduced in the hospital, followed by home infusions. Each infusion was followed for safety. Efficacy parameters were assessed every 3 months. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires were collected at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Ten-minute rapid infusions were well tolerated without related severe adverse events (SAEs). Two patients experienced a non-related SAE and another a possibly related AE. In three patients, the infusion rate was increased to 30 or 60 min (two because of suboptimal response and one because of AE). Two patients dropped out because of an unwillingness to attend follow-up visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 13 remaining patients reached the 24-month end-point. The platelet counts increased by a median (range) of 68.38% (12.5-300%) and the lyso-Gb1 levels decreased by 62.6% (32.9-89.9%). CONCLUSION: Home therapy with rapid infusion of high-dose velaglucerase alfa was a safe, effective and preferable alternative for patients with GD naive to treatment. We believe that shortening the infusion time improves the QoL of patients with GD who have a lifelong commitment to intravenous therapy.",

We aimed to evaluate the effect of ERT on the pregnancy and obstetric outcome in a unique group of multiparous women with type 1 GD (GD1) who had pregnancies with and without ERT. The Gaucher Unit database (1987-2019) was searched for multiparous women who had pregnancies before and after the institution of ERT. Data were collected from the clinic files and study-specific questionnaires. Descriptive, correlation analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to study the effect of ERT and confounding variables on study outcomes. We identified 19 women with 105 pregnancies, among which 26 (24.7%) terminated in first-trimester miscarriage. The risk for miscarriage was associated with the severity of GD1 genotype and phenotype, but not with ERT usage. Early postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was reported in 16 (84%) women after 25 deliveries (31.6%, 95% CI 21.6%-43.1%). The risks of early PPH and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions were significantly lower when ERT was used during pregnancy, OR (95% CI) 0.13 (0.03-0.54) and 0.27 (0.08-0.94), respectively, compared to pregnancies without the use of ERT. Enzyme replacement therapy during pregnancy is risk reducing for early PPH and RBC transfusions in women with GD1. We suggest considering ERT for the benefit of all pregnant women with GD1, including mild GD1.",

The condition is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, hematological abnormalities, and bone disease in both non-neuronopathic type 1 (GD1) and neuronopathic type 3 (GD3). Interestingly, GBA1 variants were found to be one of the most important risk factors for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) in GD1 patients. We performed a comprehensive study regarding the two most disease-specific biomarkers, glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb1) and alpha-synuclein for GD and PD, respectively. A total of 65 patients with GD treated with ERT (47 GD1 patients and 18 GD3 patients), 19 GBA1 pathogenic variant carriers (including 10 L444P carriers), and 16 healthy subjects were involved in the study. Lyso-Gb1 was assessed by dried blood spot testing. The level of alpha-synuclein as an mRNA transcript, total, and oligomer protein concentration were measured with real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. alpha-synuclein mRNA level was found significantly elevated in GD3 patients and L444P carriers. GD1 patients, along with GBA1 carriers of an unknown or unconfirmed variant, as well as healthy controls, have the same low level of alpha-synuclein mRNA. There was no correlation found between the level of alpha-synuclein mRNA and age in GD patients treated with ERT, whereas there was a positive correlation in L444P carriers.",

We aimed to evaluate the immunity status and reveal the course of COVID-19 in patients with LSDs. RESULTS: The median age of 110 patients with LSDs was 129 months (range: 21-655), and all but one patient with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III were regularly receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In 53.6% (n = 56) of the patients (23 patients with Gaucher disease [10 type III, 13 type I], 26 patients with MPS [8 type VI, 11 type IVA, 1 type III, 3 type II, and 3 type I], and 7 patients with Pompe disease), an abnormality in at least one of the autoimmunity or immunodeficiency parameters was reported. Furthermore, 12 (57%) of 21 Gaucher cases (7 type III, 5 type I), 18 (40.9%) of 44 MPS cases (9 type IVA, 5 type VI, 1 type I, 2 type II, and 1 type III), and six (66%) of nine Pompe cases were reported to involve abnormalities in at least one of the parameters related to immunodeficiency. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgA levels were reported to be lower, and there were abnormalities in the lymphocyte counts and subgroups in the MPS group. ANA was reported to be positive in one patient with Gaucher type III, anti-DNA in two patients with Gaucher type I and one patient with MPS type VI, antithyroglobulin in two patients with Gaucher type I, anti-TPO in one patient with Gaucher type I, TRAB in one patient with Gaucher type I, antiphospholipid IgM in three patients with Gaucher type III and one patient with Gaucher type I, anticardiolipin IgM in one patient with Gaucher type I, one patient with Gaucher type III, and one patient with MPS type II. However, no clinical presentation was consistent with the laboratory results except for one patient with Gaucher type I disease with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Two of the four patients who survived the COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms had a diagnosis of Gaucher type I, and no abnormality was detected in their laboratory tests. The other two patients had a diagnosis of MPS types VI and II. Immune dysfunction was detected in the patient with a diagnosis of MPS type II. Four of our patients were discharged without any sequelae. CONCLUSION: Problems with immunity did not cause any noticeable clinical results. Being well protected by reducing social contact might have played a role. However, we believe that it should be borne in mind that cardiac and pulmonary involvement, as well as immune dysfunction in LSDs, may cause an increased need for intensive care because of secondary bacterial infections.",

Glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (GCSi) have the potential to treat several GSL storage diseases by reducing the synthesis of the disease-causing GSLs. AL01211 is a potent oral GCSi under investigation for Type 1 Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. Here, we evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of AL01211 in healthy Chinese volunteers. METHODS: AL01211 was tested in a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with single-dose (15 and 60 mg) and multiple-dose (30 mg) arms. RESULTS: Results of AL01211 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption (median time to maximum plasma concentration [tmax] 2.5-4 hours), relatively slow clearance rate (mean apparent total clearance from plasma [CL/F] 88.3-200 L/h) and the mean terminal half-life above 30 hours. Repeated once-daily oral administration of AL01211 for 14 days had an approximately 2-fold accumulation, reaching steady-state levels between 7 and 10 days, and led to a 73% reduction in plasma glucosylceramide (GL1) on Day 14. AL01211 was safe and well tolerated, with no identified serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: AL01211 showed a favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability profile in healthy Chinese volunteers. These data support the further clinical development of AL01211 as a therapy for GSL storage diseases. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: Clinical Trial Registry no.

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase which leads to an accumulation of glucosylceramide in the macrophages. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia) and bone disorders are the main symptoms. The diagnosis is often delayed, leading to unnecessary investigations and treatments, and delaying the specific treatment. The primary objective of our study was to establish, in patients who had a diagnostic delay of more than one year, the reported misdiagnoses before the final diagnosis. The secondary objectives were to investigate the risk factors associated with error and delayed diagnosis. METHODS: Retrospective study including patients with Gaucher disease from the French Gaucher Disease Registry. Collection of data by a single investigator from a standardized form. RESULTS: Among 83 patients with a known diagnostic delay, 13 patients (15 %) had one or two misdiagnoses. These included osteo-articular diagnoses (osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, arthritis, osteochondritis, rheumatic fever, n=8), haematological diagnoses (gestational thrombocytopenia, immunological thrombocytopenia, n=4), infectious diagnoses (visceral leishmaniasis, mononucleosis, n=2) and hemochromatosis. The osteo-articular and infectious diagnoses concerned the child and the adolescent while the haematological diagnoses and the hemochromatosis concerned the adult. No factors were found associated with misdiagnoses. Patients with a diagnostic delay greater than one year were less likely to have hepatosplenomegaly as the first symptom. CONCLUSION: There is a risk of diagnostic error related to phenotypic heterogeneity and lack of specificity of Gaucher disease symptoms. This study helps to better identify the misdiagnoses associated with Gaucher disease.",

In 2018, we published the safety and efficacy of rapid 10-min infusion of velaglucerase alfa in previously treated patients, mostly on low-dose therapy. AIM: To improve quality of life (QoL) for patients needing lifelong bi-weekly infusions by introducing a 10-min infusion instead of 1 h per label in patients naive to ERT and on high-dose therapy. METHODS: Fifteen naive patients were enrolled; all received bi-weekly infusions of 60 units/kgBW velaglucerase alfa; the infusion rate was gradually reduced in the hospital, followed by home infusions. Each infusion was followed for safety. Efficacy parameters were assessed every 3 months. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires were collected at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Ten-minute rapid infusions were well tolerated without related severe adverse events (SAEs). Two patients experienced a non-related SAE and another a possibly related AE. In three patients, the infusion rate was increased to 30 or 60 min (two because of suboptimal response and one because of AE). Two patients dropped out because of an unwillingness to attend follow-up visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 13 remaining patients reached the 24-month end-point. The platelet counts increased by a median (range) of 68.38% (12.5-300%) and the lyso-Gb1 levels decreased by 62.6% (32.9-89.9%). CONCLUSION: Home therapy with rapid infusion of high-dose velaglucerase alfa was a safe, effective and preferable alternative for patients with GD naive to treatment. We believe that shortening the infusion time improves the QoL of patients with GD who have a lifelong commitment to intravenous therapy.",

Treatment options for these disorders include replacing the deficient enzymes via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Agalsidase alfa for Fabry disease and velaglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease are two ERT options with demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability. ERT infusions administered by a health care provider (HCP) in the clinic/hospital, or at the patient's home are considered HCP-supported infusions. Self-administration of ERT (by patient, partner, relative, or caregiver) is optional in patients who tolerate the HCP-supported infusions at home and have a suitable home environment. This analysis explored the safety profiles of self-administered agalsidase alfa (202 patients) and velaglucerase alfa (30 patients) versus HCP-supported infusions using data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) and Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) registries. RESULTS: The frequency of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) adverse events (AEs) recorded in the two registries was lower in patients self-administering (FOS: 4.5%, GOS: 0%) versus patients receiving HCP-supported infusions (FOS: 13.6%, GOS: 1.6%). In the FOS registry, AE rates per 100 patient-years (100PY) of follow-up were similar between the self-administration (7.99) and HCP-supported infusion (6.78) groups. In patients self-administering agalsidase alfa, cardiac disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (19 [9.4%] patients) and serious AEs (12 [5.9%]) and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported IRRs (3 [1.5%]). In the GOS registry, AE rates per 100PY were similar between self-administration (4.97) and HCP-supported infusion (4.67) groups. In patients self-administering velaglucerase alfa, skin and subcutaneous disorders (4 [13.3%]) and infections and infestations (2 [6.7%]) were the most reported AEs and serious AEs, respectively, and no IRRs were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that self-administration of agalsidase alfa or velaglucerase alfa infusions are not associated with additional safety risks compared with HCP-supported infusions and are a suitable option for qualifying patients. Further research is warranted to support these findings and to explore further the long-term safety and efficacy of ERT self-administration. FOS trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03289065.

This analysis explored the safety profiles of self-administered agalsidase alfa (202 patients) and velaglucerase alfa (30 patients) versus HCP-supported infusions using data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) and Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) registries. RESULTS: The frequency of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) adverse events (AEs) recorded in the two registries was lower in patients self-administering (FOS: 4.5%, GOS: 0%) versus patients receiving HCP-supported infusions (FOS: 13.6%, GOS: 1.6%). In the FOS registry, AE rates per 100 patient-years (100PY) of follow-up were similar between the self-administration (7.99) and HCP-supported infusion (6.78) groups. In patients self-administering agalsidase alfa, cardiac disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (19 [9.4%] patients) and serious AEs (12 [5.9%]) and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported IRRs (3 [1.5%]). In the GOS registry, AE rates per 100PY were similar between self-administration (4.97) and HCP-supported infusion (4.67) groups. In patients self-administering velaglucerase alfa, skin and subcutaneous disorders (4 [13.3%]) and infections and infestations (2 [6.7%]) were the most reported AEs and serious AEs, respectively, and no IRRs were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that self-administration of agalsidase alfa or velaglucerase alfa infusions are not associated with additional safety risks compared with HCP-supported infusions and are a suitable option for qualifying patients. Further research is warranted to support these findings and to explore further the long-term safety and efficacy of ERT self-administration. FOS trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03289065.

                    "title": "Challenges in Gaucher disease: Perspectives from an expert panel.",
                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

This disorder exhibits an earlier onset, a more severe course, and a higher dementia prevalence compared to idiopathic PD. While the pathogenesis remains debated between loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms, targeted therapies are emerging. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs), like high-dose Ambroxol, aim to mitigate enzyme misfolding-a primary driver of this disorder-rather than addressing metabolic deficiencies seen in Gaucher disease. Despite failed trials of substrate reduction therapies, current clinical trials with Ambroxol and other PCs highlight promising avenues for disease modification. This commentary advocates for increased awareness of Sidransky syndrome to advance diagnostic strategies, promote genetic testing, and refine targeted treatments, with the potential to transform care for GBA1-related PD and prodromal stages of the disease.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study that included patients with LDS treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Published clinical trials (CT) and LDS treatment guidelines were reviewed to select efficacy variables. Data to measure them (and adverse effects) were obtained from the medical history. RESULTS: No CTs have been found in which efficacy is evaluated with final variables, all have been surrogated. Twenty-two patients were included: eight with Gaucher disease, six with Niemann-PickC disease, two with Hunter disease, one with Morquio-A disease, and five with Pompe disease. Eight patients have responded to ERT and one to SRT with eliglustat. ERT has not been associated with adverse effects. Miglustat has produced tolerance problems, requiring a change in a patient. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness was variable according to the pathology. Regarding safety, manageable adverse reactions to SRT were associated with dosage adjustments.",

GD can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). The aim of this systematic review (SR) is to assess the effectiveness of drugs used for GD treatment. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in April 2021. The search strategies encompassed the name of the disease and of the drug treatments. Manual search was also conducted. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Observational and interventional longitudinal studies evaluating ERT and SRT for GD were included. Single mean meta-analyses were conducted for each drug using R. DATA SYNTHESIS: The initial search retrieved 2246 articles after duplicates were removed. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 68 reports were included. The studies evaluated imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, taliglucerase alfa, miglustat, and eliglustat. The results showed that ERT is effective as a treatment in both naive and experienced patients. Miglustat did not significantly improve blood outcomes in naive patients and resulted in a decrease in the platelet levels of experienced patients. Eliglustat was mainly assessed for experienced patients and resulted in stable outcome values. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This extensive SR confirms the effectiveness of GD treatments in short- and long-term follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: The results were favorable for all ERTs and for eliglustat. Based on the assessed evidence, miglustat did not achieved expressive results. However, all evidence should be interpreted considering its limitations and does not replace well-conducted randomized trials.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variants of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), resulting in the impairment of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme function and the accumulation of a glycolipid substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within lysosomes. Current therapeutic approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy cannot fully rescue GD pathologies, especially neurological symptoms. Meanwhile, delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of affected human cells is a promising strategy for treating neuropathic LSDs. RESULT: Here, we describe a novel approach to restore GCase enzyme in cells from neuropathic GD patients by producing extracellular vesicle (EVs)-containing GCase from cells overexpressing GBA1 gene. Lentiviral vectors containing modified GBA1 were introduced into HEK293T cells to produce a stable cell line that provides a sustainable source of functional GCase enzyme. The GBA1-overexpressing cells released EV-containing GCase enzyme, that is capable of entering into and localizing in the endocytic compartment of recipient cells, including THP-1 macrophage, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, and macrophages and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of neuropathic GD patients. Importantly, the recipient cells exhibit higher GCase enzyme activity. CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe types of LSDs. It involves delivering lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of human cells affected by conditions such as GDs with neurological symptoms, as well as potentially other neurological disorders impacting lysosomes.",

The 17-year-old female presented with 5 months of right knee pain with associated mass on exam. She was diagnosed with ES with pulmonary metastasis. The patient was treated with 17 alternating cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide and etoposide chemotherapy followed by tumor resection and radiation per standard protocol. As part of her staging work-up, bone marrow biopsy was performed, significant for Gaucher cells. After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient began to experience severe delays averaging 30 days between cycles compared to 17.29 days observed in Children's Oncology Group data. Given her bone marrow biopsy findings and chemotherapy delays GD screening was obtained and the patient was diagnosed with GD following genetic confirmation. Due to delays in chemotherapy decreasing chance of remission, the patient was referred to Genetics for aggressive management with imiglucerase and eliglustat. After initiation of therapy the period between chemotherapy cycles decreased to 23 days on average, with a 21% increase in platelet count during therapy. The patient was able to complete ES therapy achieving remission. GD is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, as seen in our patient with ES. GD patients experience prolonged hematologic cytopenia during cancer treatment. Combining Enzyme and Substrate Reduction Therapies should be investigated as an option to improve chemotherapy adherence in GD patients.",

The underlying cause mainly is an enzyme deficiency but may also be due to defects in transport or activation proteins, which result in progressive intra- and extra-lysosomal accumulation of undegraded storage material. The lysosomes play a key role in degradation and cellular recycling of macromolecules. Besides disturbance of cellular function, substrate accumulation may result in secondary toxic and/or inflammatory processes.

Liver fibrosis is a long-term complication of GD, potentially leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently no validated clinical tools for the monitoring of liver fibrosis in patients with GD. In this study, we aim at assessing the validity of common fibrosis-predicting scores, developed for other diseases, for the use in GD, using transient elastography as a gold-standard, as well as developing the first GD-specific liver fibrosis predicting score. We enrolled 19 adult patients with GD who had been on treatment for a minimum of 1 year on enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy and who had no evidence of any other liver disease except GD or metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is a common comorbidity of GD. We analyzed the correlation between liver stiffness and genotype, treatment modality (imiglucerase or other therapies), clinical severity, and clinical laboratory tests. We found that the common liver fibrosis scores APRI, FIB-4, and NFS did not accurately predict liver fibrosis in people with GD. We also found that male sex, the DS3 score, AST, and GGT levels significantly correlated with liver stiffness, and used these to create a simple but accurate fibrosis-predicting score specifically for GD (the \"Gaucher liver fibrosis score\", or GLFS), with high accuracy (AUC = 0.8571, p = 0.0206). We believe that our new GLFS may be used in clinical practice to help prioritize GD patients for closer monitoring of liver fibrosis.",

Thirty-four GD patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) were analyzed for platelet count, chitotriosidase, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in plasma samples, and quantitative measurement of Lyso-Gb1 was performed in dried blood spots. In our ERT and SRT study cohorts, plasma lyso-GL1 correlated significantly with chito-triosidase (ERT: r = 0.55, p < 0.001; SRT: r = 0.83, p < 0.001) and TRAP (ERT: r = 0.34, p < 0.001; SRT: r = 0.88, p < 0.001), irrespective of treatment method. A platelet count increase was associated with a Lyso-Gb1 decrease in both treatment groups (ERT: p = 0.021; SRT: p = 0.028). The association of Lyso-Gb1 with evaluated markers was stronger in the SRT cohort.

                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

This study evaluates bone health in adult GD type 1 patients, focusing on skeletal complications, bone mineral density (BMD), and biochemical markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of adult GD type 1 patients followed up at Ege University Pediatric Metabolism Department were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: This study included 32 patients with GD type 1, comprising 11 males (34.4%) and 21 females (65.6%). The median age at diagnosis was 20.5 years (min: 3-max:65), and at enrolment, it was 35 years (min:18-max:71). Most patients (93.8%) had organomegaly, and 93.8% had cytopenia. Common genetic variants were p.Asn409Ser (60.9%), p.Leu483Pro (7.8%), and p.Asp448His(4.7%). All patients were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for a median of 11 years (min:2-max:18). Bone complications included pathologic fractures in six patients (19%) and avascular necrosis in 12 patients (37.5%). Bone pain was reported by 93.7% of patients at admission and persisted in 59.4% during follow-up. DXA scans showed abnormal bone mineral density (BMD) in 62.5% of patients initially, with a significantly low bone density in 3.1% and reduced bone density in 59.3%. BMD improved with treatment, as evidenced by a significant increase in Z scores (p < 0.05). Elevated chitotriosidase (75%), ferritin (50%), and immunoglobulin G (21.9%) levels were noted but did not correlate with BMD. Seven patients (22%) were splenectomized, all with bone issues. DISCUSSION: Bone health in GD involves multiple factors beyond biochemical markers. While ERT improves BMD, bone pain and fractures remain significant issues. Comprehensive management, including regular BMD monitoring and better vitamin D supplementation adherence, is crucial. Further research is needed to improve treatments for bone complications in GD.",

This prospective clinical trial assessed the oxidant-antioxidant status in Egyptian patients with GD and the efficacy and safety and of vitamin E as an adjuvant antioxidant therapy. Forty children and adolescents with GD on stable doses of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) were enrolled. Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography were performed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes (reduced glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], and peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2]) were assessed. Patients were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with GD were randomized either to receive oral vitamin E for 6 months or not. All patients with GD had significantly higher MDA levels with lower levels of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Vitamin E and PRDX2 were negatively correlated to severity score index (SSI), lyso GL1, and MDA. After 6 months of vitamin E supplementation, SSI and liver and spleen volumes and liver stiffness were significantly lower. Lyso GL1 and MDA were significantly decreased post-vitamin E therapy while antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher compared with baseline levels and with patients without vitamin E therapy. Oxidative stress is related to disease severity in pediatric patients with GD. A 6-month vitamin E supplementation for those patients represents a safe therapeutic adjuvant agent increasing the efficacy of ERT, reducing oxidative stress, and improving outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, in which biallelic pathogenic variants in the Glucosidase beta acid (GBA) gene result in defective functioning of glucosylceramidase that causes deposition of glucocerebroside in cells. GD has 3 major types namely, non-neuronopathic (type I), acute neuronopathic (type II), and chronic neuronopathic (type III). Definite treatment options are limited and expensive. They succumb early to the disease, if untreated. There is paucity of studies from the Indian subcontinent, which elicit the factors resulting in their premature mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care setting of South India to assess the clinical profile, mutation spectrum, and various management strategies (only supportive therapy, enzyme replacement therapy [ERT], substrate reduction therapy [SRT] haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT]), and mortality predictors of patients with GD from 2004 to 2019. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted. In silico predictions were performed for novel variants. RESULTS: There were 60 patients with all types of GD seen over the study period of 15 years. Their median age at diagnosis was 2 years. The median follow-up was for 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-8). The overall mortality rate was 35%; however, it was only 10% in those receiving definite treatment. Mortality was higher (47.5%) by more than 4 folds in those only on supportive therapy. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 6.3 years (IQR = 3.5-10.8) in the definite treatment group and 3.5 years (IQR = 1-5) in those on supportive therapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significant (p value 0.001) mortality difference between these groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found the neuronopathic type (OR = 5) and only supportive therapy (OR = 6.3) to be the independent risk factors for premature mortality. CONCLUSION: GD is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, if left untreated. ERT and SRT are the definitive treatments which increase the survival. In resource-limited settings like India, with higher prevalence of the neuronopathic type, HSCT may be a more suitable definitive treatment option, due to its one-time intervention and cost, assuming similar efficacy to ERT. However, the efficacy and safety of HSCT in GD needs to be established further by substantial patient numbers undergoing it.",

A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper-free strain promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes beta-glucocerebrosidase and acid alpha-glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best beta-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene-based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4-fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne-presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.",

This disorder exhibits an earlier onset, a more severe course, and a higher dementia prevalence compared to idiopathic PD. While the pathogenesis remains debated between loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms, targeted therapies are emerging. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs), like high-dose Ambroxol, aim to mitigate enzyme misfolding-a primary driver of this disorder-rather than addressing metabolic deficiencies seen in Gaucher disease. Despite failed trials of substrate reduction therapies, current clinical trials with Ambroxol and other PCs highlight promising avenues for disease modification. This commentary advocates for increased awareness of Sidransky syndrome to advance diagnostic strategies, promote genetic testing, and refine targeted treatments, with the potential to transform care for GBA1-related PD and prodromal stages of the disease.",

This C5a-C5aR1-glycosphingolipid pathway- induced pro-inflammatory environment causes the tissue damage in COVID-19 and GD. Strikingly, pharmaceutically targeting the C5a-C5aR1 axis or the glycosphingolipid synthesis pathway led to a reduction in glycosphingolipid synthesis and innate and adaptive immune inflammation, and protection from the tissue destruction in both COVID-19 and GD. These results reveal a common involvement of the complement and glycosphingolipid systems driving immune inflammation and tissue damage in COVID-19 and GD, respectively. It is therefore expected that combined targeting of the complement and sphingolipid pathways could ameliorate the tissue destruction, organ failure, and death in patients at high-risk of developing severe cases of COVID-19.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by reduced lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase activity. Heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes have been observed within GD types and across ethnicities. Enzyme replacement therapy is generally recommended for patients with type 1 GD, the least severe form of GD. In Japan, velaglucerase alfa has a broad indication covering type 1, 2 or 3 GD.  METHODS: All patients with type 1, 2, or 3 GD administered velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion after its launch date in Japan in 2014, were enrolled in a non-interventional, observational post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Individual patient data were reported via case report forms (CRFs). Key safety endpoints investigated included the incidence of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), the safety of velaglucerase alfa in patients with types 2 and 3 GD, from patients under one year of age to elderly patients (>= 65 years of age). Long-term efficacy was also assessed.  RESULTS: In total, 53 patients with GD were registered. CRFs were available for 41 (77.4%) patients at the 6-year interim analysis. Fourteen adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in seven patients. All reported ADRs occurred in patients with type 2 GD. ADRs were reported by 63.6% (7/11) of patients with type 2 GD. Ten ADRs were reported in five patients aged < 4 years. No elderly patients experienced any ADR during the surveillance period. Five ADRs occurring in three (10.0%) patients were classified as IRRs, with one case of vomiting (moderate severity) resulting in treatment discontinuation. Ten serious adverse events were reported in five (16.7%) patients. Three fatal events were considered to be unrelated to treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Platelet counts increased after the administration of velaglucerase alfa and were generally maintained within the normal range over the administration period. Among eleven patients tested for neutralizing anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies, two (18.2%) were assessed as positive results.  CONCLUSION: PMS data from patients with types 1-3 GD in Japan indicate that long-term treatment with velaglucerase alfa was well-tolerated and associated with increased platelet counts, which is consistent with observations made in studies outside of Japan. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03625882 registered July 2014.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variants of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), resulting in the impairment of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme function and the accumulation of a glycolipid substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within lysosomes. Current therapeutic approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy cannot fully rescue GD pathologies, especially neurological symptoms. Meanwhile, delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of affected human cells is a promising strategy for treating neuropathic LSDs. RESULT: Here, we describe a novel approach to restore GCase enzyme in cells from neuropathic GD patients by producing extracellular vesicle (EVs)-containing GCase from cells overexpressing GBA1 gene. Lentiviral vectors containing modified GBA1 were introduced into HEK293T cells to produce a stable cell line that provides a sustainable source of functional GCase enzyme. The GBA1-overexpressing cells released EV-containing GCase enzyme, that is capable of entering into and localizing in the endocytic compartment of recipient cells, including THP-1 macrophage, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, and macrophages and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of neuropathic GD patients. Importantly, the recipient cells exhibit higher GCase enzyme activity. CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe types of LSDs. It involves delivering lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of human cells affected by conditions such as GDs with neurological symptoms, as well as potentially other neurological disorders impacting lysosomes.",

Eliglustat treatment has been started in Austria in patients recruited to a clinical trial, followed by its long-term extension and prescription treatment overall covering up to 10 years. In this case series the experience of treating Gaucher patients with eliglustat in Vienna is summarized. Patients were either switched from enzyme replacement therapy or were therapy naive. Significant improvements were shown in hematological (thrombocytes, hemoglobin) and visceral (spleen volume) manifestations as well as in biomarkers (chitotriosidase, glucosylsphingosine [lyso-GL1], angiotensin converting enzyme) in a routine setting in a therapy-naive patient. Stability was found in switch patients with slight improvement in bone density. Eliglustat was generally very well tolerated.

The criteria for treatment initiation vary across regions. Recent retrospective studies have highlighted the natural progression of never-treated GD1, suggesting that some patients remain asymptomatic or stable for extended periods. However, there is no data on long-term prospective follow-up. We conducted a prospective study following a cross-sectional analysis of 36 never-treated, non-splenectomised GD1 patients from the French Gaucher Disease Registry (FGDR). The objective was to describe the natural disease progression, tracking clinical, radiological, and biological characteristics over time. Thirty-six non-splenectomised and never-treated patients (19 women and 17 men) diagnosed with Gaucher Disease were prospectively followed for an additional median duration of 6.5 (5-8.3) years. Of the cohort, 17 remained untreated, 10 initiated treatment, and 7 were lost to follow-up. Although never-treated patients tended to be older at the time of first symptoms, diagnosis, and last follow-up compared to those who received treatment, the difference was not significant in this small cohort. At last follow-up, never-treated patients had no worsening of most of their symptoms. No significant changes were observed in platelets, chitotriosidase, and lyso-Gb1. In this prospective cohort, we highlight that patients with mild GD can remain untreated with no disease progression, offering insights into cost-effective management strategies. Identifying such patients is still challenging.",

The disease is divided into three types based on neurocognitive involvement with GD1 having no involvement while the acute (GD2) and chronic (GD3) are neuronopathic. The non-neurological symptoms of GD3 are well treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) which has replaced hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ERT is unable to prevent neurological progression as the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In this retrospective study, we report the general, neurocognitive, and biochemical outcomes of three siblings with GD3 after treatment with ERT or HSCT. Two were treated with HSCT (named HSCT1 and HSCT2) and one with ERT (ERT1). All patients were homozygous for the c.1448 T > C, (p.Leu483Pro) variant in the GBA1 gene associated with GD3. ERT1 experienced neurocognitive progression with development of seizures, oculomotor apraxia, perceptive hearing loss and mental retardation. HSCT1 had no neurological manifestations, while HSCT2 developed perceptive hearing loss and low IQ. Chitotriosidase concentrations were normal in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HSCT1 and HSCT2, but both were markedly elevated in ERT1. We report a better neurological outcome and a normalization of chitotriosidase in the two siblings treated with HSCT compared to the ERT-treated sibling. With the advancements in HSCT over the past 25 years, we may reconsider using HSCT in GD3 to achieve a better neurological outcome and limit disease progression.",

There are currently no known effective methods for the treatment of sphingolipidoses; however, gene therapy seems to be a promising therapeutic variant for this group of diseases. In this review, we discuss gene therapy approaches for sphingolipidoses that are currently being investigated in clinical trials, among which adeno-associated viral vector-based approaches and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells genetically modified with lentiviral vectors seem to be the most effective.",

We evaluated the \"real-world\" effectiveness of first-line imiglucerase on long-term bone outcomes in Italian patients in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry. METHODS: Patients treated with imiglucerase for >=2 years and with bone assessments at baseline and during follow-up were selected. Data on bone pain, bone crises, marrow infiltration, avascular necrosis, infarction, lytic lesions, Erlenmeyer flask deformity, bone fractures, mineral density, and imiglucerase dosage were evaluated. RESULTS: Data on bone manifestations were available for 73 of 229 patients (31.9 %). Bone crises frequency decreased significantly from baseline to the most recent follow-up (p < 0.001), with some improvement observed in bone pain prevalence. Bone pain and bone crises prevalence decreased significantly from baseline at 2 to <4 and 4 to <6 years (all p < 0.05). A low median (25th, 75th percentile) baseline imiglucerase dosage was identified in patients reporting bone pain or bone crises (15.0 [13.7, 30.0] and 22.8 [17.5, 36.0] U/kg once every 2 weeks, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the management of GD in Italy, with regards to imiglucerase dosage, is suboptimal and confirms the need for clinicians to monitor and correctly treat bone disease according to best practice guidelines.",

METHODS: Taliglucerase Alfa Surveillance (TALIAS), a multinational prospective Drug Registry of patients with GD, was established to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective) of taliglucerase alfa. We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females) treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January 7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of 567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment, most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Twelve of the 106 patients experienced serious AEs; two patients experienced four treatment-related serious AEs. Four patients died, although none of the deaths was considered to be related to taliglucerase alfa treatment by the treating physicians. Nine patients discontinued from the study, including the four who died. At baseline, patients with prior ERT had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts than treatment-naive patients, likely reflecting the therapeutic effects of prior treatments. During follow-up, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased in the treatment-naive patients and remained relatively constant or increased slightly in patients with prior ERT. Spleen and liver volumes decreased in treatment-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interim data showed no new or emergent safety signals. The overall interim data are consistent with the clinical program experience and known safety and effectiveness profile of taliglucerase alfa.",

                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with a prevalence in the general population of ~1 per 100 000. To optimise the recognition, diagnosis and management of patients with GD in South Africa (SA), it is important to have an understanding of local patterns of presentation of the disease. OBJECTIVES: To describe the baseline pretreatment characteristics of the SA cohort of patients enrolled into the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry whowere treated with imiglucerase (Cerezyme; Sanofi Genzyme). METHODS: The ICGG Gaucher Registry is an observational, longitudinal, international database that tracks the clinical, demographic, genetic, biochemical and therapeutic characteristics of patients with GD globally, irrespective of disease severity, treatment status or treatment choice. The study population included all SA patients reported in the ICGG Gaucher Registry as of 1 May 2020. RESULTS: The registry included 49 SA GD patients, of whom 32 received imiglucerase as first primary GD therapy. All the patients had GD type 1, 59.4% were female, and mean and median ages at diagnosis were 14.7 and 9.8 years, respectively. The most common genotype was N370S/N370S (37.5%). At treatment initiation, 30.0% of patients had been splenectomised. Among patients for whom data were available, anaemia was present in one-third of non-splenectomised patients and 12.5% of those with splenectomy, and moderate or severe thrombocytopenia was reported in two-thirds of non-splenectomised patients. Bone pain was present in 30.8% and 57.1% of non- splenectomised and splenectomised patients, respectively. No bone crises were reported, and data relating to other bone complications were available for only <=3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Haematological findings and bone pain in this group are similar to those in the global ICGG Gaucher Registry cohort. Lack of baseline data for other bone complications limits interpretation in that regard. Clinicians who treat patients with GD are encouraged to submit accurate, complete and up-to-date information so that comprehensive data for the subset of SA GD patients can be maintained to improve recognition and diagnosis, and guide appropriate and effective use of treatment for SA patients.",

We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females) treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January 7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of 567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment, most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs).

METHODS: Taliglucerase Alfa Surveillance (TALIAS), a multinational prospective Drug Registry of patients with GD, was established to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective) of taliglucerase alfa. We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females) treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January 7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of 567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment, most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Twelve of the 106 patients experienced serious AEs; two patients experienced four treatment-related serious AEs. Four patients died, although none of the deaths was considered to be related to taliglucerase alfa treatment by the treating physicians. Nine patients discontinued from the study, including the four who died. At baseline, patients with prior ERT had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts than treatment-naive patients, likely reflecting the therapeutic effects of prior treatments. During follow-up, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased in the treatment-naive patients and remained relatively constant or increased slightly in patients with prior ERT. Spleen and liver volumes decreased in treatment-naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interim data showed no new or emergent safety signals. The overall interim data are consistent with the clinical program experience and known safety and effectiveness profile of taliglucerase alfa.",

Registrational clinical trials enrolled narrowly defined phenotypes, but greater diversity is encountered in clinical practice. We report real-world outcomes with long-term eliglustat treatment in adults with GD1 in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry. Among 5985 GD1 patients in the Registry as of January 6, 2023, 872 started eliglustat at >=18 years old; of these, 469 met inclusion criteria. We compared clinical parameters at eliglustat initiation (i.e., baseline) and follow-up in treatment-naive patients and used linear mixed models to estimate annual change from baseline in parameters among patients who switched to eliglustat after >=1 year on enzyme replacement therapy. Over 4 years of follow-up in non-splenectomized treatment-naive patients, hemoglobin and platelet count increased, liver and spleen volume decreased, and total lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score decreased slightly. Among non-splenectomized switch patients, on average, hemoglobin decreased -0.030 (95% CI: -0.053, -0.008) g/dL (N = 272) and platelet count increased 2.229 (95% CI: 0.751, 3.706) x 103/mm3 (N = 262) annually up to 10 years; liver volume decreased (-0.009 [95% CI: -0.015, -0.003] MN) (N = 102) and spleen volume remained stable (-0.070 [95% CI: -0.150, 0.010] MN) (N = 106) annually up to 7 years; and total lumbar spine BMD Z-score increased 0.041 (95% CI: 0.015, 0.066) (N = 183) annually up to 8 years. Among splenectomized switch patients, clinical parameters were stable over time.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with a prevalence in the general population of ~1 per 100 000. To optimise the recognition, diagnosis and management of patients with GD in South Africa (SA), it is important to have an understanding of local patterns of presentation of the disease. OBJECTIVES: To describe the baseline pretreatment characteristics of the SA cohort of patients enrolled into the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry whowere treated with imiglucerase (Cerezyme; Sanofi Genzyme). METHODS: The ICGG Gaucher Registry is an observational, longitudinal, international database that tracks the clinical, demographic, genetic, biochemical and therapeutic characteristics of patients with GD globally, irrespective of disease severity, treatment status or treatment choice. The study population included all SA patients reported in the ICGG Gaucher Registry as of 1 May 2020. RESULTS: The registry included 49 SA GD patients, of whom 32 received imiglucerase as first primary GD therapy. All the patients had GD type 1, 59.4% were female, and mean and median ages at diagnosis were 14.7 and 9.8 years, respectively. The most common genotype was N370S/N370S (37.5%). At treatment initiation, 30.0% of patients had been splenectomised. Among patients for whom data were available, anaemia was present in one-third of non-splenectomised patients and 12.5% of those with splenectomy, and moderate or severe thrombocytopenia was reported in two-thirds of non-splenectomised patients. Bone pain was present in 30.8% and 57.1% of non- splenectomised and splenectomised patients, respectively. No bone crises were reported, and data relating to other bone complications were available for only <=3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Haematological findings and bone pain in this group are similar to those in the global ICGG Gaucher Registry cohort. Lack of baseline data for other bone complications limits interpretation in that regard. Clinicians who treat patients with GD are encouraged to submit accurate, complete and up-to-date information so that comprehensive data for the subset of SA GD patients can be maintained to improve recognition and diagnosis, and guide appropriate and effective use of treatment for SA patients.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The therapy and management of Gaucher disease (GD) have radically changed with the use of substrate reduction therapy, of which eliglustat is the most widely known drug, allowing it to overcome the limits of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The rarity of GD and the limited use of eliglustat outside clinical trials require further study of its strengths and weaknesses. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of eliglustat in a cohort of 12 patients with GD followed up in our center, reporting a reduction in both chitotriosidase (394.3 vs 181.1 nmol/h/mL, P = 0.027) and glucosylsphingosine values (45.1 vs 18.9 ng/mL, P <0.001) after at least 12 months of therapy compared with baseline, regardless of patient demographic characteristics and GD characteristics. FINDINGS: There were no drug-related serious adverse effects and no drug-related cardiac events. Most adverse events were mild and transient, mainly dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Of interest, we reported an absence of statistical difference in terms of response regarding glucosylsphingosine reduction in relation to naive or prior exposure to ERT (P = 0.296), which was confirmed also when patients were placed in naive and treated groups for <5 vs >5 years (P = 0.667). IMPLICATIONS: The use of eliglustat immediately after diagnosis may guarantee the best treatment for patients with milder phenotypes or with aggressive disease after an initial stabilization with ERT compared with ERT, which cannot adequately remove the disease burden despite the apparent response, thus potentially reducing future complications caused by substrate deposits.",

We evaluated the \"real-world\" effectiveness of first-line imiglucerase on long-term bone outcomes in Italian patients in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry. METHODS: Patients treated with imiglucerase for >=2 years and with bone assessments at baseline and during follow-up were selected. Data on bone pain, bone crises, marrow infiltration, avascular necrosis, infarction, lytic lesions, Erlenmeyer flask deformity, bone fractures, mineral density, and imiglucerase dosage were evaluated. RESULTS: Data on bone manifestations were available for 73 of 229 patients (31.9 %). Bone crises frequency decreased significantly from baseline to the most recent follow-up (p < 0.001), with some improvement observed in bone pain prevalence. Bone pain and bone crises prevalence decreased significantly from baseline at 2 to <4 and 4 to <6 years (all p < 0.05). A low median (25th, 75th percentile) baseline imiglucerase dosage was identified in patients reporting bone pain or bone crises (15.0 [13.7, 30.0] and 22.8 [17.5, 36.0] U/kg once every 2 weeks, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the management of GD in Italy, with regards to imiglucerase dosage, is suboptimal and confirms the need for clinicians to monitor and correctly treat bone disease according to best practice guidelines.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with a prevalence in the general population of ~1 per 100 000. To optimise the recognition, diagnosis and management of patients with GD in South Africa (SA), it is important to have an understanding of local patterns of presentation of the disease. OBJECTIVES: To describe the baseline pretreatment characteristics of the SA cohort of patients enrolled into the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry whowere treated with imiglucerase (Cerezyme; Sanofi Genzyme). METHODS: The ICGG Gaucher Registry is an observational, longitudinal, international database that tracks the clinical, demographic, genetic, biochemical and therapeutic characteristics of patients with GD globally, irrespective of disease severity, treatment status or treatment choice. The study population included all SA patients reported in the ICGG Gaucher Registry as of 1 May 2020. RESULTS: The registry included 49 SA GD patients, of whom 32 received imiglucerase as first primary GD therapy. All the patients had GD type 1, 59.4% were female, and mean and median ages at diagnosis were 14.7 and 9.8 years, respectively. The most common genotype was N370S/N370S (37.5%). At treatment initiation, 30.0% of patients had been splenectomised. Among patients for whom data were available, anaemia was present in one-third of non-splenectomised patients and 12.5% of those with splenectomy, and moderate or severe thrombocytopenia was reported in two-thirds of non-splenectomised patients. Bone pain was present in 30.8% and 57.1% of non- splenectomised and splenectomised patients, respectively. No bone crises were reported, and data relating to other bone complications were available for only <=3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Haematological findings and bone pain in this group are similar to those in the global ICGG Gaucher Registry cohort. Lack of baseline data for other bone complications limits interpretation in that regard. Clinicians who treat patients with GD are encouraged to submit accurate, complete and up-to-date information so that comprehensive data for the subset of SA GD patients can be maintained to improve recognition and diagnosis, and guide appropriate and effective use of treatment for SA patients.",

The rarity of GD and the limited use of eliglustat outside clinical trials require further study of its strengths and weaknesses. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of eliglustat in a cohort of 12 patients with GD followed up in our center, reporting a reduction in both chitotriosidase (394.3 vs 181.1 nmol/h/mL, P = 0.027) and glucosylsphingosine values (45.1 vs 18.9 ng/mL, P <0.001) after at least 12 months of therapy compared with baseline, regardless of patient demographic characteristics and GD characteristics. FINDINGS: There were no drug-related serious adverse effects and no drug-related cardiac events. Most adverse events were mild and transient, mainly dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Of interest, we reported an absence of statistical difference in terms of response regarding glucosylsphingosine reduction in relation to naive or prior exposure to ERT (P = 0.296), which was confirmed also when patients were placed in naive and treated groups for <5 vs >5 years (P = 0.667). IMPLICATIONS: The use of eliglustat immediately after diagnosis may guarantee the best treatment for patients with milder phenotypes or with aggressive disease after an initial stabilization with ERT compared with ERT, which cannot adequately remove the disease burden despite the apparent response, thus potentially reducing future complications caused by substrate deposits.",

                    "abstract": "Historically, disease burden and treatment responses in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) was assessed by monitoring clinical data, laboratory, imaging, chitotriosidase (CHITO), and other biomarkers; however, these biomarkers lack specificity and CHITO is uninformative in patients heterozygous or homozygous for the CHIT1 c.1049_1072dup24 variant. Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb1. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations of CHITO and lyso-Gb1; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing lyso-Gb1 levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role of lyso-Gb1 as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for these patients.",

The criteria for treatment initiation vary across regions. Recent retrospective studies have highlighted the natural progression of never-treated GD1, suggesting that some patients remain asymptomatic or stable for extended periods. However, there is no data on long-term prospective follow-up. We conducted a prospective study following a cross-sectional analysis of 36 never-treated, non-splenectomised GD1 patients from the French Gaucher Disease Registry (FGDR). The objective was to describe the natural disease progression, tracking clinical, radiological, and biological characteristics over time. Thirty-six non-splenectomised and never-treated patients (19 women and 17 men) diagnosed with Gaucher Disease were prospectively followed for an additional median duration of 6.5 (5-8.3) years. Of the cohort, 17 remained untreated, 10 initiated treatment, and 7 were lost to follow-up. Although never-treated patients tended to be older at the time of first symptoms, diagnosis, and last follow-up compared to those who received treatment, the difference was not significant in this small cohort. At last follow-up, never-treated patients had no worsening of most of their symptoms. No significant changes were observed in platelets, chitotriosidase, and lyso-Gb1. In this prospective cohort, we highlight that patients with mild GD can remain untreated with no disease progression, offering insights into cost-effective management strategies. Identifying such patients is still challenging.",

The 17-year-old female presented with 5 months of right knee pain with associated mass on exam. She was diagnosed with ES with pulmonary metastasis. The patient was treated with 17 alternating cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide and etoposide chemotherapy followed by tumor resection and radiation per standard protocol. As part of her staging work-up, bone marrow biopsy was performed, significant for Gaucher cells. After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient began to experience severe delays averaging 30 days between cycles compared to 17.29 days observed in Children's Oncology Group data. Given her bone marrow biopsy findings and chemotherapy delays GD screening was obtained and the patient was diagnosed with GD following genetic confirmation. Due to delays in chemotherapy decreasing chance of remission, the patient was referred to Genetics for aggressive management with imiglucerase and eliglustat. After initiation of therapy the period between chemotherapy cycles decreased to 23 days on average, with a 21% increase in platelet count during therapy. The patient was able to complete ES therapy achieving remission. GD is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, as seen in our patient with ES. GD patients experience prolonged hematologic cytopenia during cancer treatment. Combining Enzyme and Substrate Reduction Therapies should be investigated as an option to improve chemotherapy adherence in GD patients.",

Yet, many endure years-long diagnostic odysseys. We report the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify patients with GD from electronic health records. METHODS: We utilized Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset (2007-2019) for feature engineering and algorithm training/testing, based on clinical characteristics of GD. Two algorithms were selected: one based on age of feature occurrence (age-based), and one based on occurrence of features (prevalence-based). Performance was compared with an adaptation of the available clinical diagnostic algorithm for identifying patients with diagnosed GD. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms were compared with diagnosed GD patients. RESULTS: Splenomegaly was the most important predictor for diagnosed GD with both algorithms, followed by geographical location (northeast USA), thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, bone density disorders, and bone pain. Overall, 1204 and 2862 patients, respectively, would need to be assessed with the age- and prevalence-based algorithms, compared with 20,743 with the clinical diagnostic algorithm, to identify 28 patients with diagnosed GD in the integrated dataset. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms had similar clinical manifestations as diagnosed GD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The age-based algorithm identified younger patients, while the prevalence-based identified patients with advanced clinical manifestations. Their combined use better captures GD heterogeneity. The two algorithms were about 10-20-fold more efficient at identifying GD patients than the clinical diagnostic algorithm. Application of these algorithms could shorten diagnostic delay by identifying undiagnosed GD patients.",

Highly stable and low-dispersed Velaglucerase-loaded Eudragit nanoparticles (NPs) (NPs: Vela); 150-160 nm mean size, polydispersity index <0. 15, zeta potential around -32 mV, and 95 % Velaglucerase alfa encapsulation efficiency were obtained. Crystallographic structural analysis by Small Angle X-ray Scattering, confirmed that Velaglucerase alfa was incorporated into the nanoparticle matrix. In vitro studies revealed that NPs: Vela preferentially interact with immunoglobulins and fibrinogen, and a positive enzyme release from NPs:Vela was observed at acidic pH; while no release was observed in neutral conditions. A positive internalization of NPs:Vela in GD mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) was also verified, increasing enzyme cellular activity compared to non-treated cells. Confocal microscopy verified that NPs:Vela colocalized with lysosomes, but no effect of NPs: Vela in the mineralization of MSC was observed. Finally, the viability of GD cell lines is not affected by NPs: Vela, in comparison with Velaglucerase alone, that negatively affects the viability of the target cells. This nanocarrier system for Velaglucerase alfa delivery in lysosomes, initially proposed to improve ERT for GD, may also serve as a starting point to address pathophysiological mechanisms in GD and other lysosomal disorders.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of Gaucher disease (GD) allows for disease-specific treatment before significant symptoms arise, preventing/delaying onset of complications. Yet, many endure years-long diagnostic odysseys. We report the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify patients with GD from electronic health records. METHODS: We utilized Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset (2007-2019) for feature engineering and algorithm training/testing, based on clinical characteristics of GD. Two algorithms were selected: one based on age of feature occurrence (age-based), and one based on occurrence of features (prevalence-based). Performance was compared with an adaptation of the available clinical diagnostic algorithm for identifying patients with diagnosed GD. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms were compared with diagnosed GD patients. RESULTS: Splenomegaly was the most important predictor for diagnosed GD with both algorithms, followed by geographical location (northeast USA), thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, bone density disorders, and bone pain. Overall, 1204 and 2862 patients, respectively, would need to be assessed with the age- and prevalence-based algorithms, compared with 20,743 with the clinical diagnostic algorithm, to identify 28 patients with diagnosed GD in the integrated dataset. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms had similar clinical manifestations as diagnosed GD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The age-based algorithm identified younger patients, while the prevalence-based identified patients with advanced clinical manifestations. Their combined use better captures GD heterogeneity. The two algorithms were about 10-20-fold more efficient at identifying GD patients than the clinical diagnostic algorithm. Application of these algorithms could shorten diagnostic delay by identifying undiagnosed GD patients.",

Surprisingly, however, preliminary studies suggest that Gaucher disease does not confer a higher risk of severe, life-threatening effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no severe cases have been reported in large cohorts of patients from the United States, Europe and Israel. It is thought that the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the cells of Gaucher patients may promote immune tolerance rather than inflammation on exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We review here the current concepts of Gaucher disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing particularly on general prevention and vaccination. We also discuss the susceptibility to COVID-19 of patients with inborn errors of type 1 interferon (IFNalpha and IFNomega) immunity. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(24): 938-942.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease type 3 (GD3) is a genetic, progressive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by visceral manifestations and chronic neurologic symptoms (e.g., horizontal ophthalmoplegia/supranuclear gaze palsy, ataxia, dystonia). The investigational agent venglustat is being studied in combination with imiglucerase as potential treatment for systemic and neuronopathic manifestations of GD3 in a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial (LEAP; N = 11). To understand perceived changes in GD3 symptoms from the perspectives of patients, caregivers, and clinicians, we conducted a qualitative case study of selected LEAP participants. METHODS: Four patients in LEAP (age range, 20-28 years), four of their caregivers, and three clinicians involved in LEAP were interviewed individually by moderators using semi-structured guides. Clinicians' perceptions were based on observation of interviewed patients and those in LEAP who were not interviewed, as well as information provided by other staff involved in LEAP, patients, and caregivers. RESULTS: Reported changes in GD3 symptoms varied among patients and among reporters. Only eye movement was spontaneously mentioned as improved by at least one patient, caregiver, and clinical expert. Symptom improvement also varied in terms of time to improvement. Within the first weeks, improvements were seen in understanding new information or complex instructions, remembering the weekday, eye movement, tremor, and seizures. Changes in alertness, engagement and responsiveness, memory, and concentration appeared after months or a year. Most caregivers and all clinical experts reported greater patient independence (e.g., increased ability to perform activities of daily living or travel independently during the trial) as a perceived treatment effect on a GD3 impact. For one patient who perceived benefits from venglustat therapy, pharmacokinetic analyses during LEAP found low to undetectable venglustat levels in their plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSION: Outcomes from this study provide insights into GD3 symptoms and the early signaling of changes reported during venglustat therapy.

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease type 3 (GD3) is a genetic, progressive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by visceral manifestations and chronic neurologic symptoms (e.g., horizontal ophthalmoplegia/supranuclear gaze palsy, ataxia, dystonia). The investigational agent venglustat is being studied in combination with imiglucerase as potential treatment for systemic and neuronopathic manifestations of GD3 in a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial (LEAP; N = 11). To understand perceived changes in GD3 symptoms from the perspectives of patients, caregivers, and clinicians, we conducted a qualitative case study of selected LEAP participants. METHODS: Four patients in LEAP (age range, 20-28 years), four of their caregivers, and three clinicians involved in LEAP were interviewed individually by moderators using semi-structured guides. Clinicians' perceptions were based on observation of interviewed patients and those in LEAP who were not interviewed, as well as information provided by other staff involved in LEAP, patients, and caregivers. RESULTS: Reported changes in GD3 symptoms varied among patients and among reporters. Only eye movement was spontaneously mentioned as improved by at least one patient, caregiver, and clinical expert. Symptom improvement also varied in terms of time to improvement. Within the first weeks, improvements were seen in understanding new information or complex instructions, remembering the weekday, eye movement, tremor, and seizures. Changes in alertness, engagement and responsiveness, memory, and concentration appeared after months or a year. Most caregivers and all clinical experts reported greater patient independence (e.g., increased ability to perform activities of daily living or travel independently during the trial) as a perceived treatment effect on a GD3 impact. For one patient who perceived benefits from venglustat therapy, pharmacokinetic analyses during LEAP found low to undetectable venglustat levels in their plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSION: Outcomes from this study provide insights into GD3 symptoms and the early signaling of changes reported during venglustat therapy.

                    "abstract": "This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.",

PLE is a difficult-to-treat complication of GD. To date, only a few pediatric GD cases with PLE and massive mesenteric lymphadenopathies have been reported. CASE: Here, we report a girl with chronic neuronopathic GD, whose disease course was complicated by massive mesenteric lymphadenopathies with resultant protein losing enteropathy despite a regular and appropriate enzyme replacement therapy of 60 IU/kg/biweekly until the development of mesenteric lymphadenopathies and 120 IU/kg/biweekly thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: PLE is a devastating and life threatening complication of GD developing despite long term use of high dose ERT. Clinicians should be alert for this complication particularly in GD patients presenting with progressive abdominal distension, edema, ascites and diarrhea or in patients who have already developed mesenteric lymphadenopathies. Timely diagnosis may allow early intervention with previously suggested surgical or medical treatment options. Although there is no specific and effective treatment, surgical and aggressive medical interventions in addition to ERT were reported to relieve diarrhea and halt progression of mesenteric lymphadenopathies.",

The 17-year-old female presented with 5 months of right knee pain with associated mass on exam. She was diagnosed with ES with pulmonary metastasis. The patient was treated with 17 alternating cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide and etoposide chemotherapy followed by tumor resection and radiation per standard protocol. As part of her staging work-up, bone marrow biopsy was performed, significant for Gaucher cells. After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient began to experience severe delays averaging 30 days between cycles compared to 17.29 days observed in Children's Oncology Group data. Given her bone marrow biopsy findings and chemotherapy delays GD screening was obtained and the patient was diagnosed with GD following genetic confirmation. Due to delays in chemotherapy decreasing chance of remission, the patient was referred to Genetics for aggressive management with imiglucerase and eliglustat. After initiation of therapy the period between chemotherapy cycles decreased to 23 days on average, with a 21% increase in platelet count during therapy. The patient was able to complete ES therapy achieving remission. GD is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, as seen in our patient with ES. GD patients experience prolonged hematologic cytopenia during cancer treatment. Combining Enzyme and Substrate Reduction Therapies should be investigated as an option to improve chemotherapy adherence in GD patients.",

Management of pregnancies in Gaucher patients is further complicated by using of enzyme replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the available scientific evidence is not conclusive because there are not proper clinical trials on this issue. The aim of this work was to establish a management guide to address the main clinical problems before, during and after pregnancy and to provide key information to healthcare professionals, patients, and families. GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of scientific evidence and develop recommendations was incorporated to elaborate this guide. For final recommendations, a structured consensus 2-round process was carried out using the Delphi method with a Gaucher expert panel. After this process, nine recommendations were elaborated related to pre-pregnant status and genetic counseling and for management during pregnancy, seven related to childbirth, and eight focused on management after delivery and breastfeeding. Regarding the quality of the evidence, values and preferences of patients were also considered. A consensus guide to define and standardize pregnancy management in Gaucher disease considering the best available evidence, complemented by experts' opinions, could be a relevant tool to help patients, nurses, midwives and physicians with little experience in Gaucher disease who do not have access to guidance from Gaucher disease treatment centers of excellence.",

Socio-ethical considerations of justified applications for PGT are part of an ongoing debate. Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene, causing Gaucher disease (GD), have emerged as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) in both patients and carriers. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist between different GBA1 pathogenic variants and the risk to develop PD: mild pathogenic variants increase the risk of developing PD by ~3-fold, while severe pathogenic variants increase this risk by ~15-fold, occurring at a younger age. A woman with GD, a compound heterozygote of N370S (now commonly described as c.1226A>G (N409S)-mild pathogenic variant) and 84insG (severe pathogenic variant), had PGT consulting before planned in vitro-fertilization. Her mother, an 84insG carrier, had early-onset PD. GBA1 sequencing of her spouse was negative. We discussed the selection for N370S carrier embryos to reduce PD risk. This case report demonstrates the expansion of PGT for late-onset conditions. These novel indications will increase the number of subjects who would be candidates for PGT. The medical and bioethical considerations of these cases should be acknowledged by the professional community and discussed with couples during genetic counseling.",

This disorder exhibits an earlier onset, a more severe course, and a higher dementia prevalence compared to idiopathic PD. While the pathogenesis remains debated between loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms, targeted therapies are emerging. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs), like high-dose Ambroxol, aim to mitigate enzyme misfolding-a primary driver of this disorder-rather than addressing metabolic deficiencies seen in Gaucher disease. Despite failed trials of substrate reduction therapies, current clinical trials with Ambroxol and other PCs highlight promising avenues for disease modification. This commentary advocates for increased awareness of Sidransky syndrome to advance diagnostic strategies, promote genetic testing, and refine targeted treatments, with the potential to transform care for GBA1-related PD and prodromal stages of the disease.",

The 17-year-old female presented with 5 months of right knee pain with associated mass on exam. She was diagnosed with ES with pulmonary metastasis. The patient was treated with 17 alternating cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide and etoposide chemotherapy followed by tumor resection and radiation per standard protocol. As part of her staging work-up, bone marrow biopsy was performed, significant for Gaucher cells. After the second cycle of chemotherapy the patient began to experience severe delays averaging 30 days between cycles compared to 17.29 days observed in Children's Oncology Group data. Given her bone marrow biopsy findings and chemotherapy delays GD screening was obtained and the patient was diagnosed with GD following genetic confirmation. Due to delays in chemotherapy decreasing chance of remission, the patient was referred to Genetics for aggressive management with imiglucerase and eliglustat. After initiation of therapy the period between chemotherapy cycles decreased to 23 days on average, with a 21% increase in platelet count during therapy. The patient was able to complete ES therapy achieving remission. GD is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, as seen in our patient with ES. GD patients experience prolonged hematologic cytopenia during cancer treatment. Combining Enzyme and Substrate Reduction Therapies should be investigated as an option to improve chemotherapy adherence in GD patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease (nGD) describes the condition of a subgroup of patients with the Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD), Gaucher disease with involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) which results from inherited deficiency of beta-glucosylceramidase. Although systemic manifestations of disease are now corrected by augmentation with macrophage-targeted therapeutic enzyme (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT), neurological disease progresses unpredictably as a result of failure of therapeutic enzyme to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Without therapy, the systemic and neurological effects of the disease progress and shorten life: investigators, principally in Sweden and the UK, pioneered bone marrow transplantation (BMT; Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation HSCT) to supply healthy marrow-derived macrophages and other cells, to correct the peripheral disease. Here we report the first long-term follow-up (over 20 years in all cases) of nine patients in the UK and Sweden who underwent HSCT in the 1970s and 1980s. This retrospective, multicentre observational study was undertaken to determine whether there are neurological features of Gaucher disease that can be corrected by HSCT and the extent to which deterioration continues after the procedure. Since intravenous administration of ERT is approved for patients with the neuronopathic disease and ameliorates many of the important systemic manifestations but fails to correct the neurological features, we also consider the current therapeutic positioning of HSCT in this disorder. RESULTS: In the nine patients here reported, neurological disease continued to progress after transplantation, manifesting as seizures, cerebellar disease and abnormalities of tone and reflexes. CONCLUSIONS: Although neurological disease progressed in this cohort of patients, there may be a future role for HSCT in the treatment of nGD. The procedure has the unique advantage of providing a life-long source of normally functioning macrophages in the bone marrow, and possibly other sites, after a single administration. HSCT moreover, clearly ameliorates systemic disease and this may be advantageous-especially where sustained provision of high-cost ERT cannot be guaranteed. Given the remaining unmet needs of patients with neuronopathic Gaucher disease and the greatly improved safety profile of the transplant procedure, HSCT could be considered to provide permanent correction of systemic disease, including bone disease not ameliorated by ERT, when combined with emerging therapies directed at the neurological manifestations of disease; this could include ex-vivo gene therapy approaches.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone diseases, with or without neurological symptoms. Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for GD, has been used for diagnosis and monitoring the response to treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for the non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD (type 2 and 3) accounts for 60%-70% of the Asian affected population. METHODS: We explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 3 (GD3). RESULTS: Four patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The types of donor were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three haploidentical. The age at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 3.8-15 years in the patients with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration of 3-14 years. All patients had successful HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in one patient. The enzyme activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became lower than the pathological value. All of the patients are still alive and physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school. None of the patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after HSCT, but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: ERT followed by HSCT could be considered as an alternative treatment for patients with GD3 who have a high risk of fatal neurological progression.",

Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1) has been shown to be a reliable, key, specific, and sensitive biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response in clinical studies of patients with GD. We evaluated the change in lyso-Gb1 concentration over time following enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed GD using real-world data from the Gaucher Outcome Survey disease registry. METHODS: Data for patients aged >= 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of GD and at least two lyso-Gb1 assessments were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were stratified by treatment status at baseline (time of first lyso-Gb1 assessment). Lyso-Gb1 concentrations were measured from dried blood spot (DBS) samples by Centogene AG. Assessments included change in lyso-Gb1 concentration, hemoglobin concentration, platelet counts, and spleen and liver volume from baseline to the last lyso-Gb1 assessment. RESULTS: Of 2007 patients enrolled in the Gaucher Outcome Survey as of February 25, 2022, 435 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study: 318 treated ('all treated'; 277 receiving treatment at baseline, 41 treatment naive at baseline), 38 receiving treatment at baseline who stopped treatment before the last lyso-Gb1 assessment, and 79 untreated. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations decreased from baseline to the last lyso-Gb1 assessment for all treated patients (median change - 8.6 ng/mL), and increased for untreated patients (median change 25.0 ng/mL) and those who stopped treatment (median change 19.5 ng/mL). Decreases were greater for all treatment-naive than previously treated patients (median change - 120.5 vs. - 3.3 ng/mL) and for velaglucerase alfa-treated patients vs. the overall treated cohort (-32.6 vs. - 8.6 ng/mL). Small improvements in hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and spleen volume were observed for treated patients but not untreated/stopped treatment cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, changes in lyso-Gb1 concentrations from DBS were reflective of responses to enzyme replacement therapy initiation or withdrawal in most patients. These findings confirm that the use of DBS samples for routine monitoring of lyso-Gb1 concentrations in patients with GD is feasible in real-world settings and may be useful to assess treatment response.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders are rare diseases caused by the accumulation of substrates of the metabolic pathway within lysosomes and peroxisomes, respectively. Owing to the rarity of these diseases, the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide survey to estimate the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. METHODS: A nationwide survey was conducted following the \"Manual of nationwide epidemiological survey for understanding patient number and clinical epidemiology of rare diseases (3rd version)\". A questionnaire asking for detailed information, such as disease phenotypes and medical history, was created and sent to 504 institutions with doctors who have experience in treating patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders. Result A total of 303 completed questionnaires were collected from 504 institutions (response rate: 60.1%). The number of patients was estimated by calculating the rate/frequency of overlap. The estimated number of patients was 1658 (+-264.8) for Fabry disease, 72 (+-11.3) for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 275 (+-49.9) for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 211 (+-31.3) for Gaucher disease, 124 (+-25.8) for Pompe disease, 83 (+-44.3) for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 57 (+-9.4) for Niemann-Pick type C, and 262 (+-42.3) for adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition the birth prevalence was calculated using the estimated number of patients and birth year data for each disease, and was 1.25 for Fabry disease, 0.09 for mucopolysaccharidosis I, 0.38 for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 0.19 for Gaucher disease, 0.14 for Pompe disease, 0.16 for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 0.16 for Niemann-Pick type C, and 0.20 for adrenoleukodystrophy. DISCUSSION: Among the diseases analyzed, the disease with the highest prevalence was Fabry disease, followed by mucopolysaccharidosis II, adrenoleukodystrophy, Gaucher disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. In particular, the high prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis II and Gaucher disease type II was a feature characteristic of Japan. CONCLUSION: We estimated the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. The details of the age at diagnosis and treatment methods for each disease were clarified, and will be useful for the early diagnosis of these patients and to provide appropriate treatments. Furthermore, our results suggest that supportive care and the development of an environment that can provide optimal medical care is important in the future.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by a lack of sufficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme known as glucocerebrosidase, which leads to an accumulation of glucocerebroside, a fatty substance, in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and rarely, the lungs or central nervous system. While there are several treatments available for people with Type 1 Gaucher disease and the visceral aspects of Type 3 Gaucher disease, no cure is present for any type of Gaucher disease. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate the safety and efficacy of gene therapy in Gaucher disease, which has the potential to become a new type of (curative) treatment in the future. Gene therapy is a relatively new therapeutic approach, and with the desire to keep the community informed about new treatment developments, the International Gaucher Alliance (IGA) set-up a Gaucher disease specific survey to gauge current perceptions. The survey aimed to benchmark understanding of, and the educational needs surrounding, gene therapy among the Gaucher disease community. BODY: An international, online survey was developed, comprising twelve questions ranging from multiple choice, Likert scale, single tick-box, ranking and open questions. The survey was developed following three patient and caregiver focus groups and underwent review from members of the IGA for readability and accuracy before going live to respondents. The survey was available for two months and shared to audiences via specific Gaucher community channels. CONCLUSION: Over 100 patients and parents/caregivers from the Gaucher disease community completed the survey, including people living with Type 1 Gaucher disease (52.88%), people living with Type 3 Gaucher disease (3.85%), parents/caregivers of people living with Type 1, 2 or 3 Gaucher disease (39.42%), and other (3.85%) who were defined as parents of multiple people with Gaucher disease. The survey uncovered various commonalities in perception of gene therapy among all groups, with large knowledge gaps identified on the mode of action, the usefulness of gene therapy and overall understanding of the therapeutic area. This survey provides an overview of the type of information that could be valuable to the Gaucher disease community when developing educational materials.",

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic benefit of systemically delivered AAV9 vectors expressing the human GBA1 gene at two different doses comparing a neuronal-selective promoter with ubiquitous promoters. Our results highlight the importance of a careful evaluation of the promoter sequence used in gene delivery vectors, suggesting a neuron-targeted therapy leading to high levels of enzymatic activity in the brain but lower GCase expression in the viscera, might be the optimal therapeutic strategy for nGD.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Several new treatment modalities are being developed for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), including gene therapy. As the currently available treatment options and their influence on disease progression differ greatly within the spectrum of LSDs, willingness to undergo gene therapy might vary among patients with LSDs and/or their representatives. The width of the LSD spectrum is illustrated by the differences between type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III). For type 1 Gaucher and Fabry disease several therapies are available, resulting in a near normal or improved, but individually varying, prognosis. No treatment options are available for MPS III. AIM: To identify factors influencing patients' and/or their representatives' decisions regarding undergoing gene therapy. METHODS: Focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease and MPS III. Parents of MPS III patients were included as patients' representatives. RESULTS: Nine Gaucher patients, 23 Fabry patients, two adult MPS III patients and five parents of MPS III patients participated in the study. The five main themes that arose were: outcome of gene therapy, risks and side effects, burden of gene therapy treatment, current situation and ethical aspects. Participants' views ranged from hesitance to eagerness to undergo gene therapy, which seemed to be mostly related to disease severity and currently available treatment options. Severe disease, limited treatment options and limited effectiveness of current treatment augmented the willingness to choose gene therapy. Gaucher and Fabry patients deemed the burden of treatment important. Fabry and MPS III patients and parents considered outcome important, suggesting hope for improvement. When asked to rank the factors discussed in the focus group discussions, Gaucher patients ranked outcome low, which could indicate a more cautious attitude towards gene therapy. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the importance of exploring patients' needs and expectations before using limited resources in the development of therapies for patient groups of which a significant subset may not be willing to undergo that specific therapy.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene therapy is currently in development for several monogenetic diseases including lysosomal storage disorders. Limited evidence is available on patient preferences for gene therapy in this population. In this study, we compare gene therapy-related risk tolerance between people affected by three lysosomal storage diseases currently faced with different therapeutic options and prognoses. METHODS: A survey including the probabilistic threshold technique was developed in which respondents were asked to choose between gene therapy and the current standard of care. The attributes included to establish participants' risk tolerance were previously identified in focus groups of affected people or their representatives, namely: risk of mild side effects, severe side effects, the need for additional medication, and the likelihood of long-term effectiveness. The survey was distributed among people receiving outpatient care for type 1 Gaucher disease (good prognosis with current treatment options), Fabry disease (varying prognosis with current treatment options, XY-genotype on average more severely affected than XX), and parents representing people with severe forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B (poor prognosis, no disease-specific therapy available). RESULTS: A total of 85 surveys were completed (15 Gaucher disease respondents, 62 Fabry disease respondents (17 self-identifying male), eight parents of ten people with mucopolysaccharidosis type III). Disease groups with higher disease severity trended towards higher risk tolerance: Gaucher disease respondents were most cautious and predominantly preferred the current standard of care as opposed to MPS III representatives who were more risk tolerant. Respondents with Fabry disease were most heterogeneous in their risk tolerance, with male participants being more risk tolerant than female participants. Long-term effectiveness was the attribute in which respondents tolerated the least risk. CONCLUSIONS: People affected by a lysosomal storage disease associated with a poorer prognosis and less effective current treatment options trended towards more risk tolerance when choosing between gene therapy and the current standard of care. This study shows the importance of involvement of patient preferences before and during the development process of new treatment modalities such as gene therapy for rare diseases, to ensure that innovative therapies align with the wishes and needs of people affected by these diseases.",

The most acute neuronopathic form (nGD), for which there are no curative therapeutic options, is characterised by devastating neuropathology and death during infancy. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic benefit of systemically delivered AAV9 vectors expressing the human GBA1 gene at two different doses comparing a neuronal-selective promoter with ubiquitous promoters. Our results highlight the importance of a careful evaluation of the promoter sequence used in gene delivery vectors, suggesting a neuron-targeted therapy leading to high levels of enzymatic activity in the brain but lower GCase expression in the viscera, might be the optimal therapeutic strategy for nGD.",

This study evaluates bone health in adult GD type 1 patients, focusing on skeletal complications, bone mineral density (BMD), and biochemical markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of adult GD type 1 patients followed up at Ege University Pediatric Metabolism Department were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: This study included 32 patients with GD type 1, comprising 11 males (34.4%) and 21 females (65.6%). The median age at diagnosis was 20.5 years (min: 3-max:65), and at enrolment, it was 35 years (min:18-max:71). Most patients (93.8%) had organomegaly, and 93.8% had cytopenia. Common genetic variants were p.Asn409Ser (60.9%), p.Leu483Pro (7.8%), and p.Asp448His(4.7%). All patients were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for a median of 11 years (min:2-max:18). Bone complications included pathologic fractures in six patients (19%) and avascular necrosis in 12 patients (37.5%). Bone pain was reported by 93.7% of patients at admission and persisted in 59.4% during follow-up. DXA scans showed abnormal bone mineral density (BMD) in 62.5% of patients initially, with a significantly low bone density in 3.1% and reduced bone density in 59.3%. BMD improved with treatment, as evidenced by a significant increase in Z scores (p < 0.05). Elevated chitotriosidase (75%), ferritin (50%), and immunoglobulin G (21.9%) levels were noted but did not correlate with BMD. Seven patients (22%) were splenectomized, all with bone issues. DISCUSSION: Bone health in GD involves multiple factors beyond biochemical markers. While ERT improves BMD, bone pain and fractures remain significant issues. Comprehensive management, including regular BMD monitoring and better vitamin D supplementation adherence, is crucial. Further research is needed to improve treatments for bone complications in GD.",

To optimise the recognition, diagnosis and management of patients with GD in South Africa (SA), it is important to have an understanding of local patterns of presentation of the disease. OBJECTIVES: To describe the baseline pretreatment characteristics of the SA cohort of patients enrolled into the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry whowere treated with imiglucerase (Cerezyme; Sanofi Genzyme). METHODS: The ICGG Gaucher Registry is an observational, longitudinal, international database that tracks the clinical, demographic, genetic, biochemical and therapeutic characteristics of patients with GD globally, irrespective of disease severity, treatment status or treatment choice. The study population included all SA patients reported in the ICGG Gaucher Registry as of 1 May 2020. RESULTS: The registry included 49 SA GD patients, of whom 32 received imiglucerase as first primary GD therapy. All the patients had GD type 1, 59.4% were female, and mean and median ages at diagnosis were 14.7 and 9.8 years, respectively. The most common genotype was N370S/N370S (37.5%). At treatment initiation, 30.0% of patients had been splenectomised. Among patients for whom data were available, anaemia was present in one-third of non-splenectomised patients and 12.5% of those with splenectomy, and moderate or severe thrombocytopenia was reported in two-thirds of non-splenectomised patients. Bone pain was present in 30.8% and 57.1% of non- splenectomised and splenectomised patients, respectively. No bone crises were reported, and data relating to other bone complications were available for only <=3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Haematological findings and bone pain in this group are similar to those in the global ICGG Gaucher Registry cohort. Lack of baseline data for other bone complications limits interpretation in that regard. Clinicians who treat patients with GD are encouraged to submit accurate, complete and up-to-date information so that comprehensive data for the subset of SA GD patients can be maintained to improve recognition and diagnosis, and guide appropriate and effective use of treatment for SA patients.",

This prospective clinical trial assessed the oxidant-antioxidant status in Egyptian patients with GD and the efficacy and safety and of vitamin E as an adjuvant antioxidant therapy. Forty children and adolescents with GD on stable doses of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) were enrolled. Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography were performed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes (reduced glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], and peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2]) were assessed. Patients were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with GD were randomized either to receive oral vitamin E for 6 months or not. All patients with GD had significantly higher MDA levels with lower levels of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Vitamin E and PRDX2 were negatively correlated to severity score index (SSI), lyso GL1, and MDA. After 6 months of vitamin E supplementation, SSI and liver and spleen volumes and liver stiffness were significantly lower. Lyso GL1 and MDA were significantly decreased post-vitamin E therapy while antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher compared with baseline levels and with patients without vitamin E therapy. Oxidative stress is related to disease severity in pediatric patients with GD. A 6-month vitamin E supplementation for those patients represents a safe therapeutic adjuvant agent increasing the efficacy of ERT, reducing oxidative stress, and improving outcomes.",

Enzyme replacement therapy is ineffective for neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD). High-dose ambroxol has been administered as an alternative treatment for a group of patients with nGD. However, little is known about the clinical indication and the long-term outcome of patients after ambroxol therapy. We herein report a case of a female patient who presented with a progressive disease of GD type 2 from 11 months of age and had the pathogenic variants of p.L483P (formerly defined as p.L444P) and p.R502H (p.R463H) in GBA1. A combined treatment of imiglucerase with ambroxol started improving the patient's motor activity in 1 week, while it kept the long-lasting effect of preventing the deteriorating phenotype for 30 months. A literature review identified 40 patients with nGD, who had received high-dose ambroxol therapy. More than 65% of these patients favorably responded to the molecular chaperone therapy, irrespective of p.L483P homozygous, heterozygous or the other genotypes. These results highlight the long-lasting effect of ambroxol-based chaperone therapy for patients with an expanding spectrum of mutations in GBA1.",

The underlying cause mainly is an enzyme deficiency but may also be due to defects in transport or activation proteins, which result in progressive intra- and extra-lysosomal accumulation of undegraded storage material. The lysosomes play a key role in degradation and cellular recycling of macromolecules.

Glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (GCSi) have the potential to treat several GSL storage diseases by reducing the synthesis of the disease-causing GSLs. AL01211 is a potent oral GCSi under investigation for Type 1 Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. Here, we evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of AL01211 in healthy Chinese volunteers. METHODS: AL01211 was tested in a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with single-dose (15 and 60 mg) and multiple-dose (30 mg) arms. RESULTS: Results of AL01211 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption (median time to maximum plasma concentration [tmax] 2.5-4 hours), relatively slow clearance rate (mean apparent total clearance from plasma [CL/F] 88.3-200 L/h) and the mean terminal half-life above 30 hours. Repeated once-daily oral administration of AL01211 for 14 days had an approximately 2-fold accumulation, reaching steady-state levels between 7 and 10 days, and led to a 73% reduction in plasma glucosylceramide (GL1) on Day 14. AL01211 was safe and well tolerated, with no identified serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: AL01211 showed a favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability profile in healthy Chinese volunteers. These data support the further clinical development of AL01211 as a therapy for GSL storage diseases. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: Clinical Trial Registry no.

                    "abstract": "Glycosphingolipid (GSL) storage diseases are caused by deficiencies in the enzymes that metabolize different GSLs in the lysosome. Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors reduce GSL production and have potential to treat multiple GSL storage diseases. AL01211 is a potent, oral GCS inhibitor being developed for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. AL01211 has minimal central nervous system penetration, allowing for treatment of peripheral organs without risking CNS-associated adverse effects. AL01211 was evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study with single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) arms, to determine safety, pharmacokinetics including food effect, and pharmacodynamic effects on associated GSLs. In the SAD arm, AL01211 showed a Tmax of approximately 3.5 hours, mean clearance (CL/F) of 130.1 L/h, and t1/2  of 39.3 hours. Consuming a high-fat meal prior to dose administration reduced exposures 3.5-5.5-fold, indicating a food effect. In the MAD arm, AL01211 had an approximately 2-fold accumulation, reaching steady-state levels by 10 days. Increasing exposure inversely correlated with a decrease in GSL with plasma glucosylceramide and globotriacylceramide reduction from baseline levels, reaching 78% and 52% by day 14, respectively. AL01211 was generally well-tolerated with no AL01211 associated serious adverse events, thus supporting its further clinical development.",

                    "abstract": "Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is practiced worldwide, allowing the prevention of the transmission and expression of various genetic conditions. Socio-ethical considerations of justified applications for PGT are part of an ongoing debate. Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene, causing Gaucher disease (GD), have emerged as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) in both patients and carriers. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist between different GBA1 pathogenic variants and the risk to develop PD: mild pathogenic variants increase the risk of developing PD by ~3-fold, while severe pathogenic variants increase this risk by ~15-fold, occurring at a younger age. A woman with GD, a compound heterozygote of N370S (now commonly described as c.1226A>G (N409S)-mild pathogenic variant) and 84insG (severe pathogenic variant), had PGT consulting before planned in vitro-fertilization. Her mother, an 84insG carrier, had early-onset PD. GBA1 sequencing of her spouse was negative. We discussed the selection for N370S carrier embryos to reduce PD risk. This case report demonstrates the expansion of PGT for late-onset conditions. These novel indications will increase the number of subjects who would be candidates for PGT. The medical and bioethical considerations of these cases should be acknowledged by the professional community and discussed with couples during genetic counseling.",

                    "abstract": "Historically, disease burden and treatment responses in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) was assessed by monitoring clinical data, laboratory, imaging, chitotriosidase (CHITO), and other biomarkers; however, these biomarkers lack specificity and CHITO is uninformative in patients heterozygous or homozygous for the CHIT1 c.1049_1072dup24 variant. Recently, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both CHITO and lyso-Gb1. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations of CHITO and lyso-Gb1; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing lyso-Gb1 levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role of lyso-Gb1 as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for these patients.",

Gaucher disease, caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, belongs to this class of disorders, and it is considered the most common among the Lysosomal Storage Diseases. The two main therapeutic approaches are the Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and the Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT). ERT, consisting in replacing the defective enzyme by administering a recombinant enzyme, is effective in alleviating the visceral symptoms, hallmarks of the most common subtype of the disease whereas it has no effects when symptoms involve CNS, since the recombinant protein is unable to significantly cross the Blood Brain Barrier. The SRT strategy involves inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), the enzyme responsible for the production of the associated storage molecule. The rational design of new inhibitors of GCS has been hampered by the lack of either the crystal structure of the enzyme or an in-silico model of the active site which could provide important information regarding the interactions of potential inhibitors with the target, but, despite this, interesting results have been obtained and are herein reviewed.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, in which biallelic pathogenic variants in the Glucosidase beta acid (GBA) gene result in defective functioning of glucosylceramidase that causes deposition of glucocerebroside in cells. GD has 3 major types namely, non-neuronopathic (type I), acute neuronopathic (type II), and chronic neuronopathic (type III). Definite treatment options are limited and expensive. They succumb early to the disease, if untreated. There is paucity of studies from the Indian subcontinent, which elicit the factors resulting in their premature mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care setting of South India to assess the clinical profile, mutation spectrum, and various management strategies (only supportive therapy, enzyme replacement therapy [ERT], substrate reduction therapy [SRT] haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT]), and mortality predictors of patients with GD from 2004 to 2019. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted. In silico predictions were performed for novel variants. RESULTS: There were 60 patients with all types of GD seen over the study period of 15 years. Their median age at diagnosis was 2 years. The median follow-up was for 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-8). The overall mortality rate was 35%; however, it was only 10% in those receiving definite treatment. Mortality was higher (47.5%) by more than 4 folds in those only on supportive therapy. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 6.3 years (IQR = 3.5-10.8) in the definite treatment group and 3.5 years (IQR = 1-5) in those on supportive therapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significant (p value 0.001) mortality difference between these groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found the neuronopathic type (OR = 5) and only supportive therapy (OR = 6.3) to be the independent risk factors for premature mortality. CONCLUSION: GD is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, if left untreated. ERT and SRT are the definitive treatments which increase the survival. In resource-limited settings like India, with higher prevalence of the neuronopathic type, HSCT may be a more suitable definitive treatment option, due to its one-time intervention and cost, assuming similar efficacy to ERT. However, the efficacy and safety of HSCT in GD needs to be established further by substantial patient numbers undergoing it.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study that included patients with LDS treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Published clinical trials (CT) and LDS treatment guidelines were reviewed to select efficacy variables. Data to measure them (and adverse effects) were obtained from the medical history. RESULTS: No CTs have been found in which efficacy is evaluated with final variables, all have been surrogated. Twenty-two patients were included: eight with Gaucher disease, six with Niemann-PickC disease, two with Hunter disease, one with Morquio-A disease, and five with Pompe disease. Eight patients have responded to ERT and one to SRT with eliglustat. ERT has not been associated with adverse effects. Miglustat has produced tolerance problems, requiring a change in a patient. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness was variable according to the pathology. Regarding safety, manageable adverse reactions to SRT were associated with dosage adjustments.",
