input_text: 'Effectiveness and Safety of Eliglustat Treatment in Gaucher Disease:
  Real-Life Unicentric Experience. PURPOSE: The therapy and management of Gaucher
  disease (GD) have radically changed with the use of substrate reduction therapy,
  of which eliglustat is the most widely known drug, allowing it to overcome the limits
  of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The rarity of GD and the limited use of eliglustat
  outside clinical trials require further study of its strengths and weaknesses. METHODS:
  In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of eliglustat in a cohort
  of 12 patients with GD followed up in our center, reporting a reduction in both
  chitotriosidase (394.3 vs 181.1 nmol/h/mL, P = 0.027) and glucosylsphingosine values
  (45.1 vs 18.9 ng/mL, P <0.001) after at least 12 months of therapy compared with
  baseline, regardless of patient demographic characteristics and GD characteristics.
  FINDINGS: There were no drug-related serious adverse effects and no drug-related
  cardiac events. Most adverse events were mild and transient, mainly dyspepsia and
  abdominal pain. Of interest, we reported an absence of statistical difference in
  terms of response regarding glucosylsphingosine reduction in relation to naive or
  prior exposure to ERT (P = 0.296), which was confirmed also when patients were placed
  in naive and treated groups for <5 vs >5 years (P = 0.667). IMPLICATIONS: The use
  of eliglustat immediately after diagnosis may guarantee the best treatment for patients
  with milder phenotypes or with aggressive disease after an initial stabilization
  with ERT compared with ERT, which cannot adequately remove the disease burden despite
  the apparent response, thus potentially reducing future complications caused by
  substrate deposits.'
