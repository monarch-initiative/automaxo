input_text: Sidransky Syndrome-GBA1-Related Parkinson's Disease and Its Targeted Therapies.
  Sidransky syndrome represents a distinct variant of Parkinson's disease (PD) that
  is linked to pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene. This disorder
  exhibits an earlier onset, a more severe course, and a higher dementia prevalence
  compared to idiopathic PD. While the pathogenesis remains debated between loss-of-function
  and gain-of-function mechanisms, targeted therapies are emerging. Pharmacological
  chaperones (PCs), like high-dose Ambroxol, aim to mitigate enzyme misfolding-a primary
  driver of this disorder-rather than addressing metabolic deficiencies seen in Gaucher
  disease. Despite failed trials of substrate reduction therapies, current clinical
  trials with Ambroxol and other PCs highlight promising avenues for disease modification.
  This commentary advocates for increased awareness of Sidransky syndrome to advance
  diagnostic strategies, promote genetic testing, and refine targeted treatments,
  with the potential to transform care for GBA1-related PD and prodromal stages of
  the disease.
