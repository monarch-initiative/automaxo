input_text: 'Health care costs of home care enzyme replacement therapy for patients
  with lysosomal storage diseases in Germany. BACKGROUND: Lysosomal storage diseases
  (LSDs) can be treated with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT is
  being administered either in specialized clinics or in the home care setting. Studies
  indicate that home-based ERT can be considered safe and positively effects patient
  reported outcomes. Due to the higher level of individual care required by nurses
  when administering ERT at home, questions arise whether this will result in additional
  costs for health care systems. Since cost data to the German health care system
  are currently unavailable, this study aims to assess home care ERT costs of LSD
  patients. METHODS: The longitudinal study assessed the direct costs of home-based
  ERT for patients with LSD diseases Fabry, Pompe, Gaucher, and MPS I from 2019 to
  2021 on a patient-by-patient basis by evaluating the healthcare documentation. Costs
  assessed included ERT drug and further administration equipment, time needed to
  prepare, administer, and post-process the infusion, and travel expenses of nursing
  staff. RESULTS: Data from 62 patients was analyzed: of these, 29 (46.8%) with Fabry
  disease, 19 (30.6%) with Pompe disease, 10 (16.1%) with Gaucher disease, and 4 (6.5%)
  with MPS I. Patients ranged in age from 3 to 79 (mean 40 years); 42% of patients
  reported comorbidities (19.4% with hypertension, and 10% with heart disease). Mean
  total ERT-related costs were $369,047 per year across all patients. Approximately
  98.5% of these costs were attributable to the infusion therapy and administration
  itself ($363,880), and approximately 1.5% were attributable to personnel and travel
  costs. Patients with Pompe disease incurred the highest average annual costs ($483,907)
  and patients with Fabry disease the lowest ($264,896). Cost differences among underlying
  LSDs were due primarily to ERT drug costs; the drug infused for Fabry disease costs
  about half as much as that for Gaucher or for Pompe disease. Despite MPS I patients
  requiring about twice as many infusions, significantly lower drug costs for this
  disease resulted in the second lowest total mean costs of all LSD subtypes analyzed.
  CONCLUSION: As total costs are almost entirely driven by infusion-related material,
  especially the ERT drug, moving ERT into the home environment is not expected to
  increase costs.'
