input_text: "A 6-month randomized controlled trial for vitamin E supplementation in
  pediatric patients with Gaucher disease: Effect on oxidative stress, disease severity
  and hepatic complications. Enzymatic deficiency in Gaucher disease (GD) may induce
  oxidative stress. Vitamin E is the nature's most effective lipid-soluble antioxidant.
  This prospective clinical trial assessed the oxidant-antioxidant status in Egyptian
  patients with GD and the efficacy and safety and of vitamin E as an adjuvant antioxidant
  therapy. Forty children and adolescents with GD on stable doses of enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) were enrolled. Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography
  were performed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes (reduced
  glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], and
  peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2]) were assessed. Patients were compared with 40 age- and
  sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with GD were randomized either to receive
  oral vitamin E for 6 months or not. All patients with GD had significantly higher
  MDA levels with lower levels of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes compared with
  healthy controls (p < 0.001). Vitamin E and PRDX2 were negatively correlated to
  severity score index (SSI), lyso GL1, and MDA. After 6 months of vitamin E supplementation,
  SSI and liver and spleen volumes and liver stiffness were significantly lower. Lyso
  GL1 and MDA were significantly decreased post-vitamin E therapy while antioxidant
  enzymes were significantly higher compared with baseline levels and with patients
  without vitamin E therapy. Oxidative stress is related to disease severity in pediatric
  patients with GD. A 6-month vitamin E supplementation for those patients represents
  a safe therapeutic adjuvant agent increasing the efficacy of ERT, reducing oxidative
  stress, and improving outcomes."
