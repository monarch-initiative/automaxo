input_text: Comparison of different promoters to improve AAV vector-mediated gene
  therapy for neuronopathic Gaucher disease. Gaucher Disease (GD) is an inherited
  metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene. It can manifest with severe
  neurodegeneration and visceral pathology. The most acute neuronopathic form (nGD),
  for which there are no curative therapeutic options, is characterised by devastating
  neuropathology and death during infancy. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic
  benefit of systemically delivered AAV9 vectors expressing the human GBA1 gene at
  two different doses comparing a neuronal-selective promoter with ubiquitous promoters.
  Our results highlight the importance of a careful evaluation of the promoter sequence
  used in gene delivery vectors, suggesting a neuron-targeted therapy leading to high
  levels of enzymatic activity in the brain but lower GCase expression in the viscera,
  might be the optimal therapeutic strategy for nGD.
