input_text: 'Two delayed-diagnosis case reports of long-lasting thrombocytopenia with
  splenomegaly. RATIONALE: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage
  disorder disease progression and inappropriate treatment. However, not all patients
  with GD receive timely diagnosis and treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: Early diagnosis
  is important for initiating proper treatment and preventing complications. DIAGNOSES:
  Two patients were diagnosed as GD in this study. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: These
  2 patients received the imiglucerase enzyme replacement and symptoms significantly
  improved by the follow-up. LESSONS: Herein, we report 2 patients with a delayed
  diagnosis of GD to increase awareness and improve education regarding rare diseases.
  However, noninvasive beta-glucocerebrosidase activity or GBA gene testing had not
  been done before bone marrow aspiration, which are the noninvasive and reliable
  tests that indicate the diagnosis of GD.'
