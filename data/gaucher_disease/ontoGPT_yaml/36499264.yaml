input_text: 'Glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb1): An Informative Biomarker in the Clinical
  Monitoring of Patients with Gaucher Disease. Historically, disease burden and treatment
  responses in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) was assessed by monitoring clinical
  data, laboratory, imaging, chitotriosidase (CHITO), and other biomarkers; however,
  these biomarkers lack specificity and CHITO is uninformative in patients heterozygous
  or homozygous for the CHIT1 c.1049_1072dup24 variant. Recently, glucosylsphingosine
  (lyso-Gb1), a sensitive and specific GD biomarker, has been recommended for patient
  monitoring. Furthermore, studies measuring lyso-Gb1 and CHITO in patients on long-term
  treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and/or substrate reduction therapy
  (SRT) reported as group data show a reduction in both analytes, yet individualized
  patient data are generally unavailable. We describe seven patients on long-term
  treatment with longitudinal clinical data with monitoring based on current treatment
  guidelines. We present four patients who exhibit stable disease with normalized
  CHITO despite elevated lyso-Gb1. We present one patient who transitioned from ERT
  to SRT due to lack of a clinical response with life-threatening thrombocytopenia
  who responded with marked improvement in platelets, and normalized levels of both
  CHITO and lyso-Gb1. Finally, we present two ERT to SRT switch patients with stable
  disease on ERT who exhibited non-compliance on SRT, one with mirrored marked elevations
  of CHITO and lyso-Gb1; and another with normal CHITO and platelets, but increasing
  lyso-Gb1 levels and enlarged spleen. These clinical vignettes highlight the role
  of lyso-Gb1 as a sensitive biomarker in management of patients with GD, and its
  further value when CHITO is normal and thus uninformative. We highlight the personalized
  medicine approach needed to optimize treatment outcomes and recommendations for
  these patients.'
