input_text: 'Changing clinical manifestations of Gaucher disease in Taiwan. BACKGROUND:
  Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficient
  glucocerebrosidase activity that results from biallelic mutations in the GBA1 gene.
  Its phenotypic variability allows GD to be classified into 3 subtypes based on the
  presence and extent of neurological manifestations. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
  has been available for all patients with GD in Taiwan since 1998. Newborn screening
  (NBS) for GD has been available since 2015. This study attempted to unveil the clinical
  features of patients diagnosed with GD during different eras in Taiwan. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: Data from the health records of two tertiary hospitals responsible
  for two-thirds of the patients with GD in Taiwan were used. The study population
  included all patients identified as having GD between 1998, and April 2022, in these
  two hospitals for review. A total of 42 individuals were included, six of whom were
  diagnosed by NBS. RESULTS: Our cohort presented a higher proportion of GD3 individuals,
  both by clinical suspicion and by NBS diagnosis, than that reported worldwide. The
  major subtypes that were recognized following NBS diagnosis were GD2 and GD3. The
  majority of GD patients carry at least one p.Leu483Pro variant. The 5-year survival
  rates were 0% for GD2 patients and 100% for patients with other subtypes. Patients
  diagnosed during the post-NBS era were free of symptoms on initial presentation,
  except for those with the GD2 subtype. For those diagnosed earlier, ERT was shown
  to be effective in terms of improved hemograms and prevented bone crises. However,
  the neurological symptoms in GD3 patients progressed despite ERT intervention. CONCLUSION:
  ERT is essential in reversing the hematological presentations and preventing the
  skeletal complications of GD. Timely diagnosis of GD with NBS allows for early intervention
  with ERT to prevent disease progression and complications. However, the need for
  effective intervention for neurological dysfunction remains unmet.'
