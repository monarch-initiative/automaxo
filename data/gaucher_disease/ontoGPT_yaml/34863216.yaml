input_text: 'Long-term safety and effectiveness of velaglucerase alfa in Gaucher disease:
  6-year interim analysis of a post-marketing surveillance in Japan. BACKGROUND: Gaucher
  disease (GD) is caused by reduced lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase activity.
  Heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes have been observed within GD types and across
  ethnicities. Enzyme replacement therapy is generally recommended for patients with
  type 1 GD, the least severe form of GD. In Japan, velaglucerase alfa has a broad
  indication covering type 1, 2 or 3 GD.  METHODS: All patients with type 1, 2, or
  3 GD administered velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion
  after its launch date in Japan in 2014, were enrolled in a non-interventional, observational
  post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Individual patient data were reported via case
  report forms (CRFs). Key safety endpoints investigated included the incidence of
  infusion-related reactions (IRRs), the safety of velaglucerase alfa in patients
  with types 2 and 3 GD, from patients under one year of age to elderly patients (>=
  65 years of age). Long-term efficacy was also assessed.  RESULTS: In total, 53 patients
  with GD were registered. CRFs were available for 41 (77.4%) patients at the 6-year
  interim analysis. Fourteen adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in seven
  patients. All reported ADRs occurred in patients with type 2 GD. ADRs were reported
  by 63.6% (7/11) of patients with type 2 GD. Ten ADRs were reported in five patients
  aged < 4 years. No elderly patients experienced any ADR during the surveillance
  period. Five ADRs occurring in three (10.0%) patients were classified as IRRs, with
  one case of vomiting (moderate severity) resulting in treatment discontinuation.
  Ten serious adverse events were reported in five (16.7%) patients. Three fatal events
  were considered to be unrelated to treatment with velaglucerase alfa. Platelet counts
  increased after the administration of velaglucerase alfa and were generally maintained
  within the normal range over the administration period. Among eleven patients tested
  for neutralizing anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies, two (18.2%) were assessed as
  positive results.  CONCLUSION: PMS data from patients with types 1-3 GD in Japan
  indicate that long-term treatment with velaglucerase alfa was well-tolerated and
  associated with increased platelet counts, which is consistent with observations
  made in studies outside of Japan. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03625882 registered July
  2014.'
