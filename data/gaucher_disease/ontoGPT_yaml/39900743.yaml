input_text: 'Model-informed repurposing of eliglustat for treatment and prophylaxis
  of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic-uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) in
  children. BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic-uremic syndrome
  (STEC-HUS) is a severe illness predominantly affecting young children, with limited
  treatment options beyond supportive care. Eliglustat, approved for Gaucher disease,
  shows potential in reducing Shiga toxin binding to target glomerular endothelial
  cells in vitro, prompting interest as a treatment for STEC-HUS. However, it remains
  unknown what dose is likely to be effective and safe for treatment of STEC-HUS in
  the pediatric population. We hypothesize that effective and safe levels of eliglustat
  can be reached in children. METHODS: We identified pharmacokinetic targets of efficacy
  for treatment and prophylaxis of STEC-HUS based on a preclinical model and human
  cardiac safety data. Then, we developed oral and intravenous dosing regimens using
  population pharmacokinetic (popPK) simulations based on an existing model enriched
  to allow extrapolation to a simulated virtual pediatric population. These dosing
  regimens were then confirmed using a verified physiologically based pharmacokinetic
  (PBPK) model. RESULTS: We simulated, using popPK data, oral and intravenous dosing
  regimens resulting in adequate target exposure in > 90% of all patients, with minimal
  expected risk for cardiotoxicity. Confirmation of these dosing regimens with PBPK
  modeling resulted in very similar exposure, with lower interindividual variability
  and minimal toxicity potential. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pharmacokinetic modeling,
  we developed oral and intravenous eliglustat dosing regimens that are likely safe
  and effective for treatment of STEC-HUS and prophylaxis in case of outbreaks of
  STEC infections. Clinical evaluation of these dosing regimens in children suspected
  of or diagnosed with STEC-HUS is required and should include assessment of pharmacokinetics,
  efficacy, and safety (e.g., ECG monitoring).'
