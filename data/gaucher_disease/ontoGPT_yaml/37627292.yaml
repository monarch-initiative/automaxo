input_text: 'Therapeutic Role of Pharmacological Chaperones in Lysosomal Storage Disorders:
  A Review of the Evidence and Informed Approach to Reclassification. The treatment
  landscape for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) is rapidly evolving. An increase
  in the number of preclinical and clinical studies in the last decade has demonstrated
  that pharmacological chaperones are a feasible alternative to enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) for individuals with LSDs. A systematic search was performed to retrieve
  and critically assess the evidence from preclinical and clinical applications of
  pharmacological chaperones in the treatment of LSDs and to elucidate the mechanisms
  by which they could be effective in clinical practice. Publications were screened
  according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses
  (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Fifty-two articles evaluating 12 small molecules
  for the treatment of seven LSDs are included in this review. Overall, a substantial
  amount of preclinical and clinical data support the potential of pharmacological
  chaperones as treatments for Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Pompe disease.
  Most of the available clinical evidence evaluated migalastat for the treatment of
  Fabry disease. There was a lack of consistency in the terminology used to describe
  pharmacological chaperones in the literature. Therefore, the new small molecule
  chaperone (SMC) classification system is proposed to inform a standardized approach
  for new, emerging small molecule therapies in LSDs.'
