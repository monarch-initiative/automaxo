input_text: 'Long-term effectiveness of eliglustat treatment: A real-world analysis
  from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry. Gaucher disease
  type 1 (GD1) is known for phenotypic heterogeneity and varied natural history. Registrational
  clinical trials enrolled narrowly defined phenotypes, but greater diversity is encountered
  in clinical practice. We report real-world outcomes with long-term eliglustat treatment
  in adults with GD1 in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group Gaucher Registry.
  Among 5985 GD1 patients in the Registry as of January 6, 2023, 872 started eliglustat
  at >=18 years old; of these, 469 met inclusion criteria. We compared clinical parameters
  at eliglustat initiation (i.e., baseline) and follow-up in treatment-naive patients
  and used linear mixed models to estimate annual change from baseline in parameters
  among patients who switched to eliglustat after >=1 year on enzyme replacement therapy.
  Over 4 years of follow-up in non-splenectomized treatment-naive patients, hemoglobin
  and platelet count increased, liver and spleen volume decreased, and total lumbar
  spine bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score decreased slightly. Among non-splenectomized
  switch patients, on average, hemoglobin decreased -0.030 (95% CI: -0.053, -0.008)
  g/dL (N = 272) and platelet count increased 2.229 (95% CI: 0.751, 3.706) x 103/mm3
  (N = 262) annually up to 10 years; liver volume decreased (-0.009 [95% CI: -0.015,
  -0.003] MN) (N = 102) and spleen volume remained stable (-0.070 [95% CI: -0.150,
  0.010] MN) (N = 106) annually up to 7 years; and total lumbar spine BMD Z-score
  increased 0.041 (95% CI: 0.015, 0.066) (N = 183) annually up to 8 years. Among splenectomized
  switch patients, clinical parameters were stable over time. These long-term, real-world
  outcomes are consistent with the eliglustat clinical trials and emerging real-world
  experience across the GD phenotypic spectrum.'
