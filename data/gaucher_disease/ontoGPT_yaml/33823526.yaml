input_text: 'Clinicogenetic Profile, Treatment Modalities, and Mortality Predictors
  of Gaucher Disease: A 15-Year Retrospective Study. INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease
  (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, in which biallelic
  pathogenic variants in the Glucosidase beta acid (GBA) gene result in defective
  functioning of glucosylceramidase that causes deposition of glucocerebroside in
  cells. GD has 3 major types namely, non-neuronopathic (type I), acute neuronopathic
  (type II), and chronic neuronopathic (type III). Definite treatment options are
  limited and expensive. They succumb early to the disease, if untreated. There is
  paucity of studies from the Indian subcontinent, which elicit the factors resulting
  in their premature mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried
  out in a tertiary care setting of South India to assess the clinical profile, mutation
  spectrum, and various management strategies (only supportive therapy, enzyme replacement
  therapy [ERT], substrate reduction therapy [SRT] haematopoietic stem cell transplant
  [HSCT]), and mortality predictors of patients with GD from 2004 to 2019. A Kaplan-Meier
  survival curve was plotted. In silico predictions were performed for novel variants.
  RESULTS: There were 60 patients with all types of GD seen over the study period
  of 15 years. Their median age at diagnosis was 2 years. The median follow-up was
  for 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-8). The overall mortality rate was 35%;
  however, it was only 10% in those receiving definite treatment. Mortality was higher
  (47.5%) by more than 4 folds in those only on supportive therapy. The median survival
  from the time of diagnosis was 6.3 years (IQR = 3.5-10.8) in the definite treatment
  group and 3.5 years (IQR = 1-5) in those on supportive therapy. The Kaplan-Meier
  survival analysis showed significant (p value 0.001) mortality difference between
  these groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found the neuronopathic
  type (OR = 5) and only supportive therapy (OR = 6.3) to be the independent risk
  factors for premature mortality. CONCLUSION: GD is a rare disease with a high mortality
  rate, if left untreated. ERT and SRT are the definitive treatments which increase
  the survival. In resource-limited settings like India, with higher prevalence of
  the neuronopathic type, HSCT may be a more suitable definitive treatment option,
  due to its one-time intervention and cost, assuming similar efficacy to ERT. However,
  the efficacy and safety of HSCT in GD needs to be established further by substantial
  patient numbers undergoing it.'
