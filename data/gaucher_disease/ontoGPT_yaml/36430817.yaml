input_text: 'Targeting the Complement-Sphingolipid System in COVID-19 and Gaucher
  Diseases: Evidence for a New Treatment Strategy. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
  Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced disease (COVID-19) and Gaucher disease (GD) exhibit
  upregulation of complement 5a (C5a) and its C5aR1 receptor, and excess synthesis
  of glycosphingolipids that lead to increased infiltration and activation of innate
  and adaptive immune cells, resulting in massive generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  chemokines and growth factors. This C5a-C5aR1-glycosphingolipid pathway- induced
  pro-inflammatory environment causes the tissue damage in COVID-19 and GD. Strikingly,
  pharmaceutically targeting the C5a-C5aR1 axis or the glycosphingolipid synthesis
  pathway led to a reduction in glycosphingolipid synthesis and innate and adaptive
  immune inflammation, and protection from the tissue destruction in both COVID-19
  and GD. These results reveal a common involvement of the complement and glycosphingolipid
  systems driving immune inflammation and tissue damage in COVID-19 and GD, respectively.
  It is therefore expected that combined targeting of the complement and sphingolipid
  pathways could ameliorate the tissue destruction, organ failure, and death in patients
  at high-risk of developing severe cases of COVID-19.'
