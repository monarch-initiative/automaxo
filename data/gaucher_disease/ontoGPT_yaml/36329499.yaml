input_text: 'An observational study to investigate the relationship between plasma
  glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1) concentration and treatment outcomes of patients
  with Gaucher disease in Japan. BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal
  recessive disease caused by GBA1 mutations resulting in glucosylceramide accumulation
  in macrophages. GD is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
  bone complications, and neurological complications. Glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1),
  a deacylated form of glucosylceramide, has been identified as a promising biomarker
  for the diagnosis and treatment response in GD. The aim of this study was to examine
  the relationship between plasma lyso-Gb1 and therapeutic goals for GD (improvements
  in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, and bone crisis),
  as well as disease type and GBA1 mutation type, in Japanese patients with GD receiving
  velaglucerase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Furthermore, this study
  compared the plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration observed in Japanese patients included
  in this study with that observed in a previous non-Japanese clinical study. RESULTS:
  This non-interventional, open-label, multicenter observational cohort study (October
  2020 to March 2021) included a total of 20 patients (of any age) with GD (type 1:
  n = 8; type 2: n = 9; type 3: n = 3) treated with velaglucerase alfa for >= 3 months.
  Median (minimum-maximum) duration of velaglucerase alfa treatment was 49.5 (3-107)
  months. A total of 14 (70.0%) patients achieved all therapeutic goals (i.e., 100%
  achievement; improvements in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
  bone pain, and bone crisis). Overall, median (minimum-maximum) lyso-Gb1 concentration
  was 24.3 (2.1-150) ng/mL. Although not statistically significant, numerically lower
  plasma lyso-Gb1 concentrations were observed in patients with 100% achievement compared
  with those without; no statistically significant difference in plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration
  was observed between patients with different disease type or mutation type. Furthermore,
  lyso-Gb1 concentrations observed in Japanese patients were numerically lower than
  that observed in a previous study of non-Japanese patients with GD receiving ERT.
  CONCLUSIONS: In this study, high achievement rates of therapeutic goals with low
  lyso-Gb1 concentration were observed, demonstrating a correlation between therapeutic
  goals and lower plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration in Japanese patients with GD treated
  with velaglucerase alfa. This study further suggests that plasma lyso-Gb1 concentration
  may be a useful biomarker for treatment response in patients with GD.'
