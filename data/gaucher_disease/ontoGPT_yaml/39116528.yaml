input_text: "Clinical and preclinical insights into high-dose ambroxol therapy for
  Gaucher disease type 2 and 3: A comprehensive systematic review. RATIONALE: Gaucher
  disease (GD), an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, results from GBA1
  variants causing glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency. While enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) helps with systemic symptoms, neurological complications in GD2 and
  GD3 persist due to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) limiting ERT efficacy. Ambroxol,
  a BBB-permeable chaperone, enhances GCase activity. Our review explores high-dose
  ambroxol's therapeutic potential, both preclinical and clinical, in GD2 and GD3.
  METHODS: PubMed was searched for studies published before March 2023, including
  clinical, animal, and in vitro studies focusing on the effect of high-dose ambroxol
  in GD2 and GD3. A narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Nine in vitro, three
  animal, and eight clinical studies were included, demonstrating varied responses
  to ambroxol across diverse outcome measures. In vitro and animal studies demonstrated
  reduced endoplasmatic reticulum stress due to the relocation of GCase from the ER
  to the lysosomes. In vitro cell lines exhibited varying degrees of increased GCase
  activity. Clinical trials observed reduced lyso-GL1 levels in plasma (41-89%) and
  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (26-97%), alongside increased GCase activity in GD3 patients.
  Ambroxol exhibited varying effects on neurological outcomes and development. No
  severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: High-dose ambroxol shows promise
  in managing neurological manifestations in GD3, albeit with uncertainties resulting
  from genetic heterogeneity and variable response. Further clinical trials, are essential
  for elucidating dosage-response relationships and refining treatment outcomes and
  strategies for neuronopathic GD."
