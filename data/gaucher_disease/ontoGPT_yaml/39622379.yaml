input_text: 'Effective encapsulation of therapeutic recombinant enzyme into polymeric
  nanoparticles as a potential vehicle for lysosomal disease treatment. Gaucher Disease
  (GD) is a genetic disorder with defective activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase.
  Velaglucerasa alfa is a recombinant glucocerebrosidase used for enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) of GD. Due to its limited stability and bioavailability, the use of
  nanosized systems carrying Velaglucerase alfa is proposed as a novel strategy to
  improve ERT for GD. Highly stable and low-dispersed Velaglucerase-loaded Eudragit
  nanoparticles (NPs) (NPs: Vela); 150-160 nm mean size, polydispersity index <0.
  15, zeta potential around -32 mV, and 95 % Velaglucerase alfa encapsulation efficiency
  were obtained. Crystallographic structural analysis by Small Angle X-ray Scattering,
  confirmed that Velaglucerase alfa was incorporated into the nanoparticle matrix.
  In vitro studies revealed that NPs: Vela preferentially interact with immunoglobulins
  and fibrinogen, and a positive enzyme release from NPs:Vela was observed at acidic
  pH; while no release was observed in neutral conditions. A positive internalization
  of NPs:Vela in GD mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) was also verified, increasing enzyme
  cellular activity compared to non-treated cells. Confocal microscopy verified that
  NPs:Vela colocalized with lysosomes, but no effect of NPs: Vela in the mineralization
  of MSC was observed. Finally, the viability of GD cell lines is not affected by
  NPs: Vela, in comparison with Velaglucerase alone, that negatively affects the viability
  of the target cells. This nanocarrier system for Velaglucerase alfa delivery in
  lysosomes, initially proposed to improve ERT for GD, may also serve as a starting
  point to address pathophysiological mechanisms in GD and other lysosomal disorders.'
