input_text: 'Therapeutic delivery of recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme-containing
  extracellular vesicles to human cells from Gaucher disease patients. BACKGROUND:
  Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases
  (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variants of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1),
  resulting in the impairment of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme function and the
  accumulation of a glycolipid substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within lysosomes.
  Current therapeutic approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate
  reduction therapy cannot fully rescue GD pathologies, especially neurological symptoms.
  Meanwhile, delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of affected
  human cells is a promising strategy for treating neuropathic LSDs. RESULT: Here,
  we describe a novel approach to restore GCase enzyme in cells from neuropathic GD
  patients by producing extracellular vesicle (EVs)-containing GCase from cells overexpressing
  GBA1 gene. Lentiviral vectors containing modified GBA1 were introduced into HEK293T
  cells to produce a stable cell line that provides a sustainable source of functional
  GCase enzyme. The GBA1-overexpressing cells released EV-containing GCase enzyme,
  that is capable of entering into and localizing in the endocytic compartment of
  recipient cells, including THP-1 macrophage, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, and macrophages
  and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of neuropathic GD
  patients. Importantly, the recipient cells exhibit higher GCase enzyme activity.
  CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising therapeutic strategy to treat severe
  types of LSDs. It involves delivering lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment
  of human cells affected by conditions such as GDs with neurological symptoms, as
  well as potentially other neurological disorders impacting lysosomes.'
