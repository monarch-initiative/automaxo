input_text: Enzyme replacement therapy improves erythropoiesis and iron dysregulation
  in Gaucher disease. Anemia and hyperferritinemia are frequent findings at diagnosis
  of Gaucher disease (GD). Macrophage-independent dyserythropoiesis and abnormal iron
  metabolism have been shown. We evaluated hematological and iron status at diagnosis
  (T0) and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on erythropoiesis and iron
  utilization over 5-year follow-up in type 1 GD patients and in an ex vivo model
  of erythropoiesis from CD34 + peripheral blood cells. At T0, 41% of patients had
  anemia and 51% hyperferritinemia. Hemoglobin increased from 12.6 (T0) to 13.9 g/dL
  (T6), GFD15, a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased from 5401 to 710
  pg/ml, and serum ferritin decreased from 614 to 140 mcg/L (p < 0.001). In parallel,
  transferrin saturation (TSAT) increased. Hepcidin, although in the normal range,
  decreased from T0 to T6. Ex vivo studies showed that ERT restores the erythroid
  cells derived from CD34 + impaired ability to differentiate. During ERT, an increase
  in TFRC expression, consistent with the ability of erythroid precursors to uptake
  iron, and a reduction in HAMP and concomitant increase in SLC40A1 were observed.
  This is the largest study with a longitudinal follow-up evaluating erythropoiesis
  and iron metabolism, combining clinical and ex vivo data in GD. Iron dysregulation
  likely contributes to anemia, and ERT, by improving iron distribution, improves
  erythropoiesis.
