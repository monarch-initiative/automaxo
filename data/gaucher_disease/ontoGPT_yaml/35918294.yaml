input_text: Targeted Enzymatic VLP-Nanoreactors with beta-Glucocerebrosidase Activity
  as Potential Enzyme Replacement Therapy for Gaucher's Disease. Gaucher disease is
  a genetic disorder and the most common lysosomal disease caused by the deficiency
  of enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
  is successfully applied using mannose-exposed conjugated glucocerebrosidase, the
  lower stability of the enzyme in blood demands periodic intravenous administration
  that adds to the high cost of treatment. In this work, the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase
  was encapsulated inside virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) from brome mosaic virus
  (BMV), and their surface was functionalized with mannose groups for targeting to
  macrophages. The VLP nanoreactors showed significant GCase catalytic activity. Moreover,
  the Michaelis-Menten constants for the free GCase enzyme (KM =0.29 mM) and the functionalized
  nanoreactors (KM =0.32 mM) were similar even after chemical modification. Importantly,
  the stability of enzymes under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37  C) was enhanced
  by  11-fold after encapsulation; this is beneficial for obtaining a higher blood
  circulation half-life, which may decrease the cost of therapy by reducing the requirement
  of multiple intravenous injections. Finally, the mannose receptor targeted enzymatic
  nanoreactors showed enhanced internalization into macrophage cells. Thus, the catalytic
  activity and cell targeting suggest the potential of these nanoreactors in ERT of
  Gaucher's disease.
