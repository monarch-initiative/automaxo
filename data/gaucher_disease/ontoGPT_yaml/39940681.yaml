input_text: "Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) to Reduce the Risk for GBA-Related
  Parkinson's Disease: Expanding the Applications for Embryo Selection. Preimplantation
  genetic testing (PGT) is practiced worldwide, allowing the prevention of the transmission
  and expression of various genetic conditions. Socio-ethical considerations of justified
  applications for PGT are part of an ongoing debate. Pathogenic variants in the glucocerebrosidase
  (GBA1) gene, causing Gaucher disease (GD), have emerged as a risk factor for Parkinson's
  disease (PD) in both patients and carriers. Genotype-phenotype correlations exist
  between different GBA1 pathogenic variants and the risk to develop PD: mild pathogenic
  variants increase the risk of developing PD by ~3-fold, while severe pathogenic
  variants increase this risk by ~15-fold, occurring at a younger age. A woman with
  GD, a compound heterozygote of N370S (now commonly described as c.1226A>G (N409S)-mild
  pathogenic variant) and 84insG (severe pathogenic variant), had PGT consulting before
  planned in vitro-fertilization. Her mother, an 84insG carrier, had early-onset PD.
  GBA1 sequencing of her spouse was negative. We discussed the selection for N370S
  carrier embryos to reduce PD risk. This case report demonstrates the expansion of
  PGT for late-onset conditions. These novel indications will increase the number
  of subjects who would be candidates for PGT. The medical and bioethical considerations
  of these cases should be acknowledged by the professional community and discussed
  with couples during genetic counseling."
