input_text: "Qualitative Study of the Patient Experience with Venglustat for Gaucher
  Disease Type 3 in a Phase 2 Open-Label, Multicenter, Multinational Study (LEAP).
  INTRODUCTION: Gaucher disease type 3 (GD3) is a genetic, progressive lysosomal storage
  disorder characterized by visceral manifestations and chronic neurologic symptoms
  (e.g., horizontal ophthalmoplegia/supranuclear gaze palsy, ataxia, dystonia). The
  investigational agent venglustat is being studied in combination with imiglucerase
  as potential treatment for systemic and neuronopathic manifestations of GD3 in a
  single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial (LEAP; N = 11). To understand perceived changes
  in GD3 symptoms from the perspectives of patients, caregivers, and clinicians, we
  conducted a qualitative case study of selected LEAP participants. METHODS: Four
  patients in LEAP (age range, 20-28 years), four of their caregivers, and three clinicians
  involved in LEAP were interviewed individually by moderators using semi-structured
  guides. Clinicians' perceptions were based on observation of interviewed patients
  and those in LEAP who were not interviewed, as well as information provided by other
  staff involved in LEAP, patients, and caregivers. RESULTS: Reported changes in GD3
  symptoms varied among patients and among reporters. Only eye movement was spontaneously
  mentioned as improved by at least one patient, caregiver, and clinical expert. Symptom
  improvement also varied in terms of time to improvement. Within the first weeks,
  improvements were seen in understanding new information or complex instructions,
  remembering the weekday, eye movement, tremor, and seizures. Changes in alertness,
  engagement and responsiveness, memory, and concentration appeared after months or
  a year. Most caregivers and all clinical experts reported greater patient independence
  (e.g., increased ability to perform activities of daily living or travel independently
  during the trial) as a perceived treatment effect on a GD3 impact. For one patient
  who perceived benefits from venglustat therapy, pharmacokinetic analyses during
  LEAP found low to undetectable venglustat levels in their plasma and cerebrospinal
  fluid. CONCLUSION: Outcomes from this study provide insights into GD3 symptoms and
  the early signaling of changes reported during venglustat therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02843035."
