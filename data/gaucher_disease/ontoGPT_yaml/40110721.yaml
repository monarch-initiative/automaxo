input_text: 'Never-Treated, Non Splenectomised Patients With Gaucher Disease (The
  French GANT Study): The Prospective Follow-Up. Treatment options for Type 1 Gaucher
  Disease (GD1) include enzyme replacement therapy and oral substrate reduction therapy.
  The criteria for treatment initiation vary across regions. Recent retrospective
  studies have highlighted the natural progression of never-treated GD1, suggesting
  that some patients remain asymptomatic or stable for extended periods. However,
  there is no data on long-term prospective follow-up. We conducted a prospective
  study following a cross-sectional analysis of 36 never-treated, non-splenectomised
  GD1 patients from the French Gaucher Disease Registry (FGDR). The objective was
  to describe the natural disease progression, tracking clinical, radiological, and
  biological characteristics over time. Thirty-six non-splenectomised and never-treated
  patients (19 women and 17 men) diagnosed with Gaucher Disease were prospectively
  followed for an additional median duration of 6.5 (5-8.3) years. Of the cohort,
  17 remained untreated, 10 initiated treatment, and 7 were lost to follow-up. Although
  never-treated patients tended to be older at the time of first symptoms, diagnosis,
  and last follow-up compared to those who received treatment, the difference was
  not significant in this small cohort. At last follow-up, never-treated patients
  had no worsening of most of their symptoms. No significant changes were observed
  in platelets, chitotriosidase, and lyso-Gb1. In this prospective cohort, we highlight
  that patients with mild GD can remain untreated with no disease progression, offering
  insights into cost-effective management strategies. Identifying such patients is
  still challenging.'
