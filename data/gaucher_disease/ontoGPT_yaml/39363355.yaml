input_text: "Different diseases, different needs: Patient preferences for gene therapy
  in lysosomal storage disorders, a probabilistic threshold technique survey. BACKGROUND:
  Gene therapy is currently in development for several monogenetic diseases including
  lysosomal storage disorders. Limited evidence is available on patient preferences
  for gene therapy in this population. In this study, we compare gene therapy-related
  risk tolerance between people affected by three lysosomal storage diseases currently
  faced with different therapeutic options and prognoses. METHODS: A survey including
  the probabilistic threshold technique was developed in which respondents were asked
  to choose between gene therapy and the current standard of care. The attributes
  included to establish participants' risk tolerance were previously identified in
  focus groups of affected people or their representatives, namely: risk of mild side
  effects, severe side effects, the need for additional medication, and the likelihood
  of long-term effectiveness. The survey was distributed among people receiving outpatient
  care for type 1 Gaucher disease (good prognosis with current treatment options),
  Fabry disease (varying prognosis with current treatment options, XY-genotype on
  average more severely affected than XX), and parents representing people with severe
  forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B (poor prognosis, no disease-specific
  therapy available). RESULTS: A total of 85 surveys were completed (15 Gaucher disease
  respondents, 62 Fabry disease respondents (17 self-identifying male), eight parents
  of ten people with mucopolysaccharidosis type III). Disease groups with higher disease
  severity trended towards higher risk tolerance: Gaucher disease respondents were
  most cautious and predominantly preferred the current standard of care as opposed
  to MPS III representatives who were more risk tolerant. Respondents with Fabry disease
  were most heterogeneous in their risk tolerance, with male participants being more
  risk tolerant than female participants. Long-term effectiveness was the attribute
  in which respondents tolerated the least risk. CONCLUSIONS: People affected by a
  lysosomal storage disease associated with a poorer prognosis and less effective
  current treatment options trended towards more risk tolerance when choosing between
  gene therapy and the current standard of care. This study shows the importance of
  involvement of patient preferences before and during the development process of
  new treatment modalities such as gene therapy for rare diseases, to ensure that
  innovative therapies align with the wishes and needs of people affected by these
  diseases."
