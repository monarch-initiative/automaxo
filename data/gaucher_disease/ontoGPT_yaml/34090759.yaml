input_text: 'Prevalence of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal
  disorders: A nationwide survey in Japan. INTRODUCTION: Lysosomal storage disorders
  and peroxisomal disorders are rare diseases caused by the accumulation of substrates
  of the metabolic pathway within lysosomes and peroxisomes, respectively. Owing to
  the rarity of these diseases, the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders and
  peroxisomal disorders in Japan is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide
  survey to estimate the number of patients with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal
  disorders in Japan. METHODS: A nationwide survey was conducted following the "Manual
  of nationwide epidemiological survey for understanding patient number and clinical
  epidemiology of rare diseases (3rd version)". A questionnaire asking for detailed
  information, such as disease phenotypes and medical history, was created and sent
  to 504 institutions with doctors who have experience in treating patients with lysosomal
  storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders. Result A total of 303 completed questionnaires
  were collected from 504 institutions (response rate: 60.1%). The number of patients
  was estimated by calculating the rate/frequency of overlap. The estimated number
  of patients was 1658 (+-264.8) for Fabry disease, 72 (+-11.3) for mucopolysaccharidosis
  I, 275 (+-49.9) for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 211 (+-31.3) for Gaucher disease,
  124 (+-25.8) for Pompe disease, 83 (+-44.3) for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 57
  (+-9.4) for Niemann-Pick type C, and 262 (+-42.3) for adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition
  the birth prevalence was calculated using the estimated number of patients and birth
  year data for each disease, and was 1.25 for Fabry disease, 0.09 for mucopolysaccharidosis
  I, 0.38 for mucopolysaccharidosis II, 0.19 for Gaucher disease, 0.14 for Pompe disease,
  0.16 for metachromatic leukodystrophy, 0.16 for Niemann-Pick type C, and 0.20 for
  adrenoleukodystrophy. DISCUSSION: Among the diseases analyzed, the disease with
  the highest prevalence was Fabry disease, followed by mucopolysaccharidosis II,
  adrenoleukodystrophy, Gaucher disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. In particular,
  the high prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis II and Gaucher disease type II was
  a feature characteristic of Japan. CONCLUSION: We estimated the number of patients
  with lysosomal storage disorders and peroxisomal disorders in Japan. The details
  of the age at diagnosis and treatment methods for each disease were clarified, and
  will be useful for the early diagnosis of these patients and to provide appropriate
  treatments. Furthermore, our results suggest that supportive care and the development
  of an environment that can provide optimal medical care is important in the future.'
