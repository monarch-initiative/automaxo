input_text: a-Synuclein and lipids in erythrocytes of Gaucher disease carriers and
  patients before and after enzyme replacement therapy. It is well established that
  patients with Gaucher disease, as well as carriers of the disease have an increased
  risk for developing Parkinson's disease. A plethora of evidence suggests that disturbed
  alpha-Synuclein homeostasis is the link between Gaucher disease and Parkinson's
  disease. The pathogenic mechanism linking these entities is still a topic of debate
  and both gain- and loss-of-function theories have been put forward, which however
  are not mutually exclusive. In the present study we expanded our previous studies
  to include not only Gaucher disease patients but also Gaucher disease carriers and
  Gaucher disease patients following Enzyme Replacement Therapy. In these groups we
  investigated alpha-Synuclein in red blood cell membranes in association with lipid
  abnormalities described in Gaucher disease. These included glucosylceramide and
  its species, glucosylsphingosine, glucosylcholesterol and plasmalogens. Increased
  oligomerization of alpha-Synuclein in red blood cell membranes was observed not
  only in Gaucher disease patients but also in carriers of the disease. There were
  no qualitative differences in the lipids identified in the groups studied. However,
  significant quantitative differences compared to controls were observed in Gaucher
  disease patients but not in Gaucher disease carriers. Enzyme Replacement Therapy
  reversed the biochemical defects and normalized alpha-Synuclein homeostasis, providing
  for the first time evidence in human subjects that such homeostatic dysregulation
  is reversible. Further studies investigating alpha-Synuclein status during the differentiation
  of erythroid progenitors could provide new data on the pathogenic mechanism of alpha-Synuclein
  oligomerization in this system.
