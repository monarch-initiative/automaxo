input_text: 'Predicting liver fibrosis in Gaucher disease: Investigation of contributors
  and development of a clinically applicable Gaucher liver fibrosis score. Gaucher
  disease (GD) is a rare genetic disorder with multi-system involvement. Liver fibrosis
  is a long-term complication of GD, potentially leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver
  disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently no validated clinical
  tools for the monitoring of liver fibrosis in patients with GD. In this study, we
  aim at assessing the validity of common fibrosis-predicting scores, developed for
  other diseases, for the use in GD, using transient elastography as a gold-standard,
  as well as developing the first GD-specific liver fibrosis predicting score. We
  enrolled 19 adult patients with GD who had been on treatment for a minimum of 1
  year on enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy and who had no
  evidence of any other liver disease except GD or metabolic-associated steatotic
  liver disease (MASLD), which is a common comorbidity of GD. We analyzed the correlation
  between liver stiffness and genotype, treatment modality (imiglucerase or other
  therapies), clinical severity, and clinical laboratory tests. We found that the
  common liver fibrosis scores APRI, FIB-4, and NFS did not accurately predict liver
  fibrosis in people with GD. We also found that male sex, the DS3 score, AST, and
  GGT levels significantly correlated with liver stiffness, and used these to create
  a simple but accurate fibrosis-predicting score specifically for GD (the "Gaucher
  liver fibrosis score", or GLFS), with high accuracy (AUC = 0.8571, p = 0.0206).
  We believe that our new GLFS may be used in clinical practice to help prioritize
  GD patients for closer monitoring of liver fibrosis.'
