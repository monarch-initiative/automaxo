input_text: 'Restrictive cardiomyopathy: A rare presentation of gaucher disease. Restrictive
  cardiomyopathy is an unusual form of cardiomyopathy accounting only for 2%-5% of
  all pediatric cardiomyopathies. It is mostly idiopathic. Gaucher disease in association
  with restrictive cardiomyopathy is extremely rare. We herein report a case of cardiac
  failure in an 8-year-old male child caused by restrictive cardiomyopathy. Pathogenesis
  of which was attributed to Gaucher disease. In any case of restrictive cardiomyopathy,
  Gaucher disease should be included in differential diagnosis and investigated accordingly.'
