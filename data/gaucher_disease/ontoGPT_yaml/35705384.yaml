input_text: 'Real-world patient data on immunity and COVID-19 status of patients with
  MPS, Gaucher, and Pompe diseases from Turkey. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and lysosomal
  storage disorders (LSDs) share a common immunological pathway as they cause the
  release of cytokines in a similar pattern. We aimed to evaluate the immunity status
  and reveal the course of COVID-19 in patients with LSDs. RESULTS: The median age
  of 110 patients with LSDs was 129 months (range: 21-655), and all but one patient
  with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III were regularly receiving enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT). In 53.6% (n = 56) of the patients (23 patients with Gaucher disease
  [10 type III, 13 type I], 26 patients with MPS [8 type VI, 11 type IVA, 1 type III,
  3 type II, and 3 type I], and 7 patients with Pompe disease), an abnormality in
  at least one of the autoimmunity or immunodeficiency parameters was reported. Furthermore,
  12 (57%) of 21 Gaucher cases (7 type III, 5 type I), 18 (40.9%) of 44 MPS cases
  (9 type IVA, 5 type VI, 1 type I, 2 type II, and 1 type III), and six (66%) of nine
  Pompe cases were reported to involve abnormalities in at least one of the parameters
  related to immunodeficiency. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgA levels were reported
  to be lower, and there were abnormalities in the lymphocyte counts and subgroups
  in the MPS group. ANA was reported to be positive in one patient with Gaucher type
  III, anti-DNA in two patients with Gaucher type I and one patient with MPS type
  VI, antithyroglobulin in two patients with Gaucher type I, anti-TPO in one patient
  with Gaucher type I, TRAB in one patient with Gaucher type I, antiphospholipid IgM
  in three patients with Gaucher type III and one patient with Gaucher type I, anticardiolipin
  IgM in one patient with Gaucher type I, one patient with Gaucher type III, and one
  patient with MPS type II. However, no clinical presentation was consistent with
  the laboratory results except for one patient with Gaucher type I disease with Hashimoto
  thyroiditis. Two of the four patients who survived the COVID-19 infection with mild
  symptoms had a diagnosis of Gaucher type I, and no abnormality was detected in their
  laboratory tests. The other two patients had a diagnosis of MPS types VI and II.
  Immune dysfunction was detected in the patient with a diagnosis of MPS type II.
  Four of our patients were discharged without any sequelae. CONCLUSION: Problems
  with immunity did not cause any noticeable clinical results. Being well protected
  by reducing social contact might have played a role. However, we believe that it
  should be borne in mind that cardiac and pulmonary involvement, as well as immune
  dysfunction in LSDs, may cause an increased need for intensive care because of secondary
  bacterial infections.'
