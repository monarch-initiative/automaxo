input_text: 'Evaluation of endocrinological involvement and metabolic status in patients
  with Gaucher disease Type 1 and Fabry disease under enzyme replacement therapy.
  OBJECTIVES: Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) and Fabry disease (FD) are the two most
  common lysosomal storage diseases. For over three decades, effective enzyme replacement
  therapies (ERTs) have changed the fate of patients and offered a longer chance of
  survival and improve their quality of life. METHODS: The clinical and molecular
  findings, endocrinological features and metabolic status of 26 patients (16 with
  FD, and 10 with GD1) were evaluated. The results were compared to age- and gender-matched
  healthy individuals. RESULTS: Patients with GD1 and FD were followed for 7.2 +-
  4.7 and 6.4 +- 4.3 years, respectively. Calcium and magnesium levels in patients
  with GD1 were lower than in controls (p=0.01; p=0.002). Osteoporosis was detected
  in 20% (n=2) of GD1 patients and 12.5% (n=2) of FD patients. The HbA1c value of
  GD1 patients was significantly lower than both in control and Fabry patients (p=0.004;
  and p=0.007, respectively). There was a negative correlation between LysoGb3 and
  female gender (p=0.04; r=-0.49), but no correlation was found with any other biochemical
  parameters. There was a negative correlation between the LysoGb1 level and the neutrophil
  (p=0.03; r=-0.711) and thrombocyte levels (p=0.02; r=-0.767), and a positive correlation
  with ferritin levels (p<0.001; r=0.867). CONCLUSION: Long time effective ERT seems
  to have beneficial effects on metabolic and hormonal status as well as primary target
  organs in both FD and GD1 patients.'
