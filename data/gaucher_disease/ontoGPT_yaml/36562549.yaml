input_text: 'Comprehensive and long-term outcomes of enzyme replacement therapy followed
  by stem cell transplantation in children with Gaucher disease type 1 and 3. BACKGROUND:
  Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly,
  pancytopenia, bone diseases, with or without neurological symptoms. Plasma glucosylsphingosine
  (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for GD, has been used for
  diagnosis and monitoring the response to treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
  is an effective treatment for the non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD
  (type 2 and 3) accounts for 60%-70% of the Asian affected population. METHODS: We
  explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 3 (GD3). RESULTS: Four
  patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The types of donor
  were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three haploidentical. The age
  at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 3.8-15 years in the patients
  with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration
  of 3-14 years. All patients had successful HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease
  occurred in one patient. The enzyme activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT.
  Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became lower than the pathological value. All of the patients
  are still alive and physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school.
  None of the patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after
  HSCT, but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: ERT followed
  by HSCT could be considered as an alternative treatment for patients with GD3 who
  have a high risk of fatal neurological progression.'
