input_text: 'Thirty-year clinical outcomes after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  in neuronopathic Gaucher disease. BACKGROUND: Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease (nGD)
  describes the condition of a subgroup of patients with the Lysosomal Storage Disorder
  (LSD), Gaucher disease with involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) which
  results from inherited deficiency of beta-glucosylceramidase. Although systemic
  manifestations of disease are now corrected by augmentation with macrophage-targeted
  therapeutic enzyme (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT), neurological disease progresses
  unpredictably as a result of failure of therapeutic enzyme to cross the blood-brain
  barrier (BBB). Without therapy, the systemic and neurological effects of the disease
  progress and shorten life: investigators, principally in Sweden and the UK, pioneered
  bone marrow transplantation (BMT; Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation HSCT)
  to supply healthy marrow-derived macrophages and other cells, to correct the peripheral
  disease. Here we report the first long-term follow-up (over 20 years in all cases)
  of nine patients in the UK and Sweden who underwent HSCT in the 1970s and 1980s.
  This retrospective, multicentre observational study was undertaken to determine
  whether there are neurological features of Gaucher disease that can be corrected
  by HSCT and the extent to which deterioration continues after the procedure. Since
  intravenous administration of ERT is approved for patients with the neuronopathic
  disease and ameliorates many of the important systemic manifestations but fails
  to correct the neurological features, we also consider the current therapeutic positioning
  of HSCT in this disorder. RESULTS: In the nine patients here reported, neurological
  disease continued to progress after transplantation, manifesting as seizures, cerebellar
  disease and abnormalities of tone and reflexes. CONCLUSIONS: Although neurological
  disease progressed in this cohort of patients, there may be a future role for HSCT
  in the treatment of nGD. The procedure has the unique advantage of providing a life-long
  source of normally functioning macrophages in the bone marrow, and possibly other
  sites, after a single administration. HSCT moreover, clearly ameliorates systemic
  disease and this may be advantageous-especially where sustained provision of high-cost
  ERT cannot be guaranteed. Given the remaining unmet needs of patients with neuronopathic
  Gaucher disease and the greatly improved safety profile of the transplant procedure,
  HSCT could be considered to provide permanent correction of systemic disease, including
  bone disease not ameliorated by ERT, when combined with emerging therapies directed
  at the neurological manifestations of disease; this could include ex-vivo gene therapy
  approaches.'
