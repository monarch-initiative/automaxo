input_text: Update of treatment for Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease (GD), the most
  common lysosomal disorders, is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease that
  is caused by deficiency of glucosylceramidase. For now, there are five approved
  therapies for GD, which are used to treat thousands of patients with GD. Despite
  success of approved therapies, many unresolved issues attract academic institutions
  and industry to develop potential therapies to resolve them. This paper updated
  the latest information about approved therapies and potential curative therapies.
