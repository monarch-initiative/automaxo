input_text: 'Understanding patient and parent/caregiver perceptions on gene therapy
  in Gaucher disease: an international survey. BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease is a rare,
  autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by a lack of sufficient activity
  of the lysosomal enzyme known as glucocerebrosidase, which leads to an accumulation
  of glucocerebroside, a fatty substance, in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and rarely,
  the lungs or central nervous system. While there are several treatments available
  for people with Type 1 Gaucher disease and the visceral aspects of Type 3 Gaucher
  disease, no cure is present for any type of Gaucher disease. Clinical trials are
  currently underway to investigate the safety and efficacy of gene therapy in Gaucher
  disease, which has the potential to become a new type of (curative) treatment in
  the future. Gene therapy is a relatively new therapeutic approach, and with the
  desire to keep the community informed about new treatment developments, the International
  Gaucher Alliance (IGA) set-up a Gaucher disease specific survey to gauge current
  perceptions. The survey aimed to benchmark understanding of, and the educational
  needs surrounding, gene therapy among the Gaucher disease community. BODY: An international,
  online survey was developed, comprising twelve questions ranging from multiple choice,
  Likert scale, single tick-box, ranking and open questions. The survey was developed
  following three patient and caregiver focus groups and underwent review from members
  of the IGA for readability and accuracy before going live to respondents. The survey
  was available for two months and shared to audiences via specific Gaucher community
  channels. CONCLUSION: Over 100 patients and parents/caregivers from the Gaucher
  disease community completed the survey, including people living with Type 1 Gaucher
  disease (52.88%), people living with Type 3 Gaucher disease (3.85%), parents/caregivers
  of people living with Type 1, 2 or 3 Gaucher disease (39.42%), and other (3.85%)
  who were defined as parents of multiple people with Gaucher disease. The survey
  uncovered various commonalities in perception of gene therapy among all groups,
  with large knowledge gaps identified on the mode of action, the usefulness of gene
  therapy and overall understanding of the therapeutic area. This survey provides
  an overview of the type of information that could be valuable to the Gaucher disease
  community when developing educational materials.'
