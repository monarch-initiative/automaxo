input_text: "Development of a rare disease algorithm to identify persons at risk of
  Gaucher disease using electronic health records in the United States. BACKGROUND:
  Early diagnosis of Gaucher disease (GD) allows for disease-specific treatment before
  significant symptoms arise, preventing/delaying onset of complications. Yet, many
  endure years-long diagnostic odysseys. We report the development of a machine learning
  algorithm to identify patients with GD from electronic health records. METHODS:
  We utilized Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical dataset (2007-2019)
  for feature engineering and algorithm training/testing, based on clinical characteristics
  of GD. Two algorithms were selected: one based on age of feature occurrence (age-based),
  and one based on occurrence of features (prevalence-based). Performance was compared
  with an adaptation of the available clinical diagnostic algorithm for identifying
  patients with diagnosed GD. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms
  were compared with diagnosed GD patients. RESULTS: Splenomegaly was the most important
  predictor for diagnosed GD with both algorithms, followed by geographical location
  (northeast USA), thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, bone density disorders, and bone
  pain. Overall, 1204 and 2862 patients, respectively, would need to be assessed with
  the age- and prevalence-based algorithms, compared with 20,743 with the clinical
  diagnostic algorithm, to identify 28 patients with diagnosed GD in the integrated
  dataset. Undiagnosed patients highly-ranked by the algorithms had similar clinical
  manifestations as diagnosed GD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The age-based algorithm identified
  younger patients, while the prevalence-based identified patients with advanced clinical
  manifestations. Their combined use better captures GD heterogeneity. The two algorithms
  were about 10-20-fold more efficient at identifying GD patients than the clinical
  diagnostic algorithm. Application of these algorithms could shorten diagnostic delay
  by identifying undiagnosed GD patients."
