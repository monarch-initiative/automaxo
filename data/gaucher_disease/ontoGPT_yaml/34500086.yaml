input_text: 'Clinical-genetic characteristics and treatment outcomes of Turkish children
  with Gaucher disease type 1 and type 3: A sixteen year single-center experience.
  Data from 38 children were retrospectively analyzed to determine the patient characteristics
  of Turkish children with Gaucher disease (GD) and evaluate the impact of enzyme
  replacement therapy (ERT) in a pediatric cohort consisting of two different sub-types
  of the disease, Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) and type 3 (GD3). Both types were represented
  equally (GD1/GD3 = 20/18). L444P (35.5%) was the most common mutant allele while
  L444P/L444P (34.2%) was the most common genotype overall. Compound heterozygosity
  of N370S and L444P homozygosity were the dominant genotypes in Turkish children
  with GD1 and GD3, respectively. None of the patients had moderate to severe thrombocytopenia
  at last follow-up while the percent of patients with anemia decreased from 60% to
  5.7% (p < 0.001). Significant improvements in mean liver (from 2.2 to 1.6 MN, p
  < 0.001) and spleen (from 15.5 to 7.6 MN, p < 0.001) volumes were observed in the
  first year of ERT. Linear growth was ameliorated as shown by the decrease in the
  percent of patients having short stature from 34.3% to 13.3% (p < 0.01) at year
  5. Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteopenia and scoliosis were common skeletal findings.
  Although none of the patients had lung disease at diagnosis, 20% developed radiological
  findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement. This single center experience is the
  first comprehensive study from Turkey not only reporting clinical and genetic characteristics
  of GD patients but also providing information on the outcomes of ERT in two different
  sub-types of GD. Genotypic background of Turkish children with GD is similar to
  western populations. Although visceral and hematological therapeutic goals are reached
  as early as one year of ERT in both sub-types, achieving normal growth takes several
  more years than suggested in significant number of children with GD.'
