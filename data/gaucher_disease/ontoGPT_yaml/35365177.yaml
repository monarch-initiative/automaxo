  disease: an interim analysis of real-world data from a multinational drug registry
  (TALIAS). BACKGROUND: Limited real-world data from routine clinical care are available
  on the safety and effectiveness of treatment with taliglucerase alfa in patients
  with Gaucher disease (GD). METHODS: Taliglucerase Alfa Surveillance (TALIAS), a
  multinational prospective Drug Registry of patients with GD, was established to
  evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective)
  of taliglucerase alfa. We present an interim analysis of the data from the Drug
  Registry collected over the 5-year period from September 2013 to January 2019. RESULTS:
  A total of 106 patients with GD (15.1% children aged < 18 years; 53.8% females)
  treated with taliglucerase alfa have been enrolled in the Drug Registry, as of January
  7, 2019. The median duration of follow-up was 795 days with quartiles (Q1, Q3) of
  567 and 994 days. Fifty-three patients (50.0%) were from Israel, 28 (26.4%) were
  from the United States, and 25 (23.6%) were from Albania. At the time of enrollment,
  most patients (87.7%) had received prior enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Thirty-nine
  of the 106 patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Twelve of the 106
  patients experienced serious AEs; two patients experienced four treatment-related
  serious AEs. Four patients died, although none of the deaths was considered to be
  related to taliglucerase alfa treatment by the treating physicians. Nine patients
  discontinued from the study, including the four who died. At baseline, patients
  with prior ERT had a higher mean hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts than
  treatment-naive patients, likely reflecting the therapeutic effects of prior treatments.
  During follow-up, the hemoglobin concentration and platelet counts increased in
  the treatment-naive patients and remained relatively constant or increased slightly
  in patients with prior ERT. Spleen and liver volumes decreased in treatment-naive
  patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interim data showed no new or emergent safety signals.
  The overall interim data are consistent with the clinical program experience and
  known safety and effectiveness profile of taliglucerase alfa.'
