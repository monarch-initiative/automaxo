input_text: 'The budget impact of enzyme replacement therapy in type 1 Gaucher disease
  in the United States. AIM: Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare autosomal recessive condition.
  Type 1 GD (GD1) is the most prevalent form of GD in Western countries; enzyme replacement
  therapy (ERT) is a treatment option for patients with GD1. To understand the economic
  value of the GD1 ERT velaglucerase alfa, a budget impact model (BIM) was developed
  from a United States (US) payer perspective. METHODS: We estimated the budget impact
  of velaglucerase alfa for a 10-million-member US health plan by comparing the annual
  total costs of therapy between a scenario using current velaglucerase alfa uptake
  to a projected scenario with increased velaglucerase alfa uptake. Total drug costs
  for both scenarios were estimated as the sum of the product of the number of eligible
  patients on each treatment and the annual per-patient cost of each medication. Average
  per-patient costs for ERTs were calculated by adding the yearly drug acquisition,
  drug administration, and site-of-care markup costs. The budget impact was measured
  over years 1-3. RESULTS: An estimated 65 patients would receive velaglucerase alfa
  treatment in year 1, increasing to 90 patients by year 3. Across analyses, cost
  savings were realized with velaglucerase alfa compared with imiglucerase ($115,909)
  and taliglucerase alfa ($80,401). An annual total budget savings of $8.67 million
  could be realized for a hypothetical 10-million-member US health plan with increased
  velaglucerase alfa uptake. The per-member per-month costs decreased by $0.0241 across
  years 1-3. CONCLUSIONS: BIM results show that increased velaglucerase alfa uptake
  for GD1 treatment is cost-saving for US health plans.'
