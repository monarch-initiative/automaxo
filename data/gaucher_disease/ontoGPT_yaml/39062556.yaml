input_text: "Long- and Short-Term Glucosphingosine (lyso-Gb1) Dynamics in Gaucher
  Patients Undergoing Enzyme Replacement Therapy. Background: Gaucher disease (GD)
  is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, leading to
  beta-glucocerebrosidase deficiency and glucosylceramide accumulation. Methods: We
  analyzed short- and long-term dynamics of lyso-glucosylceramide (lyso-Gb1) in a
  large cohort of GD patients undergoing enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Results:
  Eight-years analysis of lyso-Gb1 revealed statistically insignificant variability
  in the biomarker across the years and relatively high individual variability in
  patients' results. GD type 1 (GD1) patients exhibited higher variability compared
  to GD type 3 (GD3) patients (coefficients of variation: 34% and 23%, respectively;
  p-value = 0.0003). We also investigated the short-term response of the biomarker
  to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), measuring lyso-Gb1 right before and 30 min
  after treatment administration. We tested 20 GD patients (16 GD1, 4 GD3) and observed
  a rapid and significant reduction in lyso-Gb1 levels (average decrease of 17%; p-value
  < 0.0001). This immediate response reaffirms the efficacy of ERT in reducing substrate
  accumulation in GD patients but, on the other hand, suggests the biomarker's instability
  between the infusions. Conclusions: These findings underscore lyso-Gb1's potential
  as a reliable biomarker for monitoring efficacy of treatment. However, individual
  variability and dry blood spot (DBS) testing limitations urge a further refinement
  in clinical application. Our study contributes valuable insights into GD patient
  management, emphasizing the evolving role of biomarkers in personalized medicine."
