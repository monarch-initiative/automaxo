input_text: 'Long-Term Evaluation of Biomarkers in the Czech Cohort of Gaucher Patients.
  A personalized treatment decision for Gaucher disease (GD) patients should be based
  on relevant markers that are specific to GD, play a direct role in GD pathophysiology,
  exhibit low genetic variation, reflect the therapy, and can be used for all patients.
  Thirty-four GD patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate
  reduction therapy (SRT) were analyzed for platelet count, chitotriosidase, and tartrate-resistant
  acid phosphatase activity in plasma samples, and quantitative measurement of Lyso-Gb1
  was performed in dried blood spots. In our ERT and SRT study cohorts, plasma lyso-GL1
  correlated significantly with chito-triosidase (ERT: r = 0.55, p < 0.001; SRT: r
  = 0.83, p < 0.001) and TRAP (ERT: r = 0.34, p < 0.001; SRT: r = 0.88, p < 0.001),
  irrespective of treatment method. A platelet count increase was associated with
  a Lyso-Gb1 decrease in both treatment groups (ERT: p = 0.021; SRT: p = 0.028). The
  association of Lyso-Gb1 with evaluated markers was stronger in the SRT cohort. Our
  results indicate that ERT and SRT in combination or in a switch manner could offer
  the potential of individual drug effectiveness for particular GD symptoms. Combination
  of the key biomarker of GD, Lyso-Gb1, with other biomarkers can offer improved response
  assessment to long-term therapy.'
