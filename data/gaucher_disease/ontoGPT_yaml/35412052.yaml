input_text: Long-term eliglustat treatment of Gaucher patients over up to 10 years
  in Vienna. Gaucher disease has been the first lysosomal storage disorder for which
  an enzyme replacement therapy has been approved in the 1990s and was the first to
  receive approval for a first-line substrate reduction therapy in 2015. Eliglustat
  treatment has been started in Austria in patients recruited to a clinical trial,
  followed by its long-term extension and prescription treatment overall covering
  up to 10 years. In this case series the experience of treating Gaucher patients
  with eliglustat in Vienna is summarized. Patients were either switched from enzyme
  replacement therapy or were therapy naive. Significant improvements were shown in
  hematological (thrombocytes, hemoglobin) and visceral (spleen volume) manifestations
  as well as in biomarkers (chitotriosidase, glucosylsphingosine [lyso-GL1], angiotensin
  converting enzyme) in a routine setting in a therapy-naive patient. Stability was
  found in switch patients with slight improvement in bone density. Eliglustat was
  generally very well tolerated. Patient selection and regular monitoring is required
  to ensure effective and safe use.
