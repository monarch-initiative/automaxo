input_text: 'Risk of postpartum hemorrhage in multiparous women with Gaucher disease:
  A call for reconsidering enzyme replacement therapy in all pregnant patients. For
  the last three decades, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Gaucher disease (GD)
  has been available. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ERT on the pregnancy and
  obstetric outcome in a unique group of multiparous women with type 1 GD (GD1) who
  had pregnancies with and without ERT. The Gaucher Unit database (1987-2019) was
  searched for multiparous women who had pregnancies before and after the institution
  of ERT. Data were collected from the clinic files and study-specific questionnaires.
  Descriptive, correlation analysis and generalized estimating equations (GEE) were
  used to study the effect of ERT and confounding variables on study outcomes. We
  identified 19 women with 105 pregnancies, among which 26 (24.7%) terminated in first-trimester
  miscarriage. The risk for miscarriage was associated with the severity of GD1 genotype
  and phenotype, but not with ERT usage. Early postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was reported
  in 16 (84%) women after 25 deliveries (31.6%, 95% CI 21.6%-43.1%). The risks of
  early PPH and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions were significantly lower when ERT
  was used during pregnancy, OR (95% CI) 0.13 (0.03-0.54) and 0.27 (0.08-0.94), respectively,
  compared to pregnancies without the use of ERT. Enzyme replacement therapy during
  pregnancy is risk reducing for early PPH and RBC transfusions in women with GD1.
  We suggest considering ERT for the benefit of all pregnant women with GD1, including
  mild GD1.'
