input_text: 'Long-term outcomes in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic
  arthritis receiving adalimumab with or without methotrexate. OBJECTIVES: Long-term
  safety and efficacy of adalimumab among patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis
  (JIA) was evaluated through 6 years of treatment. METHODS: Children aged 4-17 years
  with polyarticular JIA were enrolled in a phase III, randomised-withdrawal, double-blind,
  placebo-controlled trial consisting of a 16-week open-label lead-in period, 32-week
  randomised double-blind period and 360-week long-term extension. Patients were stratified
  by baseline methotrexate use. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored, and efficacy
  assessments included JIA American College of Rheumatology (JIA ACR) 30%, 50%, 70%
  or 90% responses and the proportions of patients achieving 27-joint Juvenile Arthritis
  Disease Activity Score (JADAS27) low disease activity (LDA, <=3.8) and inactive
  disease (ID, <=1). RESULTS: Of 171 patients enrolled, 62 (36%) completed the long-term
  extension. Twelve serious infections in 11 patients were reported through 592.8
  patient-years of exposure. No cases of congestive heart failure-related AEs, demyelinating
  disease, lupus-like syndrome, malignancies, tuberculosis or deaths were reported.
  JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses and JADAS27 LDA were achieved in 66% to 96% of patients
  at week 104, and 63 (37%) patients achieved clinical remission (JADAS27 ID sustained
  for >=6 continuous months) during the study. Attainment of JIA ACR 50 or higher
  and JADAS27 LDA or ID in the initial weeks were the best predictors of clinical
  remission. Mean JADAS27 decreased from baseline, 22.5 (n=170), to 2.5 (n=30) at
  week 312 (observed analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Through 6 years of exposure, adalimumab
  was well tolerated with significant clinical response (up to clinical remission)
  and a relatively low retention rate.'
