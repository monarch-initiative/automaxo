input_text: 'Kidney Transplantation in Patients With AA Amyloidosis: Outcomes in a
  French Multicenter Cohort. RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Outcomes of kidney transplantation
  for patients with renal AA amyloidosis are uncertain, with reports of poor survival
  and high rates of disease recurrence. However, data are inconclusive and mostly
  based on studies from the early 2000s and earlier. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter
  cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We searched the French national transplant
  database to identify all patients with renal AA amyloidosis who underwent kidney
  transplantation between 2008 and 2018. EXPOSURES: Age, cause of amyloidosis, use
  of biotherapies, CRP levels. OUTCOMES: Outcomes were all-cause mortality and allograft
  loss. We also reported amyloidosis allograft recurrence, occurrence of acute rejection
  episodes, as well as infectious, cardiovascular, and neoplastic disease events.
  ANALYTICAL APPROACH: The Kaplan-Meier estimator for mortality and the cumulative
  incidence function method for allograft loss. Factors associated with patient and
  allograft survival were investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model and
  a cause-specific hazards model, respectively. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients who received
  kidney transplants for AA amyloidosis at 26 French centers were included. The median
  age was 49.4 years (interquartile range 39.7-61.1). The main cause of amyloidosis
  was Familial Mediterranean Fever (37 cases, 43%). Sixteen (18.6%) patients received
  a biotherapy after transplantation. Patient survival was 94.0% (95% confidence interval
  89.1-99.2) at 1 year and 85.5% (77.8-94.0) at 5 years post-transplantation. The
  cumulative incidence of allograft loss was 10.5% (4.0-17.0) at 1 year, and 13.0%
  (5.8-20.1) at 5 years post-transplantation. Histologically proven AA amyloidosis
  recurrence occurred in 5 transplants (5.8%). 55.8% of cases developed an infection
  requiring hospitalization and 27.9% acute allograft rejection. Multivariable analysis
  showed that CRP concentration at the time of transplantation was associated with
  patient survival (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p=0.01) and with allograft survival
  (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.10-2.57, p 0.02). LIMITATIONS: The study lacked a control group
  and the effect of biotherapies on transplantation outcomes could not be explored.
  CONCLUSIONS: This relatively contemporary cohort of patients who received a kidney
  transplant for AA amyloidosis experienced favorable rates of survival and lower
  recurrence rates than previously reported. These data support the practice of treating
  these patients with kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease.'
