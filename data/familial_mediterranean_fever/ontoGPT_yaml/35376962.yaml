input_text: "Safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with Behcet's syndrome and
  familial Mediterranean fever: a cross-sectional comparative study on the effects
  of M-RNA based and inactivated vaccine. Most of the published data relate to classical
  forms of rheumatic diseases (RD) and information on rare inflammatory disorders
  such as Behcet's syndrome (BS) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is limited.
  We studied the frequency of side effects and disease flares after COVID-19 vaccination
  with either Pfizer/BioNTech or Sinovac/CoronaVac in 256 patients with BS, 247 with
  FMF, and 601 with RD. Telephone interviews were conducted using a questionnaire
  survey in a cross-sectional design in patients with BS, FMF, and RD followed by
  a single university hospital. Study participants were vaccinated either with CoronaVac
  (BS:109, FMF: 90, and RD: 343,) or BioNTech (BS: 147, FMF: 157 and RD: 258). The
  majority have received double dose (BS: 94.9%, FMF 92.3% and RD: 86.2%). BioNTech
  ensured a significantly better efficacy than CoronaVac against COVID-19 in all patient
  groups (BS: 1.4% vs 10.1%; FMF: 3.2% vs 12.2%, RD:2.7% vs 6.4%). Those with at least
  one adverse event (AE) were significantly more frequent among those vaccinated with
  BioNTech than those with CoronaVac (BS: 86.4% vs 45%; FMF: 83.4% vs 53.3%; and RD:
  83.3% vs 45.5%). The majority of AEs were mild to moderate and transient and this
  was true for either vaccine. There were also AEs that required medical attention
  in all study groups following CoronaVac (BS: 5.5%, FMF: 3.3%, and RD:2.9%) or BioNTech
  (BS: 5.4%, FMF: 1.9%, and RD: 4.7%). The main causes for medical assistance were
  disease flare and cardiovascular events. Patients with BS (16.0%) and FMF (17.4%)
  were found to flare significantly more frequently when compared to those with RD
  (6.0%) (p < 0.001). This was true for either vaccine. BS patients reported mainly
  skin-mucosa lesions; there were however, 11 (4.3%) who developed major organ attack
  such as uveitis, thrombosis or stroke. Flare in FMF patients were associated mainly
  with acute serositis with or without fever. Arthralgia/arthritis or inflammatory
  back pain were observed mainly in the RD group. Our study demonstrates that BS and
  FMF patients vaccinated with either CoronaVac or BioNTech demonstrated similar AE
  profile and frequency compared to RD patients. AEs that required physician consultation
  or hospitalization occurred in all study groups after either CoronaVac or BioNTech.
  Increased frequency of flares in BS and FMF compared to that seen in RD might reflect
  defects in innate immunity and deserves further investigation. Caution should be
  required when monitoring these patients after vaccination."
