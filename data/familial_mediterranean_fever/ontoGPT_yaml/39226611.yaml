input_text: 'Factors Associated With Successful Withdrawal of Biologic Agents in Children
  With Colchicine-Resistant Familial Mediterranean Fever. BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean
  fever (FMF) is a monogenic autoinflammatory disease, and colchicine is the mainstay
  of treatment. Approximately 5%-10% of patients may respond inadequately to colchicine,
  and anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) agents are important treatment options in these
  patients. The aim of this study was to see whether there is any factor associated
  with the withdrawal of these anti-IL-1 agents and to investigate the characteristics
  of colchicine-resistant FMF patients who needed biological therapy. METHODS: Demographic,
  clinical characteristics, and disease severity of patients, at 2 referral centers,
  between 2012 and 2022, in whom anti-IL-1 treatment was continued and discontinued,
  were compared in this study. The international severity scoring system for FMF (ISSF)
  was used for disease severity assessment. RESULTS: In 64 colchicine-resistant FMF
  patients, the median (interquartile range) duration of biological treatment was
  39 (45) months. Treatment of 26 patients (40.6%) was started with anakinra and 38
  (59.4%) with canakinumab. During follow-up, anti-IL-1 treatment was discontinued
  in 23 patients (35.9%). High ISSF scores before biological treatment, presence of
  exertional leg pain, subclinical inflammation, and comorbidity were found to be
  statistically more frequent in the group whose biological therapy could not be discontinued
  (p = 0.009, p = 0.006, p = 0.026, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low ISSF
  scores before biological treatment with no accompanying exertional leg pain, subclinical
  inflammation, and comorbidities may be stated as an associated factors in terms
  of the discontinuation of biological agents in colchicine-resistant pediatric FMF
  patients.'
