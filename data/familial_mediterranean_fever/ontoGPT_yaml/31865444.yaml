input_text: "Drug reactions in children with rheumatic diseases receiving parenteral
  therapies: 9 years' experience of a tertiary pediatric rheumatology center. Parenteral
  treatments (either subcutaneous or intravenous) are frequently used in rheumatology
  practice. In this study, drug side effects in patients who were followed up with
  a rheumatic disease and treated with parenteral administration methods were evaluated.
  The drug side effects in children who were followed up with a rheumatic disease
  and treated with parenteral treatments between 2010 and 2019 were recorded, retrospectively.
  All parenteral treatments are applied by a clinical nurse specialist (CNS) who is
  experienced in pediatric rheumatology for 10 years. Four hundred and thirteen patients
  were evaluated in this study. The mean age was 12.09 +- 5.05 years. Most of them
  were diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n = 317) and colchicine-resistant
  familial Mediterranean fever (n = 57). Among the patients, 287 was treated with
  methotrexate, 130 with etanercept, 90 with adalimumab, 71 with anakinra, 64 with
  canakinumab, 55 with tocilizumab, seven with rituximab, six with infliximab, and
  four with abatacept. Two of the patients had a history of drug allergy (ceftriaxone
  = 1, ranitidine = 1). The most common adverse reactions were as follows: nausea-vomiting
  in 52, rash in 11, itching in three, chest tightening in two, bruising in two, headache
  in two, and abdominal pain in one of the patients. Drug side effects were observed
  after an average of three (1-4) administrations. Antihistaminic and steroids (tocilizumab
  = 3, infliximab = 1, methotrexate = 1) were administered to five patients due to
  hypersensitivity reactions. Considering the possible side effects and preparation
  protocols of parenteral treatments, experienced physicians and nurses are required
  in the field."
