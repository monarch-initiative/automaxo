input_text: 'The impact of COVID-19 on familial Mediterranean fever: a nationwide
  study. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and to assess the relationships
  between FMF characteristics and severe COVID-19 outcomes such as hospitalization.
  The study was planned within a national network of 21 different centers. Demographics,
  FMF-related clinical and genetic characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes were obtained.
  A total of 822 patients with FMF (mean age of 36 years) were included in the study.
  Fifty-nine of them (7%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by real-time PCR test
  or chest CT findings. Most FMF patients with COVID-19 (58) had mild and moderate
  disease activity. All patients were on colchicine treatment. However, 8 of them
  (13.6%) were not compliant with colchicine use and 9 of them (15.3%) were colchicine
  resistant. Twelve FMF patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized. There were 4 patients
  requiring oxygen support. COVID-19 related complications were observed in 2 patients
  (1 thromboembolism, 1 acute respiratory distress syndrome). Hospitalized COVID-19
  patients with FMF were older than non-hospitalized patients (median ages: 51 and
  31 years, respectively; p: 0.002). Other FMF-related characteristics were similar
  between the groups. FMF-related characteristics were not found to be associated
  with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Thus, FMF may not be a risk factor for poor COVID-19
  outcomes.'
