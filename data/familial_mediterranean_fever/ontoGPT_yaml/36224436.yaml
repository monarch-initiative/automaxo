input_text: 'Live-attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella booster vaccine in children
  diagnosed with rheumatic disease: A single-center study. To evaluate the safety
  profile of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster in children diagnosed with rheumatic
  diseases receiving biological agents. The study included retrospective safety data
  of children administered MMR booster dose receiving biologics or biologics with
  methotrexate. The files of 182 patients were accessed from the pediatric rheumatology
  biological therapy archive, and the vaccination status of these children was obtained
  by accessing electronic records. Of 182 patients, 14 patients were vaccinated with
  MMR booster dose. Thirteen of the patients were followed up with a diagnosis of
  juvenile idiopathic arthritis and one with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean
  fever. None of the patients had disease exacerbation after vaccination, and three
  patients had mild side effects consisting of rash, angioedema, joint pain, and fatigue.    Conclusion:
  This study supports the data regarding evidence of the safety of MMR booster dose
  administration in children with rheumatic diseases receiving bDMARDs. What is Known:   MMR
  booster is avoided in immunocompromised pediatric patients receiving bDMARDs except
  in specific conditions. What is New:   The MMR booster dose may be safe in children
  with PedRD receiving bDMARDs or bDMARDs with MTX. These bullets can be added to
  the manuscript.'
