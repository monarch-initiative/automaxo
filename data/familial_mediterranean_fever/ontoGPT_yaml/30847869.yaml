input_text: 'Early Treatment of Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis with Canakinumab
  and Complete Remission After 2 Years of Treatment Suspension: Case Report of an
  Adolescent Girl. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is an autoinflammatory
  disease characterised by fever and arthritis. We describe the case of a 14-year-old
  girl hospitalised with fever associated with rash, myalgia, arthralgia and polyarticular
  involvement. Examinations revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte
  sedimentation rate, ferritin, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase,
  fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
  gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Bone marrow biopsy showed polyclonal leukocyte
  activation. A genetic study revealed a heterozygous mutation of the MEFV gene, c.442G>C
  (E148Q), which is typical of familial Mediterranean fever. However, the genetic
  pattern was not associated with a history of recurrent fever, aphthous ulcers of
  the mouth, abdominal pain, arthralgia and rash. Therefore, a diagnosis of sJIA was
  made. The patient did not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids
  improved biochemical examinations; however, AST, ALT, GGT and glycaemia remained
  elevated and adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment became evident and therefore
  corticosteroids were withdrawn. Canakinumab (150 mg/4 weeks subcutaneously) was
  initiated. Biochemical data returned to normal values and clinical symptoms resolved.
  After 2.5 years of canakinumab treatment, complete disease remission allowed the
  prolongation of intervals between doses. When the intervals were longer than 10
  weeks we discontinued the treatment. The patient is still in remission 2 years after
  canakinumab withdrawal.'
