input_text: 'The development of a targeted and more potent, anti-Inflammatory derivative
  of colchicine: Implications for gout. BACKGROUND: Colchicine is routinely used for
  its anti-inflammatory properties to treat gout and Familial Mediterranean fever.
  More recently, it was also shown to be of therapeutic benefit for another group
  of diseases in which inflammation is a key component, namely, cardiovascular disease.
  Whilst there is considerable interest in repurposing this alkaloid, it has a narrow
  therapeutic index and is associated with undesirable side effects and drug interactions.
  We, therefore, developed a derivatives of colchicine that preferentially target
  leukocytes to increase their potency and diminish their side effects. The anti-inflammatory
  activity of the colchicine derivatives was tested in experimental models of neutrophil
  activation by the etiological agent of gout, monosodium urate crystals (MSU). METHODS:
  Using a rational drug design approach, the structure of colchicine was modified
  to increase its affinity for betaVI-tubulin, a colchicine ligand preferentially
  expressed by immune cells. The ability of the colchicine analogues with the predicted
  highest affinity for betaVI-tubulin to dampen neutrophil responses to MSU was determined
  with in vitro assays that measure MSU-induced production of ROS, release of IL-1
  and CXCL8/IL-8, and the increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium. The
  anti-inflammatory property of the derivatives was assessed in the air pouch model
  of MSU-induced inflammation in mice. RESULTS: The most effective compound generated,
  CCI, is more potent than colchicine in all the in vitro assays. It inhibits neutrophil
  responses to MSU in vitro at concentrations 10-100-fold lower than colchicine. Similarly,
  in vivo, CCI inhibits the MSU-induced recruitment of leukocytes at a 10-fold lower
  concentration than colchicine when administered prior to or after MSU. CONCLUSIONS:
  We provide evidence that colchicine can be rendered more potent atinhibiting MSU-induced
  neutrophil activation and inflammation using a rational drug design approach. The
  development of compounds such as CCI will provide more efficacious drugs that will
  not only alleviate gout patients of their painful inflammatory episodes at significantly
  lower doses than colchicine, but also be of potential therapeutic benefit for patients
  with other diseases treated with colchicine.'
