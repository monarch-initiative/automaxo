input_text: 'Canakinumab Treatment in Familial Mediterranean Fever Patients: With/Without
  Colchicine. OBJECTIVES: To compare the differences in attack characteristics, acute-phase
  reactants, and renal outcomes in patients using canakinumab with or without colchicine
  treatment. METHODS: FMF patients treated with canakinumab for >= 3 months were retrospectively
  reviewed. Patients unable to continue colchicine for various reasons were identified
  and grouped as those receiving the canakinumab + colchicine combination (CAN + CLC)
  and canakinumab monotherapy (CANmono). Attack frequency, C-reactive protein (CRP),
  urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR), and kidney function tests were recorded before
  and after canakinumab treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients receiving canakinumab
  treatment were included in the study. Thirty-one patients (56.4%) used CAN + CLC
  and 24 (43.6%) CANmono. With both CAN + CLC and CANmono treatment, there was no
  significant change in UPCR of patient groups with GFR > 60 and < 60 mL/min/1.73
  m2. Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis was present in 21 (38.2%) patients. In patients with
  AA amyloidosis receiving CAN + CLC, there was a nonsignificant decrease in UPCR
  and increased creatinine levels after treatment (p = 0.214 and p = 0.051, respectively).
  Median GFR decreased significantly from 69 (IQR, mg/dl, 45-95) to 44 (IQR, mg/dl,
  28-75) with CAN + CLC treatment (p = 0.021). In the CANmono group, compared to baseline
  values, there was no significant change in posttreatment UPCR, serum creatinine,
  and GFR values. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to make a recommendation regarding the
  discontinuation or continuation of colchicine treatment in all FMF patients who
  initiated anti-IL-1 treatment. Canakinumab can be continued as monotherapy in patients
  who cannot continue colchicine treatment due to side effects and patient noncompliance.'
