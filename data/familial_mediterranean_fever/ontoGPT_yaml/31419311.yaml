input_text: 'Severe hypersensitivity reactions to biological drugs in children with
  rheumatic diseases. BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) to biologic drugs
  (BD) may limit their use in children with rheumatic diseases. We aimed to analyze
  the incidence and clinical characteristics of immediate type I (IgE/non-IgE) hypersensitivity
  reactions to BD and the risk factors for these reactions. METHODS: Children with
  rheumatic diseases using BD who were evaluated in the pediatric allergy department
  for possible drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) due to BD or any other drug were
  included in the study. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight children (49.2% boys;
  14.6 years [9.9-16.9 years] with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [58%], familial Mediterranean
  fever [14%], vasculitis [14%], and other diseases [14%]) had used eight different
  BD with 32 494 infusions/injections. Fifteen patients were evaluated for DHR [injection-site
  reactions [n = 4], adverse events [n = 2], drug hypersensitivity other than BD [n
  = 3], and immediate BD hypersensitivity [n = 6]). The incidence of immediate BD
  HSR was 4.7%, with a clinical presentation of anaphylaxis in 3.9% (tocilizumab [n
  = 3], rituximab [n = 2], positive skin test with culprit BD [n = 3]). Among patients
  with BD HSR, the median follow-up was longer (84.5 vs 54 months, P = .048), and
  renal (33.3% vs 4.1%, P = .002), hematologic involvement (16.7% vs 0, P < .001),
  and active disease (83.3% vs 13.9%, P < .001) were more common. Logistic regression
  analysis revealed that renal involvement, more than 14 hospitalizations per lifetime,
  and more than two different BD used were associated with BD hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION:
  The frequency of severe immediate HSR due to BD was shown to be 3.9% in children
  with rheumatic diseases. Children with active rheumatic disease and who have exposure
  to multiple BD should be monitored for BD HSR, particularly during intravenous BD
  infusions.'
