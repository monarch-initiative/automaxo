input_text: 'Targeting the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases: where are
  we? The gut microbiota is now recognized to be a key driver of mucosal inflammation
  in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Robust functional and compositional alterations
  of the gut microbiota have been described in IBD with a reduction in bacterial diversity,
  a reduction in some anti-inflammatory anaerobic bacteria, and an increase in bacteria
  with pro-inflammatory potential. However, despite 15 years of active research, therapeutical
  applications are still lacking. Recent studies have shed new light on how targeting
  the gut microbiota can be beneficial in IBD with fecal microbiota transplantation,
  next-generation probiotics, and phage therapy. Given the similarities in dysfunction
  and structure of the gut microbiota between IBD and other chronic conditions associated
  with intestinal inflammation, such as celiac disease, Familial Mediterranean Fever,
  or common variable immunodeficiency, common therapeutic strategies targeting the
  host-microbiota symbiosis may be applied in these different conditions.'
