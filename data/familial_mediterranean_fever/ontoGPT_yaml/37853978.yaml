input_text: 'A rare complication of IgA vasculitis: renal and intestinal ischemia
  successfully treated with plasmapheresis. BACKGROUND: IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is a
  multisystemic small vessel vasculitis and is the most common vasculitis in childhood.
  The characteristic findings of IgAV are palpable purpuric rash, abdominal pain,
  arthralgia or arthritis, and hematuria. Ischemic complications are very rare in
  IgAV. Thrombotic complications can be observed after a COVID-19 infection. Also
  in the presence of familial Mediterranean fever, IgAV may have an atypical or more
  severe course. CASE: We present a case of IgAV complicated with renal infarction
  and intestinal ischemia. There was no recent or distant history of COVID-19 in the
  patient or family members, but the patient`s COVID-19 antibody was positive. In
  addition, MEFV gene analysis of the patient showed homozygous M694V mutation. The
  patient did not respond to enoxaparin, pulse methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin
  (IVIG), iloprost, and cyclophosphamide treatments. She was successfully treated
  with six sessions of plasmapheresis. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmapheresis seems to be an
  effective treatment option in IgAV-related ischemic findings that do not respond
  to intensive immunosuppressive therapy.'
