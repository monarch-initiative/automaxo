input_text: "Interventions for reducing inflammation in familial Mediterranean fever.
  BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever, a hereditary auto-inflammatory disease,
  mainly affects ethnic groups living in the Mediterranean region. Early studies reported
  colchicine as a potential drug for preventing attacks of familial Mediterranean
  fever. For those people who are colchicine-resistant or intolerant, drugs such as
  rilonacept, anakinra, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, thalidomide and interferon-alpha
  might be beneficial. This is an updated version of the review. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate
  the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in people with
  familial Mediterranean fever. SEARCH METHODS: We used detailed search strategies
  to search the following databases: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; Chinese Biomedical
  Literature Database (CBM); China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI);
  Wan Fang; and VIP. In addition, we also searched the clinical trials registries
  including ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial
  Number Register, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the
  Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, as well as references listed in relevant reports.Date
  of last search: 21 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled studies
  (RCTs) of people diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever, comparing active interventions
  (including colchicine, anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab,
  thalidomide, interferon-alpha, ImmunoGuard  (a herbal dietary supplement) and non-steroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs) with placebo or no treatment, or comparing active drugs
  to each other. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors independently selected
  studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled data to present the
  risk ratio or mean difference with their 95% confidence intervals. We assessed overall
  evidence quality according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine
  RCTs with a total of 249 participants (aged three to 53 years); five were of cross-over
  and four of parallel design. Six studies used oral colchicine, one used oral ImmunoGuard\
  \  and the remaining two used rilonacept or anakinra as a subcutaneous injection.
  The duration of each study arm ranged from one to eight months.The three studies
  of ImmunoGuard , rilonacept and anakinra were generally well-designed, except for
  an unclear risk of detection bias in one of these. However, some inadequacy existed
  in the four older studies on colchicine, which had an unclear risk of selection
  bias, detection bias and reporting bias, and also a high risk of attrition bias
  and other potential bias. Neither of the two studies comparing a single to a divided
  dose of colchicine were adequately blinded, furthermore one study had an unclear
  risk of selection bias and reporting bias, a high risk of attrition bias and other
  potential bias.We aimed to report on the number of participants experiencing an
  attack, the timing of attacks, the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis, any adverse
  drug reactions and the response of a number of biochemical markers from the acute
  phase of an attack, but data were not available for all outcomes across all comparisons.One
  study (15 participants) reported a significant reduction in the number of people
  experiencing attacks at three months with 0.6 mg colchicine three times daily (14%
  versus 100%), risk ratio 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.95) (low-quality
  evidence). A further study (22 participants) of 0.5 mg colchicine twice daily showed
  no significant reduction in the number of participants experiencing attacks at two
  months (low-quality evidence). A study of rilonacept in individuals who were colchicine-resistant
  or intolerant (14 participants) also showed no reduction at three months (moderate-quality
  evidence). Likewise, a study of anakinra given to colchicine-resistant people (25
  participants) showed no reduction in the number of participants experiencing an
  attack at four months (moderate-quality evidence).Three studies reported no significant
  differences in duration of attacks: one comparing colchicine to placebo (15 participants)
  (very low-quality evidence); one comparing single-dose colchicine to divided-dose
  colchicine (90 participants) (moderate-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept
  to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence). Three studies reported no significant
  differences in the number of days between attacks: two comparing colchicine to placebo
  (24 participants in total) (very low-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept
  to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence).No study reported on the prevention
  of amyloid A amyloidosis.One study of colchicine reported loose stools and frequent
  bowel movements (very low-quality evidence) and a second reported diarrhoea (very
  low-quality evidence). The rilonacept study reported no significant differences
  in gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, headache, respiratory tract infections,
  injection site reactions and herpes, compared to placebo (low-quality evidence).
  The ImmunoGuard study observed no side effects (moderate-quality evidence). The
  anakinra study reported no significant differences between intervention and placebo,
  including injection site reaction, headache, presyncope, dyspnea and itching (moderate-quality
  evidence). When comparing single and divided doses of colchicine, one study reported
  no difference in adverse events (including anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal
  pain, vomiting and elevated liver enzymes) between groups (moderate-quality evidence)
  and the second study reported no adverse effects were detected.The rilonacept study
  reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after three
  months (low-quality evidence). In the ImmunoGuard  study, these indicators were
  not reduced after one month of treatment (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra
  study, reported that C-reactive protein was significantly reduced after four months
  (moderate-quality evidence). One of the single dose versus divided dose colchicine
  studies reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after
  eight months (low-quality evidence), while the second study reported no significant
  reduction in serum amyloid A concentration after six months (moderate-quality evidence).
  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There were limited RCTs assessing interventions for people
  with familial Mediterranean fever. Based on the evidence, three times daily colchicine
  appears to reduce the number of people experiencing attacks, colchicine single dose
  and divided dose might not be different for children with familial Mediterranean
  fever and anakinra might reduce C-reactive protein in colchicine-resistant participants;
  however, only a few RCTs contributed data for analysis. Further RCTs examining active
  interventions, not only colchicine, are necessary before a comprehensive conclusion
  regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in
  familial Mediterranean fever can be drawn."
