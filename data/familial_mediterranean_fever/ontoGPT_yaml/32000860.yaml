input_text: 'Assessment of effectiveness of anakinra and canakinumab in patients with
  colchicine-resistant/unresponsive familial Mediterranean fever. INTRODUCTION: Familial
  Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary auto-inflammatory disease characterized
  by recurrent fever and serosal inflammation. Anti-interleukin-1 (Anti-IL-1) treatments
  are recommended in colchicine resistant and/or intolerant FMF patients. This study
  aims to evaluate the efficacy of anakinra and canakinumab in FMF patients that are
  resistant/intolareted to colchicine or complicated with amyloidosis. METHODS: Between
  January 2014 and March 2019, 65 patients following-up at Sivas Cumhuriyet University
  (Medical Faculty Rheumatology-Internal Medicine Department) who were diagnosed with
  FMF according to the criteria of Tel-Hashomer were included in the study. The laboratory
  values and clinical features of patients and disease activities were recorded at
  least every 3 months, and these data were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-one (63.1%) patients
  used anakinra (100 mg/day) and 24 (36.9%) patients used canakinumab (150 mg/8 week).
  The median duration of anti-IL-1 agents use was 7 months (range, 3-30). Fifteen
  (23.1%) cases were complicated with amyloidosis. Seven (10.8%) patients had renal
  transplantation. Overall, the FMF 50 score response was 96.9%. In the group that
  had a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 60 ml/min/m2, the median proteinuria decreased
  from 2390 mg/day (range, 1400-7200) to 890 mg/day (range, 120-2750) (p = 0.008).
  No serious infections were detected, except in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-IL-1
  agents are effective and safe in the treatment of FMF patients. These agents are
  particularly effective at reducing proteinuria in patients with GFR >= 60 ml/min/m2,
  but less effective in cases with FMF associated with arthritis and sacroiliitis.
  Large and long follow-up studies are now needed to establish the long-term effects
  of these treatments.'
