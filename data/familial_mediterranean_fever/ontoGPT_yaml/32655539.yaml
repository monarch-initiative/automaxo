input_text: "Current Therapeutic Options for the Main Monogenic Autoinflammatory Diseases
  and PFAPA Syndrome: Evidence-Based Approach and Proposal of a Practical Guide. Monogenic
  autoinflammatory diseases are rare conditions caused by genetic abnormalities affecting
  the innate immunity. Previous therapeutic strategies had been mainly based on results
  from retrospective studies and physicians' experience. However, during the last
  years, the significant improvement in their genetic and pathogenic knowledge has
  been accompanied by a remarkable progress in their management. The relatively recent
  identification of the inflammasome as the crucial pathogenic mechanism causing an
  aberrant production of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in the most frequent monogenic
  autoinflammatory diseases led to the introduction of anti-IL-1 agents and other
  biologic drugs as part of the previously limited therapeutic armamentarium available.
  Advances in the treatment of autoinflammatory diseases have been favored by the
  use of new biologic agents and the performance of a notable number of randomized
  clinical trials exploring the efficacy and safety of these agents. Clinical trials
  have contributed to increase the level of evidence and provided more robust therapeutic
  recommendations. This review analyzes the treatment of the most frequent monogenic
  autoinflammatory diseases, namely, familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome/mevalonate
  kinase deficiency, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, together with periodic
  fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome, which
  is the most common polygenic autoinflammatory disease in children, also occurring
  in adult patients. Finally, based on the available expert consensus recommendations
  and the highest level of evidence of the published studies, a practical evidence-based
  guideline for the treatment of these autoinflammatory diseases is proposed."
