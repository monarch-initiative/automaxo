input_text: 'Reasons for canakinumab initiation among patients with periodic fever
  syndromes: a retrospective medical chart review from the United States. BACKGROUND:
  Although canakinumab has demonstrated efficacy in multiple trials in patients with
  periodic fever syndromes (PFS), the evidence on initiation of canakinumab among
  PFS patients in real world setting is not well understood. We aimed to characterize
  the reasons for canakinumab initiation among patients with PFS, specifically, cryopyrin-associated
  periodic syndrome (CAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome/mevalonate kinase deficiency
  (HIDS/MKD), TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and familial Mediterranean
  fever (FMF). METHODS: Physicians retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of
  PFS patients prescribed canakinumab between 2016 and 2018. Information collected
  included patient clinical characteristics, reasons for previous treatment discontinuation
  and canakinumab initiation. The results were summarized for overall patients, and
  by children (< 18 years) and adults and by subtype of PFS. RESULTS: Fifty-eight
  physicians in the US (rheumatologists, 44.8 %; allergists/immunologists, 29.3 %;
  dermatologists, 25.9 %) abstracted information for 147 patients (children, 46.3
  %; males, 57.1 %; CAPS, 36.7 %; TRAPS, 26.5 %; FMF, 26.5 %; HIDS/MKD, 6.8 %; Mixed,
  3.4 %). Overall, most patients (90.5 %) received treatment directly preceding canakinumab
  (NSAIDs, 27.8 % [40.0 % in HIDS/MKD]; anakinra, 24.1 % [32.7 % in CAPS]; colchicine,
  21.8 % [35.9 % in FMF]), which were discontinued due to lack of efficacy/effectiveness
  (39.5 %) and availability of a new treatment (36.1 %). The common reasons for canakinumab
  initiation were physician perceived efficacy/effectiveness (81.0 %; children, 75.0
  %; adults, 86.1 %), lack of response to previous treatment (40.8 %; children, 38.2
  %; adults, 43.0 %) and favorable safety profile/tolerability (40.1 %; children,
  42.6 %; adults, 38.0 %). Within subtypes, efficacy/effectiveness was the most stated
  reason for canakinumab initiation in HIDS/MKD (90.9 %), lack of response to previous
  treatment in FMF (52.4 %) and convenience of administration/dosing in CAPS (27.1
  %). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insights into how canakinumab is initiated
  in US clinical practice among PFS patients, with physician perceived efficacy/effectiveness
  of canakinumab, lack of response to previous treatment and favorable safety profile/tolerability
  of canakinumab being the dominant reasons for canakinumab initiation in all patients
  and in children and adults and PFS subtypes. Notably, the favorable safety profile/tolerability
  of canakinumab was more often the reason for initiation among children versus adults.'
