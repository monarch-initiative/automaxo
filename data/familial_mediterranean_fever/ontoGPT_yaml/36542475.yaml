input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of interleukin-1 blockers in kidney transplant recipients
  with familial Mediterranean fever: a propensity score-matched cohort study. BACKGROUND:
  Data on use of IL-1 blockers in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with familial
  Mediterranean fever (FMF) are very limited. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and
  safety of anakinra and canakinumab in the transplantation setting. METHODS: In this
  retrospective cohort study, we included KTRs suffered from AA amyloidosis caused
  by FMF and treated with anakinra or canakinumab (study group, n = 36). Using propensity
  score matching, we selected 36 patients without FMF or amyloidosis from our database
  of 696 KTRs as the control group. Primary outcomes were patient and graft survival.
  Biopsy-confirmed graft rejection, changes in eGFR, hsCRP, erythrocyte sedimentation
  rate (ESR), proteinuria, and number of monthly attacks were secondary outcomes.
  RESULTS: All KTRs with FMF began IL-1 blocker therapy with anakinra and nine (25%)
  were switched to canakinumab. Overall death was more frequent in study group (19.4%
  vs 0%) (p = 0.005); however, overall graft loss was comparable between study (27.8%)
  and control groups (36.1%) (p = 0.448). Five- and 10-year graft survival rates were
  significantly higher in study group (94.4% and 83.3%, respectively) than control
  group (77.8% and 63.9%, respectively) (p = 0.014 and p<0.001, respectively). Rejections
  were numerically lower in study group (8.3% vs 25%), but it did not reach to statistical
  significance (p = 0.058). When compared to pre-treatment period, with IL-1 blockers,
  number of attacks per month (p<0.001), eGFR (p = 0.004), hsCRP (p<0.001) and ESR
  (p = 0.026) levels were lower throughout the follow-up; whereas proteinuria levels
  were not. CONCLUSIONS: Anakinra and canakinumab are effective in KTRs suffering
  from FMF; however, mortality rate may be of concern.'
