input_text: Identification of a Germline Pyrin Variant in a Metastatic Melanoma Patient
  With Multiple Spontaneous Regressions and Immune-related Adverse Events. The mechanisms
  underlying tumor immunosurveillance and their association with the immune-related
  adverse events (irAEs) associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies remain
  poorly understood. We describe a metastatic melanoma patient exhibiting multiple
  episodes of spontaneous disease regression followed by the development of several
  irAEs during the course of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody immunotherapy.
  Whole-exome next-generation sequencing studies revealed this patient to harbor a
  pyrin inflammasome variant previously described to be associated with an atypical
  presentation of familial Mediterranean fever. This work highlights a potential role
  for inflammasomes in the regulation of tumor immunosurveillance and the pathogenesis
  of irAEs.
