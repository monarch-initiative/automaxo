input_text: Atypical Familial Mediterranean Fever Presenting with Recurrent Migratory
  Polyarthritis. A 38-year-old Japanese man without any significant past medical history
  was referred to our clinic to undergo further examination for a "refractory infection
  in his joints". He suffered recurrent migratory polyarthritis starting from bilateral
  knees to his right elbow. Certain antibiotic therapies appeared to improve his symptoms,
  but the symptoms recurred due to the migratory nature of arthritis. A diagnosis
  of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was considered and diagnostic tests were performed.
  Not many differential diagnoses exist for migratory polyarthritis, particularly
  when it has a recurrent nature. The administration of antibiotics without sufficient
  diagnostic consideration can cause a delay in making an accurate diagnosis and thereby
  also cause a delay in administering appropriate treatment.
