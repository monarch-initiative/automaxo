input_text: 'Psychotropics in Your Medicine Cabinet: A Case Study of Dimenhydrinate
  Use. : Reporting of intoxication and withdrawal from aberrant use of over-the-counter
  medication has been sparse and inconsistent in literature. Attributed to their anticholinergic
  properties, medications such as dimenhydrinate (Gravol) taken in supratherapeutic
  doses have been associated with euphoria, anxiolysis, and hallucinations. We present
  a case of a woman in her forties, with a psychiatric history of bipolar disorder,
  and complex concurrent medical history including familial Mediterranean fever (FMF),
  and fibromyalgia, admitted for withdrawal management of her intravenous dimenhydrinate
  use. As a result of her FMF, there were numerous hospital admissions and treatment
  which required intravenous access. Hence, a physician-inserted intravenous access
  port was placed on her chest. The port was maintained monthly with the help of a
  community agency. In this port, she was injecting 100 to 200 mg of dimenhydrinate
  hourly for its euphoric and calming effects, consuming upwards of 2400 mg/d. Comprehensive
  laboratory work-up and urine drug screening were unremarkable. Vital signs were
  stable. Her mental status at time of admission was lethargic, unfocused, but calm.
  Her withdrawal symptoms included severe nausea, vomiting, sedation, headaches, dizziness,
  anxiety, and muscle stiffness. Her detoxification was managed with benztropine and
  lorazepam, and was well tolerated. The patient was discharged to a community inpatient
  rehabilitation center. Urine drug testing before discharge was negative. This case
  draws attention to the addictive potential of dimenhydrinate and offers a regime
  for its medical withdrawal management. Additionally, this case highlights that screening
  and management of over-the-counter medications warrants further clinical consideration
  and investigation.'
