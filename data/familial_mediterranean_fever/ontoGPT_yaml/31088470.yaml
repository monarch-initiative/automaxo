input_text: 'Periodic fever syndromes: beyond the single gene paradigm. Familial Mediterranean
  fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease in Canada and
  is characterized by a clinical syndrome of episodic inflammatory symptoms. Traditionally,
  the disease is defined by autosomal recessive inheritance of MEFV gene variants,
  yet FMF also not uncommonly manifests in individuals with only one identified disease-associated
  allele. Increasing availability and affordability of gene sequencing has led to
  the identification of multiple MEFV variants; however, they are often of unknown
  clinical significance. Variants in other genes affecting overlapping or distinct
  inflammatory signaling pathways - together with gene-environment interactions including
  epigenetic modulation - likely underlie the significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity
  seen among patients with this disease. We review recent evidence of the expanding
  spectrum of FMF genotype and phenotype and suggest that current drug funding schemes
  restricting biologic agents to patients with homozygous mutations have not kept
  pace with our biological understanding of the disease.'
