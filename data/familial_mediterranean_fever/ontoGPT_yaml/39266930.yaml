input_text: 'Pregnancy occurring in AA amyloidosis: a series of 27 patients including
  3 new French cases. BACKGROUND: AA amyloidosis (AAA) is a multisystem disease related
  to the deposition in tissues of serum amyloid A protein which complicates chronic
  inflammation. It is a potentially fatal complication.  Renal involvement is the
  most common manifestation of AAA. Pregnancy in women with chronic kidney disease  is
  considered to be at risk for specific pregnancy complications and the worsening
  of their underlying renal dysfunction. Our aim was to report pregnancy in our AAA
  patients and discuss the outcome through a literature review. METHODS: French cases
  were identified through the Reference Center for Auto-Inflammatory Diseases and
  Amyloidosis and a systematic literature review was performed. RESULTS: Three new
  patients were identified: two with Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and one with
  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome; one was under anakinra therapy and one had
  received a kidney transplantation before her pregnancy. One patient was diagnosed
  with AAA following the detection of post-partum nephrotic syndrome. Among the 27
  patients from literature and our case, FMF was the main cause of AAA (69%). Eight
  of the patients were diagnosed with AAA during their pregnancy or in immediate post-partum
  and gestational complications appeared in 23/25 cases, mostly intrauterine growth
  retardation (n = 10), prematurity (n = 11) and preeclampsia (n = 4). No bleeding
  complication was reported. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy can occur in patients (eight overall)
  with AAA and the diagnosis is frequently made during pregnancy. Pregnant women with
  AAA are at risk for adverse pregnancy-associated outcomes and require special and
  closer monitoring.'
