input_text: 'Outcomes of Canakinumab Treatment in Recipients of Kidney Transplant
  With Familial Mediterranean Fever: A Case Series. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)
  is an important and preventable cause of chronic kidney disease due to secondary
  amyloidosis. Although colchicine is the first-line therapy in patients with FMF
  with 60% to 65% complete remission rates, 5% to 10% of patients are colchicine-resistant
  and 5% to 10% of them are intolerant to the therapy. Anti-interleukin-1 agents,
  such as anakinra and canakinumab, are safe and efficient therapeutic options in
  patients with colchicine resistance or intolerance. However, the data on management
  of these targeted agents is limited in recipients of kidney transplant (RKT). In
  this case series, we aim to share our experience on canakinumab therapy of 4 RKTs
  with FMF-related amyloidosis, who were followed up in our clinic between 2010 and
  2017. All of the 4 patients with end-stage renal disease were colchicine- resistant
  and on other alternative therapies, which provided poor disease control. For efficient
  control of secondary amyloidosis, canakinumab therapy was initiated in 1 of the
  patients before the renal transplant, and for the remaining patients after renal
  transplant. Any serious adverse effect, development of proteinuria, or graft dysfunction
  has not been observed in any of the patients. Under the canakinumab treatment, complete
  clinical responses, prevent typical familial Mediterranean fever attacks with fever
  and arthritis and abdominal pain, normalized serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein
  levels were achieved in all patients. Canakinumab treatment is a safe and effective
  therapeutic option for RKTs with FMF who are resistant or intolerant to colchicine
  and anakinra.'
