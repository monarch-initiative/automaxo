input_text: 'The Role of IL-17 in Systemic Autoinflammatory Diseases: Mechanisms and
  Therapeutic Perspectives. Interleukin (IL)-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, plays
  a pivotal role in immune regulation by bridging innate and adaptive responses. Beyond
  its canonical involvement in T helper-17 cells-mediated immunity, IL-17 contributes
  significantly to the pathogenesis of systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs)
  including Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-associated autoinflammatory diseases, and
  synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. Dysregulated
  IL-17 signaling drives inflammasome activation, neutrophil recruitment, and chronic
  tissue inflammation. IL-17 inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in refractory SAIDs,
  though challenges such as increased infection risks, paradoxical inflammatory reactions,
  and uncertainties regarding long-term safety persist. Currently, there is insufficient
  data to support the use of IL-17 inhibitors as first-line treatments, and their
  role in managing SAIDs is yet to be fully defined. This review highlights the mechanistic
  role of IL-17 in SAIDs and emerging therapeutic strategies, including IL-17-targeted
  monotherapies and combination approaches with IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
  inhibitors. Future research should focus on biomarker development, combination therapies,
  and long-term studies to optimize the safety and efficacy of IL-17-targeted therapies
  in SAIDs.'
