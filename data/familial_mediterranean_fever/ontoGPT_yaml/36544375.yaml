input_text: "Long-term results of kidney transplantation in patients with familial
  mediterranean fever. INTRODUCTION: Long-term kidney transplantation (KT) results
  in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)-related amyloidosis are not
  well studied. This study reviewed the long-term survival outcomes of FMF patients
  who underwent KT. METHODS: We compared the outcomes of 31 patients who underwent
  (KT) for biopsy-proven amyloidosis secondary to FMF with 31 control patients (five
  with diabetes mellitus and 26 with nondiabetic kidney disease) undergoing KT between
  1994 and 2021 at Baskent University Hospital. All data were recorded retrospectively
  from patients' files. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE (QUARTILE DEVIATION: QD) at the time
  of KT in the FMF and control group were 31 (6.7) and 33 (11), respectively. The
  median follow-up period (QD) after KT was 108 (57) months in the FMF and 132 (72)
  months in the control group. In the FMF group, graft and patient survivals were
  71% and 84% at 5 years and 45% and 48% at 10 years, respectively. In the control
  group, graft and patient survivals were 79% and 100% at 5 years and 63% and 71%
  at 10 years, respectively. Patient survival in the FMF group at 5 years was significantly
  lower than in the control group (p = .045). There was no statistically significant
  difference between the FMF and control groups in terms of graft and patient survival,
  and serum creatinine levels at 10 years. All patients were given triple immunosuppressive
  treatment with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Three patients
  received anakinra and one received canakinumab in addition to colchicine treatment.
  One FMF patient also underwent heart transplantation due to AA amyloidosis. Of the
  FMF patients, 11 died during follow-up. CONCLUSION: We have found that the long-term
  outcome of KT in patients with FMF amyloidosis is numerically worse but not statistically
  different from the control group. However, short- and long-term complications still
  need to be resolved."
