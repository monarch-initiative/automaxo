input_text: 'Transition to Adult Care in Autoinflammatory Diseases: A Cohort of 111
  French Patients. BACKGROUND: Transitioning from pediatric to adult care is a critical
  step for individuals with autoinflammatory diseases, requiring effective programs
  to ensure continuity of care and disease management. Despite various recommendations,
  the effectiveness of transition programs, particularly in monogenic autoinflammatory
  diseases, remains understudied. METHODS: A single-center medical records review
  study was conducted at the French National Reference Center for Adult Autoinflammatory
  Diseases in Tenon Hospital from 2017 to 2023. All patients who had consulted for
  the first time between the ages of 15 and 30 years and had received care for an
  autoinflammatory disease during childhood were included. The patients were classified
  according to whether they had undergone a transition, defined as either no transition,
  simple transition (referral letter), or joint transition (pediatrician and adult
  physician consultation). RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients (median age, 18 years)
  were included. Patients who consulted without transition started adult follow-up
  and were followed up less regularly than those who underwent the transition process
  (p < 0.001 and p = 0.028). In patients with familial Mediterranean fever, the absence
  of a formal transition was associated with poorer disease control at baseline (p
  = 0.019). The type of transition did not impact disease control during follow-up.
  CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a transition program is associated with earlier and
  more regular follow-up in adulthood. Although transition type did not significantly
  impact disease control during follow-up in familial Mediterranean fever, the potential
  benefit of joint consultation extends beyond consultation frequency and disease
  outcomes, encompassing patient perspectives and self-management abilities. This
  study highlights the significance of collaborative transition programs in AIDs.'
