input_text: Efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with intravenous colchicine
  for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) refractory to oral colchicine. Colchicine
  is the mainstay of treatment for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Intravenous
  (IV) colchicine, administered over several months, has been shown to be effective
  for FMF patients unresponsive to oral colchicine. The objective of this study was
  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term IV colchicine treatment in oral
  colchicine-resistant FMF. We analyzed data of 15 patients with frequent FMF attacks,
  despite a maximal tolerated dose of oral colchicine (2-3 mg/day), who were treated
  with weekly IV injections of 1 mg of colchicine for at least 12 months. Treatment
  efficacy was determined by changes in frequency, duration and severity of FMF attacks.
  Safety was assessed according to adverse events. The mean duration of IV colchicine
  treatment was 5.16 +- 2.85 years. Decreases were observed from pre-treatment period
  in the monthly mean rates of abdominal attacks (from 5.6 +- 3.7 to 1.9 +- 3.3, p
  = 0.0009), joint attacks (from 6.5 +- 5.1 to 1.6 +- 1.6, p = 0.01) and overall attacks
  (from 22.3 +- 16.2 to 7.4 +- 5.7, p = 0.002) as well as in the mean duration (from
  3.8 +- 1.5 to 2.4 +- 1.1 days per attack, p = 0.008) and severity of attacks (from
  9.9 +- 0.3 to 5.7 +- 2.6, on a scale of 0-10, p < 0.05). The rate of adverse events
  was low, and they were mainly gastrointestinal. No severe or serious adverse events
  were recorded. Long-term treatment with IV colchicine in patients unresponsive to
  oral colchicine therapy is effective and safe.
