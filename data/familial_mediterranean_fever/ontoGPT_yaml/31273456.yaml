input_text: 'Successful management of colchicine resistant familial Mediterranean
  fever patients with a standardized canakinumab treatment protocol: a case series
  and literature review. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic
  auto-inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and serositis.
  Although colchicine is the first line treatment in FMF, 5-10% of patients do not
  respond to colchicine. Canakinumab, an anti-IL-1beta monoclonal antibody, has been
  reported to be effective and safe in colchicine-resistant FMF patients, but the
  adequate duration and interval of treatment is still a matter of debate. Aim of
  this study was to evaluate the success of the standardized treatment protocol for
  canakinumab applied in our Pediatric Rheumatology Department in colchicine-resistant
  FMF cases with a review of the literature. Nine patients included in this study
  had indications for canakinumab use as colchicine resistance and recurrent corticosteroid
  need for pleural/pericardial effusions. Canakinumab was administered monthly for
  6 months (initial treatment), bimonthly for 6 months (maintenance treatment), then
  treatment was discontinued. For the patients who developed a new attack after one-year
  treatment period, canakinumab was readministered with 3-month intervals (continuation
  treatment). The mean follow-up time beginning from the first canakinumab injection
  was 24.3 +- 10.2 (6-33) months. None of the patients had an attack during the first-year
  treatment. Four of the patients developed an attack 9.0 +- 2.9 (6-12) months after
  discontinuation of treatment and switched to the continuation treatment period,
  with no more attacks. We suggest that this standard protocol may be used successfully
  in colchicine-resistant FMF patients.'
