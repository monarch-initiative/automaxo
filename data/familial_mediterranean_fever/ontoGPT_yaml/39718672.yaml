input_text: 'Frequency of severe infections in rheumatic disease patients receiving
  bDMARDs post-kidney transplantation: a multicenter study. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate
  the incidence and characteristics of severe infections in rheumatic patients receiving
  biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) after kidney transplantation.
  METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 38 patients who had undergone
  kidney transplantation and received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases. Demographic,
  clinical, and treatment data were collected. Severe infections were defined as those
  requiring hospitalization, and the incidence of severe infections was calculated
  per 100 patient years. Risk factors for severe infections were analyzed. RESULTS:
  Of the 38 patients (median age 40.5 years), 52.6% experienced severe infections,
  with a total of 39 severe infection episodes. The incidence of severe infections
  was 26.2 per 100 patient-years. The most common infections were urinary tract infections
  (43.5%) and pneumonia (30.8%). Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was the most common
  rheumatic disease (57.9%), and the median disease duration was 18.5 years. Most
  patients (68.4%) were using IL-1 inhibitors, and 31.6% were on anti-TNF therapy.
  There was no significant difference between patients with and without infections
  in terms of gender, pre-transplant biological therapy use, or type of biological
  therapy used. Four patients (11%) died from infection-related complications, including
  coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic patients receiving bDMARDs
  post-kidney transplantation have a high risk of severe infections. The concurrent
  use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk, necessitating
  close infection monitoring and management. Key Points   Rheumatic patients treated
  with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) following kidney
  transplantation face a heightened risk of severe infections.   The concurrent use
  of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk.   Individualized
  treatment strategies are essential to balance the benefits of bDMARDs with the potential
  for severe infectious complications.'
