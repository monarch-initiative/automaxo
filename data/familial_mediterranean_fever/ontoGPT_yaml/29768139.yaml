input_text: 'Canakinumab for the Treatment of Autoinflammatory Recurrent Fever Syndromes.
  BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency (also known
  as the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome), and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  periodic syndrome (TRAPS) are monogenic autoinflammatory diseases characterized
  by recurrent fever flares. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with genetically
  confirmed colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency,
  or TRAPS at the time of a flare to receive 150 mg of canakinumab subcutaneously
  or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients who did not have a resolution of their flare
  received an add-on injection of 150 mg of canakinumab. The primary outcome was complete
  response (resolution of flare and no flare until week 16). In the subsequent phase
  up to week 40, patients who had a complete response underwent a second randomization
  to receive canakinumab or placebo every 8 weeks. Patients who underwent a second
  randomization and had a subsequent flare and all other patients received open-label
  canakinumab. RESULTS: At week 16, significantly more patients receiving canakinumab
  had a complete response than those receiving placebo: 61% vs. 6% of patients with
  colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever (P<0.001), 35% versus 6% of those
  with mevalonate kinase deficiency (P=0.003), and 45% versus 8% of those with TRAPS
  (P=0.006). The inclusion of patients whose dose was increased to 300 mg every 4
  weeks yielded a complete response in 71% of those with colchicine-resistant familial
  Mediterranean fever, 57% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 73% of
  those with TRAPS. After week 16, an extended dosing regimen (every 8 weeks) maintained
  disease control in 46% of patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean
  fever, 23% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 53% of those with TRAPS.
  Among patients who received canakinumab, the most frequently reported adverse events
  were infections (173.3, 313.5, and 148.0 per 100 patient-years among patients with
  colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, those with mevalonate kinase
  deficiency, and those with TRAPS, respectively), with a few being serious infections
  (6.6, 13.7, and 0.0 per 100 patient-years). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, canakinumab
  was effective in controlling and preventing flares in patients with colchicine-resistant
  familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, and TRAPS. (Funded by
