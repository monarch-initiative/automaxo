input_text: 'Improved kidney function is associated with Colchicine treatment in COVID-19
  patients. BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2
  virus) has been a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney
  injury (AKI) has been seen in COVID-19-infected subjects, and it has frequently
  resulted in an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Colchicine, an immunomodulatory
  drug, was used in several studies in the early stages of the pandemic. Colchicine
  has been shown to prevent the development of renal failure in patients with Familial
  Mediterranean Fever (FMF). It has also been reported to reduce fibrosis, which plays
  a role in chronic kidney disease. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether using
  Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with better renal function
  in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study
  comprised 118 out of 605 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. Some of the subjects (n
  = 50) received oral Colchicine plus standard care, called the Col ( +) group. The
  others (n = 68) received only the standard care, called the Col (-) group. The estimated
  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other laboratory findings, including lymphocytes,
  D-dimer, and CRP, were analyzed. RESULTS: The D-dimer and serum creatine levels
  were significantly reduced in both groups. The number of lymphocytes showed a significant
  increase in both groups at discharge. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was
  significantly higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at admission.
  The reduction of SCr was considerably higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col
  (-) group. Similarly, the improvement of eGFR was higher in the Col ( +) group than
  in the Col (-) group at discharge and 6-12 mounts follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings
  indicated the use of Colchicine plus standard care was associated with improved
  renal function in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection.'
