input_text: 'Neonatal onset familial Mediterranean fever. Objectives: Familial Mediterranean
  fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by recurrent, self-limited
  attacks of fever with serositis. Recently, it was shown that FMF patients with early
  disease onset have more severe disease. The aim of this study was to describe the
  demographic, clinical and genetic features of FMF patients who had disease onset
  during the neonatal period. Methods: Medical records of all patients diagnosed as
  FMF and had been seen in the outpatient clinic of Paediatric Rheumatology department
  between January 2013 and January 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with
  disease onset during the first month of life were included to the study. Results:
  Among 317 patients; 19 (12 males) were included to the study. Approximately 60%
  of the patients had family history of FMF. Homozygous p.M694V mutation was detected
  in 42% of the cases. Thirteen patients present with attacks of fever and remaining
  had attacks in the form of restlessness, resembling infantile colic starting in
  the neonatal period. Majority of these patients developed classical abdominal attacks
  between the ages of 1 and 2.5 years. The diagnosis of FMF was significantly delayed;
  the median age at onset of therapy was 3.5 years (range 7 months-17 years). Conclusion:
  Patients with FMF could have complaints even in the neonatal period. Homozygous
  p.M694V mutation is a prominent mutation in this group of patients. In order to
  prevent diagnostic delay physicians dealing with these type of patients should be
  more vigilant.'
