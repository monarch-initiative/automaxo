input_text: 'A multicenter study of the clinical, laboratory characteristics, and
  potential prognostic factors in patients with amyloid A amyloidosis on hemodialysis.
  INTRODUCTION: While light chain (AL) amyloidosis is more common in western countries,
  the most common type of amyloidosis is amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis in Eastern Mediterranean
  Region, including Turkey. Although worse prognosis has been attributed to the AL
  amyloidosis, AA amyloidosis can be related to higher mortality under renal replacement
  therapies. However, there are no sufficient data regarding etiology, clinical presentation,
  and prognostic factors of AA amyloidosis. The objective of our study is to evaluate
  the clinical, laboratory characteristics, and possible predictive factors related
  to mortality in patients with AA amyloidosis undergoing hemodialysis (HD). METHODS:
  This multicenter, cross-sectional study was a retrospective analysis of 2100 patients
  on HD. It was carried out in 14 selected HD centers throughout Turkey. Thirty-two
  patients with biopsy-proven AA amyloidosis and thirty-two control patients without
  AA amyloidosis undergoing HD were included between October 2018 and October 2019.
  There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age and dialysis
  vintage. Causes of AA amyloidosis, treatment (colchicine and/or anti-interleukin
  1 [IL] treatment), and the number of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) attacks
  in the last year in case of FMF, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, biochemical
  values such as mean CRP, hemoglobin, serum albumin, phosphorus, calcium, PTH, ferritin,
  transferrin saturation, total cholesterol levels, EPO dose, erythropoietin-stimulating
  agents resistance index, interdialytic fluid intake, body mass indexes, heparin
  dosage, UF volume, and Kt/V data in the last year were collected by retrospective
  review of medical records. FINDINGS: Prevalence of AA amyloidosis was found to be
  1.87% in HD centers. In amyloidosis and control groups, 56% and 53% were male, mean
  age was 54 +- 11 and 53 +- 11 years, and mean dialysis vintage was 104 +- 94 and
  107 +- 95 months, respectively. FMF was the most common cause of AA amyloidosis
  (59.5%). All FMF patients received colchicine and the mean colchicine dose was 0.70
  +- 0.30 mg/day. 26.3% of FMF patients were unresponsive to colchicine and anti-IL-1
  treatment was used in these patients. In AA amyloid and control groups, erythropoietin-stimulating
  agents resistance index were 7.88 +- 3.78 and 5.41 +- 3.06 IU/kg/week/g/dl, respectively
  (p = 0.008). Additionally, higher CRP values (18.78 +- 18.74 and 10.61 +- 10.47
  mg/L, p = 0.037), lower phosphorus (4.68 +- 0.73 vs. 5.25 +- 1.04 mg/dl, p = 0.014),
  total cholesterol (135 +- 42 vs. 174 +- 39 mg/dl, p < 0.01), and serum albumin (3.67
  +- 0.49 mg/dl, 4.03 +- 0.22, p < 0.01) were observed in patients with AA amyloidosis
  compared to the control group. DISCUSSION: In this study, we found that long-term
  prognostic factors including higher inflammation, malnutritional parameters, and
  higher erythropoietin-stimulating agents resistance index were more frequent in
  AA amyloidosis patients under HD treatment.'
