input_text: 'Safety and efficacy of anti-interleukin-1 treatment in 40 patients, followed
  in a single centre, with AA amyloidosis secondary to familial Mediterranean fever.
  OBJECTIVE: The main devastating complication of FMF is AA amyloidosis. Approximately
  10-15% of the patients are either intolerant or have an insufficient response to
  colchicine treatment. The most promising alternative treatment approach is anti-IL-1
  agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-IL-1
  therapy in FMF amyloidosis. METHODS: Forty-four patients with amyloidosis who had
  been treated with anti-IL-1 agents, anakinra and/or canakinumab, were assessed retrospectively
  for efficacy and safety. Five patients were on haemodialysis and four had received
  a renal transplant. RESULTS: The mean duration of anti-IL-1 treatment was 21.4  (18)
  months. Among 35 patients who were not on dialysis, renal function was maintained
  or improved in 79.4% but deteriorated in 20.6%. Patients with creatinine levels
  below 1.5 mg/dl at onset benefitted more from IL-1 inhibition with regard to their
  kidney functions and acute phase reactants. No additional side effects were observed
  in patients with renal replacement treatments. The major side effect of anakinra
  was injection-site reaction observed in four patients. CONCLUSION: Anti-IL-1 agents
  are well tolerated and effective in the treatment of amyloidosis secondary to FMF,
  including patients on dialysis and renal transplant recipients. This approach may
  improve the lifespan of transplanted kidneys in FMF patients.'
