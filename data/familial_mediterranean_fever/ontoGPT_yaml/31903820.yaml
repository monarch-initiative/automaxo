input_text: 'The assessment of tocilizumab therapy on recurrent attacks of patients
  with familial Mediterranean fever: A retrospective study of 15 patients. AIM: Interleukin-6
  receptor antagonist, tocilizumab (TCZ), is known to be effective in the treatment
  of amyloidosis in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). But there are
  limited data about the effect of TCZ on frequency of attacks. In the current study,
  we aimed to find out whether TCZ therapy could decrease the frequency of recurrent
  attacks of FMF or not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The recorded files of 15 patients
  who had received intravenous TCZ for the improvement of amyloidosis associated with
  FMF, were evaluated retrospectively. Data of demographic and clinical characteristics
  of patients were archived from those files. RESULTS: Three female and 12 male patients
  received TCZ due to amyloidosis were included to the study. The mean age was 42.07
  +- 14.37 years. All of the patients were in full compliance with colchicine treatment.
  According to international severity scoring system for FMF, all of the patients
  had severe disease. The frequency of attacks recorded was evaluated during TCZ treatment,
  and it was reported that one patient had no response, six patients had decreased
  attack frequency and eight patients had no attacks. DISCUSSION: Tocilizumab is found
  to be efficient on improvement of amyloidosis and decreasing the frequency of recurrent
  attacks in patients with FMF. Besides, TCZ is well tolerated among the patients.
  Further and prospective studies with larger sample are needed to support these results.'
