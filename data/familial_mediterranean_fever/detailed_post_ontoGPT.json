                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent serosal inflammation with fever, which can result in amyloid deposition. Anti-interleukin-1 drugs emerge as a therapeutic option for colchicine-resistant patients. In this study, we aimed to document our experience with canakinumab use in kidney transplant recipients who developed AA amyloidosis due to FMF. METHODS: A total of nine patients with FMF amyloidosis treated with canakinumab were enrolled. Laboratory and clinical data were collected from the patient files, electronic database of the hospital and with interviews. RESULTS: Five of the patients were male and four were female (median age: 33, range: 27-62 years). All of the patients had rapid or gradual disappearance of FMF attacks. The following changes in the laboratory parameters were observed before and after the treatment: C-reactive protein: 18.31 +- 13.58 mg/L vs 9.98 +- 11.66 mg/L, creatinine clearance: 45.27 +- 21.5 mL/min vs 50.71 +- 22.48 mL/min, and 24-hour proteinuria: 2381.8 +- 3910.4 mg vs 710.0 +- 1117.5 mg; there were no statistically significant differences on those parameters. One patient developed a reaction to injection while another showed symptoms of Cytomegalovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Canakinumab can be considered as a safe and efficient drug in preventing the FMF attacks in kidney transplant recipients.",

Clinical and laboratory data of each visit were recorded. Drug-related adverse events were recorded. Complete remission was described as no attacks and normal acute phase reactants; partial remission was defined as decrease in severity and rate of attacks and/or elevated acute phase reactants with anti-IL-1 treatment.Results: The average duration of canakinumab use was 23.9 months (min:12, max:58 months). Twelve patients were M694V homozygotes. Eleven patients achieved complete remission after the first dose at 2 months and 12 patients at 6 months. Canakinumab interval was shortened in 2 patients from 150 mg/8 weeks to 150 mg/4 weeks. Except one, 14 patients achieved complete remission by 12 months. Two patients had mild urinary tract infections. One patient had bronchopneumonia requiring hospitalization. Two patients had teeth abscess. There were no serious adverse events such as opportunistic infections, malignancies, or deaths. Besides, no significant laboratory abnormalities occurred in complete blood count parameters, liver and kidney function tests.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest outcome study about canakinumab use in paediatric FMF patients. This study suggested that canakinumab is safe and effective in children with FMF in the long term.",

Early studies reported colchicine as a potential drug for preventing attacks of familial Mediterranean fever. For those people who are colchicine-resistant or intolerant, drugs such as rilonacept, anakinra, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, thalidomide and interferon-alpha might be beneficial. This is an updated version of the review. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in people with familial Mediterranean fever. SEARCH METHODS: We used detailed search strategies to search the following databases: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM); China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI); Wan Fang; and VIP. In addition, we also searched the clinical trials registries including ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, as well as references listed in relevant reports.Date of last search: 21 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) of people diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever, comparing active interventions (including colchicine, anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, thalidomide, interferon-alpha, ImmunoGuard  (a herbal dietary supplement) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) with placebo or no treatment, or comparing active drugs to each other. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled data to present the risk ratio or mean difference with their 95% confidence intervals. We assessed overall evidence quality according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with a total of 249 participants (aged three to 53 years); five were of cross-over and four of parallel design. Six studies used oral colchicine, one used oral ImmunoGuard  and the remaining two used rilonacept or anakinra as a subcutaneous injection. The duration of each study arm ranged from one to eight months.The three studies of ImmunoGuard , rilonacept and anakinra were generally well-designed, except for an unclear risk of detection bias in one of these. However, some inadequacy existed in the four older studies on colchicine, which had an unclear risk of selection bias, detection bias and reporting bias, and also a high risk of attrition bias and other potential bias. Neither of the two studies comparing a single to a divided dose of colchicine were adequately blinded, furthermore one study had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias, a high risk of attrition bias and other potential bias.We aimed to report on the number of participants experiencing an attack, the timing of attacks, the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis, any adverse drug reactions and the response of a number of biochemical markers from the acute phase of an attack, but data were not available for all outcomes across all comparisons.One study (15 participants) reported a significant reduction in the number of people experiencing attacks at three months with 0.6 mg colchicine three times daily (14% versus 100%), risk ratio 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.95) (low-quality evidence). A further study (22 participants) of 0.5 mg colchicine twice daily showed no significant reduction in the number of participants experiencing attacks at two months (low-quality evidence). A study of rilonacept in individuals who were colchicine-resistant or intolerant (14 participants) also showed no reduction at three months (moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, a study of anakinra given to colchicine-resistant people (25 participants) showed no reduction in the number of participants experiencing an attack at four months (moderate-quality evidence).Three studies reported no significant differences in duration of attacks: one comparing colchicine to placebo (15 participants) (very low-quality evidence); one comparing single-dose colchicine to divided-dose colchicine (90 participants) (moderate-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence). Three studies reported no significant differences in the number of days between attacks: two comparing colchicine to placebo (24 participants in total) (very low-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence).No study reported on the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis.One study of colchicine reported loose stools and frequent bowel movements (very low-quality evidence) and a second reported diarrhoea (very low-quality evidence). The rilonacept study reported no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, headache, respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions and herpes, compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). The ImmunoGuard study observed no side effects (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study reported no significant differences between intervention and placebo, including injection site reaction, headache, presyncope, dyspnea and itching (moderate-quality evidence). When comparing single and divided doses of colchicine, one study reported no difference in adverse events (including anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and elevated liver enzymes) between groups (moderate-quality evidence) and the second study reported no adverse effects were detected.The rilonacept study reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after three months (low-quality evidence). In the ImmunoGuard  study, these indicators were not reduced after one month of treatment (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study, reported that C-reactive protein was significantly reduced after four months (moderate-quality evidence). One of the single dose versus divided dose colchicine studies reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after eight months (low-quality evidence), while the second study reported no significant reduction in serum amyloid A concentration after six months (moderate-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There were limited RCTs assessing interventions for people with familial Mediterranean fever. Based on the evidence, three times daily colchicine appears to reduce the number of people experiencing attacks, colchicine single dose and divided dose might not be different for children with familial Mediterranean fever and anakinra might reduce C-reactive protein in colchicine-resistant participants; however, only a few RCTs contributed data for analysis. Further RCTs examining active interventions, not only colchicine, are necessary before a comprehensive conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in familial Mediterranean fever can be drawn.",

Three studies reported no significant differences in the number of days between attacks: two comparing colchicine to placebo (24 participants in total) (very low-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence).No study reported on the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis.One study of colchicine reported loose stools and frequent bowel movements (very low-quality evidence) and a second reported diarrhoea (very low-quality evidence). The rilonacept study reported no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, headache, respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions and herpes, compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). The ImmunoGuard study observed no side effects (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study reported no significant differences between intervention and placebo, including injection site reaction, headache, presyncope, dyspnea and itching (moderate-quality evidence). When comparing single and divided doses of colchicine, one study reported no difference in adverse events (including anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and elevated liver enzymes) between groups (moderate-quality evidence) and the second study reported no adverse effects were detected.The rilonacept study reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after three months (low-quality evidence). In the ImmunoGuard  study, these indicators were not reduced after one month of treatment (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study, reported that C-reactive protein was significantly reduced after four months (moderate-quality evidence). One of the single dose versus divided dose colchicine studies reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after eight months (low-quality evidence), while the second study reported no significant reduction in serum amyloid A concentration after six months (moderate-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There were limited RCTs assessing interventions for people with familial Mediterranean fever. Based on the evidence, three times daily colchicine appears to reduce the number of people experiencing attacks, colchicine single dose and divided dose might not be different for children with familial Mediterranean fever and anakinra might reduce C-reactive protein in colchicine-resistant participants; however, only a few RCTs contributed data for analysis. Further RCTs examining active interventions, not only colchicine, are necessary before a comprehensive conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in familial Mediterranean fever can be drawn.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever, a hereditary auto-inflammatory disease, mainly affects ethnic groups living in the Mediterranean region. Early studies reported colchicine as a potential drug for preventing attacks of familial Mediterranean fever. For those people who are colchicine-resistant or intolerant, drugs such as rilonacept, anakinra, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, thalidomide and interferon-alpha might be beneficial. This is an updated version of the review. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in people with familial Mediterranean fever. SEARCH METHODS: We used detailed search strategies to search the following databases: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM); China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI); Wan Fang; and VIP. In addition, we also searched the clinical trials registries including ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, as well as references listed in relevant reports.Date of last search: 21 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) of people diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever, comparing active interventions (including colchicine, anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, thalidomide, interferon-alpha, ImmunoGuard  (a herbal dietary supplement) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) with placebo or no treatment, or comparing active drugs to each other. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled data to present the risk ratio or mean difference with their 95% confidence intervals. We assessed overall evidence quality according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with a total of 249 participants (aged three to 53 years); five were of cross-over and four of parallel design. Six studies used oral colchicine, one used oral ImmunoGuard  and the remaining two used rilonacept or anakinra as a subcutaneous injection. The duration of each study arm ranged from one to eight months.The three studies of ImmunoGuard , rilonacept and anakinra were generally well-designed, except for an unclear risk of detection bias in one of these. However, some inadequacy existed in the four older studies on colchicine, which had an unclear risk of selection bias, detection bias and reporting bias, and also a high risk of attrition bias and other potential bias. Neither of the two studies comparing a single to a divided dose of colchicine were adequately blinded, furthermore one study had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias, a high risk of attrition bias and other potential bias.We aimed to report on the number of participants experiencing an attack, the timing of attacks, the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis, any adverse drug reactions and the response of a number of biochemical markers from the acute phase of an attack, but data were not available for all outcomes across all comparisons.One study (15 participants) reported a significant reduction in the number of people experiencing attacks at three months with 0.6 mg colchicine three times daily (14% versus 100%), risk ratio 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.95) (low-quality evidence). A further study (22 participants) of 0.5 mg colchicine twice daily showed no significant reduction in the number of participants experiencing attacks at two months (low-quality evidence). A study of rilonacept in individuals who were colchicine-resistant or intolerant (14 participants) also showed no reduction at three months (moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, a study of anakinra given to colchicine-resistant people (25 participants) showed no reduction in the number of participants experiencing an attack at four months (moderate-quality evidence).Three studies reported no significant differences in duration of attacks: one comparing colchicine to placebo (15 participants) (very low-quality evidence); one comparing single-dose colchicine to divided-dose colchicine (90 participants) (moderate-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence). Three studies reported no significant differences in the number of days between attacks: two comparing colchicine to placebo (24 participants in total) (very low-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence).No study reported on the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis.One study of colchicine reported loose stools and frequent bowel movements (very low-quality evidence) and a second reported diarrhoea (very low-quality evidence). The rilonacept study reported no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, headache, respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions and herpes, compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). The ImmunoGuard study observed no side effects (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study reported no significant differences between intervention and placebo, including injection site reaction, headache, presyncope, dyspnea and itching (moderate-quality evidence). When comparing single and divided doses of colchicine, one study reported no difference in adverse events (including anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and elevated liver enzymes) between groups (moderate-quality evidence) and the second study reported no adverse effects were detected.The rilonacept study reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after three months (low-quality evidence).

                    "abstract": "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is an autoinflammatory disease characterised by fever and arthritis. We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl hospitalised with fever associated with rash, myalgia, arthralgia and polyarticular involvement. Examinations revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Bone marrow biopsy showed polyclonal leukocyte activation. A genetic study revealed a heterozygous mutation of the MEFV gene, c.442G>C (E148Q), which is typical of familial Mediterranean fever. However, the genetic pattern was not associated with a history of recurrent fever, aphthous ulcers of the mouth, abdominal pain, arthralgia and rash. Therefore, a diagnosis of sJIA was made. The patient did not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids improved biochemical examinations; however, AST, ALT, GGT and glycaemia remained elevated and adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment became evident and therefore corticosteroids were withdrawn. Canakinumab (150 mg/4 weeks subcutaneously) was initiated. Biochemical data returned to normal values and clinical symptoms resolved. After 2.5 years of canakinumab treatment, complete disease remission allowed the prolongation of intervals between doses. When the intervals were longer than 10 weeks we discontinued the treatment. The patient is still in remission 2 years after canakinumab withdrawal.",

He suffered recurrent migratory polyarthritis starting from bilateral knees to his right elbow. Certain antibiotic therapies appeared to improve his symptoms, but the symptoms recurred due to the migratory nature of arthritis. A diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was considered and diagnostic tests were performed. Not many differential diagnoses exist for migratory polyarthritis, particularly when it has a recurrent nature. The administration of antibiotics without sufficient diagnostic consideration can cause a delay in making an accurate diagnosis and thereby also cause a delay in administering appropriate treatment.",

Aim of this study was to evaluate the success of the standardized treatment protocol for canakinumab applied in our Pediatric Rheumatology Department in colchicine-resistant FMF cases with a review of the literature. Nine patients included in this study had indications for canakinumab use as colchicine resistance and recurrent corticosteroid need for pleural/pericardial effusions. Canakinumab was administered monthly for 6 months (initial treatment), bimonthly for 6 months (maintenance treatment), then treatment was discontinued. For the patients who developed a new attack after one-year treatment period, canakinumab was readministered with 3-month intervals (continuation treatment). The mean follow-up time beginning from the first canakinumab injection was 24.3 +- 10.2 (6-33) months. None of the patients had an attack during the first-year treatment. Four of the patients developed an attack 9.0 +- 2.9 (6-12) months after discontinuation of treatment and switched to the continuation treatment period, with no more attacks.

                    "abstract": "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is an autoinflammatory disease characterised by fever and arthritis. We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl hospitalised with fever associated with rash, myalgia, arthralgia and polyarticular involvement. Examinations revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Bone marrow biopsy showed polyclonal leukocyte activation. A genetic study revealed a heterozygous mutation of the MEFV gene, c.442G>C (E148Q), which is typical of familial Mediterranean fever. However, the genetic pattern was not associated with a history of recurrent fever, aphthous ulcers of the mouth, abdominal pain, arthralgia and rash. Therefore, a diagnosis of sJIA was made. The patient did not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids improved biochemical examinations; however, AST, ALT, GGT and glycaemia remained elevated and adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment became evident and therefore corticosteroids were withdrawn. Canakinumab (150 mg/4 weeks subcutaneously) was initiated. Biochemical data returned to normal values and clinical symptoms resolved. After 2.5 years of canakinumab treatment, complete disease remission allowed the prolongation of intervals between doses. When the intervals were longer than 10 weeks we discontinued the treatment. The patient is still in remission 2 years after canakinumab withdrawal.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Patients, suffering from inflammatory disorders, are at an increased risk to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we examine whether in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a model of inflammatory diseases, inflammation also increases the risk to develop cardiovascular (CV) disease. METHODS: To explore the role of inflammation in the occurrence of CVD in FMF, we identified all FMF patients <=55 years old with CVD, admitted to our center over a 15-year period. Correlates of inflammation, such as severity of FMF and dose of colchicine, as well as the presence of traditional CV risk factors were compared between the FMF patients with CVD (FMF- CVD) and control FMF patients with- out CVD. RESULTS: Twenty-three FMF-CVD and 40 control patients were compared. The severity of FMF, and the dose of colchicine, were similar in the 2 study groups; therefore, not associated with CVD. Compared with FMF patients without CVD, the FMF-CVD group comprised a higher proportion of men (78 vs. 40% p=0.005), and of patients with diabetes (31 vs. 7%, p=0.016) and inflammatory comorbidities such as Behcet's disease (30 vs. 7%, p=0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that only diabetes mellitus and inflammatory comorbidities were independent factors associated with FMF-CVD. CONCLUSIONS: In FMF patients treated with colchicine, CVD is not associated with FMF-related inflammation.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Articular involvement in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) ranges between 40 and 70% of the patients. Involvement of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in FMF is very rare, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. There are no specific guidelines for treatment. We hereby present a new treatment for TMJ inflammation in FMF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed according to the following criteria: key terms included in the search were FMF arthritis, TMJ involvement in FMF patients, and arthroscopy in FMF patients. All keywords were included both as medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and text words. Selections were limited to the English language. RESULTS: Literature search yielded four reported cases of TMJ involvement in FMF patients. The four cases were treated differently, with no clear guidelines for management of TMJ involvement. Our patient suffered from painful swelling and redness over the involved TMJ area and severe trismus. She was treated by arthroscopic lysis and lavage of her TMJ followed by aggressive physiotherapy resulting to improvement of her mouth opening. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse effect of TMJ arthritis in FMF patients can be avascular necrosis and destruction of the mandibular condylar head. TMJ arthroscopy allows lysis and lavage of the joint with minimal operative and postoperative complication, resulting with satisfactory results. Thus, in case of TMJ arthritis in FMF, we recommend TMJ arthroscopy as soon as possible, following aggressive physiotherapy in order to gain normal mouth opening. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: FMF rates have been described among the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern population ranging from 1:5 to 1:3; thus, TMJ involvement due to the disease is not so rare in this region, and a clear treatment protocol is needed.",

Approximately 10-15% of the patients are either intolerant or have an insufficient response to colchicine treatment. The most promising alternative treatment approach is anti-IL-1 agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-IL-1 therapy in FMF amyloidosis. METHODS: Forty-four patients with amyloidosis who had been treated with anti-IL-1 agents, anakinra and/or canakinumab, were assessed retrospectively for efficacy and safety. Five patients were on haemodialysis and four had received a renal transplant. RESULTS: The mean duration of anti-IL-1 treatment was 21.4  (18) months. Among 35 patients who were not on dialysis, renal function was maintained or improved in 79.4% but deteriorated in 20.6%. Patients with creatinine levels below 1.5 mg/dl at onset benefitted more from IL-1 inhibition with regard to their kidney functions and acute phase reactants. No additional side effects were observed in patients with renal replacement treatments. The major side effect of anakinra was injection-site reaction observed in four patients.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review presents a modern perspective on the cardiovascular re-purposing of colchicine, the oldest drug in the pharmacopeia other than aspirin that is still in regular use. METHODS: This article presents a brief overview of colchicine's long history as a medicine, as well as a critical review of safety and efficacy from the results of recent cardiovascular clinical trials. FINDINGS: Long-term continuous colchicine use at doses between 0.6 and 2.4 mg has been used to prevent inflammatory flares in patients with gout and familial Mediterranean fever and less commonly employed in a range of other inflammatory conditions. In these settings, lifelong therapy has been found to be safe and well tolerated. Understanding the central role of inflammation in atherosclerosis has led to the search for effective anti-inflammatory agents that can be used continuously in combination with a range of other medications, including lipid-lowering therapies, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulants. The results of recent robust randomized clinical trials of low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) in patients with coronary disease recently led the US Food and Drug Administration to approve its use as a new cornerstone therapy for secondary prevention in patients with coronary disease. Several misconceptions regarding the safety and tolerability of low dose colchicine are addressed. IMPLICATIONS: Colchicine has emerged from its traditional role in medicine as the prevention of gout flare as the first anti-inflammatory agent to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of severe infections in rheumatic patients receiving biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) after kidney transplantation. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 38 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation and received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Severe infections were defined as those requiring hospitalization, and the incidence of severe infections was calculated per 100 patient years. Risk factors for severe infections were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients (median age 40.5 years), 52.6% experienced severe infections, with a total of 39 severe infection episodes. The incidence of severe infections was 26.2 per 100 patient-years. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (43.5%) and pneumonia (30.8%). Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was the most common rheumatic disease (57.9%), and the median disease duration was 18.5 years. Most patients (68.4%) were using IL-1 inhibitors, and 31.6% were on anti-TNF therapy. There was no significant difference between patients with and without infections in terms of gender, pre-transplant biological therapy use, or type of biological therapy used. Four patients (11%) died from infection-related complications, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic patients receiving bDMARDs post-kidney transplantation have a high risk of severe infections. The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk, necessitating close infection monitoring and management. Key Points   Rheumatic patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) following kidney transplantation face a heightened risk of severe infections.   The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk.   Individualized treatment strategies are essential to balance the benefits of bDMARDs with the potential for severe infectious complications.",

A diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was considered and diagnostic tests were performed.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by periodic febrile attacks of aseptic serositis and/or arthritis. The main treatment is colchicine which prevents attacks in the majority of patients except for a group of colchicine-resistant cases. Chronic hepatitis C is a viral infection causing chronic inflammation of liver tissue (hepatitis) which ultimately progresses to fibrosis and liver cirrhosis with a high chance of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, we found no data in the literature concerning the impact of hepatitis C on the course of attacks of familial Mediterranean fever. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 21-year-old white woman with familial Mediterranean fever who had not been responding to a high dose of colchicine (2 mg/day). She presented to our clinic with a finding of chronic hepatitis C genotype 3 infection. After successful antiviral therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin, she became attack-free for 2 years and went on to a lower dose of colchicine. CONCLUSIONS: This unusual case illustrates complete resolution of attacks of autoinflammatory disease after drug-induced clearance of chronic hepatitis C infection. Coexisting infections should be viewed as potentially altering the course of autoinflammatory disorders, and any attempt to cure the infections should be made in order to gain an added value of benefiting the chronic disease. This case highlights the interrelation of external pathogen-related and genetically inherited alterations in immunity and the importance of considering the whole spectrum of possible causative factors rather than implementing separate guidelines in order to achieve best quality of medical care in any given patient.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Articular involvement in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) ranges between 40 and 70% of the patients. Involvement of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in FMF is very rare, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. There are no specific guidelines for treatment. We hereby present a new treatment for TMJ inflammation in FMF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed according to the following criteria: key terms included in the search were FMF arthritis, TMJ involvement in FMF patients, and arthroscopy in FMF patients. All keywords were included both as medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and text words. Selections were limited to the English language. RESULTS: Literature search yielded four reported cases of TMJ involvement in FMF patients. The four cases were treated differently, with no clear guidelines for management of TMJ involvement. Our patient suffered from painful swelling and redness over the involved TMJ area and severe trismus. She was treated by arthroscopic lysis and lavage of her TMJ followed by aggressive physiotherapy resulting to improvement of her mouth opening. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse effect of TMJ arthritis in FMF patients can be avascular necrosis and destruction of the mandibular condylar head. TMJ arthroscopy allows lysis and lavage of the joint with minimal operative and postoperative complication, resulting with satisfactory results. Thus, in case of TMJ arthritis in FMF, we recommend TMJ arthroscopy as soon as possible, following aggressive physiotherapy in order to gain normal mouth opening. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: FMF rates have been described among the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern population ranging from 1:5 to 1:3; thus, TMJ involvement due to the disease is not so rare in this region, and a clear treatment protocol is needed.",

Involvement of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in FMF is very rare, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. There are no specific guidelines for treatment. We hereby present a new treatment for TMJ inflammation in FMF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed according to the following criteria: key terms included in the search were FMF arthritis, TMJ involvement in FMF patients, and arthroscopy in FMF patients. All keywords were included both as medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and text words. Selections were limited to the English language. RESULTS: Literature search yielded four reported cases of TMJ involvement in FMF patients. The four cases were treated differently, with no clear guidelines for management of TMJ involvement. Our patient suffered from painful swelling and redness over the involved TMJ area and severe trismus. She was treated by arthroscopic lysis and lavage of her TMJ followed by aggressive physiotherapy resulting to improvement of her mouth opening. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse effect of TMJ arthritis in FMF patients can be avascular necrosis and destruction of the mandibular condylar head. TMJ arthroscopy allows lysis and lavage of the joint with minimal operative and postoperative complication, resulting with satisfactory results. Thus, in case of TMJ arthritis in FMF, we recommend TMJ arthroscopy as soon as possible, following aggressive physiotherapy in order to gain normal mouth opening. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: FMF rates have been described among the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern population ranging from 1:5 to 1:3; thus, TMJ involvement due to the disease is not so rare in this region, and a clear treatment protocol is needed.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary auto-inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent fever and serosal inflammation. Anti-interleukin-1 (Anti-IL-1) treatments are recommended in colchicine resistant and/or intolerant FMF patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of anakinra and canakinumab in FMF patients that are resistant/intolareted to colchicine or complicated with amyloidosis. METHODS: Between January 2014 and March 2019, 65 patients following-up at Sivas Cumhuriyet University (Medical Faculty Rheumatology-Internal Medicine Department) who were diagnosed with FMF according to the criteria of Tel-Hashomer were included in the study. The laboratory values and clinical features of patients and disease activities were recorded at least every 3 months, and these data were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-one (63.1%) patients used anakinra (100 mg/day) and 24 (36.9%) patients used canakinumab (150 mg/8 week). The median duration of anti-IL-1 agents use was 7 months (range, 3-30). Fifteen (23.1%) cases were complicated with amyloidosis. Seven (10.8%) patients had renal transplantation. Overall, the FMF 50 score response was 96.9%. In the group that had a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 60 ml/min/m2, the median proteinuria decreased from 2390 mg/day (range, 1400-7200) to 890 mg/day (range, 120-2750) (p = 0.008). No serious infections were detected, except in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-IL-1 agents are effective and safe in the treatment of FMF patients. These agents are particularly effective at reducing proteinuria in patients with GFR >= 60 ml/min/m2, but less effective in cases with FMF associated with arthritis and sacroiliitis. Large and long follow-up studies are now needed to establish the long-term effects of these treatments.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a monogenic autoinflammatory disease, and colchicine is the mainstay of treatment. Approximately 5%-10% of patients may respond inadequately to colchicine, and anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) agents are important treatment options in these patients. The aim of this study was to see whether there is any factor associated with the withdrawal of these anti-IL-1 agents and to investigate the characteristics of colchicine-resistant FMF patients who needed biological therapy. METHODS: Demographic, clinical characteristics, and disease severity of patients, at 2 referral centers, between 2012 and 2022, in whom anti-IL-1 treatment was continued and discontinued, were compared in this study. The international severity scoring system for FMF (ISSF) was used for disease severity assessment. RESULTS: In 64 colchicine-resistant FMF patients, the median (interquartile range) duration of biological treatment was 39 (45) months. Treatment of 26 patients (40.6%) was started with anakinra and 38 (59.4%) with canakinumab. During follow-up, anti-IL-1 treatment was discontinued in 23 patients (35.9%). High ISSF scores before biological treatment, presence of exertional leg pain, subclinical inflammation, and comorbidity were found to be statistically more frequent in the group whose biological therapy could not be discontinued (p = 0.009, p = 0.006, p = 0.026, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low ISSF scores before biological treatment with no accompanying exertional leg pain, subclinical inflammation, and comorbidities may be stated as an associated factors in terms of the discontinuation of biological agents in colchicine-resistant pediatric FMF patients.",

METHODS: We used electronic medical records to obtain data about the total number of the insured population and the number of FMF patients in the two largest health management organizations in Jerusalem, Clalit and Meuhedet. The total number of COVID-19 inpatients at the Hadassah Medical Center, including those with FMF, for the period between 1 February 2020 and 10March 2021, was retrieved from the electronic medical records of Hadassah. COVID-19 course was compared between the FMF inpatient group and age-, sex-, ethnicity- and comorbidity-matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. Each FMF inpatient was matched with two non-FMF controls. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference in the odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 between FMF patients and the non-FMF population (0.46% vs 0.41%, P = 0.73). Furthermore, we found similar disease severity and therapeutic approach in FMF COVID-19 inpatients and matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Neither FMF nor baseline colchicine therapy, appear to affect the incidence of hospitalization for COVID-19 or the disease course, in terms of severity and therapeutic approach.",

Our aim was to study on a large cohort of European FMF patients the frequency and associated factors of diagnosis delay. Clinical data were extracted from the Juvenile Inflammatory Rheumatism (JIR)-cohort. All FMF patients fulfilled Livneh Criteria and had been sequenced for MEFV exon 10. FMF-diagnostic delay (d-FMF) was defined as the duration between the onset of the symptoms and the diagnosis of more than 10 years. 960 FMF patients were enrolled: delayed diagnosis (d-FMF) was noted in 200 patients (20%). d-FMF patients were significantly older compared to non d-FMF with a median age of 46.4 years old vs. 15.5 (p < 0.0001). Women displayed more d-FMF compared to men (56 vs. 47%, p = 0.03). Clinical presentation during attacks was not statistically significant except for erysipelas-like erythema, which was higher among d-FMF patients (33 vs. 22%, p = 0.0003). The presence of one or two pathogenic MEFV mutation was not different between patients. Compared to other FMF, d-FMF patients displayed significantly more AA amyloidosis (10 vs. 2.6%, p < 0.0001) and received more biotherapy (18 vs. 3.8%, p < 0.0001). Twenty percent of FMF patients had a diagnostic delay >10 years, including more women. The differential diagnosis of abdominal attacks with menstrual pain may be an explanation, and erysipelas-like erythema may not be recognized as FMF by all practitioners.",

METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with genetically confirmed colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, or TRAPS at the time of a flare to receive 150 mg of canakinumab subcutaneously or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients who did not have a resolution of their flare received an add-on injection of 150 mg of canakinumab. The primary outcome was complete response (resolution of flare and no flare until week 16). In the subsequent phase up to week 40, patients who had a complete response underwent a second randomization to receive canakinumab or placebo every 8 weeks. Patients who underwent a second randomization and had a subsequent flare and all other patients received open-label canakinumab. RESULTS: At week 16, significantly more patients receiving canakinumab had a complete response than those receiving placebo: 61% vs. 6% of patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever (P<0.001), 35% versus 6% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency (P=0.003), and 45% versus 8% of those with TRAPS (P=0.006). The inclusion of patients whose dose was increased to 300 mg every 4 weeks yielded a complete response in 71% of those with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 57% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 73% of those with TRAPS. After week 16, an extended dosing regimen (every 8 weeks) maintained disease control in 46% of patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 23% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 53% of those with TRAPS. Among patients who received canakinumab, the most frequently reported adverse events were infections (173.3, 313.5, and 148.0 per 100 patient-years among patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and those with TRAPS, respectively), with a few being serious infections (6.6, 13.7, and 0.0 per 100 patient-years). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, canakinumab was effective in controlling and preventing flares in patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, and TRAPS.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeted at interleukin-1 beta, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in preventing familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) attacks among individuals with colchicine-resistant (crFMF). The manufacturer orders prescribe monthly subcutaneous injections. However, a subset of our patients is treated with an \"canakinumab on demand \" (COD) strategy, with wider intervals between drug administrations. Therefore, we aimed to compare disease activity and drug safety between COD and \"canakinumab fixed frequency\" (CFF) policies. METHODS: This retrospective study collected data from three Israeli paediatric rheumatology centres, of children with crFMF who were treated with canakinumab. Epidemiological and clinical parameters, cumulative drug dosages, and adverse events were compared between children treated by both policies. RESULTS: Twenty-five (49 %) children were treated according to COD policy and 26 according to CFF policy. Demographic parameters and most of the disease features did not differ significantly between the groups. Both groups showed significant reduction in attacks after canakinumab introduction. The median number (interquartile range) of attacks per month did not differ significantly between the COD and CFF groups (0.33 (0.08, 0.58) and 0.13 (0, 0.5), respectively, p = 0.485 (even though, per definition, COD patients presumably had an attack before receiving the second canakinumab dose). The mean monthly dose was lower for the COD than the CFF group (1.13 +- 1.13 vs. 3.16 +- 1.46 mg/kg, p < 0.001). Adverse events were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: For individuals with crFMF, COD compared to CFF policy can achieve similar efficacy and safety, with a lower accumulated canakinumab dose, rendering it less immunosuppressive and less expensive.",

                    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an important and preventable cause of chronic kidney disease due to secondary amyloidosis. Although colchicine is the first-line therapy in patients with FMF with 60% to 65% complete remission rates, 5% to 10% of patients are colchicine-resistant and 5% to 10% of them are intolerant to the therapy. Anti-interleukin-1 agents, such as anakinra and canakinumab, are safe and efficient therapeutic options in patients with colchicine resistance or intolerance. However, the data on management of these targeted agents is limited in recipients of kidney transplant (RKT). In this case series, we aim to share our experience on canakinumab therapy of 4 RKTs with FMF-related amyloidosis, who were followed up in our clinic between 2010 and 2017. All of the 4 patients with end-stage renal disease were colchicine- resistant and on other alternative therapies, which provided poor disease control. For efficient control of secondary amyloidosis, canakinumab therapy was initiated in 1 of the patients before the renal transplant, and for the remaining patients after renal transplant. Any serious adverse effect, development of proteinuria, or graft dysfunction has not been observed in any of the patients. Under the canakinumab treatment, complete clinical responses, prevent typical familial Mediterranean fever attacks with fever and arthritis and abdominal pain, normalized serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels were achieved in all patients. Canakinumab treatment is a safe and effective therapeutic option for RKTs with FMF who are resistant or intolerant to colchicine and anakinra.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the differences in attack characteristics, acute-phase reactants, and renal outcomes in patients using canakinumab with or without colchicine treatment. METHODS: FMF patients treated with canakinumab for >= 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. Patients unable to continue colchicine for various reasons were identified and grouped as those receiving the canakinumab + colchicine combination (CAN + CLC) and canakinumab monotherapy (CANmono). Attack frequency, C-reactive protein (CRP), urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR), and kidney function tests were recorded before and after canakinumab treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients receiving canakinumab treatment were included in the study. Thirty-one patients (56.4%) used CAN + CLC and 24 (43.6%) CANmono. With both CAN + CLC and CANmono treatment, there was no significant change in UPCR of patient groups with GFR > 60 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis was present in 21 (38.2%) patients. In patients with AA amyloidosis receiving CAN + CLC, there was a nonsignificant decrease in UPCR and increased creatinine levels after treatment (p = 0.214 and p = 0.051, respectively). Median GFR decreased significantly from 69 (IQR, mg/dl, 45-95) to 44 (IQR, mg/dl, 28-75) with CAN + CLC treatment (p = 0.021). In the CANmono group, compared to baseline values, there was no significant change in posttreatment UPCR, serum creatinine, and GFR values. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to make a recommendation regarding the discontinuation or continuation of colchicine treatment in all FMF patients who initiated anti-IL-1 treatment. Canakinumab can be continued as monotherapy in patients who cannot continue colchicine treatment due to side effects and patient noncompliance.",

Pat.1 is a 32y at 20 weeks of gestation with acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome and history of familial Mediterranean fever. Case 2 is a 23y with cirrhotic kidneys, stage 5 of chronic kidney disease and dialysis treatment 3 x a week. The pregnancy was an incidental finding. Pat. 3 is a 29y I/0 with history of renal transplantation years ago. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: In pat. 1a renal biopsy confirmed the suspected diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Due to deterioration of the kidney function, she required dialysis up to 6 x a week. In Case 2 the dialysis increased to 6 x a week as well. In both patients, we indicated delivery at 35 weeks of gestational age. Pat. 3 delivered at term without complications. CONCLUSION: A close interdisciplinary cooperation improves neonatal outcome in pregnant women with CKD. Counseling and risk assessment of these patients should be initiated before pregnancy. The care of these high-risk pregnancies needs to be performed at a tertiary care center with the above-mentioned specialists.",

METHODS: Sixty-four of 1786 children with FMF in whom colchicine was stopped by the physician or patients/parents were enrolled. These patients were grouped as children who were in need of colchicine due to attacks and/or elevated acute phase reactants after cessation of colchicine (group 1) and children in whom colchicine was not necessary and not restarted (group 2). RESULTS: Colchicine was stopped in 59.4% by the physician and in 40.6% by the patient/parents. It was ceased at a median of 10.6 years of age (range 2.1-20.5) and attack- and inflammation-free periods of 18.2 months (range 6-148). The median follow-up of 64 patients after colchicine cessation was 37.4 months (range 6.4-154.7). It was restarted in 17 patients due to attacks (n = 11) or elevated acute phase reactants (n = 6). The age at cessation of the colchicine was lower (P = 0.04) and the duration of colchicine treatment until its cessation was shorter (P = 0.007) in group 1 compared with group 2. CONCLUSION: Life-long colchicine treatment may not be required in all FMF patients. There are no current guidelines to determine in which patients it is safe to stop colchicine.

We aimed to analyze the incidence and clinical characteristics of immediate type I (IgE/non-IgE) hypersensitivity reactions to BD and the risk factors for these reactions. METHODS: Children with rheumatic diseases using BD who were evaluated in the pediatric allergy department for possible drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) due to BD or any other drug were included in the study. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight children (49.2% boys; 14.6 years [9.9-16.9 years] with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [58%], familial Mediterranean fever [14%], vasculitis [14%], and other diseases [14%]) had used eight different BD with 32 494 infusions/injections. Fifteen patients were evaluated for DHR [injection-site reactions [n = 4], adverse events [n = 2], drug hypersensitivity other than BD [n = 3], and immediate BD hypersensitivity [n = 6]). The incidence of immediate BD HSR was 4.7%, with a clinical presentation of anaphylaxis in 3.9% (tocilizumab [n = 3], rituximab [n = 2], positive skin test with culprit BD [n = 3]). Among patients with BD HSR, the median follow-up was longer (84.5 vs 54 months, P = .048), and renal (33.3% vs 4.1%, P = .002), hematologic involvement (16.7% vs 0, P < .001), and active disease (83.3% vs 13.9%, P < .001) were more common. Logistic regression analysis revealed that renal involvement, more than 14 hospitalizations per lifetime, and more than two different BD used were associated with BD hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: The frequency of severe immediate HSR due to BD was shown to be 3.9% in children with rheumatic diseases. Children with active rheumatic disease and who have exposure to multiple BD should be monitored for BD HSR, particularly during intravenous BD infusions.",

It is a potentially fatal complication.  Renal involvement is the most common manifestation of AAA. Pregnancy in women with chronic kidney disease  is considered to be at risk for specific pregnancy complications and the worsening of their underlying renal dysfunction. Our aim was to report pregnancy in our AAA patients and discuss the outcome through a literature review. METHODS: French cases were identified through the Reference Center for Auto-Inflammatory Diseases and Amyloidosis and a systematic literature review was performed. RESULTS: Three new patients were identified: two with Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and one with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome; one was under anakinra therapy and one had received a kidney transplantation before her pregnancy. One patient was diagnosed with AAA following the detection of post-partum nephrotic syndrome. Among the 27 patients from literature and our case, FMF was the main cause of AAA (69%). Eight of the patients were diagnosed with AAA during their pregnancy or in immediate post-partum and gestational complications appeared in 23/25 cases, mostly intrauterine growth retardation (n = 10), prematurity (n = 11) and preeclampsia (n = 4). No bleeding complication was reported. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy can occur in patients (eight overall) with AAA and the diagnosis is frequently made during pregnancy. Pregnant women with AAA are at risk for adverse pregnancy-associated outcomes and require special and closer monitoring.",

                    "title": "Interventions for reducing inflammation in familial Mediterranean fever.",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever, a hereditary auto-inflammatory disease, mainly affects ethnic groups living in the Mediterranean region. Early studies reported colchicine as a potential drug for preventing attacks of familial Mediterranean fever. For those people who are colchicine-resistant or intolerant, drugs such as rilonacept, anakinra, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, thalidomide and interferon-alpha might be beneficial. This is an updated version of the review. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in people with familial Mediterranean fever. SEARCH METHODS: We used detailed search strategies to search the following databases: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM); China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI); Wan Fang; and VIP. In addition, we also searched the clinical trials registries including ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, as well as references listed in relevant reports.Date of last search: 21 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) of people diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever, comparing active interventions (including colchicine, anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, thalidomide, interferon-alpha, ImmunoGuard  (a herbal dietary supplement) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) with placebo or no treatment, or comparing active drugs to each other. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled data to present the risk ratio or mean difference with their 95% confidence intervals. We assessed overall evidence quality according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with a total of 249 participants (aged three to 53 years); five were of cross-over and four of parallel design. Six studies used oral colchicine, one used oral ImmunoGuard  and the remaining two used rilonacept or anakinra as a subcutaneous injection. The duration of each study arm ranged from one to eight months.The three studies of ImmunoGuard , rilonacept and anakinra were generally well-designed, except for an unclear risk of detection bias in one of these. However, some inadequacy existed in the four older studies on colchicine, which had an unclear risk of selection bias, detection bias and reporting bias, and also a high risk of attrition bias and other potential bias. Neither of the two studies comparing a single to a divided dose of colchicine were adequately blinded, furthermore one study had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias, a high risk of attrition bias and other potential bias.We aimed to report on the number of participants experiencing an attack, the timing of attacks, the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis, any adverse drug reactions and the response of a number of biochemical markers from the acute phase of an attack, but data were not available for all outcomes across all comparisons.One study (15 participants) reported a significant reduction in the number of people experiencing attacks at three months with 0.6 mg colchicine three times daily (14% versus 100%), risk ratio 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.95) (low-quality evidence). A further study (22 participants) of 0.5 mg colchicine twice daily showed no significant reduction in the number of participants experiencing attacks at two months (low-quality evidence). A study of rilonacept in individuals who were colchicine-resistant or intolerant (14 participants) also showed no reduction at three months (moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, a study of anakinra given to colchicine-resistant people (25 participants) showed no reduction in the number of participants experiencing an attack at four months (moderate-quality evidence).Three studies reported no significant differences in duration of attacks: one comparing colchicine to placebo (15 participants) (very low-quality evidence); one comparing single-dose colchicine to divided-dose colchicine (90 participants) (moderate-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence). Three studies reported no significant differences in the number of days between attacks: two comparing colchicine to placebo (24 participants in total) (very low-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence).No study reported on the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis.One study of colchicine reported loose stools and frequent bowel movements (very low-quality evidence) and a second reported diarrhoea (very low-quality evidence). The rilonacept study reported no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, headache, respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions and herpes, compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). The ImmunoGuard study observed no side effects (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study reported no significant differences between intervention and placebo, including injection site reaction, headache, presyncope, dyspnea and itching (moderate-quality evidence). When comparing single and divided doses of colchicine, one study reported no difference in adverse events (including anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and elevated liver enzymes) between groups (moderate-quality evidence) and the second study reported no adverse effects were detected.The rilonacept study reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after three months (low-quality evidence). In the ImmunoGuard  study, these indicators were not reduced after one month of treatment (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study, reported that C-reactive protein was significantly reduced after four months (moderate-quality evidence). One of the single dose versus divided dose colchicine studies reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after eight months (low-quality evidence), while the second study reported no significant reduction in serum amyloid A concentration after six months (moderate-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There were limited RCTs assessing interventions for people with familial Mediterranean fever. Based on the evidence, three times daily colchicine appears to reduce the number of people experiencing attacks, colchicine single dose and divided dose might not be different for children with familial Mediterranean fever and anakinra might reduce C-reactive protein in colchicine-resistant participants; however, only a few RCTs contributed data for analysis. Further RCTs examining active interventions, not only colchicine, are necessary before a comprehensive conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in familial Mediterranean fever can be drawn.",

                    "abstract": "Autoinflammatory disorders (AIDs) are a subgroup of immune-mediated syndromes that result from a primary dysfunction of the innate immune system. AIDs can be either monogenic or polygenic diseases. Unlike organspecific AIDs, systemic AIDs are characterized by fever and/or elevation of acute-phase reactants. This review aims to describe the most common adult-onset systemic AIDs, focusing mostly on polygenic and mixed-pattern diseases which are expected to be more prevalent in adult patients than monogenic AIDs overall. The literature was searched in Medline database. Organ-specific or childhood-onset systemic AIDs were excluded. AIDs were divided in three distinct groups: mixed-pattern, polygenic and adult-onset monogenic AIDs. Most adult-onset AIDs are polygenic but late-onset disease is not rare among monogenic AIDs such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). The diagnosis of systemic AIDs in adults is often delayed due to several factors and sometimes it is only established when amyloidosis or other complications are present. Therefore, it probably makes sense to primarily exclude common AIDs in adult patients with fever of unknown origin (and probably different presentations such as polyserositis) since a high prevalence of adult-onset Still's disease or FMF is usually expected. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, immunosuppressive agents, interleukin-1 inhibitors and tumor necrosis factor antagonists constitute common therapeutic options for systemic AIDs.",

Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor blocker and a treatment option for patients with FMF. There is no reported rejection episode associated with the use of Anakinra in the literature. A fortynine years old woman with a history of kidney transplantation is described here. Anakinra was initiated in the patients whose FMF attacks were exacerbated, and the inflammation could not be controlled under the colchicine treatment. After eight months of follow up under Anakinra treatment, a moderate but persistent increase in serum creatinine level was observed. Allograft biopsy was compatible with acute T cell-mediated rejection with BANFF type 2A. Data on the use of Anakinra in KTRs is limited. Antidrug- antibodies or hapten induced T cell activation may facilitate late-onset acute T cell-mediated rejection in the patient who used Anakinra.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) has been a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been seen in COVID-19-infected subjects, and it has frequently resulted in an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Colchicine, an immunomodulatory drug, was used in several studies in the early stages of the pandemic. Colchicine has been shown to prevent the development of renal failure in patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). It has also been reported to reduce fibrosis, which plays a role in chronic kidney disease. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether using Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with better renal function in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised 118 out of 605 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. Some of the subjects (n = 50) received oral Colchicine plus standard care, called the Col ( +) group. The others (n = 68) received only the standard care, called the Col (-) group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other laboratory findings, including lymphocytes, D-dimer, and CRP, were analyzed. RESULTS: The D-dimer and serum creatine levels were significantly reduced in both groups. The number of lymphocytes showed a significant increase in both groups at discharge. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at admission. The reduction of SCr was considerably higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group. Similarly, the improvement of eGFR was higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at discharge and 6-12 mounts follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the use of Colchicine plus standard care was associated with improved renal function in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection.",

The overlap and sequence of signs/symptoms and the median time from first sign/symptom to AL amyloidosis diagnosis were explored. Healthcare utilization was summarized. The most common individual AL amyloidosis signs/symptoms were malaise/fatigue (61%) and dyspnea (59%). Cardiac signs/symptoms were observed in 77% of patients, followed by renal (62%) and neurologic (59%) signs/symptoms. Multisystem involvement (>=3 systems) was present in 54%. Monoclonal gammopathy was detected in 29% before diagnosis. Median time from symptom onset to AL amyloidosis diagnosis was 2.7 years.

But there are limited data about the effect of TCZ on frequency of attacks. In the current study, we aimed to find out whether TCZ therapy could decrease the frequency of recurrent attacks of FMF or not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The recorded files of 15 patients who had received intravenous TCZ for the improvement of amyloidosis associated with FMF, were evaluated retrospectively. Data of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were archived from those files. RESULTS: Three female and 12 male patients received TCZ due to amyloidosis were included to the study. The mean age was 42.07 +- 14.37 years. All of the patients were in full compliance with colchicine treatment. According to international severity scoring system for FMF, all of the patients had severe disease. The frequency of attacks recorded was evaluated during TCZ treatment, and it was reported that one patient had no response, six patients had decreased attack frequency and eight patients had no attacks. DISCUSSION: Tocilizumab is found to be efficient on improvement of amyloidosis and decreasing the frequency of recurrent attacks in patients with FMF. Besides, TCZ is well tolerated among the patients. Further and prospective studies with larger sample are needed to support these results.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of severe infections in rheumatic patients receiving biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) after kidney transplantation. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 38 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation and received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Severe infections were defined as those requiring hospitalization, and the incidence of severe infections was calculated per 100 patient years. Risk factors for severe infections were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients (median age 40.5 years), 52.6% experienced severe infections, with a total of 39 severe infection episodes. The incidence of severe infections was 26.2 per 100 patient-years. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (43.5%) and pneumonia (30.8%). Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was the most common rheumatic disease (57.9%), and the median disease duration was 18.5 years. Most patients (68.4%) were using IL-1 inhibitors, and 31.6% were on anti-TNF therapy. There was no significant difference between patients with and without infections in terms of gender, pre-transplant biological therapy use, or type of biological therapy used. Four patients (11%) died from infection-related complications, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic patients receiving bDMARDs post-kidney transplantation have a high risk of severe infections. The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk, necessitating close infection monitoring and management. Key Points   Rheumatic patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) following kidney transplantation face a heightened risk of severe infections.   The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk.   Individualized treatment strategies are essential to balance the benefits of bDMARDs with the potential for severe infectious complications.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review presents a modern perspective on the cardiovascular re-purposing of colchicine, the oldest drug in the pharmacopeia other than aspirin that is still in regular use. METHODS: This article presents a brief overview of colchicine's long history as a medicine, as well as a critical review of safety and efficacy from the results of recent cardiovascular clinical trials. FINDINGS: Long-term continuous colchicine use at doses between 0.6 and 2.4 mg has been used to prevent inflammatory flares in patients with gout and familial Mediterranean fever and less commonly employed in a range of other inflammatory conditions. In these settings, lifelong therapy has been found to be safe and well tolerated. Understanding the central role of inflammation in atherosclerosis has led to the search for effective anti-inflammatory agents that can be used continuously in combination with a range of other medications, including lipid-lowering therapies, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulants. The results of recent robust randomized clinical trials of low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) in patients with coronary disease recently led the US Food and Drug Administration to approve its use as a new cornerstone therapy for secondary prevention in patients with coronary disease. Several misconceptions regarding the safety and tolerability of low dose colchicine are addressed. IMPLICATIONS: Colchicine has emerged from its traditional role in medicine as the prevention of gout flare as the first anti-inflammatory agent to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis.",

                    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic auto-inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and serositis. Although colchicine is the first line treatment in FMF, 5-10% of patients do not respond to colchicine. Canakinumab, an anti-IL-1beta monoclonal antibody, has been reported to be effective and safe in colchicine-resistant FMF patients, but the adequate duration and interval of treatment is still a matter of debate. Aim of this study was to evaluate the success of the standardized treatment protocol for canakinumab applied in our Pediatric Rheumatology Department in colchicine-resistant FMF cases with a review of the literature. Nine patients included in this study had indications for canakinumab use as colchicine resistance and recurrent corticosteroid need for pleural/pericardial effusions. Canakinumab was administered monthly for 6 months (initial treatment), bimonthly for 6 months (maintenance treatment), then treatment was discontinued. For the patients who developed a new attack after one-year treatment period, canakinumab was readministered with 3-month intervals (continuation treatment). The mean follow-up time beginning from the first canakinumab injection was 24.3 +- 10.2 (6-33) months. None of the patients had an attack during the first-year treatment. Four of the patients developed an attack 9.0 +- 2.9 (6-12) months after discontinuation of treatment and switched to the continuation treatment period, with no more attacks. We suggest that this standard protocol may be used successfully in colchicine-resistant FMF patients.",

Case 2 is a 23y with cirrhotic kidneys, stage 5 of chronic kidney disease and dialysis treatment 3 x a week. The pregnancy was an incidental finding. Pat. 3 is a 29y I/0 with history of renal transplantation years ago. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: In pat. 1a renal biopsy confirmed the suspected diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Due to deterioration of the kidney function, she required dialysis up to 6 x a week. In Case 2 the dialysis increased to 6 x a week as well. In both patients, we indicated delivery at 35 weeks of gestational age. Pat. 3 delivered at term without complications. CONCLUSION: A close interdisciplinary cooperation improves neonatal outcome in pregnant women with CKD. Counseling and risk assessment of these patients should be initiated before pregnancy. The care of these high-risk pregnancies needs to be performed at a tertiary care center with the above-mentioned specialists.",

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been seen in COVID-19-infected subjects, and it has frequently resulted in an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Colchicine, an immunomodulatory drug, was used in several studies in the early stages of the pandemic. Colchicine has been shown to prevent the development of renal failure in patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). It has also been reported to reduce fibrosis, which plays a role in chronic kidney disease. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether using Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with better renal function in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised 118 out of 605 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. Some of the subjects (n = 50) received oral Colchicine plus standard care, called the Col ( +) group. The others (n = 68) received only the standard care, called the Col (-) group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other laboratory findings, including lymphocytes, D-dimer, and CRP, were analyzed. RESULTS: The D-dimer and serum creatine levels were significantly reduced in both groups. The number of lymphocytes showed a significant increase in both groups at discharge. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at admission. The reduction of SCr was considerably higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group. Similarly, the improvement of eGFR was higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at discharge and 6-12 mounts follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the use of Colchicine plus standard care was associated with improved renal function in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Outcomes of kidney transplantation for patients with renal AA amyloidosis are uncertain, with reports of poor survival and high rates of disease recurrence. However, data are inconclusive and mostly based on studies from the early 2000s and earlier. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We searched the French national transplant database to identify all patients with renal AA amyloidosis who underwent kidney transplantation between 2008 and 2018. EXPOSURES: Age, cause of amyloidosis, use of biotherapies, CRP levels. OUTCOMES: Outcomes were all-cause mortality and allograft loss. We also reported amyloidosis allograft recurrence, occurrence of acute rejection episodes, as well as infectious, cardiovascular, and neoplastic disease events. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: The Kaplan-Meier estimator for mortality and the cumulative incidence function method for allograft loss. Factors associated with patient and allograft survival were investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model and a cause-specific hazards model, respectively. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients who received kidney transplants for AA amyloidosis at 26 French centers were included. The median age was 49.4 years (interquartile range 39.7-61.1). The main cause of amyloidosis was Familial Mediterranean Fever (37 cases, 43%). Sixteen (18.6%) patients received a biotherapy after transplantation. Patient survival was 94.0% (95% confidence interval 89.1-99.2) at 1 year and 85.5% (77.8-94.0) at 5 years post-transplantation. The cumulative incidence of allograft loss was 10.5% (4.0-17.0) at 1 year, and 13.0% (5.8-20.1) at 5 years post-transplantation. Histologically proven AA amyloidosis recurrence occurred in 5 transplants (5.8%). 55.8% of cases developed an infection requiring hospitalization and 27.9% acute allograft rejection. Multivariable analysis showed that CRP concentration at the time of transplantation was associated with patient survival (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p=0.01) and with allograft survival (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.10-2.57, p 0.02). LIMITATIONS: The study lacked a control group and the effect of biotherapies on transplantation outcomes could not be explored. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively contemporary cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant for AA amyloidosis experienced favorable rates of survival and lower recurrence rates than previously reported. These data support the practice of treating these patients with kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease.",

The characteristic findings of IgAV are palpable purpuric rash, abdominal pain, arthralgia or arthritis, and hematuria. Ischemic complications are very rare in IgAV. Thrombotic complications can be observed after a COVID-19 infection. Also in the presence of familial Mediterranean fever, IgAV may have an atypical or more severe course. CASE: We present a case of IgAV complicated with renal infarction and intestinal ischemia. There was no recent or distant history of COVID-19 in the patient or family members, but the patient`s COVID-19 antibody was positive. In addition, MEFV gene analysis of the patient showed homozygous M694V mutation. The patient did not respond to enoxaparin, pulse methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), iloprost, and cyclophosphamide treatments. She was successfully treated with six sessions of plasmapheresis. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmapheresis seems to be an effective treatment option in IgAV-related ischemic findings that do not respond to intensive immunosuppressive therapy.",

Pat.1 is a 32y at 20 weeks of gestation with acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome and history of familial Mediterranean fever. Case 2 is a 23y with cirrhotic kidneys, stage 5 of chronic kidney disease and dialysis treatment 3 x a week. The pregnancy was an incidental finding. Pat. 3 is a 29y I/0 with history of renal transplantation years ago. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: In pat. 1a renal biopsy confirmed the suspected diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Due to deterioration of the kidney function, she required dialysis up to 6 x a week. In Case 2 the dialysis increased to 6 x a week as well. In both patients, we indicated delivery at 35 weeks of gestational age. Pat. 3 delivered at term without complications. CONCLUSION: A close interdisciplinary cooperation improves neonatal outcome in pregnant women with CKD. Counseling and risk assessment of these patients should be initiated before pregnancy. The care of these high-risk pregnancies needs to be performed at a tertiary care center with the above-mentioned specialists.",

METHODS: The study included 30 FMF patients with homozygous M694V mutation in remission under colchicine therapy, 12 asymptomatic FMF carriers with heterozygous M694V mutation, and 41 age-sex-matched healthy controls. All patients underwent detailed eye examination, and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT), macular vascular densities, and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) areas were measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography. RESULTS: In this study, the mean pRNFL thickness was statistically significantly thinner (p=0.010) in the FMF patients group compared to the FMF carriers group and the healthy control group, especially in the inferior quadrant of pRNFL (p=0.042). The CMT in asymptomatic FMF carriers group was statistically significantly thicker than in FMF patients group (p=0.037), especially the superior and inferior quadrants of macula were affected (p=0.024; p=0.020, respectively). In addition, this study showed that the changes of pRNFL thickness and CMT in pediatric patients with FMF were moderately correlated with the duration of diagnosis. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of macular vascular densities and FAZ values. CONCLUSION: FMF is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease that causes multi-organ involvement, and this study showed that posterior segment ocular parameters could be affected not only in FMF patients but also in asymptomatic FMF carriers.",

METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups according to the age of disease onset: group 1 includes the patients who had their first attack <=3 years of age; group 2 consisted of patients who had their first attack >3 years of age. Furthermore, we compared the proportion of patients fulfilling the three diagnostic criteria among two groups. RESULTS: Of 1687 patients, 761 had first FMF attack at <=3 years of age while 926 patients presented with their first manifestation of FMF at >3 years. Delay in diagnosis, fever and peritonitis were significantly higher in group 1. Frequency of arthritis, erysipelas-like erythema, non-nephrotic proteinuria, incomplete attacks, chronic arthritis, arthralgia and mean colchicine dose were significantly higher in group 2. Mean Pras score was higher and the presence of M694V mutation was more frequent in group 1. The percentage of children diagnosed according to Tel-Hashomer and pediatric criteria was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2. However, both groups meet Livneh criteria similarly. CONCLUSION: Although patients with early disease onset seem to have more severe disease course, they are more likely to have a delay in diagnosis. To avoid the diagnostic delay, clinicians should be aware of the findings of FMF in early age.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disorder predominantly affecting individuals of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent, including those with certain heritages including Sephardic Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, and Arab. The disorder affects up to 1 in 200 people making it a very common etiology for pain states worldwide, including serositis mediated painful states of the chest, joint, and abdomen. RECENT FINDINGS: Defined by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation, FMF can lead to not only severe pain, but complications such as renal amyloidosis, if untreated. This narrative review explores the genetic basis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and current management strategies for FMF. Mutations in the MEFV gene result in the dysregulation of the pyrin inflammasome, leading to excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. Diagnosis primarily relies on clinical criteria supported by genetic testing. Colchicine remains the cornerstone of treatment, effectively preventing inflammatory attacks and complications. For colchicine-resistant patients, IL-1 antagonists like anakinra and canakinumab show promise, although their long-term benefits require further investigation. The present investigation underscores the importance of early diagnosis and integrated treatment approaches to improve patient outcomes, pain management, and quality of life.",

Recently, it was shown that FMF patients with early disease onset have more severe disease. The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, clinical and genetic features of FMF patients who had disease onset during the neonatal period. Methods: Medical records of all patients diagnosed as FMF and had been seen in the outpatient clinic of Paediatric Rheumatology department between January 2013 and January 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with disease onset during the first month of life were included to the study. Results: Among 317 patients; 19 (12 males) were included to the study. Approximately 60% of the patients had family history of FMF. Homozygous p.M694V mutation was detected in 42% of the cases. Thirteen patients present with attacks of fever and remaining had attacks in the form of restlessness, resembling infantile colic starting in the neonatal period. Majority of these patients developed classical abdominal attacks between the ages of 1 and 2.5 years. The diagnosis of FMF was significantly delayed; the median age at onset of therapy was 3.5 years (range 7 months-17 years).

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disorder predominantly affecting individuals of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent, including those with certain heritages including Sephardic Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, and Arab. The disorder affects up to 1 in 200 people making it a very common etiology for pain states worldwide, including serositis mediated painful states of the chest, joint, and abdomen. RECENT FINDINGS: Defined by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation, FMF can lead to not only severe pain, but complications such as renal amyloidosis, if untreated. This narrative review explores the genetic basis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and current management strategies for FMF. Mutations in the MEFV gene result in the dysregulation of the pyrin inflammasome, leading to excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. Diagnosis primarily relies on clinical criteria supported by genetic testing. Colchicine remains the cornerstone of treatment, effectively preventing inflammatory attacks and complications. For colchicine-resistant patients, IL-1 antagonists like anakinra and canakinumab show promise, although their long-term benefits require further investigation. The present investigation underscores the importance of early diagnosis and integrated treatment approaches to improve patient outcomes, pain management, and quality of life.",

This retrospective observational study sought to characterize the clinical prodrome and diagnostic delay to inform early detection. We identified 1523 adults with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis in the Optum de-identified Clinformatics  Datamart US healthcare claims database as those with >=2 new diagnosis codes for AL or other amyloidosis in 90 days with >=1 multiple myeloma treatment within 730 days, excluding patients with prior hereditary or secondary amyloidosis and Familial Mediterranean Fever. We considered 34 signs/symptoms using diagnosis codes in all observable time on or before AL amyloidosis diagnosis. Sign/symptom prevalence was compared to that of 1:4 matched population controls. The overlap and sequence of signs/symptoms and the median time from first sign/symptom to AL amyloidosis diagnosis were explored. Healthcare utilization was summarized. The most common individual AL amyloidosis signs/symptoms were malaise/fatigue (61%) and dyspnea (59%). Cardiac signs/symptoms were observed in 77% of patients, followed by renal (62%) and neurologic (59%) signs/symptoms. Multisystem involvement (>=3 systems) was present in 54%. Monoclonal gammopathy was detected in 29% before diagnosis. Median time from symptom onset to AL amyloidosis diagnosis was 2.7 years. Healthcare utilization was high between first AL amyloidosis signs/symptoms and diagnosis, with 50% visiting >=5 physician types. AL amyloidosis patients have a lengthy and complex clinical prodrome. Novel approaches to early diagnosis are needed to improve outcomes.",

He suffered recurrent migratory polyarthritis starting from bilateral knees to his right elbow. Certain antibiotic therapies appeared to improve his symptoms, but the symptoms recurred due to the migratory nature of arthritis. A diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was considered and diagnostic tests were performed. Not many differential diagnoses exist for migratory polyarthritis, particularly when it has a recurrent nature. The administration of antibiotics without sufficient diagnostic consideration can cause a delay in making an accurate diagnosis and thereby also cause a delay in administering appropriate treatment.",

Here, we examine whether in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a model of inflammatory diseases, inflammation also increases the risk to develop cardiovascular (CV) disease. METHODS: To explore the role of inflammation in the occurrence of CVD in FMF, we identified all FMF patients <=55 years old with CVD, admitted to our center over a 15-year period. Correlates of inflammation, such as severity of FMF and dose of colchicine, as well as the presence of traditional CV risk factors were compared between the FMF patients with CVD (FMF- CVD) and control FMF patients with- out CVD. RESULTS: Twenty-three FMF-CVD and 40 control patients were compared. The severity of FMF, and the dose of colchicine, were similar in the 2 study groups; therefore, not associated with CVD. Compared with FMF patients without CVD, the FMF-CVD group comprised a higher proportion of men (78 vs. 40% p=0.005), and of patients with diabetes (31 vs. 7%, p=0.016) and inflammatory comorbidities such as Behcet's disease (30 vs. 7%, p=0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that only diabetes mellitus and inflammatory comorbidities were independent factors associated with FMF-CVD. CONCLUSIONS: In FMF patients treated with colchicine, CVD is not associated with FMF-related inflammation.",

Traditionally, the disease is defined by autosomal recessive inheritance of MEFV gene variants, yet FMF also not uncommonly manifests in individuals with only one identified disease-associated allele. Increasing availability and affordability of gene sequencing has led to the identification of multiple MEFV variants; however, they are often of unknown clinical significance. Variants in other genes affecting overlapping or distinct inflammatory signaling pathways - together with gene-environment interactions including epigenetic modulation - likely underlie the significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity seen among patients with this disease. We review recent evidence of the expanding spectrum of FMF genotype and phenotype and suggest that current drug funding schemes restricting biologic agents to patients with homozygous mutations have not kept pace with our biological understanding of the disease.",

METHODS: Children aged 4-17 years with polyarticular JIA were enrolled in a phase III, randomised-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial consisting of a 16-week open-label lead-in period, 32-week randomised double-blind period and 360-week long-term extension. Patients were stratified by baseline methotrexate use. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored, and efficacy assessments included JIA American College of Rheumatology (JIA ACR) 30%, 50%, 70% or 90% responses and the proportions of patients achieving 27-joint Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS27) low disease activity (LDA, <=3.8) and inactive disease (ID, <=1). RESULTS: Of 171 patients enrolled, 62 (36%) completed the long-term extension. Twelve serious infections in 11 patients were reported through 592.8 patient-years of exposure. No cases of congestive heart failure-related AEs, demyelinating disease, lupus-like syndrome, malignancies, tuberculosis or deaths were reported. JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses and JADAS27 LDA were achieved in 66% to 96% of patients at week 104, and 63 (37%) patients achieved clinical remission (JADAS27 ID sustained for >=6 continuous months) during the study. Attainment of JIA ACR 50 or higher and JADAS27 LDA or ID in the initial weeks were the best predictors of clinical remission. Mean JADAS27 decreased from baseline, 22.5 (n=170), to 2.5 (n=30) at week 312 (observed analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Through 6 years of exposure, adalimumab was well tolerated with significant clinical response (up to clinical remission) and a relatively low retention rate.",

We aimed to analyze the incidence and clinical characteristics of immediate type I (IgE/non-IgE) hypersensitivity reactions to BD and the risk factors for these reactions. METHODS: Children with rheumatic diseases using BD who were evaluated in the pediatric allergy department for possible drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) due to BD or any other drug were included in the study. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight children (49.2% boys; 14.6 years [9.9-16.9 years] with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [58%], familial Mediterranean fever [14%], vasculitis [14%], and other diseases [14%]) had used eight different BD with 32 494 infusions/injections. Fifteen patients were evaluated for DHR [injection-site reactions [n = 4], adverse events [n = 2], drug hypersensitivity other than BD [n = 3], and immediate BD hypersensitivity [n = 6]). The incidence of immediate BD HSR was 4.7%, with a clinical presentation of anaphylaxis in 3.9% (tocilizumab [n = 3], rituximab [n = 2], positive skin test with culprit BD [n = 3]). Among patients with BD HSR, the median follow-up was longer (84.5 vs 54 months, P = .048), and renal (33.3% vs 4.1%, P = .002), hematologic involvement (16.7% vs 0, P < .001), and active disease (83.3% vs 13.9%, P < .001) were more common. Logistic regression analysis revealed that renal involvement, more than 14 hospitalizations per lifetime, and more than two different BD used were associated with BD hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: The frequency of severe immediate HSR due to BD was shown to be 3.9% in children with rheumatic diseases. Children with active rheumatic disease and who have exposure to multiple BD should be monitored for BD HSR, particularly during intravenous BD infusions.",

The overlap and sequence of signs/symptoms and the median time from first sign/symptom to AL amyloidosis diagnosis were explored. Healthcare utilization was summarized. The most common individual AL amyloidosis signs/symptoms were malaise/fatigue (61%) and dyspnea (59%). Cardiac signs/symptoms were observed in 77% of patients, followed by renal (62%) and neurologic (59%) signs/symptoms. Multisystem involvement (>=3 systems) was present in 54%.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeted at interleukin-1 beta, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in preventing familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) attacks among individuals with colchicine-resistant (crFMF). The manufacturer orders prescribe monthly subcutaneous injections. However, a subset of our patients is treated with an \"canakinumab on demand \" (COD) strategy, with wider intervals between drug administrations. Therefore, we aimed to compare disease activity and drug safety between COD and \"canakinumab fixed frequency\" (CFF) policies. METHODS: This retrospective study collected data from three Israeli paediatric rheumatology centres, of children with crFMF who were treated with canakinumab. Epidemiological and clinical parameters, cumulative drug dosages, and adverse events were compared between children treated by both policies. RESULTS: Twenty-five (49 %) children were treated according to COD policy and 26 according to CFF policy. Demographic parameters and most of the disease features did not differ significantly between the groups. Both groups showed significant reduction in attacks after canakinumab introduction. The median number (interquartile range) of attacks per month did not differ significantly between the COD and CFF groups (0.33 (0.08, 0.58) and 0.13 (0, 0.5), respectively, p = 0.485 (even though, per definition, COD patients presumably had an attack before receiving the second canakinumab dose). The mean monthly dose was lower for the COD than the CFF group (1.13 +- 1.13 vs. 3.16 +- 1.46 mg/kg, p < 0.001). Adverse events were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: For individuals with crFMF, COD compared to CFF policy can achieve similar efficacy and safety, with a lower accumulated canakinumab dose, rendering it less immunosuppressive and less expensive.",

Traditionally, the disease is defined by autosomal recessive inheritance of MEFV gene variants, yet FMF also not uncommonly manifests in individuals with only one identified disease-associated allele. Increasing availability and affordability of gene sequencing has led to the identification of multiple MEFV variants; however, they are often of unknown clinical significance. Variants in other genes affecting overlapping or distinct inflammatory signaling pathways - together with gene-environment interactions including epigenetic modulation - likely underlie the significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity seen among patients with this disease. We review recent evidence of the expanding spectrum of FMF genotype and phenotype and suggest that current drug funding schemes restricting biologic agents to patients with homozygous mutations have not kept pace with our biological understanding of the disease.",

However, it is possible that intermittent colchicine therapy only during FMF attacks prevents the attacks completely in patients with FMF with expectable attacks. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old Japanese woman suffered high fever and arthralgia lasting for 2 to 3 days after each menstrual period's start. She was admitted to our hospital, and colchicine was administered immediately after her next period's start, and the febrile attack was completely prevented. DIAGNOSES: We eventually diagnosed typical FMF. INTERVENTIONS: Her remission has been maintained by intermittent colchicine therapy. OUTCOMES: The genetic analysis revealed the G304R heterozygous mutation in exon 2 of the MEFV gene. Cytokine analysis suggested subclinical inflammation during the remission period. LESSONS: This case suggests that taking an extensive medical history (including the relationship between fever attack and menstruation) is important in the diagnosis of female patients with FMF. This case also suggests that a continuous administration of colchicine may have to be considered to regulate subclinical inflammation even in patients with FMF with completely expectable attacks.",

We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl hospitalised with fever associated with rash, myalgia, arthralgia and polyarticular involvement. Examinations revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Bone marrow biopsy showed polyclonal leukocyte activation. A genetic study revealed a heterozygous mutation of the MEFV gene, c.442G>C (E148Q), which is typical of familial Mediterranean fever. However, the genetic pattern was not associated with a history of recurrent fever, aphthous ulcers of the mouth, abdominal pain, arthralgia and rash. Therefore, a diagnosis of sJIA was made. The patient did not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids improved biochemical examinations; however, AST, ALT, GGT and glycaemia remained elevated and adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment became evident and therefore corticosteroids were withdrawn. Canakinumab (150 mg/4 weeks subcutaneously) was initiated. Biochemical data returned to normal values and clinical symptoms resolved. After 2.5 years of canakinumab treatment, complete disease remission allowed the prolongation of intervals between doses. When the intervals were longer than 10 weeks we discontinued the treatment. The patient is still in remission 2 years after canakinumab withdrawal.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by periodic febrile attacks of aseptic serositis and/or arthritis. The main treatment is colchicine which prevents attacks in the majority of patients except for a group of colchicine-resistant cases. Chronic hepatitis C is a viral infection causing chronic inflammation of liver tissue (hepatitis) which ultimately progresses to fibrosis and liver cirrhosis with a high chance of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, we found no data in the literature concerning the impact of hepatitis C on the course of attacks of familial Mediterranean fever. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 21-year-old white woman with familial Mediterranean fever who had not been responding to a high dose of colchicine (2 mg/day). She presented to our clinic with a finding of chronic hepatitis C genotype 3 infection. After successful antiviral therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin, she became attack-free for 2 years and went on to a lower dose of colchicine. CONCLUSIONS: This unusual case illustrates complete resolution of attacks of autoinflammatory disease after drug-induced clearance of chronic hepatitis C infection. Coexisting infections should be viewed as potentially altering the course of autoinflammatory disorders, and any attempt to cure the infections should be made in order to gain an added value of benefiting the chronic disease. This case highlights the interrelation of external pathogen-related and genetically inherited alterations in immunity and the importance of considering the whole spectrum of possible causative factors rather than implementing separate guidelines in order to achieve best quality of medical care in any given patient.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Outcomes of kidney transplantation for patients with renal AA amyloidosis are uncertain, with reports of poor survival and high rates of disease recurrence. However, data are inconclusive and mostly based on studies from the early 2000s and earlier. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We searched the French national transplant database to identify all patients with renal AA amyloidosis who underwent kidney transplantation between 2008 and 2018. EXPOSURES: Age, cause of amyloidosis, use of biotherapies, CRP levels. OUTCOMES: Outcomes were all-cause mortality and allograft loss. We also reported amyloidosis allograft recurrence, occurrence of acute rejection episodes, as well as infectious, cardiovascular, and neoplastic disease events. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: The Kaplan-Meier estimator for mortality and the cumulative incidence function method for allograft loss. Factors associated with patient and allograft survival were investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model and a cause-specific hazards model, respectively. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients who received kidney transplants for AA amyloidosis at 26 French centers were included. The median age was 49.4 years (interquartile range 39.7-61.1). The main cause of amyloidosis was Familial Mediterranean Fever (37 cases, 43%). Sixteen (18.6%) patients received a biotherapy after transplantation. Patient survival was 94.0% (95% confidence interval 89.1-99.2) at 1 year and 85.5% (77.8-94.0) at 5 years post-transplantation. The cumulative incidence of allograft loss was 10.5% (4.0-17.0) at 1 year, and 13.0% (5.8-20.1) at 5 years post-transplantation. Histologically proven AA amyloidosis recurrence occurred in 5 transplants (5.8%). 55.8% of cases developed an infection requiring hospitalization and 27.9% acute allograft rejection. Multivariable analysis showed that CRP concentration at the time of transplantation was associated with patient survival (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p=0.01) and with allograft survival (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.10-2.57, p 0.02). LIMITATIONS: The study lacked a control group and the effect of biotherapies on transplantation outcomes could not be explored. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively contemporary cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant for AA amyloidosis experienced favorable rates of survival and lower recurrence rates than previously reported. These data support the practice of treating these patients with kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease.",

Approximately 10-15% of the patients are either intolerant or have an insufficient response to colchicine treatment. The most promising alternative treatment approach is anti-IL-1 agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-IL-1 therapy in FMF amyloidosis. METHODS: Forty-four patients with amyloidosis who had been treated with anti-IL-1 agents, anakinra and/or canakinumab, were assessed retrospectively for efficacy and safety. Five patients were on haemodialysis and four had received a renal transplant. RESULTS: The mean duration of anti-IL-1 treatment was 21.4  (18) months. Among 35 patients who were not on dialysis, renal function was maintained or improved in 79.4% but deteriorated in 20.6%. Patients with creatinine levels below 1.5 mg/dl at onset benefitted more from IL-1 inhibition with regard to their kidney functions and acute phase reactants. No additional side effects were observed in patients with renal replacement treatments. The major side effect of anakinra was injection-site reaction observed in four patients. CONCLUSION: Anti-IL-1 agents are well tolerated and effective in the treatment of amyloidosis secondary to FMF, including patients on dialysis and renal transplant recipients. This approach may improve the lifespan of transplanted kidneys in FMF patients.",

The incidence of severe infections was 26.2 per 100 patient-years. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (43.5%) and pneumonia (30.8%). Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was the most common rheumatic disease (57.9%), and the median disease duration was 18.5 years. Most patients (68.4%) were using IL-1 inhibitors, and 31.6% were on anti-TNF therapy. There was no significant difference between patients with and without infections in terms of gender, pre-transplant biological therapy use, or type of biological therapy used. Four patients (11%) died from infection-related complications, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic patients receiving bDMARDs post-kidney transplantation have a high risk of severe infections. The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk, necessitating close infection monitoring and management. Key Points   Rheumatic patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) following kidney transplantation face a heightened risk of severe infections.   The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk.   Individualized treatment strategies are essential to balance the benefits of bDMARDs with the potential for severe infectious complications.",

Switching to canakinumab (human monoclonal antibody against IL-1beta) at dose of 150 mg every 4 weeks induced a rapid remission of the disease activity and inflammatory markers. However, due to relapse of acute flares after three weeks from application, the escalation of dose to 300 mg every 4 weeks induced a complete remission of symptoms and significantly improved the quality of life. This is the first report of successful canakinumab administration in FMF patient in Central and Eastern Europe, a region with very low incidence of FMF (Tab. 1, Ref. 16).",

METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 38 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation and received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Severe infections were defined as those requiring hospitalization, and the incidence of severe infections was calculated per 100 patient years. Risk factors for severe infections were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients (median age 40.5 years), 52.6% experienced severe infections, with a total of 39 severe infection episodes. The incidence of severe infections was 26.2 per 100 patient-years. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (43.5%) and pneumonia (30.8%). Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was the most common rheumatic disease (57.9%), and the median disease duration was 18.5 years. Most patients (68.4%) were using IL-1 inhibitors, and 31.6% were on anti-TNF therapy. There was no significant difference between patients with and without infections in terms of gender, pre-transplant biological therapy use, or type of biological therapy used. Four patients (11%) died from infection-related complications, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic patients receiving bDMARDs post-kidney transplantation have a high risk of severe infections. The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk, necessitating close infection monitoring and management. Key Points   Rheumatic patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) following kidney transplantation face a heightened risk of severe infections.   The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk.   Individualized treatment strategies are essential to balance the benefits of bDMARDs with the potential for severe infectious complications.",

At the molecular level, colchicine reduces proinflammatory cytokine release and inhibits NF-kappaB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this review, we summarize the current clinical trials with proven curative effect of colchicine in treating cardiovascular diseases.

                    "abstract": "Colchicine is an ancient herbal drug derived from Colchicum autumnale. It was first used to treat familial Mediterranean fever and gout. Based on its unique efficacy as an anti-inflammatory agent, colchicine has been used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, recurrent pericarditis, vascular restenosis, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. More recently, colchicine has also shown therapeutic efficacy in alleviating cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. COLCOT and LoDoCo2 are two milestone clinical trials that confirm the curative effect of long-term administration of colchicine in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. There is growing interest in studying the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of colchicine. The anti-inflammatory action of colchicine is mediated mainly through inhibiting the assembly of microtubules. At the cellular level, colchicine inhibits the following: (1) endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation; (2) smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration; (3) macrophage chemotaxis, migration, and adhesion; (4) platelet activation. At the molecular level, colchicine reduces proinflammatory cytokine release and inhibits NF-kappaB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this review, we summarize the current clinical trials with proven curative effect of colchicine in treating cardiovascular diseases. We also systematically discuss the mechanisms of colchicine action in cardiovascular therapeutics. Altogether, colchicine, a bioactive constituent from an ancient medicinal herb, exerts unique anti-inflammatory effects and prominent cardiovascular actions, and will charter a new page in cardiovascular medicine.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although canakinumab has demonstrated efficacy in multiple trials in patients with periodic fever syndromes (PFS), the evidence on initiation of canakinumab among PFS patients in real world setting is not well understood. We aimed to characterize the reasons for canakinumab initiation among patients with PFS, specifically, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome/mevalonate kinase deficiency (HIDS/MKD), TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). METHODS: Physicians retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of PFS patients prescribed canakinumab between 2016 and 2018. Information collected included patient clinical characteristics, reasons for previous treatment discontinuation and canakinumab initiation. The results were summarized for overall patients, and by children (< 18 years) and adults and by subtype of PFS. RESULTS: Fifty-eight physicians in the US (rheumatologists, 44.8 %; allergists/immunologists, 29.3 %; dermatologists, 25.9 %) abstracted information for 147 patients (children, 46.3 %; males, 57.1 %; CAPS, 36.7 %; TRAPS, 26.5 %; FMF, 26.5 %; HIDS/MKD, 6.8 %; Mixed, 3.4 %). Overall, most patients (90.5 %) received treatment directly preceding canakinumab (NSAIDs, 27.8 % [40.0 % in HIDS/MKD]; anakinra, 24.1 % [32.7 % in CAPS]; colchicine, 21.8 % [35.9 % in FMF]), which were discontinued due to lack of efficacy/effectiveness (39.5 %) and availability of a new treatment (36.1 %). The common reasons for canakinumab initiation were physician perceived efficacy/effectiveness (81.0 %; children, 75.0 %; adults, 86.1 %), lack of response to previous treatment (40.8 %; children, 38.2 %; adults, 43.0 %) and favorable safety profile/tolerability (40.1 %; children, 42.6 %; adults, 38.0 %). Within subtypes, efficacy/effectiveness was the most stated reason for canakinumab initiation in HIDS/MKD (90.9 %), lack of response to previous treatment in FMF (52.4 %) and convenience of administration/dosing in CAPS (27.1 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insights into how canakinumab is initiated in US clinical practice among PFS patients, with physician perceived efficacy/effectiveness of canakinumab, lack of response to previous treatment and favorable safety profile/tolerability of canakinumab being the dominant reasons for canakinumab initiation in all patients and in children and adults and PFS subtypes. Notably, the favorable safety profile/tolerability of canakinumab was more often the reason for initiation among children versus adults.",

                    "abstract": "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is an autoinflammatory disease characterised by fever and arthritis. We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl hospitalised with fever associated with rash, myalgia, arthralgia and polyarticular involvement. Examinations revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Bone marrow biopsy showed polyclonal leukocyte activation. A genetic study revealed a heterozygous mutation of the MEFV gene, c.442G>C (E148Q), which is typical of familial Mediterranean fever. However, the genetic pattern was not associated with a history of recurrent fever, aphthous ulcers of the mouth, abdominal pain, arthralgia and rash. Therefore, a diagnosis of sJIA was made. The patient did not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids improved biochemical examinations; however, AST, ALT, GGT and glycaemia remained elevated and adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment became evident and therefore corticosteroids were withdrawn. Canakinumab (150 mg/4 weeks subcutaneously) was initiated. Biochemical data returned to normal values and clinical symptoms resolved. After 2.5 years of canakinumab treatment, complete disease remission allowed the prolongation of intervals between doses. When the intervals were longer than 10 weeks we discontinued the treatment. The patient is still in remission 2 years after canakinumab withdrawal.",

Intravenous (IV) colchicine, administered over several months, has been shown to be effective for FMF patients unresponsive to oral colchicine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term IV colchicine treatment in oral colchicine-resistant FMF. We analyzed data of 15 patients with frequent FMF attacks, despite a maximal tolerated dose of oral colchicine (2-3 mg/day), who were treated with weekly IV injections of 1 mg of colchicine for at least 12 months. Treatment efficacy was determined by changes in frequency, duration and severity of FMF attacks. Safety was assessed according to adverse events. The mean duration of IV colchicine treatment was 5.16 +- 2.85 years. Decreases were observed from pre-treatment period in the monthly mean rates of abdominal attacks (from 5.6 +- 3.7 to 1.9 +- 3.3, p = 0.0009), joint attacks (from 6.5 +- 5.1 to 1.6 +- 1.6, p = 0.01) and overall attacks (from 22.3 +- 16.2 to 7.4 +- 5.7, p = 0.002) as well as in the mean duration (from 3.8 +- 1.5 to 2.4 +- 1.1 days per attack, p = 0.008) and severity of attacks (from 9.9 +- 0.3 to 5.7 +- 2.6, on a scale of 0-10, p < 0.05). The rate of adverse events was low, and they were mainly gastrointestinal. No severe or serious adverse events were recorded. Long-term treatment with IV colchicine in patients unresponsive to oral colchicine therapy is effective and safe.",

                    "abstract": ": Reporting of intoxication and withdrawal from aberrant use of over-the-counter medication has been sparse and inconsistent in literature. Attributed to their anticholinergic properties, medications such as dimenhydrinate (Gravol) taken in supratherapeutic doses have been associated with euphoria, anxiolysis, and hallucinations. We present a case of a woman in her forties, with a psychiatric history of bipolar disorder, and complex concurrent medical history including familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and fibromyalgia, admitted for withdrawal management of her intravenous dimenhydrinate use. As a result of her FMF, there were numerous hospital admissions and treatment which required intravenous access. Hence, a physician-inserted intravenous access port was placed on her chest. The port was maintained monthly with the help of a community agency. In this port, she was injecting 100 to 200 mg of dimenhydrinate hourly for its euphoric and calming effects, consuming upwards of 2400 mg/d. Comprehensive laboratory work-up and urine drug screening were unremarkable. Vital signs were stable. Her mental status at time of admission was lethargic, unfocused, but calm. Her withdrawal symptoms included severe nausea, vomiting, sedation, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and muscle stiffness. Her detoxification was managed with benztropine and lorazepam, and was well tolerated. The patient was discharged to a community inpatient rehabilitation center. Urine drug testing before discharge was negative. This case draws attention to the addictive potential of dimenhydrinate and offers a regime for its medical withdrawal management. Additionally, this case highlights that screening and management of over-the-counter medications warrants further clinical consideration and investigation.",

Case 2 is a 23y with cirrhotic kidneys, stage 5 of chronic kidney disease and dialysis treatment 3 x a week. The pregnancy was an incidental finding. Pat. 3 is a 29y I/0 with history of renal transplantation years ago. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: In pat. 1a renal biopsy confirmed the suspected diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Due to deterioration of the kidney function, she required dialysis up to 6 x a week. In Case 2 the dialysis increased to 6 x a week as well. In both patients, we indicated delivery at 35 weeks of gestational age. Pat. 3 delivered at term without complications. CONCLUSION: A close interdisciplinary cooperation improves neonatal outcome in pregnant women with CKD. Counseling and risk assessment of these patients should be initiated before pregnancy. The care of these high-risk pregnancies needs to be performed at a tertiary care center with the above-mentioned specialists.",

Patients of this cohort were retrospectively evaluated for a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) polymerized chain reaction (PCR) test result and information regarding hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were collected from medical records.Out of a total 496 FMF patients, 34 were detected to have a positive SARS-CoV 2 PCR test. Eighty-five point three percent of these patients were under colchicine treatment and 17.6% were under interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitor treatment. Eight of the 34 patients (23.9%) were found to be hospitalized, one of them was admitted to the intensive care unit and died thereafter (2.9%). An increasing trend in the frequency of comorbid diseases (presence of at least one comorbidity 64.7% in all patients vs 75.0% in hospitalized patients) and IL-1 inhibitor usage (17.6% in all patients vs 50.0% in hospitalized patients) was observed in hospitalized patients.Rates of comorbid diseases and IL-1 inhibitor use for FMF were observed to be increased in FMF patients hospitalized for COVID-19.",

However, 5% of patients are considered non-responders and, therefore, candidates for biologic therapy. Intravenous (IV) Colchicine treatment has been shown to be effective and safe in adult patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of IV Colchicine for pediatric FMF patients in our hospital, refractory to oral Colchicine, by reviewing their medical records. Inclusion criteria were all patients with FMF who commenced treatment with IV Colchicine before the age of 18 years, and received at least 6 months of IV therapy. The patients completed questionnaires to assess the efficacy of the treatment. Between 2004 and 2017, 7 pediatric FMF patients receiving maximal oral Colchicine doses and deemed non-responders were treated with weekly IV Colchicine, including 38 cumulative patient years of follow-up data (a full blood count, renal and liver function tests). All patients were homozygous for the M694V genotype. Long-term follow-up showed normal laboratory results with no Colchicine-related hospital admissions or toxicity. Global health assessment and the number of disease-free days have significantly improved (P < 0.05). Prolonged IV Colchicine use is described in pediatric FMF patients for the first time, with an excellent safety profile in our population, and decrease in intensity and frequency of attacks. In the biological era, IV Colchicine, although not leading to complete remission, may be considered a second-line option in countries where anti-interleukin 1 blockers are not available, or as a third-line option in case of failure to respond to biologics.",

RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight children (49.2% boys; 14.6 years [9.9-16.9 years] with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [58%], familial Mediterranean fever [14%], vasculitis [14%], and other diseases [14%]) had used eight different BD with 32 494 infusions/injections. Fifteen patients were evaluated for DHR [injection-site reactions [n = 4], adverse events [n = 2], drug hypersensitivity other than BD [n = 3], and immediate BD hypersensitivity [n = 6]). The incidence of immediate BD HSR was 4.7%, with a clinical presentation of anaphylaxis in 3.9% (tocilizumab [n = 3], rituximab [n = 2], positive skin test with culprit BD [n = 3]). Among patients with BD HSR, the median follow-up was longer (84.5 vs 54 months, P = .048), and renal (33.3% vs 4.1%, P = .002), hematologic involvement (16.7% vs 0, P < .001), and active disease (83.3% vs 13.9%, P < .001) were more common. Logistic regression analysis revealed that renal involvement, more than 14 hospitalizations per lifetime, and more than two different BD used were associated with BD hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: The frequency of severe immediate HSR due to BD was shown to be 3.9% in children with rheumatic diseases. Children with active rheumatic disease and who have exposure to multiple BD should be monitored for BD HSR, particularly during intravenous BD infusions.",

The characteristic findings of IgAV are palpable purpuric rash, abdominal pain, arthralgia or arthritis, and hematuria. Ischemic complications are very rare in IgAV. Thrombotic complications can be observed after a COVID-19 infection. Also in the presence of familial Mediterranean fever, IgAV may have an atypical or more severe course. CASE: We present a case of IgAV complicated with renal infarction and intestinal ischemia. There was no recent or distant history of COVID-19 in the patient or family members, but the patient`s COVID-19 antibody was positive. In addition, MEFV gene analysis of the patient showed homozygous M694V mutation. The patient did not respond to enoxaparin, pulse methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), iloprost, and cyclophosphamide treatments. She was successfully treated with six sessions of plasmapheresis. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmapheresis seems to be an effective treatment option in IgAV-related ischemic findings that do not respond to intensive immunosuppressive therapy.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: CLCN2 is a gene that encodes the voltage-gated chloride channel protein 2 in the human brain and eyes. While mutations in this gene have been associated with leukoencephalopathy as well as ocular manifestations including optic neuropathy and choroidopathy, here we report for the first time a case of severe proliferative retinopathy in a patient with CLCN2 mutation. OBSERVATIONS: A 12-year-old girl with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was referred due to blurred vision in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed mild vitreous hemorrhage, large neovascularization at the disc (NVD), extensive neovascularization along the arcades (i.e., NVE; neovascularization elsewhere), retinal arteriolar narrowing, silver sheathing of the veins and preretinal hemorrhages. Fluorescein angiography (FA) demonstrated prominent leakage from multiple large NVEs. A thorough and multidisciplinary evaluation ruled out metabolic, thrombotic, infectious, inflammatory, or autoimmune etiologies. Notably, however, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed leukodystrophy yet poorly correlated with her clinical manifestation. Strikingly, whole exome sequencing uncovered a homozygous mutation in the CLCN2 gene. She was treated with intravitreal injections of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody Bevacizumab and laser pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) with partial response. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that CLCN2 mutation may possess a key role in an aggressive form of proliferative retinopathy with partial response to anti-VEGF therapy. We hypothesize that the potential underlying mechanism involves astrocyte dysfunction and retinal blood barrier disruption. Noteworthy, a comprehensive approach is unequivocally significant in evaluating such cases of proliferative retinopathy with unclear etiology to establish a diagnosis and management strategy.",

                    "abstract": "Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases are rare conditions caused by genetic abnormalities affecting the innate immunity. Previous therapeutic strategies had been mainly based on results from retrospective studies and physicians' experience. However, during the last years, the significant improvement in their genetic and pathogenic knowledge has been accompanied by a remarkable progress in their management. The relatively recent identification of the inflammasome as the crucial pathogenic mechanism causing an aberrant production of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in the most frequent monogenic autoinflammatory diseases led to the introduction of anti-IL-1 agents and other biologic drugs as part of the previously limited therapeutic armamentarium available. Advances in the treatment of autoinflammatory diseases have been favored by the use of new biologic agents and the performance of a notable number of randomized clinical trials exploring the efficacy and safety of these agents. Clinical trials have contributed to increase the level of evidence and provided more robust therapeutic recommendations. This review analyzes the treatment of the most frequent monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, namely, familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome/mevalonate kinase deficiency, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, together with periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome, which is the most common polygenic autoinflammatory disease in children, also occurring in adult patients. Finally, based on the available expert consensus recommendations and the highest level of evidence of the published studies, a practical evidence-based guideline for the treatment of these autoinflammatory diseases is proposed.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of severe infections in rheumatic patients receiving biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) after kidney transplantation. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 38 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation and received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Severe infections were defined as those requiring hospitalization, and the incidence of severe infections was calculated per 100 patient years. Risk factors for severe infections were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients (median age 40.5 years), 52.6% experienced severe infections, with a total of 39 severe infection episodes. The incidence of severe infections was 26.2 per 100 patient-years. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (43.5%) and pneumonia (30.8%). Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was the most common rheumatic disease (57.9%), and the median disease duration was 18.5 years. Most patients (68.4%) were using IL-1 inhibitors, and 31.6% were on anti-TNF therapy. There was no significant difference between patients with and without infections in terms of gender, pre-transplant biological therapy use, or type of biological therapy used. Four patients (11%) died from infection-related complications, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic patients receiving bDMARDs post-kidney transplantation have a high risk of severe infections. The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk, necessitating close infection monitoring and management. Key Points   Rheumatic patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) following kidney transplantation face a heightened risk of severe infections.   The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk.   Individualized treatment strategies are essential to balance the benefits of bDMARDs with the potential for severe infectious complications.",

This study reviewed the long-term survival outcomes of FMF patients who underwent KT. METHODS: We compared the outcomes of 31 patients who underwent (KT) for biopsy-proven amyloidosis secondary to FMF with 31 control patients (five with diabetes mellitus and 26 with nondiabetic kidney disease) undergoing KT between 1994 and 2021 at Baskent University Hospital. All data were recorded retrospectively from patients' files. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE (QUARTILE DEVIATION: QD) at the time of KT in the FMF and control group were 31 (6.7) and 33 (11), respectively. The median follow-up period (QD) after KT was 108 (57) months in the FMF and 132 (72) months in the control group. In the FMF group, graft and patient survivals were 71% and 84% at 5 years and 45% and 48% at 10 years, respectively. In the control group, graft and patient survivals were 79% and 100% at 5 years and 63% and 71% at 10 years, respectively. Patient survival in the FMF group at 5 years was significantly lower than in the control group (p = .045). There was no statistically significant difference between the FMF and control groups in terms of graft and patient survival, and serum creatinine levels at 10 years. All patients were given triple immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Three patients received anakinra and one received canakinumab in addition to colchicine treatment. One FMF patient also underwent heart transplantation due to AA amyloidosis. Of the FMF patients, 11 died during follow-up. CONCLUSION: We have found that the long-term outcome of KT in patients with FMF amyloidosis is numerically worse but not statistically different from the control group. However, short- and long-term complications still need to be resolved.",

However, data are inconclusive and mostly based on studies from the early 2000s and earlier. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We searched the French national transplant database to identify all patients with renal AA amyloidosis who underwent kidney transplantation between 2008 and 2018. EXPOSURES: Age, cause of amyloidosis, use of biotherapies, CRP levels. OUTCOMES: Outcomes were all-cause mortality and allograft loss. We also reported amyloidosis allograft recurrence, occurrence of acute rejection episodes, as well as infectious, cardiovascular, and neoplastic disease events. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: The Kaplan-Meier estimator for mortality and the cumulative incidence function method for allograft loss. Factors associated with patient and allograft survival were investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model and a cause-specific hazards model, respectively. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients who received kidney transplants for AA amyloidosis at 26 French centers were included. The median age was 49.4 years (interquartile range 39.7-61.1). The main cause of amyloidosis was Familial Mediterranean Fever (37 cases, 43%). Sixteen (18.6%) patients received a biotherapy after transplantation. Patient survival was 94.0% (95% confidence interval 89.1-99.2) at 1 year and 85.5% (77.8-94.0) at 5 years post-transplantation. The cumulative incidence of allograft loss was 10.5% (4.0-17.0) at 1 year, and 13.0% (5.8-20.1) at 5 years post-transplantation. Histologically proven AA amyloidosis recurrence occurred in 5 transplants (5.8%). 55.8% of cases developed an infection requiring hospitalization and 27.9% acute allograft rejection. Multivariable analysis showed that CRP concentration at the time of transplantation was associated with patient survival (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p=0.01) and with allograft survival (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.10-2.57, p 0.02). LIMITATIONS: The study lacked a control group and the effect of biotherapies on transplantation outcomes could not be explored. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively contemporary cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant for AA amyloidosis experienced favorable rates of survival and lower recurrence rates than previously reported. These data support the practice of treating these patients with kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease.",

It is a potentially fatal complication.  Renal involvement is the most common manifestation of AAA. Pregnancy in women with chronic kidney disease  is considered to be at risk for specific pregnancy complications and the worsening of their underlying renal dysfunction. Our aim was to report pregnancy in our AAA patients and discuss the outcome through a literature review. METHODS: French cases were identified through the Reference Center for Auto-Inflammatory Diseases and Amyloidosis and a systematic literature review was performed. RESULTS: Three new patients were identified: two with Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and one with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome; one was under anakinra therapy and one had received a kidney transplantation before her pregnancy. One patient was diagnosed with AAA following the detection of post-partum nephrotic syndrome. Among the 27 patients from literature and our case, FMF was the main cause of AAA (69%). Eight of the patients were diagnosed with AAA during their pregnancy or in immediate post-partum and gestational complications appeared in 23/25 cases, mostly intrauterine growth retardation (n = 10), prematurity (n = 11) and preeclampsia (n = 4). No bleeding complication was reported. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy can occur in patients (eight overall) with AAA and the diagnosis is frequently made during pregnancy. Pregnant women with AAA are at risk for adverse pregnancy-associated outcomes and require special and closer monitoring.",

While mutations in this gene have been associated with leukoencephalopathy as well as ocular manifestations including optic neuropathy and choroidopathy, here we report for the first time a case of severe proliferative retinopathy in a patient with CLCN2 mutation. OBSERVATIONS: A 12-year-old girl with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was referred due to blurred vision in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed mild vitreous hemorrhage, large neovascularization at the disc (NVD), extensive neovascularization along the arcades (i.e., NVE; neovascularization elsewhere), retinal arteriolar narrowing, silver sheathing of the veins and preretinal hemorrhages. Fluorescein angiography (FA) demonstrated prominent leakage from multiple large NVEs. A thorough and multidisciplinary evaluation ruled out metabolic, thrombotic, infectious, inflammatory, or autoimmune etiologies. Notably, however, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed leukodystrophy yet poorly correlated with her clinical manifestation. Strikingly, whole exome sequencing uncovered a homozygous mutation in the CLCN2 gene. She was treated with intravitreal injections of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody Bevacizumab and laser pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) with partial response. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that CLCN2 mutation may possess a key role in an aggressive form of proliferative retinopathy with partial response to anti-VEGF therapy. We hypothesize that the potential underlying mechanism involves astrocyte dysfunction and retinal blood barrier disruption. Noteworthy, a comprehensive approach is unequivocally significant in evaluating such cases of proliferative retinopathy with unclear etiology to establish a diagnosis and management strategy.",

CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that CLCN2 mutation may possess a key role in an aggressive form of proliferative retinopathy with partial response to anti-VEGF therapy. We hypothesize that the potential underlying mechanism involves astrocyte dysfunction and retinal blood barrier disruption. Noteworthy, a comprehensive approach is unequivocally significant in evaluating such cases of proliferative retinopathy with unclear etiology to establish a diagnosis and management strategy.",

We aimed to analyze the incidence and clinical characteristics of immediate type I (IgE/non-IgE) hypersensitivity reactions to BD and the risk factors for these reactions. METHODS: Children with rheumatic diseases using BD who were evaluated in the pediatric allergy department for possible drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) due to BD or any other drug were included in the study. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight children (49.2% boys; 14.6 years [9.9-16.9 years] with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [58%], familial Mediterranean fever [14%], vasculitis [14%], and other diseases [14%]) had used eight different BD with 32 494 infusions/injections. Fifteen patients were evaluated for DHR [injection-site reactions [n = 4], adverse events [n = 2], drug hypersensitivity other than BD [n = 3], and immediate BD hypersensitivity [n = 6]). The incidence of immediate BD HSR was 4.7%, with a clinical presentation of anaphylaxis in 3.9% (tocilizumab [n = 3], rituximab [n = 2], positive skin test with culprit BD [n = 3]). Among patients with BD HSR, the median follow-up was longer (84.5 vs 54 months, P = .048), and renal (33.3% vs 4.1%, P = .002), hematologic involvement (16.7% vs 0, P < .001), and active disease (83.3% vs 13.9%, P < .001) were more common. Logistic regression analysis revealed that renal involvement, more than 14 hospitalizations per lifetime, and more than two different BD used were associated with BD hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: The frequency of severe immediate HSR due to BD was shown to be 3.9% in children with rheumatic diseases. Children with active rheumatic disease and who have exposure to multiple BD should be monitored for BD HSR, particularly during intravenous BD infusions.",

                    "abstract": "Colchicine is an ancient herbal drug derived from Colchicum autumnale. It was first used to treat familial Mediterranean fever and gout. Based on its unique efficacy as an anti-inflammatory agent, colchicine has been used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, recurrent pericarditis, vascular restenosis, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. More recently, colchicine has also shown therapeutic efficacy in alleviating cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. COLCOT and LoDoCo2 are two milestone clinical trials that confirm the curative effect of long-term administration of colchicine in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. There is growing interest in studying the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of colchicine. The anti-inflammatory action of colchicine is mediated mainly through inhibiting the assembly of microtubules. At the cellular level, colchicine inhibits the following: (1) endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation; (2) smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration; (3) macrophage chemotaxis, migration, and adhesion; (4) platelet activation. At the molecular level, colchicine reduces proinflammatory cytokine release and inhibits NF-kappaB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this review, we summarize the current clinical trials with proven curative effect of colchicine in treating cardiovascular diseases. We also systematically discuss the mechanisms of colchicine action in cardiovascular therapeutics. Altogether, colchicine, a bioactive constituent from an ancient medicinal herb, exerts unique anti-inflammatory effects and prominent cardiovascular actions, and will charter a new page in cardiovascular medicine.",

Intravenous (IV) colchicine, administered over several months, has been shown to be effective for FMF patients unresponsive to oral colchicine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term IV colchicine treatment in oral colchicine-resistant FMF. We analyzed data of 15 patients with frequent FMF attacks, despite a maximal tolerated dose of oral colchicine (2-3 mg/day), who were treated with weekly IV injections of 1 mg of colchicine for at least 12 months. Treatment efficacy was determined by changes in frequency, duration and severity of FMF attacks. Safety was assessed according to adverse events. The mean duration of IV colchicine treatment was 5.16 +- 2.85 years. Decreases were observed from pre-treatment period in the monthly mean rates of abdominal attacks (from 5.6 +- 3.7 to 1.9 +- 3.3, p = 0.0009), joint attacks (from 6.5 +- 5.1 to 1.6 +- 1.6, p = 0.01) and overall attacks (from 22.3 +- 16.2 to 7.4 +- 5.7, p = 0.002) as well as in the mean duration (from 3.8 +- 1.5 to 2.4 +- 1.1 days per attack, p = 0.008) and severity of attacks (from 9.9 +- 0.3 to 5.7 +- 2.6, on a scale of 0-10, p < 0.05). The rate of adverse events was low, and they were mainly gastrointestinal. No severe or serious adverse events were recorded. Long-term treatment with IV colchicine in patients unresponsive to oral colchicine therapy is effective and safe.",

Anti-interleukin-1 drugs emerge as a therapeutic option for colchicine-resistant patients. In this study, we aimed to document our experience with canakinumab use in kidney transplant recipients who developed AA amyloidosis due to FMF. METHODS: A total of nine patients with FMF amyloidosis treated with canakinumab were enrolled. Laboratory and clinical data were collected from the patient files, electronic database of the hospital and with interviews. RESULTS: Five of the patients were male and four were female (median age: 33, range: 27-62 years). All of the patients had rapid or gradual disappearance of FMF attacks. The following changes in the laboratory parameters were observed before and after the treatment: C-reactive protein: 18.31 +- 13.58 mg/L vs 9.98 +- 11.66 mg/L, creatinine clearance: 45.27 +- 21.5 mL/min vs 50.71 +- 22.48 mL/min, and 24-hour proteinuria: 2381.8 +- 3910.4 mg vs 710.0 +- 1117.5 mg; there were no statistically significant differences on those parameters. One patient developed a reaction to injection while another showed symptoms of Cytomegalovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Canakinumab can be considered as a safe and efficient drug in preventing the FMF attacks in kidney transplant recipients.",

                    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an important and preventable cause of chronic kidney disease due to secondary amyloidosis. Although colchicine is the first-line therapy in patients with FMF with 60% to 65% complete remission rates, 5% to 10% of patients are colchicine-resistant and 5% to 10% of them are intolerant to the therapy. Anti-interleukin-1 agents, such as anakinra and canakinumab, are safe and efficient therapeutic options in patients with colchicine resistance or intolerance. However, the data on management of these targeted agents is limited in recipients of kidney transplant (RKT). In this case series, we aim to share our experience on canakinumab therapy of 4 RKTs with FMF-related amyloidosis, who were followed up in our clinic between 2010 and 2017. All of the 4 patients with end-stage renal disease were colchicine- resistant and on other alternative therapies, which provided poor disease control. For efficient control of secondary amyloidosis, canakinumab therapy was initiated in 1 of the patients before the renal transplant, and for the remaining patients after renal transplant. Any serious adverse effect, development of proteinuria, or graft dysfunction has not been observed in any of the patients. Under the canakinumab treatment, complete clinical responses, prevent typical familial Mediterranean fever attacks with fever and arthritis and abdominal pain, normalized serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels were achieved in all patients. Canakinumab treatment is a safe and effective therapeutic option for RKTs with FMF who are resistant or intolerant to colchicine and anakinra.",

DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional, case-control study. METHODS: Topographic parameters and corneal and lens densitometry of 48 patients with FMF (10.12 +- 3.84 years [range: 5-19 years]) and 33 healthy volunteers (10.94 +- 3.78 years [range: 5-19 years]; p > 0.05) were evaluated with a Scheimpflug camera. For corneal densitometric measurements, the cornea was divided into four concentric radial zones and anterior, central, and posterior layers according to corneal thickness. The mean densitometry value for the crystalline lens was calculated in three zones around the center of the pupil. RESULTS: Corneal light backscattering in all layers and zones of the cornea were similar between the patient and control groups. Lens densitometry values in the three zones did not differ between the two groups (p > 0.05). Maximum lens densitometry values were found to be significantly higher in the patient group (22.14 vs 19.11; p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Monitoring the cornea and lens density in patients with FMF using Pentacam may help to show the presence of subclinical inflammation and regulate the follow-up and treatment protocols. Larger sample sizes and prospective design studies are needed to reach more conclusive results.",

METHODS: Children aged 4-17 years with polyarticular JIA were enrolled in a phase III, randomised-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial consisting of a 16-week open-label lead-in period, 32-week randomised double-blind period and 360-week long-term extension. Patients were stratified by baseline methotrexate use. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored, and efficacy assessments included JIA American College of Rheumatology (JIA ACR) 30%, 50%, 70% or 90% responses and the proportions of patients achieving 27-joint Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS27) low disease activity (LDA, <=3.8) and inactive disease (ID, <=1). RESULTS: Of 171 patients enrolled, 62 (36%) completed the long-term extension. Twelve serious infections in 11 patients were reported through 592.8 patient-years of exposure. No cases of congestive heart failure-related AEs, demyelinating disease, lupus-like syndrome, malignancies, tuberculosis or deaths were reported. JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses and JADAS27 LDA were achieved in 66% to 96% of patients at week 104, and 63 (37%) patients achieved clinical remission (JADAS27 ID sustained for >=6 continuous months) during the study. Attainment of JIA ACR 50 or higher and JADAS27 LDA or ID in the initial weeks were the best predictors of clinical remission. Mean JADAS27 decreased from baseline, 22.5 (n=170), to 2.5 (n=30) at week 312 (observed analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Through 6 years of exposure, adalimumab was well tolerated with significant clinical response (up to clinical remission) and a relatively low retention rate.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra and canakinumab in the transplantation setting. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included KTRs suffered from AA amyloidosis caused by FMF and treated with anakinra or canakinumab (study group, n = 36). Using propensity score matching, we selected 36 patients without FMF or amyloidosis from our database of 696 KTRs as the control group. Primary outcomes were patient and graft survival. Biopsy-confirmed graft rejection, changes in eGFR, hsCRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), proteinuria, and number of monthly attacks were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: All KTRs with FMF began IL-1 blocker therapy with anakinra and nine (25%) were switched to canakinumab. Overall death was more frequent in study group (19.4% vs 0%) (p = 0.005); however, overall graft loss was comparable between study (27.8%) and control groups (36.1%) (p = 0.448). Five- and 10-year graft survival rates were significantly higher in study group (94.4% and 83.3%, respectively) than control group (77.8% and 63.9%, respectively) (p = 0.014 and p<0.001, respectively). Rejections were numerically lower in study group (8.3% vs 25%), but it did not reach to statistical significance (p = 0.058). When compared to pre-treatment period, with IL-1 blockers, number of attacks per month (p<0.001), eGFR (p = 0.004), hsCRP (p<0.001) and ESR (p = 0.026) levels were lower throughout the follow-up; whereas proteinuria levels were not. CONCLUSIONS: Anakinra and canakinumab are effective in KTRs suffering from FMF; however, mortality rate may be of concern.",

The aim of the present study is to evaluate demographic, clinical, laboratory, and prognostic characteristics and outcome measures of these patients. METHODS: Eighty-one renal transplant recipients with FMF-associated AA amyloidosis (group 1) and propensity score-matched transplant recipients (group 2, n = 81) with nonamyloidosis etiologies were evaluated in this retrospective, multicenter study. Recurrence of AA amyloidosis was diagnosed in 21 patients (group 1a), and their features were compared with 21 propensity score-matched recipients with FMF amyloidosis with no laboratory signs of recurrence (group 1b). RESULTS: The risk of overall allograft loss was higher in group 1 compared with group 2 (25 [30.9%] versus 12 [14.8%]; P = 0.015 [hazard ratio, 2.083; 95% confidence interval, 1.126-3.856]). Patients in group 1 were characterized by an increased risk of mortality compared with group 2 (11 [13.6%] versus 0%; P = 0.001 [hazard ratio, 1.136; 95% confidence interval, 1.058-1.207]). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 5- and 10-year patient survival rates in group 1 (92.5% and 70.4%) were significantly lower than in group 2 (100% and 100%; P = 0.026 and P = 0.023, respectively). Although not reaching significance, overall, 5- and 10-year graft survival rates (57.1%, 94.7%, and 53.8%, respectively) in group 1a were worse than in group 1b (76.2%, 95%, and 77.8%, respectively; P = 0.19, P = 0.95, and P = 0.27, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: AA amyloidosis is associated with higher risk of mortality after kidney transplantation. Inflammatory indicators should be monitored closely, and persistent high levels of acute-phase reactants should raise concerns about amyloid recurrence in allograft.",

The manufacturer orders prescribe monthly subcutaneous injections. However, a subset of our patients is treated with an \"canakinumab on demand \" (COD) strategy, with wider intervals between drug administrations. Therefore, we aimed to compare disease activity and drug safety between COD and \"canakinumab fixed frequency\" (CFF) policies. METHODS: This retrospective study collected data from three Israeli paediatric rheumatology centres, of children with crFMF who were treated with canakinumab. Epidemiological and clinical parameters, cumulative drug dosages, and adverse events were compared between children treated by both policies. RESULTS: Twenty-five (49 %) children were treated according to COD policy and 26 according to CFF policy. Demographic parameters and most of the disease features did not differ significantly between the groups. Both groups showed significant reduction in attacks after canakinumab introduction. The median number (interquartile range) of attacks per month did not differ significantly between the COD and CFF groups (0.33 (0.08, 0.58) and 0.13 (0, 0.5), respectively, p = 0.485 (even though, per definition, COD patients presumably had an attack before receiving the second canakinumab dose). The mean monthly dose was lower for the COD than the CFF group (1.13 +- 1.13 vs. 3.16 +- 1.46 mg/kg, p < 0.001). Adverse events were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: For individuals with crFMF, COD compared to CFF policy can achieve similar efficacy and safety, with a lower accumulated canakinumab dose, rendering it less immunosuppressive and less expensive.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has robustly affected the global healthcare and economic systems and it was caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from a flu-like illness to severe pneumonia and death. Till September 2022, the cumulative number of cases exceeded 600 million worldwide and deaths were more than 6 million. Colchicine is an alkaloid drug that is used in many autoinflammatory conditions e.g., gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behcet's syndrome. Colchicine inhibits the production of superoxide and the release of interleukins that stimulate the inflammatory cascade. Colchicine decreases the differentiation of myofibroblast and the release of fibrotic mediators including transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) that are related to the fibrosis. Moreover, colchicine has been used to traet viral myocarditis caused by CMV or EBV, interstitial pneumonia, and pericarditis resulting from influenza B infection. Additionally, colchicine is considered safe and affordable with wide availability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess the evidence of colchicine effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was done till May 2022 and yielded 814 articles after ranking the articles according to authors and year of publication. Only 8 clinical trials and cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included for further steps of data collection, analysis, and reporting. RESULTS: This meta-analysis involved 16,488 patients; 8146 patients in the treatment group and 8342 patients in the control group. The results showed that colchicine resulted in a significant reduction in the mortality rate among patients received colchicine in comparison with placebo or standard care (RR 0.35, 95%CI: 0.15-0.79). Colchicine resulted in a significant decrease in the need for O2 therapy in patients with COVID-19 (RR 0.07, 95%CI 0.02-0.27, P = 0.000024). However, colchicine had no significant effect on the following outcomes among COVID-19 patients: the need for hospitalization, ICU admission, artificial ventilation, and hospital discharge rate. Among the PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, colchicine decreased the hospitalization rate (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57-0.99, P = 0.042). However, colchicine had no effect on mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation among this subgroup. CONCLUSION: Colchicine caused a significant clinical improvement among COVID-19 patients as compared with the standard care or placebo, in terms of the need for O2, and mortality. This beneficial effect could play a role in the management of COVID-19 especially severe cases to decrease need for oxygen and to decrease mortality among these patients.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeted at interleukin-1 beta, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in preventing familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) attacks among individuals with colchicine-resistant (crFMF). The manufacturer orders prescribe monthly subcutaneous injections. However, a subset of our patients is treated with an \"canakinumab on demand \" (COD) strategy, with wider intervals between drug administrations. Therefore, we aimed to compare disease activity and drug safety between COD and \"canakinumab fixed frequency\" (CFF) policies. METHODS: This retrospective study collected data from three Israeli paediatric rheumatology centres, of children with crFMF who were treated with canakinumab. Epidemiological and clinical parameters, cumulative drug dosages, and adverse events were compared between children treated by both policies. RESULTS: Twenty-five (49 %) children were treated according to COD policy and 26 according to CFF policy. Demographic parameters and most of the disease features did not differ significantly between the groups. Both groups showed significant reduction in attacks after canakinumab introduction. The median number (interquartile range) of attacks per month did not differ significantly between the COD and CFF groups (0.33 (0.08, 0.58) and 0.13 (0, 0.5), respectively, p = 0.485 (even though, per definition, COD patients presumably had an attack before receiving the second canakinumab dose). The mean monthly dose was lower for the COD than the CFF group (1.13 +- 1.13 vs. 3.16 +- 1.46 mg/kg, p < 0.001). Adverse events were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: For individuals with crFMF, COD compared to CFF policy can achieve similar efficacy and safety, with a lower accumulated canakinumab dose, rendering it less immunosuppressive and less expensive.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) has been a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been seen in COVID-19-infected subjects, and it has frequently resulted in an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Colchicine, an immunomodulatory drug, was used in several studies in the early stages of the pandemic. Colchicine has been shown to prevent the development of renal failure in patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). It has also been reported to reduce fibrosis, which plays a role in chronic kidney disease. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether using Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with better renal function in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised 118 out of 605 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. Some of the subjects (n = 50) received oral Colchicine plus standard care, called the Col ( +) group. The others (n = 68) received only the standard care, called the Col (-) group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other laboratory findings, including lymphocytes, D-dimer, and CRP, were analyzed. RESULTS: The D-dimer and serum creatine levels were significantly reduced in both groups. The number of lymphocytes showed a significant increase in both groups at discharge. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at admission. The reduction of SCr was considerably higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group. Similarly, the improvement of eGFR was higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at discharge and 6-12 mounts follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the use of Colchicine plus standard care was associated with improved renal function in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection.",

                    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), the most common monogenic inflammatory disease, is mainly treated by oral Colchicine. However, 5% of patients are considered non-responders and, therefore, candidates for biologic therapy. Intravenous (IV) Colchicine treatment has been shown to be effective and safe in adult patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of IV Colchicine for pediatric FMF patients in our hospital, refractory to oral Colchicine, by reviewing their medical records. Inclusion criteria were all patients with FMF who commenced treatment with IV Colchicine before the age of 18 years, and received at least 6 months of IV therapy. The patients completed questionnaires to assess the efficacy of the treatment. Between 2004 and 2017, 7 pediatric FMF patients receiving maximal oral Colchicine doses and deemed non-responders were treated with weekly IV Colchicine, including 38 cumulative patient years of follow-up data (a full blood count, renal and liver function tests). All patients were homozygous for the M694V genotype. Long-term follow-up showed normal laboratory results with no Colchicine-related hospital admissions or toxicity. Global health assessment and the number of disease-free days have significantly improved (P < 0.05). Prolonged IV Colchicine use is described in pediatric FMF patients for the first time, with an excellent safety profile in our population, and decrease in intensity and frequency of attacks. In the biological era, IV Colchicine, although not leading to complete remission, may be considered a second-line option in countries where anti-interleukin 1 blockers are not available, or as a third-line option in case of failure to respond to biologics.",

The study was planned within a national network of 21 different centers. Demographics, FMF-related clinical and genetic characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes were obtained. A total of 822 patients with FMF (mean age of 36 years) were included in the study. Fifty-nine of them (7%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by real-time PCR test or chest CT findings. Most FMF patients with COVID-19 (58) had mild and moderate disease activity. All patients were on colchicine treatment. However, 8 of them (13.6%) were not compliant with colchicine use and 9 of them (15.3%) were colchicine resistant. Twelve FMF patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized. There were 4 patients requiring oxygen support. COVID-19 related complications were observed in 2 patients (1 thromboembolism, 1 acute respiratory distress syndrome). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with FMF were older than non-hospitalized patients (median ages: 51 and 31 years, respectively; p: 0.002).

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review presents a modern perspective on the cardiovascular re-purposing of colchicine, the oldest drug in the pharmacopeia other than aspirin that is still in regular use. METHODS: This article presents a brief overview of colchicine's long history as a medicine, as well as a critical review of safety and efficacy from the results of recent cardiovascular clinical trials. FINDINGS: Long-term continuous colchicine use at doses between 0.6 and 2.4 mg has been used to prevent inflammatory flares in patients with gout and familial Mediterranean fever and less commonly employed in a range of other inflammatory conditions. In these settings, lifelong therapy has been found to be safe and well tolerated. Understanding the central role of inflammation in atherosclerosis has led to the search for effective anti-inflammatory agents that can be used continuously in combination with a range of other medications, including lipid-lowering therapies, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulants. The results of recent robust randomized clinical trials of low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) in patients with coronary disease recently led the US Food and Drug Administration to approve its use as a new cornerstone therapy for secondary prevention in patients with coronary disease. Several misconceptions regarding the safety and tolerability of low dose colchicine are addressed.

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review presents a modern perspective on the cardiovascular re-purposing of colchicine, the oldest drug in the pharmacopeia other than aspirin that is still in regular use. METHODS: This article presents a brief overview of colchicine's long history as a medicine, as well as a critical review of safety and efficacy from the results of recent cardiovascular clinical trials. FINDINGS: Long-term continuous colchicine use at doses between 0.6 and 2.4 mg has been used to prevent inflammatory flares in patients with gout and familial Mediterranean fever and less commonly employed in a range of other inflammatory conditions. In these settings, lifelong therapy has been found to be safe and well tolerated. Understanding the central role of inflammation in atherosclerosis has led to the search for effective anti-inflammatory agents that can be used continuously in combination with a range of other medications, including lipid-lowering therapies, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulants. The results of recent robust randomized clinical trials of low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) in patients with coronary disease recently led the US Food and Drug Administration to approve its use as a new cornerstone therapy for secondary prevention in patients with coronary disease. Several misconceptions regarding the safety and tolerability of low dose colchicine are addressed. IMPLICATIONS: Colchicine has emerged from its traditional role in medicine as the prevention of gout flare as the first anti-inflammatory agent to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis.",

                    "abstract": "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is an autoinflammatory disease characterised by fever and arthritis. We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl hospitalised with fever associated with rash, myalgia, arthralgia and polyarticular involvement. Examinations revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Bone marrow biopsy showed polyclonal leukocyte activation. A genetic study revealed a heterozygous mutation of the MEFV gene, c.442G>C (E148Q), which is typical of familial Mediterranean fever. However, the genetic pattern was not associated with a history of recurrent fever, aphthous ulcers of the mouth, abdominal pain, arthralgia and rash. Therefore, a diagnosis of sJIA was made. The patient did not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids improved biochemical examinations; however, AST, ALT, GGT and glycaemia remained elevated and adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment became evident and therefore corticosteroids were withdrawn. Canakinumab (150 mg/4 weeks subcutaneously) was initiated. Biochemical data returned to normal values and clinical symptoms resolved. After 2.5 years of canakinumab treatment, complete disease remission allowed the prolongation of intervals between doses. When the intervals were longer than 10 weeks we discontinued the treatment. The patient is still in remission 2 years after canakinumab withdrawal.",

The characteristic findings of IgAV are palpable purpuric rash, abdominal pain, arthralgia or arthritis, and hematuria. Ischemic complications are very rare in IgAV. Thrombotic complications can be observed after a COVID-19 infection. Also in the presence of familial Mediterranean fever, IgAV may have an atypical or more severe course. CASE: We present a case of IgAV complicated with renal infarction and intestinal ischemia. There was no recent or distant history of COVID-19 in the patient or family members, but the patient`s COVID-19 antibody was positive. In addition, MEFV gene analysis of the patient showed homozygous M694V mutation. The patient did not respond to enoxaparin, pulse methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), iloprost, and cyclophosphamide treatments. She was successfully treated with six sessions of plasmapheresis.

The study was planned within a national network of 21 different centers. Demographics, FMF-related clinical and genetic characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes were obtained. A total of 822 patients with FMF (mean age of 36 years) were included in the study. Fifty-nine of them (7%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by real-time PCR test or chest CT findings. Most FMF patients with COVID-19 (58) had mild and moderate disease activity. All patients were on colchicine treatment. However, 8 of them (13.6%) were not compliant with colchicine use and 9 of them (15.3%) were colchicine resistant. Twelve FMF patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized. There were 4 patients requiring oxygen support. COVID-19 related complications were observed in 2 patients (1 thromboembolism, 1 acute respiratory distress syndrome). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with FMF were older than non-hospitalized patients (median ages: 51 and 31 years, respectively; p: 0.002). Other FMF-related characteristics were similar between the groups. FMF-related characteristics were not found to be associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Thus, FMF may not be a risk factor for poor COVID-19 outcomes.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) has been a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been seen in COVID-19-infected subjects, and it has frequently resulted in an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Colchicine, an immunomodulatory drug, was used in several studies in the early stages of the pandemic. Colchicine has been shown to prevent the development of renal failure in patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). It has also been reported to reduce fibrosis, which plays a role in chronic kidney disease. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether using Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with better renal function in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised 118 out of 605 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. Some of the subjects (n = 50) received oral Colchicine plus standard care, called the Col ( +) group. The others (n = 68) received only the standard care, called the Col (-) group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other laboratory findings, including lymphocytes, D-dimer, and CRP, were analyzed. RESULTS: The D-dimer and serum creatine levels were significantly reduced in both groups. The number of lymphocytes showed a significant increase in both groups at discharge. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at admission. The reduction of SCr was considerably higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group. Similarly, the improvement of eGFR was higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at discharge and 6-12 mounts follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the use of Colchicine plus standard care was associated with improved renal function in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection.",

                    "abstract": "Colchicine is an ancient herbal drug derived from Colchicum autumnale. It was first used to treat familial Mediterranean fever and gout. Based on its unique efficacy as an anti-inflammatory agent, colchicine has been used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, recurrent pericarditis, vascular restenosis, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. More recently, colchicine has also shown therapeutic efficacy in alleviating cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. COLCOT and LoDoCo2 are two milestone clinical trials that confirm the curative effect of long-term administration of colchicine in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. There is growing interest in studying the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of colchicine. The anti-inflammatory action of colchicine is mediated mainly through inhibiting the assembly of microtubules. At the cellular level, colchicine inhibits the following: (1) endothelial cell dysfunction and inflammation; (2) smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration; (3) macrophage chemotaxis, migration, and adhesion; (4) platelet activation. At the molecular level, colchicine reduces proinflammatory cytokine release and inhibits NF-kappaB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this review, we summarize the current clinical trials with proven curative effect of colchicine in treating cardiovascular diseases. We also systematically discuss the mechanisms of colchicine action in cardiovascular therapeutics. Altogether, colchicine, a bioactive constituent from an ancient medicinal herb, exerts unique anti-inflammatory effects and prominent cardiovascular actions, and will charter a new page in cardiovascular medicine.",

The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from a flu-like illness to severe pneumonia and death. Till September 2022, the cumulative number of cases exceeded 600 million worldwide and deaths were more than 6 million. Colchicine is an alkaloid drug that is used in many autoinflammatory conditions e.g., gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behcet's syndrome. Colchicine inhibits the production of superoxide and the release of interleukins that stimulate the inflammatory cascade. Colchicine decreases the differentiation of myofibroblast and the release of fibrotic mediators including transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) that are related to the fibrosis. Moreover, colchicine has been used to traet viral myocarditis caused by CMV or EBV, interstitial pneumonia, and pericarditis resulting from influenza B infection. Additionally, colchicine is considered safe and affordable with wide availability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess the evidence of colchicine effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was done till May 2022 and yielded 814 articles after ranking the articles according to authors and year of publication. Only 8 clinical trials and cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included for further steps of data collection, analysis, and reporting. RESULTS: This meta-analysis involved 16,488 patients; 8146 patients in the treatment group and 8342 patients in the control group. The results showed that colchicine resulted in a significant reduction in the mortality rate among patients received colchicine in comparison with placebo or standard care (RR 0.35, 95%CI: 0.15-0.79). Colchicine resulted in a significant decrease in the need for O2 therapy in patients with COVID-19 (RR 0.07, 95%CI 0.02-0.27, P = 0.000024). However, colchicine had no significant effect on the following outcomes among COVID-19 patients: the need for hospitalization, ICU admission, artificial ventilation, and hospital discharge rate. Among the PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, colchicine decreased the hospitalization rate (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57-0.99, P = 0.042). However, colchicine had no effect on mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation among this subgroup. CONCLUSION: Colchicine caused a significant clinical improvement among COVID-19 patients as compared with the standard care or placebo, in terms of the need for O2, and mortality. This beneficial effect could play a role in the management of COVID-19 especially severe cases to decrease need for oxygen and to decrease mortality among these patients.",

Pat.1 is a 32y at 20 weeks of gestation with acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome and history of familial Mediterranean fever. Case 2 is a 23y with cirrhotic kidneys, stage 5 of chronic kidney disease and dialysis treatment 3 x a week. The pregnancy was an incidental finding. Pat. 3 is a 29y I/0 with history of renal transplantation years ago. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: In pat. 1a renal biopsy confirmed the suspected diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Due to deterioration of the kidney function, she required dialysis up to 6 x a week. In Case 2 the dialysis increased to 6 x a week as well. In both patients, we indicated delivery at 35 weeks of gestational age. Pat. 3 delivered at term without complications. CONCLUSION: A close interdisciplinary cooperation improves neonatal outcome in pregnant women with CKD. Counseling and risk assessment of these patients should be initiated before pregnancy. The care of these high-risk pregnancies needs to be performed at a tertiary care center with the above-mentioned specialists.",

The aim of the present study is to evaluate demographic, clinical, laboratory, and prognostic characteristics and outcome measures of these patients. METHODS: Eighty-one renal transplant recipients with FMF-associated AA amyloidosis (group 1) and propensity score-matched transplant recipients (group 2, n = 81) with nonamyloidosis etiologies were evaluated in this retrospective, multicenter study. Recurrence of AA amyloidosis was diagnosed in 21 patients (group 1a), and their features were compared with 21 propensity score-matched recipients with FMF amyloidosis with no laboratory signs of recurrence (group 1b). RESULTS: The risk of overall allograft loss was higher in group 1 compared with group 2 (25 [30.9%] versus 12 [14.8%]; P = 0.015 [hazard ratio, 2.083; 95% confidence interval, 1.126-3.856]). Patients in group 1 were characterized by an increased risk of mortality compared with group 2 (11 [13.6%] versus 0%; P = 0.001 [hazard ratio, 1.136; 95% confidence interval, 1.058-1.207]). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 5- and 10-year patient survival rates in group 1 (92.5% and 70.4%) were significantly lower than in group 2 (100% and 100%; P = 0.026 and P = 0.023, respectively). Although not reaching significance, overall, 5- and 10-year graft survival rates (57.1%, 94.7%, and 53.8%, respectively) in group 1a were worse than in group 1b (76.2%, 95%, and 77.8%, respectively; P = 0.19, P = 0.95, and P = 0.27, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: AA amyloidosis is associated with higher risk of mortality after kidney transplantation. Inflammatory indicators should be monitored closely, and persistent high levels of acute-phase reactants should raise concerns about amyloid recurrence in allograft.",

RESULTS: Colchicine was stopped in 59.4% by the physician and in 40.6% by the patient/parents. It was ceased at a median of 10.6 years of age (range 2.1-20.5) and attack- and inflammation-free periods of 18.2 months (range 6-148). The median follow-up of 64 patients after colchicine cessation was 37.4 months (range 6.4-154.7). It was restarted in 17 patients due to attacks (n = 11) or elevated acute phase reactants (n = 6). The age at cessation of the colchicine was lower (P = 0.04) and the duration of colchicine treatment until its cessation was shorter (P = 0.007) in group 1 compared with group 2. CONCLUSION: Life-long colchicine treatment may not be required in all FMF patients. There are no current guidelines to determine in which patients it is safe to stop colchicine.

SEARCH METHODS: We used detailed search strategies to search the following databases: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM); China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI); Wan Fang; and VIP. In addition, we also searched the clinical trials registries including ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, as well as references listed in relevant reports.Date of last search: 21 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) of people diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever, comparing active interventions (including colchicine, anakinra, rilonacept, canakinumab, etanercept, infliximab, thalidomide, interferon-alpha, ImmunoGuard  (a herbal dietary supplement) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) with placebo or no treatment, or comparing active drugs to each other. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled data to present the risk ratio or mean difference with their 95% confidence intervals. We assessed overall evidence quality according to the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with a total of 249 participants (aged three to 53 years); five were of cross-over and four of parallel design. Six studies used oral colchicine, one used oral ImmunoGuard  and the remaining two used rilonacept or anakinra as a subcutaneous injection. The duration of each study arm ranged from one to eight months.The three studies of ImmunoGuard , rilonacept and anakinra were generally well-designed, except for an unclear risk of detection bias in one of these. However, some inadequacy existed in the four older studies on colchicine, which had an unclear risk of selection bias, detection bias and reporting bias, and also a high risk of attrition bias and other potential bias. Neither of the two studies comparing a single to a divided dose of colchicine were adequately blinded, furthermore one study had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias, a high risk of attrition bias and other potential bias.We aimed to report on the number of participants experiencing an attack, the timing of attacks, the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis, any adverse drug reactions and the response of a number of biochemical markers from the acute phase of an attack, but data were not available for all outcomes across all comparisons.One study (15 participants) reported a significant reduction in the number of people experiencing attacks at three months with 0.6 mg colchicine three times daily (14% versus 100%), risk ratio 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.95) (low-quality evidence). A further study (22 participants) of 0.5 mg colchicine twice daily showed no significant reduction in the number of participants experiencing attacks at two months (low-quality evidence). A study of rilonacept in individuals who were colchicine-resistant or intolerant (14 participants) also showed no reduction at three months (moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, a study of anakinra given to colchicine-resistant people (25 participants) showed no reduction in the number of participants experiencing an attack at four months (moderate-quality evidence).Three studies reported no significant differences in duration of attacks: one comparing colchicine to placebo (15 participants) (very low-quality evidence); one comparing single-dose colchicine to divided-dose colchicine (90 participants) (moderate-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence). Three studies reported no significant differences in the number of days between attacks: two comparing colchicine to placebo (24 participants in total) (very low-quality evidence); and one comparing rilonacept to placebo (14 participants) (low-quality evidence).No study reported on the prevention of amyloid A amyloidosis.One study of colchicine reported loose stools and frequent bowel movements (very low-quality evidence) and a second reported diarrhoea (very low-quality evidence). The rilonacept study reported no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, headache, respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions and herpes, compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). The ImmunoGuard study observed no side effects (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study reported no significant differences between intervention and placebo, including injection site reaction, headache, presyncope, dyspnea and itching (moderate-quality evidence). When comparing single and divided doses of colchicine, one study reported no difference in adverse events (including anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and elevated liver enzymes) between groups (moderate-quality evidence) and the second study reported no adverse effects were detected.The rilonacept study reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after three months (low-quality evidence). In the ImmunoGuard  study, these indicators were not reduced after one month of treatment (moderate-quality evidence). The anakinra study, reported that C-reactive protein was significantly reduced after four months (moderate-quality evidence). One of the single dose versus divided dose colchicine studies reported no significant reduction in acute phase response indicators after eight months (low-quality evidence), while the second study reported no significant reduction in serum amyloid A concentration after six months (moderate-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There were limited RCTs assessing interventions for people with familial Mediterranean fever. Based on the evidence, three times daily colchicine appears to reduce the number of people experiencing attacks, colchicine single dose and divided dose might not be different for children with familial Mediterranean fever and anakinra might reduce C-reactive protein in colchicine-resistant participants; however, only a few RCTs contributed data for analysis. Further RCTs examining active interventions, not only colchicine, are necessary before a comprehensive conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for reducing inflammation in familial Mediterranean fever can be drawn.",

METHODS: Children with rheumatic diseases using BD who were evaluated in the pediatric allergy department for possible drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) due to BD or any other drug were included in the study. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight children (49.2% boys; 14.6 years [9.9-16.9 years] with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [58%], familial Mediterranean fever [14%], vasculitis [14%], and other diseases [14%]) had used eight different BD with 32 494 infusions/injections.

The incidence of immediate BD HSR was 4.7%, with a clinical presentation of anaphylaxis in 3.9% (tocilizumab [n = 3], rituximab [n = 2], positive skin test with culprit BD [n = 3]). Among patients with BD HSR, the median follow-up was longer (84.5 vs 54 months, P = .048), and renal (33.3% vs 4.1%, P = .002), hematologic involvement (16.7% vs 0, P < .001), and active disease (83.3% vs 13.9%, P < .001) were more common. Logistic regression analysis revealed that renal involvement, more than 14 hospitalizations per lifetime, and more than two different BD used were associated with BD hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: The frequency of severe immediate HSR due to BD was shown to be 3.9% in children with rheumatic diseases. Children with active rheumatic disease and who have exposure to multiple BD should be monitored for BD HSR, particularly during intravenous BD infusions.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This review presents a modern perspective on the cardiovascular re-purposing of colchicine, the oldest drug in the pharmacopeia other than aspirin that is still in regular use. METHODS: This article presents a brief overview of colchicine's long history as a medicine, as well as a critical review of safety and efficacy from the results of recent cardiovascular clinical trials. FINDINGS: Long-term continuous colchicine use at doses between 0.6 and 2.4 mg has been used to prevent inflammatory flares in patients with gout and familial Mediterranean fever and less commonly employed in a range of other inflammatory conditions. In these settings, lifelong therapy has been found to be safe and well tolerated. Understanding the central role of inflammation in atherosclerosis has led to the search for effective anti-inflammatory agents that can be used continuously in combination with a range of other medications, including lipid-lowering therapies, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulants. The results of recent robust randomized clinical trials of low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) in patients with coronary disease recently led the US Food and Drug Administration to approve its use as a new cornerstone therapy for secondary prevention in patients with coronary disease. Several misconceptions regarding the safety and tolerability of low dose colchicine are addressed. IMPLICATIONS: Colchicine has emerged from its traditional role in medicine as the prevention of gout flare as the first anti-inflammatory agent to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis.",

Our aim was to study on a large cohort of European FMF patients the frequency and associated factors of diagnosis delay. Clinical data were extracted from the Juvenile Inflammatory Rheumatism (JIR)-cohort. All FMF patients fulfilled Livneh Criteria and had been sequenced for MEFV exon 10. FMF-diagnostic delay (d-FMF) was defined as the duration between the onset of the symptoms and the diagnosis of more than 10 years. 960 FMF patients were enrolled: delayed diagnosis (d-FMF) was noted in 200 patients (20%). d-FMF patients were significantly older compared to non d-FMF with a median age of 46.4 years old vs. 15.5 (p < 0.0001). Women displayed more d-FMF compared to men (56 vs. 47%, p = 0.03). Clinical presentation during attacks was not statistically significant except for erysipelas-like erythema, which was higher among d-FMF patients (33 vs. 22%, p = 0.0003). The presence of one or two pathogenic MEFV mutation was not different between patients. Compared to other FMF, d-FMF patients displayed significantly more AA amyloidosis (10 vs. 2.6%, p < 0.0001) and received more biotherapy (18 vs. 3.8%, p < 0.0001). Twenty percent of FMF patients had a diagnostic delay >10 years, including more women. The differential diagnosis of abdominal attacks with menstrual pain may be an explanation, and erysipelas-like erythema may not be recognized as FMF by all practitioners.",

A fortynine years old woman with a history of kidney transplantation is described here. Anakinra was initiated in the patients whose FMF attacks were exacerbated, and the inflammation could not be controlled under the colchicine treatment. After eight months of follow up under Anakinra treatment, a moderate but persistent increase in serum creatinine level was observed. Allograft biopsy was compatible with acute T cell-mediated rejection with BANFF type 2A. Data on the use of Anakinra in KTRs is limited.

                    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic auto-inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and serositis. Although colchicine is the first line treatment in FMF, 5-10% of patients do not respond to colchicine. Canakinumab, an anti-IL-1beta monoclonal antibody, has been reported to be effective and safe in colchicine-resistant FMF patients, but the adequate duration and interval of treatment is still a matter of debate. Aim of this study was to evaluate the success of the standardized treatment protocol for canakinumab applied in our Pediatric Rheumatology Department in colchicine-resistant FMF cases with a review of the literature. Nine patients included in this study had indications for canakinumab use as colchicine resistance and recurrent corticosteroid need for pleural/pericardial effusions. Canakinumab was administered monthly for 6 months (initial treatment), bimonthly for 6 months (maintenance treatment), then treatment was discontinued. For the patients who developed a new attack after one-year treatment period, canakinumab was readministered with 3-month intervals (continuation treatment). The mean follow-up time beginning from the first canakinumab injection was 24.3 +- 10.2 (6-33) months. None of the patients had an attack during the first-year treatment. Four of the patients developed an attack 9.0 +- 2.9 (6-12) months after discontinuation of treatment and switched to the continuation treatment period, with no more attacks. We suggest that this standard protocol may be used successfully in colchicine-resistant FMF patients.",

METHODS: The study included 30 FMF patients with homozygous M694V mutation in remission under colchicine therapy, 12 asymptomatic FMF carriers with heterozygous M694V mutation, and 41 age-sex-matched healthy controls. All patients underwent detailed eye examination, and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT), macular vascular densities, and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) areas were measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography. RESULTS: In this study, the mean pRNFL thickness was statistically significantly thinner (p=0.010) in the FMF patients group compared to the FMF carriers group and the healthy control group, especially in the inferior quadrant of pRNFL (p=0.042). The CMT in asymptomatic FMF carriers group was statistically significantly thicker than in FMF patients group (p=0.037), especially the superior and inferior quadrants of macula were affected (p=0.024; p=0.020, respectively). In addition, this study showed that the changes of pRNFL thickness and CMT in pediatric patients with FMF were moderately correlated with the duration of diagnosis. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of macular vascular densities and FAZ values. CONCLUSION: FMF is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease that causes multi-organ involvement, and this study showed that posterior segment ocular parameters could be affected not only in FMF patients but also in asymptomatic FMF carriers.",

METHODS: We used electronic medical records to obtain data about the total number of the insured population and the number of FMF patients in the two largest health management organizations in Jerusalem, Clalit and Meuhedet. The total number of COVID-19 inpatients at the Hadassah Medical Center, including those with FMF, for the period between 1 February 2020 and 10March 2021, was retrieved from the electronic medical records of Hadassah. COVID-19 course was compared between the FMF inpatient group and age-, sex-, ethnicity- and comorbidity-matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. Each FMF inpatient was matched with two non-FMF controls. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference in the odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 between FMF patients and the non-FMF population (0.46% vs 0.41%, P = 0.73). Furthermore, we found similar disease severity and therapeutic approach in FMF COVID-19 inpatients and matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Neither FMF nor baseline colchicine therapy, appear to affect the incidence of hospitalization for COVID-19 or the disease course, in terms of severity and therapeutic approach.",

Pyrexia resulted in therapy discontinuation in up to 26% of patients that otherwise were benefiting from the treatment. Little is known about the pathogenesis and optimal management of this common AE. We hypothesized that the etiology of pyrexia in patients treated with DT could be extrapolated from DT-related cutaneous adverse effects in which a paradoxical MAPK pathway activation has been identified. Based on preliminary data by our group suggesting an upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in human lymphocytes exposed to dabrafenib and trametinib, specifically elevated expression of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK), and ERK5 (p-ERK5), we hypothesized that the mechanism of MAPK pathway activation with DT therapy is similar to that reported in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a rare, inherited condition characterized by episodes of fever and rash that responds exceedingly well to colchicine-based therapy in which the MAPK pathway is hyper-activated. Based on this association, our group explored the use of oral colchicine for the treatment of DT-associated pyrexia in five patients with metastatic melanoma.",

Recently, it was shown that FMF patients with early disease onset have more severe disease. The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, clinical and genetic features of FMF patients who had disease onset during the neonatal period. Methods: Medical records of all patients diagnosed as FMF and had been seen in the outpatient clinic of Paediatric Rheumatology department between January 2013 and January 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with disease onset during the first month of life were included to the study. Results: Among 317 patients; 19 (12 males) were included to the study. Approximately 60% of the patients had family history of FMF. Homozygous p.M694V mutation was detected in 42% of the cases. Thirteen patients present with attacks of fever and remaining had attacks in the form of restlessness, resembling infantile colic starting in the neonatal period. Majority of these patients developed classical abdominal attacks between the ages of 1 and 2.5 years. The diagnosis of FMF was significantly delayed; the median age at onset of therapy was 3.5 years (range 7 months-17 years). Conclusion: Patients with FMF could have complaints even in the neonatal period. Homozygous p.M694V mutation is a prominent mutation in this group of patients. In order to prevent diagnostic delay physicians dealing with these type of patients should be more vigilant.",

                    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic auto-inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and serositis. Although colchicine is the first line treatment in FMF, 5-10% of patients do not respond to colchicine. Canakinumab, an anti-IL-1beta monoclonal antibody, has been reported to be effective and safe in colchicine-resistant FMF patients, but the adequate duration and interval of treatment is still a matter of debate. Aim of this study was to evaluate the success of the standardized treatment protocol for canakinumab applied in our Pediatric Rheumatology Department in colchicine-resistant FMF cases with a review of the literature. Nine patients included in this study had indications for canakinumab use as colchicine resistance and recurrent corticosteroid need for pleural/pericardial effusions. Canakinumab was administered monthly for 6 months (initial treatment), bimonthly for 6 months (maintenance treatment), then treatment was discontinued. For the patients who developed a new attack after one-year treatment period, canakinumab was readministered with 3-month intervals (continuation treatment). The mean follow-up time beginning from the first canakinumab injection was 24.3 +- 10.2 (6-33) months. None of the patients had an attack during the first-year treatment. Four of the patients developed an attack 9.0 +- 2.9 (6-12) months after discontinuation of treatment and switched to the continuation treatment period, with no more attacks. We suggest that this standard protocol may be used successfully in colchicine-resistant FMF patients.",

Amyloidosis secondary to FMF is an important cause of end-stage renal failure, and kidney transplantation (KT) in these cases can be complicated, with long-term results oftentimes inferior compared with organ transplant in patients without FMF. The present study aims to show the long-term results of patients with secondary amyloidosis caused by FMF undergoing KT . METHODS: We enrolled 27 patients with a history of FMF amyloidosis undergoing KT and a control group of 614 patients undergoing KT between 2005 and 2018 at Ankara University Medical School. All data were recorded retrospectively from patients files.

Amyloidosis secondary to FMF is an important cause of end-stage renal failure, and kidney transplantation (KT) in these cases can be complicated, with long-term results oftentimes inferior compared with organ transplant in patients without FMF. The present study aims to show the long-term results of patients with secondary amyloidosis caused by FMF undergoing KT . METHODS: We enrolled 27 patients with a history of FMF amyloidosis undergoing KT and a control group of 614 patients undergoing KT between 2005 and 2018 at Ankara University Medical School. All data were recorded retrospectively from patients files. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (81.5%) were treated with triple immunosuppressive therapy consisting of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and a steroid; 5 patients (18.5%) were treated with tacrolimus, azathioprine, and prednisolone.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) has been a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been seen in COVID-19-infected subjects, and it has frequently resulted in an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Colchicine, an immunomodulatory drug, was used in several studies in the early stages of the pandemic. Colchicine has been shown to prevent the development of renal failure in patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). It has also been reported to reduce fibrosis, which plays a role in chronic kidney disease. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether using Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with better renal function in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised 118 out of 605 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. Some of the subjects (n = 50) received oral Colchicine plus standard care, called the Col ( +) group. The others (n = 68) received only the standard care, called the Col (-) group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other laboratory findings, including lymphocytes, D-dimer, and CRP, were analyzed. RESULTS: The D-dimer and serum creatine levels were significantly reduced in both groups. The number of lymphocytes showed a significant increase in both groups at discharge. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at admission. The reduction of SCr was considerably higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group. Similarly, the improvement of eGFR was higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at discharge and 6-12 mounts follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the use of Colchicine plus standard care was associated with improved renal function in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection.",

Anti-interleukin-1 drugs emerge as a therapeutic option for colchicine-resistant patients. In this study, we aimed to document our experience with canakinumab use in kidney transplant recipients who developed AA amyloidosis due to FMF. METHODS: A total of nine patients with FMF amyloidosis treated with canakinumab were enrolled. Laboratory and clinical data were collected from the patient files, electronic database of the hospital and with interviews. RESULTS: Five of the patients were male and four were female (median age: 33, range: 27-62 years). All of the patients had rapid or gradual disappearance of FMF attacks. The following changes in the laboratory parameters were observed before and after the treatment: C-reactive protein: 18.31 +- 13.58 mg/L vs 9.98 +- 11.66 mg/L, creatinine clearance: 45.27 +- 21.5 mL/min vs 50.71 +- 22.48 mL/min, and 24-hour proteinuria: 2381.8 +- 3910.4 mg vs 710.0 +- 1117.5 mg; there were no statistically significant differences on those parameters. One patient developed a reaction to injection while another showed symptoms of Cytomegalovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Canakinumab can be considered as a safe and efficient drug in preventing the FMF attacks in kidney transplant recipients.",

Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor blocker and a treatment option for patients with FMF. There is no reported rejection episode associated with the use of Anakinra in the literature. A fortynine years old woman with a history of kidney transplantation is described here. Anakinra was initiated in the patients whose FMF attacks were exacerbated, and the inflammation could not be controlled under the colchicine treatment. After eight months of follow up under Anakinra treatment, a moderate but persistent increase in serum creatinine level was observed. Allograft biopsy was compatible with acute T cell-mediated rejection with BANFF type 2A. Data on the use of Anakinra in KTRs is limited. Antidrug- antibodies or hapten induced T cell activation may facilitate late-onset acute T cell-mediated rejection in the patient who used Anakinra.",

Patients unable to continue colchicine for various reasons were identified and grouped as those receiving the canakinumab + colchicine combination (CAN + CLC) and canakinumab monotherapy (CANmono). Attack frequency, C-reactive protein (CRP), urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR), and kidney function tests were recorded before and after canakinumab treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients receiving canakinumab treatment were included in the study. Thirty-one patients (56.4%) used CAN + CLC and 24 (43.6%) CANmono. With both CAN + CLC and CANmono treatment, there was no significant change in UPCR of patient groups with GFR > 60 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis was present in 21 (38.2%) patients. In patients with AA amyloidosis receiving CAN + CLC, there was a nonsignificant decrease in UPCR and increased creatinine levels after treatment (p = 0.214 and p = 0.051, respectively). Median GFR decreased significantly from 69 (IQR, mg/dl, 45-95) to 44 (IQR, mg/dl, 28-75) with CAN + CLC treatment (p = 0.021). In the CANmono group, compared to baseline values, there was no significant change in posttreatment UPCR, serum creatinine, and GFR values. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to make a recommendation regarding the discontinuation or continuation of colchicine treatment in all FMF patients who initiated anti-IL-1 treatment. Canakinumab can be continued as monotherapy in patients who cannot continue colchicine treatment due to side effects and patient noncompliance.",

Patients of this cohort were retrospectively evaluated for a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) polymerized chain reaction (PCR) test result and information regarding hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and mortality were collected from medical records.Out of a total 496 FMF patients, 34 were detected to have a positive SARS-CoV 2 PCR test. Eighty-five point three percent of these patients were under colchicine treatment and 17.6% were under interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitor treatment. Eight of the 34 patients (23.9%) were found to be hospitalized, one of them was admitted to the intensive care unit and died thereafter (2.9%). An increasing trend in the frequency of comorbid diseases (presence of at least one comorbidity 64.7% in all patients vs 75.0% in hospitalized patients) and IL-1 inhibitor usage (17.6% in all patients vs 50.0% in hospitalized patients) was observed in hospitalized patients.Rates of comorbid diseases and IL-1 inhibitor use for FMF were observed to be increased in FMF patients hospitalized for COVID-19.",

METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using Embase , MEDLINE , MEDLINE -In Process, and Cochrane databases to identify randomized/non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs/non-RCTs) and real-world observational studies of FMF published as full-text articles (2000-September 2017) or conference abstracts (2014-September 2017). Studies with data for >=1 biologic were included. Studies with <5 patients were excluded. RESULTS: Of the 3342 retrieved records, 67 publications, yielding 38 unique studies, were included. All studies were published after the year 2010, and the majority (21) were full-text articles. Most studies (33/38) were prospective/retrospective observational; three were double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs (one each of anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept); and two were non-RCTs (both canakinumab). Anakinra (26), canakinumab (21) and etanercept (6) were the most frequently used biologics across studies, whereas use of adalimumab, tocilizumab, rilonacept and infliximab was limited (1-2 studies). The available evidence suggested benefits of anakinra and canakinumab in FMF. CONCLUSION: Anti-IL-1 therapies (i.e. anakinra and canakinumab) appear to be effective and safe options in the treatment of overall FMF, including patients with colchicine resistance and FMF-related amyloidosis. There is a need for properly designed prospective or controlled studies to conclude the superiority of one anti-IL-1 therapy over another.

Although worse prognosis has been attributed to the AL amyloidosis, AA amyloidosis can be related to higher mortality under renal replacement therapies. However, there are no sufficient data regarding etiology, clinical presentation, and prognostic factors of AA amyloidosis. The objective of our study is to evaluate the clinical, laboratory characteristics, and possible predictive factors related to mortality in patients with AA amyloidosis undergoing hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: This multicenter, cross-sectional study was a retrospective analysis of 2100 patients on HD. It was carried out in 14 selected HD centers throughout Turkey. Thirty-two patients with biopsy-proven AA amyloidosis and thirty-two control patients without AA amyloidosis undergoing HD were included between October 2018 and October 2019. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age and dialysis vintage.

FINDINGS: Prevalence of AA amyloidosis was found to be 1.87% in HD centers. In amyloidosis and control groups, 56% and 53% were male, mean age was 54 +- 11 and 53 +- 11 years, and mean dialysis vintage was 104 +- 94 and 107 +- 95 months, respectively. FMF was the most common cause of AA amyloidosis (59.5%). All FMF patients received colchicine and the mean colchicine dose was 0.70 +- 0.30 mg/day. 26.3% of FMF patients were unresponsive to colchicine and anti-IL-1 treatment was used in these patients. In AA amyloid and control groups, erythropoietin-stimulating agents resistance index were 7.88 +- 3.78 and 5.41 +- 3.06 IU/kg/week/g/dl, respectively (p = 0.008).

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) has been a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been seen in COVID-19-infected subjects, and it has frequently resulted in an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Colchicine, an immunomodulatory drug, was used in several studies in the early stages of the pandemic. Colchicine has been shown to prevent the development of renal failure in patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). It has also been reported to reduce fibrosis, which plays a role in chronic kidney disease. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether using Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with better renal function in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study comprised 118 out of 605 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. Some of the subjects (n = 50) received oral Colchicine plus standard care, called the Col ( +) group. The others (n = 68) received only the standard care, called the Col (-) group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other laboratory findings, including lymphocytes, D-dimer, and CRP, were analyzed. RESULTS: The D-dimer and serum creatine levels were significantly reduced in both groups. The number of lymphocytes showed a significant increase in both groups at discharge. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at admission. The reduction of SCr was considerably higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group. Similarly, the improvement of eGFR was higher in the Col ( +) group than in the Col (-) group at discharge and 6-12 mounts follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the use of Colchicine plus standard care was associated with improved renal function in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection.",

Anti-interleukin-1 drugs emerge as a therapeutic option for colchicine-resistant patients. In this study, we aimed to document our experience with canakinumab use in kidney transplant recipients who developed AA amyloidosis due to FMF. METHODS: A total of nine patients with FMF amyloidosis treated with canakinumab were enrolled. Laboratory and clinical data were collected from the patient files, electronic database of the hospital and with interviews. RESULTS: Five of the patients were male and four were female (median age: 33, range: 27-62 years). All of the patients had rapid or gradual disappearance of FMF attacks. The following changes in the laboratory parameters were observed before and after the treatment: C-reactive protein: 18.31 +- 13.58 mg/L vs 9.98 +- 11.66 mg/L, creatinine clearance: 45.27 +- 21.5 mL/min vs 50.71 +- 22.48 mL/min, and 24-hour proteinuria: 2381.8 +- 3910.4 mg vs 710.0 +- 1117.5 mg; there were no statistically significant differences on those parameters. One patient developed a reaction to injection while another showed symptoms of Cytomegalovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Canakinumab can be considered as a safe and efficient drug in preventing the FMF attacks in kidney transplant recipients.",

Most studies (33/38) were prospective/retrospective observational; three were double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs (one each of anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept); and two were non-RCTs (both canakinumab). Anakinra (26), canakinumab (21) and etanercept (6) were the most frequently used biologics across studies, whereas use of adalimumab, tocilizumab, rilonacept and infliximab was limited (1-2 studies). The available evidence suggested benefits of anakinra and canakinumab in FMF. CONCLUSION: Anti-IL-1 therapies (i.e. anakinra and canakinumab) appear to be effective and safe options in the treatment of overall FMF, including patients with colchicine resistance and FMF-related amyloidosis. There is a need for properly designed prospective or controlled studies to conclude the superiority of one anti-IL-1 therapy over another.

The study was planned within a national network of 21 different centers. Demographics, FMF-related clinical and genetic characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes were obtained. A total of 822 patients with FMF (mean age of 36 years) were included in the study. Fifty-nine of them (7%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by real-time PCR test or chest CT findings. Most FMF patients with COVID-19 (58) had mild and moderate disease activity. All patients were on colchicine treatment. However, 8 of them (13.6%) were not compliant with colchicine use and 9 of them (15.3%) were colchicine resistant. Twelve FMF patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized. There were 4 patients requiring oxygen support. COVID-19 related complications were observed in 2 patients (1 thromboembolism, 1 acute respiratory distress syndrome). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with FMF were older than non-hospitalized patients (median ages: 51 and 31 years, respectively; p: 0.002). Other FMF-related characteristics were similar between the groups. FMF-related characteristics were not found to be associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Thus, FMF may not be a risk factor for poor COVID-19 outcomes.",

The aim of this study was to see whether there is any factor associated with the withdrawal of these anti-IL-1 agents and to investigate the characteristics of colchicine-resistant FMF patients who needed biological therapy. METHODS: Demographic, clinical characteristics, and disease severity of patients, at 2 referral centers, between 2012 and 2022, in whom anti-IL-1 treatment was continued and discontinued, were compared in this study.

METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups according to the age of disease onset: group 1 includes the patients who had their first attack <=3 years of age; group 2 consisted of patients who had their first attack >3 years of age. Furthermore, we compared the proportion of patients fulfilling the three diagnostic criteria among two groups. RESULTS: Of 1687 patients, 761 had first FMF attack at <=3 years of age while 926 patients presented with their first manifestation of FMF at >3 years. Delay in diagnosis, fever and peritonitis were significantly higher in group 1. Frequency of arthritis, erysipelas-like erythema, non-nephrotic proteinuria, incomplete attacks, chronic arthritis, arthralgia and mean colchicine dose were significantly higher in group 2.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the differences in attack characteristics, acute-phase reactants, and renal outcomes in patients using canakinumab with or without colchicine treatment. METHODS: FMF patients treated with canakinumab for >= 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. Patients unable to continue colchicine for various reasons were identified and grouped as those receiving the canakinumab + colchicine combination (CAN + CLC) and canakinumab monotherapy (CANmono). Attack frequency, C-reactive protein (CRP), urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR), and kidney function tests were recorded before and after canakinumab treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients receiving canakinumab treatment were included in the study. Thirty-one patients (56.4%) used CAN + CLC and 24 (43.6%) CANmono. With both CAN + CLC and CANmono treatment, there was no significant change in UPCR of patient groups with GFR > 60 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis was present in 21 (38.2%) patients. In patients with AA amyloidosis receiving CAN + CLC, there was a nonsignificant decrease in UPCR and increased creatinine levels after treatment (p = 0.214 and p = 0.051, respectively). Median GFR decreased significantly from 69 (IQR, mg/dl, 45-95) to 44 (IQR, mg/dl, 28-75) with CAN + CLC treatment (p = 0.021). In the CANmono group, compared to baseline values, there was no significant change in posttreatment UPCR, serum creatinine, and GFR values. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to make a recommendation regarding the discontinuation or continuation of colchicine treatment in all FMF patients who initiated anti-IL-1 treatment. Canakinumab can be continued as monotherapy in patients who cannot continue colchicine treatment due to side effects and patient noncompliance.",

METHODS: Children aged 4-17 years with polyarticular JIA were enrolled in a phase III, randomised-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial consisting of a 16-week open-label lead-in period, 32-week randomised double-blind period and 360-week long-term extension. Patients were stratified by baseline methotrexate use. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored, and efficacy assessments included JIA American College of Rheumatology (JIA ACR) 30%, 50%, 70% or 90% responses and the proportions of patients achieving 27-joint Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS27) low disease activity (LDA, <=3.8) and inactive disease (ID, <=1). RESULTS: Of 171 patients enrolled, 62 (36%) completed the long-term extension. Twelve serious infections in 11 patients were reported through 592.8 patient-years of exposure. No cases of congestive heart failure-related AEs, demyelinating disease, lupus-like syndrome, malignancies, tuberculosis or deaths were reported. JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses and JADAS27 LDA were achieved in 66% to 96% of patients at week 104, and 63 (37%) patients achieved clinical remission (JADAS27 ID sustained for >=6 continuous months) during the study. Attainment of JIA ACR 50 or higher and JADAS27 LDA or ID in the initial weeks were the best predictors of clinical remission. Mean JADAS27 decreased from baseline, 22.5 (n=170), to 2.5 (n=30) at week 312 (observed analysis).

METHODS: Children aged 4-17 years with polyarticular JIA were enrolled in a phase III, randomised-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial consisting of a 16-week open-label lead-in period, 32-week randomised double-blind period and 360-week long-term extension. Patients were stratified by baseline methotrexate use. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored, and efficacy assessments included JIA American College of Rheumatology (JIA ACR) 30%, 50%, 70% or 90% responses and the proportions of patients achieving 27-joint Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS27) low disease activity (LDA, <=3.8) and inactive disease (ID, <=1). RESULTS: Of 171 patients enrolled, 62 (36%) completed the long-term extension. Twelve serious infections in 11 patients were reported through 592.8 patient-years of exposure. No cases of congestive heart failure-related AEs, demyelinating disease, lupus-like syndrome, malignancies, tuberculosis or deaths were reported. JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses and JADAS27 LDA were achieved in 66% to 96% of patients at week 104, and 63 (37%) patients achieved clinical remission (JADAS27 ID sustained for >=6 continuous months) during the study. Attainment of JIA ACR 50 or higher and JADAS27 LDA or ID in the initial weeks were the best predictors of clinical remission. Mean JADAS27 decreased from baseline, 22.5 (n=170), to 2.5 (n=30) at week 312 (observed analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Through 6 years of exposure, adalimumab was well tolerated with significant clinical response (up to clinical remission) and a relatively low retention rate.",

RESULTS: Eleven patients with FMF, 9 with MKD, 3 with TRAPS, and 1 with DADA2 were included. The median age (range) at diagnosis and drug initiation was 6.06 (1.45-16.06) years and 9.72 (1.82-19.11) years, respectively. The mean weight, height, and BMI SD scores significantly increased after canakinumab. There were significant improvements in laboratory parameters and disease activities. However, growth parameters after the drug did not differ according to gender, the duration of diagnostic delay, and age at the diagnosis.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the differences in attack characteristics, acute-phase reactants, and renal outcomes in patients using canakinumab with or without colchicine treatment. METHODS: FMF patients treated with canakinumab for >= 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. Patients unable to continue colchicine for various reasons were identified and grouped as those receiving the canakinumab + colchicine combination (CAN + CLC) and canakinumab monotherapy (CANmono). Attack frequency, C-reactive protein (CRP), urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR), and kidney function tests were recorded before and after canakinumab treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients receiving canakinumab treatment were included in the study. Thirty-one patients (56.4%) used CAN + CLC and 24 (43.6%) CANmono. With both CAN + CLC and CANmono treatment, there was no significant change in UPCR of patient groups with GFR > 60 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis was present in 21 (38.2%) patients. In patients with AA amyloidosis receiving CAN + CLC, there was a nonsignificant decrease in UPCR and increased creatinine levels after treatment (p = 0.214 and p = 0.051, respectively). Median GFR decreased significantly from 69 (IQR, mg/dl, 45-95) to 44 (IQR, mg/dl, 28-75) with CAN + CLC treatment (p = 0.021). In the CANmono group, compared to baseline values, there was no significant change in posttreatment UPCR, serum creatinine, and GFR values. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to make a recommendation regarding the discontinuation or continuation of colchicine treatment in all FMF patients who initiated anti-IL-1 treatment. Canakinumab can be continued as monotherapy in patients who cannot continue colchicine treatment due to side effects and patient noncompliance.",

Pyrexia resulted in therapy discontinuation in up to 26% of patients that otherwise were benefiting from the treatment. Little is known about the pathogenesis and optimal management of this common AE. We hypothesized that the etiology of pyrexia in patients treated with DT could be extrapolated from DT-related cutaneous adverse effects in which a paradoxical MAPK pathway activation has been identified. Based on preliminary data by our group suggesting an upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in human lymphocytes exposed to dabrafenib and trametinib, specifically elevated expression of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK), and ERK5 (p-ERK5), we hypothesized that the mechanism of MAPK pathway activation with DT therapy is similar to that reported in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a rare, inherited condition characterized by episodes of fever and rash that responds exceedingly well to colchicine-based therapy in which the MAPK pathway is hyper-activated. Based on this association, our group explored the use of oral colchicine for the treatment of DT-associated pyrexia in five patients with metastatic melanoma.",

METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups according to the age of disease onset: group 1 includes the patients who had their first attack <=3 years of age; group 2 consisted of patients who had their first attack >3 years of age. Furthermore, we compared the proportion of patients fulfilling the three diagnostic criteria among two groups. RESULTS: Of 1687 patients, 761 had first FMF attack at <=3 years of age while 926 patients presented with their first manifestation of FMF at >3 years. Delay in diagnosis, fever and peritonitis were significantly higher in group 1. Frequency of arthritis, erysipelas-like erythema, non-nephrotic proteinuria, incomplete attacks, chronic arthritis, arthralgia and mean colchicine dose were significantly higher in group 2. Mean Pras score was higher and the presence of M694V mutation was more frequent in group 1. The percentage of children diagnosed according to Tel-Hashomer and pediatric criteria was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2. However, both groups meet Livneh criteria similarly. CONCLUSION: Although patients with early disease onset seem to have more severe disease course, they are more likely to have a delay in diagnosis. To avoid the diagnostic delay, clinicians should be aware of the findings of FMF in early age.",

Although colchicine is the first-line therapy in patients with FMF with 60% to 65% complete remission rates, 5% to 10% of patients are colchicine-resistant and 5% to 10% of them are intolerant to the therapy. Anti-interleukin-1 agents, such as anakinra and canakinumab, are safe and efficient therapeutic options in patients with colchicine resistance or intolerance. However, the data on management of these targeted agents is limited in recipients of kidney transplant (RKT). In this case series, we aim to share our experience on canakinumab therapy of 4 RKTs with FMF-related amyloidosis, who were followed up in our clinic between 2010 and 2017. All of the 4 patients with end-stage renal disease were colchicine- resistant and on other alternative therapies, which provided poor disease control. For efficient control of secondary amyloidosis, canakinumab therapy was initiated in 1 of the patients before the renal transplant, and for the remaining patients after renal transplant. Any serious adverse effect, development of proteinuria, or graft dysfunction has not been observed in any of the patients. Under the canakinumab treatment, complete clinical responses, prevent typical familial Mediterranean fever attacks with fever and arthritis and abdominal pain, normalized serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels were achieved in all patients. Canakinumab treatment is a safe and effective therapeutic option for RKTs with FMF who are resistant or intolerant to colchicine and anakinra.",

Three patients, who were on regular follow-up due to the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), contracted COVID-19 infection; and their pre-clinical and post-clinical data as well as laboratory, prognosis and treatment data were investigated. Effects of colchicine in FMF patients who contracted COVID-19 infection were presented in this study. All the cases recovered from COVID-19 without complications.

The disorder affects up to 1 in 200 people making it a very common etiology for pain states worldwide, including serositis mediated painful states of the chest, joint, and abdomen. RECENT FINDINGS: Defined by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation, FMF can lead to not only severe pain, but complications such as renal amyloidosis, if untreated. This narrative review explores the genetic basis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and current management strategies for FMF. Mutations in the MEFV gene result in the dysregulation of the pyrin inflammasome, leading to excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. Diagnosis primarily relies on clinical criteria supported by genetic testing. Colchicine remains the cornerstone of treatment, effectively preventing inflammatory attacks and complications. For colchicine-resistant patients, IL-1 antagonists like anakinra and canakinumab show promise, although their long-term benefits require further investigation. The present investigation underscores the importance of early diagnosis and integrated treatment approaches to improve patient outcomes, pain management, and quality of life.",

Approximately 5%-10% of patients may respond inadequately to colchicine, and anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) agents are important treatment options in these patients. The aim of this study was to see whether there is any factor associated with the withdrawal of these anti-IL-1 agents and to investigate the characteristics of colchicine-resistant FMF patients who needed biological therapy. METHODS: Demographic, clinical characteristics, and disease severity of patients, at 2 referral centers, between 2012 and 2022, in whom anti-IL-1 treatment was continued and discontinued, were compared in this study. The international severity scoring system for FMF (ISSF) was used for disease severity assessment. RESULTS: In 64 colchicine-resistant FMF patients, the median (interquartile range) duration of biological treatment was 39 (45) months. Treatment of 26 patients (40.6%) was started with anakinra and 38 (59.4%) with canakinumab. During follow-up, anti-IL-1 treatment was discontinued in 23 patients (35.9%). High ISSF scores before biological treatment, presence of exertional leg pain, subclinical inflammation, and comorbidity were found to be statistically more frequent in the group whose biological therapy could not be discontinued (p = 0.009, p = 0.006, p = 0.026, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low ISSF scores before biological treatment with no accompanying exertional leg pain, subclinical inflammation, and comorbidities may be stated as an associated factors in terms of the discontinuation of biological agents in colchicine-resistant pediatric FMF patients.",

                    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disorder predominantly affecting individuals of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent, including those with certain heritages including Sephardic Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, and Arab. The disorder affects up to 1 in 200 people making it a very common etiology for pain states worldwide, including serositis mediated painful states of the chest, joint, and abdomen. RECENT FINDINGS: Defined by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation, FMF can lead to not only severe pain, but complications such as renal amyloidosis, if untreated. This narrative review explores the genetic basis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and current management strategies for FMF. Mutations in the MEFV gene result in the dysregulation of the pyrin inflammasome, leading to excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. Diagnosis primarily relies on clinical criteria supported by genetic testing. Colchicine remains the cornerstone of treatment, effectively preventing inflammatory attacks and complications. For colchicine-resistant patients, IL-1 antagonists like anakinra and canakinumab show promise, although their long-term benefits require further investigation. The present investigation underscores the importance of early diagnosis and integrated treatment approaches to improve patient outcomes, pain management, and quality of life.",

Intravenous (IV) colchicine, administered over several months, has been shown to be effective for FMF patients unresponsive to oral colchicine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term IV colchicine treatment in oral colchicine-resistant FMF. We analyzed data of 15 patients with frequent FMF attacks, despite a maximal tolerated dose of oral colchicine (2-3 mg/day), who were treated with weekly IV injections of 1 mg of colchicine for at least 12 months. Treatment efficacy was determined by changes in frequency, duration and severity of FMF attacks. Safety was assessed according to adverse events. The mean duration of IV colchicine treatment was 5.16 +- 2.85 years. Decreases were observed from pre-treatment period in the monthly mean rates of abdominal attacks (from 5.6 +- 3.7 to 1.9 +- 3.3, p = 0.0009), joint attacks (from 6.5 +- 5.1 to 1.6 +- 1.6, p = 0.01) and overall attacks (from 22.3 +- 16.2 to 7.4 +- 5.7, p = 0.002) as well as in the mean duration (from 3.8 +- 1.5 to 2.4 +- 1.1 days per attack, p = 0.008) and severity of attacks (from 9.9 +- 0.3 to 5.7 +- 2.6, on a scale of 0-10, p < 0.05). The rate of adverse events was low, and they were mainly gastrointestinal. No severe or serious adverse events were recorded. Long-term treatment with IV colchicine in patients unresponsive to oral colchicine therapy is effective and safe.",

Anti-interleukin-1 (Anti-IL-1) treatments are recommended in colchicine resistant and/or intolerant FMF patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of anakinra and canakinumab in FMF patients that are resistant/intolareted to colchicine or complicated with amyloidosis. METHODS: Between January 2014 and March 2019, 65 patients following-up at Sivas Cumhuriyet University (Medical Faculty Rheumatology-Internal Medicine Department) who were diagnosed with FMF according to the criteria of Tel-Hashomer were included in the study. The laboratory values and clinical features of patients and disease activities were recorded at least every 3 months, and these data were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-one (63.1%) patients used anakinra (100 mg/day) and 24 (36.9%) patients used canakinumab (150 mg/8 week). The median duration of anti-IL-1 agents use was 7 months (range, 3-30). Fifteen (23.1%) cases were complicated with amyloidosis. Seven (10.8%) patients had renal transplantation. Overall, the FMF 50 score response was 96.9%. In the group that had a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 60 ml/min/m2, the median proteinuria decreased from 2390 mg/day (range, 1400-7200) to 890 mg/day (range, 120-2750) (p = 0.008). No serious infections were detected, except in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-IL-1 agents are effective and safe in the treatment of FMF patients. These agents are particularly effective at reducing proteinuria in patients with GFR >= 60 ml/min/m2, but less effective in cases with FMF associated with arthritis and sacroiliitis. Large and long follow-up studies are now needed to establish the long-term effects of these treatments.",

Amyloidosis secondary to FMF is an important cause of end-stage renal failure, and kidney transplantation (KT) in these cases can be complicated, with long-term results oftentimes inferior compared with organ transplant in patients without FMF. The present study aims to show the long-term results of patients with secondary amyloidosis caused by FMF undergoing KT . METHODS: We enrolled 27 patients with a history of FMF amyloidosis undergoing KT and a control group of 614 patients undergoing KT between 2005 and 2018 at Ankara University Medical School. All data were recorded retrospectively from patients files. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (81.5%) were treated with triple immunosuppressive therapy consisting of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and a steroid; 5 patients (18.5%) were treated with tacrolimus, azathioprine, and prednisolone. Acute cellular rejection was seen in 3 patients (11.1%), and acute cellular- and antibody-mediated rejection occurred in 1 patient (3.7%).

This study reviewed the long-term survival outcomes of FMF patients who underwent KT. METHODS: We compared the outcomes of 31 patients who underwent (KT) for biopsy-proven amyloidosis secondary to FMF with 31 control patients (five with diabetes mellitus and 26 with nondiabetic kidney disease) undergoing KT between 1994 and 2021 at Baskent University Hospital. All data were recorded retrospectively from patients' files. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE (QUARTILE DEVIATION: QD) at the time of KT in the FMF and control group were 31 (6.7) and 33 (11), respectively. The median follow-up period (QD) after KT was 108 (57) months in the FMF and 132 (72) months in the control group. In the FMF group, graft and patient survivals were 71% and 84% at 5 years and 45% and 48% at 10 years, respectively. In the control group, graft and patient survivals were 79% and 100% at 5 years and 63% and 71% at 10 years, respectively. Patient survival in the FMF group at 5 years was significantly lower than in the control group (p = .045). There was no statistically significant difference between the FMF and control groups in terms of graft and patient survival, and serum creatinine levels at 10 years. All patients were given triple immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Three patients received anakinra and one received canakinumab in addition to colchicine treatment. One FMF patient also underwent heart transplantation due to AA amyloidosis. Of the FMF patients, 11 died during follow-up. CONCLUSION: We have found that the long-term outcome of KT in patients with FMF amyloidosis is numerically worse but not statistically different from the control group. However, short- and long-term complications still need to be resolved.",

The literature was searched in Medline database. Organ-specific or childhood-onset systemic AIDs were excluded. AIDs were divided in three distinct groups: mixed-pattern, polygenic and adult-onset monogenic AIDs. Most adult-onset AIDs are polygenic but late-onset disease is not rare among monogenic AIDs such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). The diagnosis of systemic AIDs in adults is often delayed due to several factors and sometimes it is only established when amyloidosis or other complications are present. Therefore, it probably makes sense to primarily exclude common AIDs in adult patients with fever of unknown origin (and probably different presentations such as polyserositis) since a high prevalence of adult-onset Still's disease or FMF is usually expected. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, immunosuppressive agents, interleukin-1 inhibitors and tumor necrosis factor antagonists constitute common therapeutic options for systemic AIDs.",

There are known triggers to initiate an FMF attack, yet potential effects of intrauterine devices (IUD) in women of reproductive age have not been evaluated before. METHOD: Consecutive female patients with FMF who ever used IUD over the age of 18 were enrolled. Female patients with FMF were sub grouped according to the type of IUD they use. FMF attack frequency, severity, duration, presence of dysmenorrhea, severity of dysmenorrhea, having attacks during menstruation before and after IUD use were questioned. Demographic and clinical data were collected from hospital database. RESULTS: When all patients with IUD use were evaluated, it was found that the frequency of attacks increased after IUD insertion at 3rd and 12th months (median [min-max] attack frequency at 3rd month, 1 (0-3) vs 1 (0-6), p = 0.002, median [min-max] attack frequency at 12th month, 2 (0-12) vs 3.5 (0-18), p = 0.028). Attack severity measured by VAS pain was also significantly increased. Attack duration and menstrual pain was similar before and after IUD use. Attack frequency at 3rd and 12th months, attack severity and menstrual pain was all increased significantly in Cu-IUD users, whereas none of these parameters deteriorated in LNG-IUD group. CONCLUSION: IUD use, especially Cu-IUD, may increase the frequency and severity of attacks in female patients with FMF. Clinicians may benefit from considering LGN-IUD if IUDs are preferred as contraception in women of childbearing age with FMF.",

METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 38 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation and received bDMARDs for rheumatic diseases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected. Severe infections were defined as those requiring hospitalization, and the incidence of severe infections was calculated per 100 patient years. Risk factors for severe infections were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients (median age 40.5 years), 52.6% experienced severe infections, with a total of 39 severe infection episodes. The incidence of severe infections was 26.2 per 100 patient-years. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (43.5%) and pneumonia (30.8%). Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) was the most common rheumatic disease (57.9%), and the median disease duration was 18.5 years. Most patients (68.4%) were using IL-1 inhibitors, and 31.6% were on anti-TNF therapy. There was no significant difference between patients with and without infections in terms of gender, pre-transplant biological therapy use, or type of biological therapy used. Four patients (11%) died from infection-related complications, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic patients receiving bDMARDs post-kidney transplantation have a high risk of severe infections. The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk, necessitating close infection monitoring and management. Key Points   Rheumatic patients treated with biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) following kidney transplantation face a heightened risk of severe infections.   The concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy and bDMARDs may further increase this risk.   Individualized treatment strategies are essential to balance the benefits of bDMARDs with the potential for severe infectious complications.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to present our single-center real-life experience of canakinumab use in adult patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). METHODS: Data were derived from the Gazi FMF cohort, which was established in 2010. From that year, all patients with FMF were registered. The impact of FMF on their lives was tracked by either an FMF diary or mobile phone application (FMF-AIDD, free to download in App Store and Google Play). The records of patients who were treated with canakinumab were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-three adult patients with FMF (65% female) were enrolled in this study. The median age was 32 years (min-max, 24-58 years), and the disease duration was 26 years (14-59 years). A total of 86% of patients harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous exon 10 MEFV mutations. Indications for interleukin 1 inhibitor use were colchicine resistance (n = 12) or intolerance (n = 2), amyloidosis (n = 7), and chronic manifestations of the disease (n = 2). All patients used anakinra before. The median duration of canakinumab use was 7 months (min-max, 1-44 months). Pre- and post-canakinumab periods were compared. Attack severity, duration, frequency, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly improved (p <= 0.01), whereas serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase levels remained the same (p = 0.27 and p = 0.74, respectively). Canakinumab achieved complete disease remission in 14 patients (60%). Canakinumab was discontinued in 7 patients. The reasons for discontinuation were pregnancy (n = 2), dominance of axial spondyloarthropathy (n = 2), inflammatory bowel disease, patient's refusal, and weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Canakinumab is effective in the prevention of FMF bouts without severe adverse effects. Treatment with canakinumab in an individualized dose and interval may be a reasonable choice for colchicine- and anakinra-resistant or -intolerant adult patients with FMF and those with chronic manifestations of disease.",

Considering the current knowledge on the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, it is safe to state that both COVID-19 and inflammatory rheumatic disorders cause a cytokine storm and merit treatment with anti-rheumatic drugs. Three patients, who were on regular follow-up due to the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), contracted COVID-19 infection; and their pre-clinical and post-clinical data as well as laboratory, prognosis and treatment data were investigated. Effects of colchicine in FMF patients who contracted COVID-19 infection were presented in this study. All the cases recovered from COVID-19 without complications. The present study suggests that colchicine can positively affect the prognosis of COVID-19 in FMF patients; therefore, experience of rheumatologists in the use of anti-inflammatory drugs can be highly instrumental in management of COVID-19 patients.",

The Gazi FMF cohort was established in the year 2010, and from that date, 689 patients with FMF diagnosed according to the Tel Hashomer criteria were registered. Attack type, duration, severity, and their impact on life were collected either by disease diaries or a mobile phone application (FMF AIDD, AppStore, and Playstore). A retrospective cohort analysis was made from records of patients who have ever been treated with IL-1 inhibitors. A total of 78 patients were treated with IL-1 inhibitors in our cohort. Among these, 15 patients were identified who received on-demand anakinra. Rationale for on-demand use was prominent prodrome or trigger for attacks and patient's personal claim. Six patients were switched from regular use and nine were directly started as on-demand use. All were using background colchicine in maximum tolerated doses. None of the patients had evidence of persistently elevated acute phase reactants or proteinuria. The median duration of on-demand anakinra use was 6 (3-36) months. Pre- and post- on-demand anakinra periods were compared. Patient reported attack severity (p = 0.002), duration (p = 0.001), frequency (p = 0.001), absenteeism (p = 0.002), and presenteeism (p = 0.002) were significantly improved. On-demand anakinra prevented progression of prodromes to full-blown attacks which was demonstrated by decrease in the rate of attack/prodrome ratio (p = 0.02). On-demand anakinra can be continued in ten subjects on long-term. On-demand anakinra significantly improved FMF attacks in certain patients which suggest this approach would be of benefit in daily practice in selected patients.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Outcomes of kidney transplantation for patients with renal AA amyloidosis are uncertain, with reports of poor survival and high rates of disease recurrence. However, data are inconclusive and mostly based on studies from the early 2000s and earlier. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We searched the French national transplant database to identify all patients with renal AA amyloidosis who underwent kidney transplantation between 2008 and 2018. EXPOSURES: Age, cause of amyloidosis, use of biotherapies, CRP levels. OUTCOMES: Outcomes were all-cause mortality and allograft loss. We also reported amyloidosis allograft recurrence, occurrence of acute rejection episodes, as well as infectious, cardiovascular, and neoplastic disease events. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: The Kaplan-Meier estimator for mortality and the cumulative incidence function method for allograft loss. Factors associated with patient and allograft survival were investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model and a cause-specific hazards model, respectively. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients who received kidney transplants for AA amyloidosis at 26 French centers were included. The median age was 49.4 years (interquartile range 39.7-61.1). The main cause of amyloidosis was Familial Mediterranean Fever (37 cases, 43%). Sixteen (18.6%) patients received a biotherapy after transplantation. Patient survival was 94.0% (95% confidence interval 89.1-99.2) at 1 year and 85.5% (77.8-94.0) at 5 years post-transplantation. The cumulative incidence of allograft loss was 10.5% (4.0-17.0) at 1 year, and 13.0% (5.8-20.1) at 5 years post-transplantation. Histologically proven AA amyloidosis recurrence occurred in 5 transplants (5.8%). 55.8% of cases developed an infection requiring hospitalization and 27.9% acute allograft rejection. Multivariable analysis showed that CRP concentration at the time of transplantation was associated with patient survival (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p=0.01) and with allograft survival (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.10-2.57, p 0.02). LIMITATIONS: The study lacked a control group and the effect of biotherapies on transplantation outcomes could not be explored. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively contemporary cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant for AA amyloidosis experienced favorable rates of survival and lower recurrence rates than previously reported. These data support the practice of treating these patients with kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to present our single-center real-life experience of canakinumab use in adult patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). METHODS: Data were derived from the Gazi FMF cohort, which was established in 2010. From that year, all patients with FMF were registered. The impact of FMF on their lives was tracked by either an FMF diary or mobile phone application (FMF-AIDD, free to download in App Store and Google Play). The records of patients who were treated with canakinumab were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-three adult patients with FMF (65% female) were enrolled in this study. The median age was 32 years (min-max, 24-58 years), and the disease duration was 26 years (14-59 years). A total of 86% of patients harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous exon 10 MEFV mutations. Indications for interleukin 1 inhibitor use were colchicine resistance (n = 12) or intolerance (n = 2), amyloidosis (n = 7), and chronic manifestations of the disease (n = 2). All patients used anakinra before. The median duration of canakinumab use was 7 months (min-max, 1-44 months). Pre- and post-canakinumab periods were compared. Attack severity, duration, frequency, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly improved (p <= 0.01), whereas serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase levels remained the same (p = 0.27 and p = 0.74, respectively). Canakinumab achieved complete disease remission in 14 patients (60%). Canakinumab was discontinued in 7 patients. The reasons for discontinuation were pregnancy (n = 2), dominance of axial spondyloarthropathy (n = 2), inflammatory bowel disease, patient's refusal, and weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Canakinumab is effective in the prevention of FMF bouts without severe adverse effects. Treatment with canakinumab in an individualized dose and interval may be a reasonable choice for colchicine- and anakinra-resistant or -intolerant adult patients with FMF and those with chronic manifestations of disease.",

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 926 FMF patients, who fulfilled the Tel-Hashomer criteria and had at least six months of follow-up. Patients were stratified according to their damage status (damage vs. no damage) defined with autoinflammatory disease damage index (ADDI) and modified ADDI (excluding musculoskeletal pain). We used logistic regression analysis to investigate independent predictors of damage for both indexes. RESULTS: Mean disease duration was 21.6+-11.9 years. 527 patients (57%) had damage according to ADDI. Median ADDI score was 1 (0-11). Most common FMF-related damages were observed in musculoskeletal, reproductive and kidney domains. Female gender, inflammatory comorbidity, colchicine resistance, colchicine nonadherence, musculoskeletal attack dominance, diagnostic delay, follow-up time, and smoking history remained independent predictors of damage according to ADDI score. The rate of patients with damage defined by modified ADDI was only to 23%. M694V/M694V homozygosity, female gender, musculoskeletal attack dominance, colchicine resistance, persistent inflammation, follow up time and family history of amyloidosis were found to be predictors of damage according to modified ADDI score. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to apply comprehensive damage indexes to FMF patients and identified predictors of damage. Factors linked to a severe FMF phenotype, including M694V homozygosity and persistent inflammation, were associated with only modified ADDI. Our findings justify the concerns about musculoskeletal pain and might point to the need for re-evaluation of ADDI for FMF patients.",

The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from a flu-like illness to severe pneumonia and death. Till September 2022, the cumulative number of cases exceeded 600 million worldwide and deaths were more than 6 million. Colchicine is an alkaloid drug that is used in many autoinflammatory conditions e.g., gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behcet's syndrome. Colchicine inhibits the production of superoxide and the release of interleukins that stimulate the inflammatory cascade. Colchicine decreases the differentiation of myofibroblast and the release of fibrotic mediators including transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) that are related to the fibrosis. Moreover, colchicine has been used to traet viral myocarditis caused by CMV or EBV, interstitial pneumonia, and pericarditis resulting from influenza B infection. Additionally, colchicine is considered safe and affordable with wide availability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess the evidence of colchicine effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was done till May 2022 and yielded 814 articles after ranking the articles according to authors and year of publication. Only 8 clinical trials and cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included for further steps of data collection, analysis, and reporting. RESULTS: This meta-analysis involved 16,488 patients; 8146 patients in the treatment group and 8342 patients in the control group. The results showed that colchicine resulted in a significant reduction in the mortality rate among patients received colchicine in comparison with placebo or standard care (RR 0.35, 95%CI: 0.15-0.79). Colchicine resulted in a significant decrease in the need for O2 therapy in patients with COVID-19 (RR 0.07, 95%CI 0.02-0.27, P = 0.000024). However, colchicine had no significant effect on the following outcomes among COVID-19 patients: the need for hospitalization, ICU admission, artificial ventilation, and hospital discharge rate. Among the PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, colchicine decreased the hospitalization rate (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57-0.99, P = 0.042). However, colchicine had no effect on mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation among this subgroup. CONCLUSION: Colchicine caused a significant clinical improvement among COVID-19 patients as compared with the standard care or placebo, in terms of the need for O2, and mortality. This beneficial effect could play a role in the management of COVID-19 especially severe cases to decrease need for oxygen and to decrease mortality among these patients.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has robustly affected the global healthcare and economic systems and it was caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from a flu-like illness to severe pneumonia and death. Till September 2022, the cumulative number of cases exceeded 600 million worldwide and deaths were more than 6 million. Colchicine is an alkaloid drug that is used in many autoinflammatory conditions e.g., gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behcet's syndrome. Colchicine inhibits the production of superoxide and the release of interleukins that stimulate the inflammatory cascade. Colchicine decreases the differentiation of myofibroblast and the release of fibrotic mediators including transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) that are related to the fibrosis. Moreover, colchicine has been used to traet viral myocarditis caused by CMV or EBV, interstitial pneumonia, and pericarditis resulting from influenza B infection. Additionally, colchicine is considered safe and affordable with wide availability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess the evidence of colchicine effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was done till May 2022 and yielded 814 articles after ranking the articles according to authors and year of publication. Only 8 clinical trials and cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included for further steps of data collection, analysis, and reporting. RESULTS: This meta-analysis involved 16,488 patients; 8146 patients in the treatment group and 8342 patients in the control group. The results showed that colchicine resulted in a significant reduction in the mortality rate among patients received colchicine in comparison with placebo or standard care (RR 0.35, 95%CI: 0.15-0.79). Colchicine resulted in a significant decrease in the need for O2 therapy in patients with COVID-19 (RR 0.07, 95%CI 0.02-0.27, P = 0.000024). However, colchicine had no significant effect on the following outcomes among COVID-19 patients: the need for hospitalization, ICU admission, artificial ventilation, and hospital discharge rate. Among the PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, colchicine decreased the hospitalization rate (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57-0.99, P = 0.042). However, colchicine had no effect on mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation among this subgroup. CONCLUSION: Colchicine caused a significant clinical improvement among COVID-19 patients as compared with the standard care or placebo, in terms of the need for O2, and mortality. This beneficial effect could play a role in the management of COVID-19 especially severe cases to decrease need for oxygen and to decrease mortality among these patients.",

                    "abstract": "AIM: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common inherited autoinflammatory disease in the world. There are known triggers to initiate an FMF attack, yet potential effects of intrauterine devices (IUD) in women of reproductive age have not been evaluated before. METHOD: Consecutive female patients with FMF who ever used IUD over the age of 18 were enrolled. Female patients with FMF were sub grouped according to the type of IUD they use. FMF attack frequency, severity, duration, presence of dysmenorrhea, severity of dysmenorrhea, having attacks during menstruation before and after IUD use were questioned. Demographic and clinical data were collected from hospital database. RESULTS: When all patients with IUD use were evaluated, it was found that the frequency of attacks increased after IUD insertion at 3rd and 12th months (median [min-max] attack frequency at 3rd month, 1 (0-3) vs 1 (0-6), p = 0.002, median [min-max] attack frequency at 12th month, 2 (0-12) vs 3.5 (0-18), p = 0.028). Attack severity measured by VAS pain was also significantly increased. Attack duration and menstrual pain was similar before and after IUD use. Attack frequency at 3rd and 12th months, attack severity and menstrual pain was all increased significantly in Cu-IUD users, whereas none of these parameters deteriorated in LNG-IUD group. CONCLUSION: IUD use, especially Cu-IUD, may increase the frequency and severity of attacks in female patients with FMF. Clinicians may benefit from considering LGN-IUD if IUDs are preferred as contraception in women of childbearing age with FMF.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra and canakinumab in the transplantation setting. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included KTRs suffered from AA amyloidosis caused by FMF and treated with anakinra or canakinumab (study group, n = 36). Using propensity score matching, we selected 36 patients without FMF or amyloidosis from our database of 696 KTRs as the control group. Primary outcomes were patient and graft survival. Biopsy-confirmed graft rejection, changes in eGFR, hsCRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), proteinuria, and number of monthly attacks were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: All KTRs with FMF began IL-1 blocker therapy with anakinra and nine (25%) were switched to canakinumab.

There are known triggers to initiate an FMF attack, yet potential effects of intrauterine devices (IUD) in women of reproductive age have not been evaluated before. METHOD: Consecutive female patients with FMF who ever used IUD over the age of 18 were enrolled. Female patients with FMF were sub grouped according to the type of IUD they use. FMF attack frequency, severity, duration, presence of dysmenorrhea, severity of dysmenorrhea, having attacks during menstruation before and after IUD use were questioned. Demographic and clinical data were collected from hospital database. RESULTS: When all patients with IUD use were evaluated, it was found that the frequency of attacks increased after IUD insertion at 3rd and 12th months (median [min-max] attack frequency at 3rd month, 1 (0-3) vs 1 (0-6), p = 0.002, median [min-max] attack frequency at 12th month, 2 (0-12) vs 3.5 (0-18), p = 0.028).

                    "abstract": "Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases are rare conditions caused by genetic abnormalities affecting the innate immunity. Previous therapeutic strategies had been mainly based on results from retrospective studies and physicians' experience. However, during the last years, the significant improvement in their genetic and pathogenic knowledge has been accompanied by a remarkable progress in their management. The relatively recent identification of the inflammasome as the crucial pathogenic mechanism causing an aberrant production of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in the most frequent monogenic autoinflammatory diseases led to the introduction of anti-IL-1 agents and other biologic drugs as part of the previously limited therapeutic armamentarium available. Advances in the treatment of autoinflammatory diseases have been favored by the use of new biologic agents and the performance of a notable number of randomized clinical trials exploring the efficacy and safety of these agents. Clinical trials have contributed to increase the level of evidence and provided more robust therapeutic recommendations. This review analyzes the treatment of the most frequent monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, namely, familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome/mevalonate kinase deficiency, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, together with periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome, which is the most common polygenic autoinflammatory disease in children, also occurring in adult patients. Finally, based on the available expert consensus recommendations and the highest level of evidence of the published studies, a practical evidence-based guideline for the treatment of these autoinflammatory diseases is proposed.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a monogenic autoinflammatory disease, and colchicine is the mainstay of treatment. Approximately 5%-10% of patients may respond inadequately to colchicine, and anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) agents are important treatment options in these patients. The aim of this study was to see whether there is any factor associated with the withdrawal of these anti-IL-1 agents and to investigate the characteristics of colchicine-resistant FMF patients who needed biological therapy. METHODS: Demographic, clinical characteristics, and disease severity of patients, at 2 referral centers, between 2012 and 2022, in whom anti-IL-1 treatment was continued and discontinued, were compared in this study. The international severity scoring system for FMF (ISSF) was used for disease severity assessment. RESULTS: In 64 colchicine-resistant FMF patients, the median (interquartile range) duration of biological treatment was 39 (45) months. Treatment of 26 patients (40.6%) was started with anakinra and 38 (59.4%) with canakinumab. During follow-up, anti-IL-1 treatment was discontinued in 23 patients (35.9%). High ISSF scores before biological treatment, presence of exertional leg pain, subclinical inflammation, and comorbidity were found to be statistically more frequent in the group whose biological therapy could not be discontinued (p = 0.009, p = 0.006, p = 0.026, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low ISSF scores before biological treatment with no accompanying exertional leg pain, subclinical inflammation, and comorbidities may be stated as an associated factors in terms of the discontinuation of biological agents in colchicine-resistant pediatric FMF patients.",

                    "abstract": ": Reporting of intoxication and withdrawal from aberrant use of over-the-counter medication has been sparse and inconsistent in literature. Attributed to their anticholinergic properties, medications such as dimenhydrinate (Gravol) taken in supratherapeutic doses have been associated with euphoria, anxiolysis, and hallucinations. We present a case of a woman in her forties, with a psychiatric history of bipolar disorder, and complex concurrent medical history including familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and fibromyalgia, admitted for withdrawal management of her intravenous dimenhydrinate use. As a result of her FMF, there were numerous hospital admissions and treatment which required intravenous access. Hence, a physician-inserted intravenous access port was placed on her chest. The port was maintained monthly with the help of a community agency. In this port, she was injecting 100 to 200 mg of dimenhydrinate hourly for its euphoric and calming effects, consuming upwards of 2400 mg/d. Comprehensive laboratory work-up and urine drug screening were unremarkable. Vital signs were stable. Her mental status at time of admission was lethargic, unfocused, but calm. Her withdrawal symptoms included severe nausea, vomiting, sedation, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and muscle stiffness. Her detoxification was managed with benztropine and lorazepam, and was well tolerated. The patient was discharged to a community inpatient rehabilitation center. Urine drug testing before discharge was negative. This case draws attention to the addictive potential of dimenhydrinate and offers a regime for its medical withdrawal management. Additionally, this case highlights that screening and management of over-the-counter medications warrants further clinical consideration and investigation.",

                    "abstract": "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is an autoinflammatory disease characterised by fever and arthritis. We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl hospitalised with fever associated with rash, myalgia, arthralgia and polyarticular involvement. Examinations revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Bone marrow biopsy showed polyclonal leukocyte activation. A genetic study revealed a heterozygous mutation of the MEFV gene, c.442G>C (E148Q), which is typical of familial Mediterranean fever. However, the genetic pattern was not associated with a history of recurrent fever, aphthous ulcers of the mouth, abdominal pain, arthralgia and rash. Therefore, a diagnosis of sJIA was made. The patient did not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids improved biochemical examinations; however, AST, ALT, GGT and glycaemia remained elevated and adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment became evident and therefore corticosteroids were withdrawn. Canakinumab (150 mg/4 weeks subcutaneously) was initiated. Biochemical data returned to normal values and clinical symptoms resolved. After 2.5 years of canakinumab treatment, complete disease remission allowed the prolongation of intervals between doses. When the intervals were longer than 10 weeks we discontinued the treatment. The patient is still in remission 2 years after canakinumab withdrawal.",

In this study we investigated the presentation pattern, the frequency of misdiagnosis and the duration of diagnostic delay and its underlying causes in a large cohort followed by a single tertiary centre in Turkey. METHODS: We studied 197 (118 F, 79 M) consecutive patients with FMF (median age: 34 years [IQR: 27-44]). The median registry year of the patients was 2006 [IQR: 2001-2011]. A standardised questionnaire was used to assess age at first symptom, date at diagnosis, previous diagnosis and treatments before the FMF diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 167 (84%) patients were misdiagnosed and 56 (28%) underwent surgical operations before FMF diagnosis. The most common mis-diagnoses were appendicitis (55%) and acute rheumatic fever (ARF) (45%). The median duration of diagnostic delay was 11 years. Joint attacks were observed to start at a significantly younger age (median age: 3 years) than abdominal attacks (median age: 12 years). Early onset with solo joint attacks, without usual peritonitis attacks and being a carrier of M694V were found to be significantly associated with ARF misdiagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Misdiagnosis frequency is still significantly high and diagnostic delay is long even in a cohort of patients registered after year 2000 in Turkey. Atypical presentation with solo joint attacks, especially among patients with early onset, seems to play a significant role in misdiagnosis and delay in diagnosis.",

                    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), the most common monogenic inflammatory disease, is mainly treated by oral Colchicine. However, 5% of patients are considered non-responders and, therefore, candidates for biologic therapy. Intravenous (IV) Colchicine treatment has been shown to be effective and safe in adult patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of IV Colchicine for pediatric FMF patients in our hospital, refractory to oral Colchicine, by reviewing their medical records. Inclusion criteria were all patients with FMF who commenced treatment with IV Colchicine before the age of 18 years, and received at least 6 months of IV therapy. The patients completed questionnaires to assess the efficacy of the treatment. Between 2004 and 2017, 7 pediatric FMF patients receiving maximal oral Colchicine doses and deemed non-responders were treated with weekly IV Colchicine, including 38 cumulative patient years of follow-up data (a full blood count, renal and liver function tests). All patients were homozygous for the M694V genotype. Long-term follow-up showed normal laboratory results with no Colchicine-related hospital admissions or toxicity. Global health assessment and the number of disease-free days have significantly improved (P < 0.05). Prolonged IV Colchicine use is described in pediatric FMF patients for the first time, with an excellent safety profile in our population, and decrease in intensity and frequency of attacks. In the biological era, IV Colchicine, although not leading to complete remission, may be considered a second-line option in countries where anti-interleukin 1 blockers are not available, or as a third-line option in case of failure to respond to biologics.",

                    "abstract": "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is an autoinflammatory disease characterised by fever and arthritis. We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl hospitalised with fever associated with rash, myalgia, arthralgia and polyarticular involvement. Examinations revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Bone marrow biopsy showed polyclonal leukocyte activation. A genetic study revealed a heterozygous mutation of the MEFV gene, c.442G>C (E148Q), which is typical of familial Mediterranean fever. However, the genetic pattern was not associated with a history of recurrent fever, aphthous ulcers of the mouth, abdominal pain, arthralgia and rash. Therefore, a diagnosis of sJIA was made. The patient did not respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids improved biochemical examinations; however, AST, ALT, GGT and glycaemia remained elevated and adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment became evident and therefore corticosteroids were withdrawn. Canakinumab (150 mg/4 weeks subcutaneously) was initiated. Biochemical data returned to normal values and clinical symptoms resolved. After 2.5 years of canakinumab treatment, complete disease remission allowed the prolongation of intervals between doses. When the intervals were longer than 10 weeks we discontinued the treatment. The patient is still in remission 2 years after canakinumab withdrawal.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While light chain (AL) amyloidosis is more common in western countries, the most common type of amyloidosis is amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis in Eastern Mediterranean Region, including Turkey. Although worse prognosis has been attributed to the AL amyloidosis, AA amyloidosis can be related to higher mortality under renal replacement therapies. However, there are no sufficient data regarding etiology, clinical presentation, and prognostic factors of AA amyloidosis. The objective of our study is to evaluate the clinical, laboratory characteristics, and possible predictive factors related to mortality in patients with AA amyloidosis undergoing hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: This multicenter, cross-sectional study was a retrospective analysis of 2100 patients on HD. It was carried out in 14 selected HD centers throughout Turkey. Thirty-two patients with biopsy-proven AA amyloidosis and thirty-two control patients without AA amyloidosis undergoing HD were included between October 2018 and October 2019. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age and dialysis vintage. Causes of AA amyloidosis, treatment (colchicine and/or anti-interleukin 1 [IL] treatment), and the number of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) attacks in the last year in case of FMF, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, biochemical values such as mean CRP, hemoglobin, serum albumin, phosphorus, calcium, PTH, ferritin, transferrin saturation, total cholesterol levels, EPO dose, erythropoietin-stimulating agents resistance index, interdialytic fluid intake, body mass indexes, heparin dosage, UF volume, and Kt/V data in the last year were collected by retrospective review of medical records. FINDINGS: Prevalence of AA amyloidosis was found to be 1.87% in HD centers. In amyloidosis and control groups, 56% and 53% were male, mean age was 54 +- 11 and 53 +- 11 years, and mean dialysis vintage was 104 +- 94 and 107 +- 95 months, respectively. FMF was the most common cause of AA amyloidosis (59.5%). All FMF patients received colchicine and the mean colchicine dose was 0.70 +- 0.30 mg/day. 26.3% of FMF patients were unresponsive to colchicine and anti-IL-1 treatment was used in these patients. In AA amyloid and control groups, erythropoietin-stimulating agents resistance index were 7.88 +- 3.78 and 5.41 +- 3.06 IU/kg/week/g/dl, respectively (p = 0.008). Additionally, higher CRP values (18.78 +- 18.74 and 10.61 +- 10.47 mg/L, p = 0.037), lower phosphorus (4.68 +- 0.73 vs. 5.25 +- 1.04 mg/dl, p = 0.014), total cholesterol (135 +- 42 vs. 174 +- 39 mg/dl, p < 0.01), and serum albumin (3.67 +- 0.49 mg/dl, 4.03 +- 0.22, p < 0.01) were observed in patients with AA amyloidosis compared to the control group. DISCUSSION: In this study, we found that long-term prognostic factors including higher inflammation, malnutritional parameters, and higher erythropoietin-stimulating agents resistance index were more frequent in AA amyloidosis patients under HD treatment.",

Telephone interviews were conducted using a questionnaire survey in a cross-sectional design in patients with BS, FMF, and RD followed by a single university hospital. Study participants were vaccinated either with CoronaVac (BS:109, FMF: 90, and RD: 343,) or BioNTech (BS: 147, FMF: 157 and RD: 258). The majority have received double dose (BS: 94.9%, FMF 92.3% and RD: 86.2%). BioNTech ensured a significantly better efficacy than CoronaVac against COVID-19 in all patient groups (BS: 1.4% vs 10.1%; FMF: 3.2% vs 12.2%, RD:2.7% vs 6.4%).

The majority of AEs were mild to moderate and transient and this was true for either vaccine. There were also AEs that required medical attention in all study groups following CoronaVac (BS: 5.5%, FMF: 3.3%, and RD:2.9%) or BioNTech (BS: 5.4%, FMF: 1.9%, and RD: 4.7%). The main causes for medical assistance were disease flare and cardiovascular events. Patients with BS (16.0%) and FMF (17.4%) were found to flare significantly more frequently when compared to those with RD (6.0%) (p < 0.001). This was true for either vaccine. BS patients reported mainly skin-mucosa lesions; there were however, 11 (4.3%) who developed major organ attack such as uveitis, thrombosis or stroke. Flare in FMF patients were associated mainly with acute serositis with or without fever. Arthralgia/arthritis or inflammatory back pain were observed mainly in the RD group. Our study demonstrates that BS and FMF patients vaccinated with either CoronaVac or BioNTech demonstrated similar AE profile and frequency compared to RD patients. AEs that required physician consultation or hospitalization occurred in all study groups after either CoronaVac or BioNTech. Increased frequency of flares in BS and FMF compared to that seen in RD might reflect defects in innate immunity and deserves further investigation.

We studied the frequency of side effects and disease flares after COVID-19 vaccination with either Pfizer/BioNTech or Sinovac/CoronaVac in 256 patients with BS, 247 with FMF, and 601 with RD. Telephone interviews were conducted using a questionnaire survey in a cross-sectional design in patients with BS, FMF, and RD followed by a single university hospital. Study participants were vaccinated either with CoronaVac (BS:109, FMF: 90, and RD: 343,) or BioNTech (BS: 147, FMF: 157 and RD: 258). The majority have received double dose (BS: 94.9%, FMF 92.3% and RD: 86.2%). BioNTech ensured a significantly better efficacy than CoronaVac against COVID-19 in all patient groups (BS: 1.4% vs 10.1%; FMF: 3.2% vs 12.2%, RD:2.7% vs 6.4%). Those with at least one adverse event (AE) were significantly more frequent among those vaccinated with BioNTech than those with CoronaVac (BS: 86.4% vs 45%; FMF: 83.4% vs 53.3%; and RD: 83.3% vs 45.5%). The majority of AEs were mild to moderate and transient and this was true for either vaccine. There were also AEs that required medical attention in all study groups following CoronaVac (BS: 5.5%, FMF: 3.3%, and RD:2.9%) or BioNTech (BS: 5.4%, FMF: 1.9%, and RD: 4.7%). The main causes for medical assistance were disease flare and cardiovascular events. Patients with BS (16.0%) and FMF (17.4%) were found to flare significantly more frequently when compared to those with RD (6.0%) (p < 0.001). This was true for either vaccine. BS patients reported mainly skin-mucosa lesions; there were however, 11 (4.3%) who developed major organ attack such as uveitis, thrombosis or stroke. Flare in FMF patients were associated mainly with acute serositis with or without fever. Arthralgia/arthritis or inflammatory back pain were observed mainly in the RD group. Our study demonstrates that BS and FMF patients vaccinated with either CoronaVac or BioNTech demonstrated similar AE profile and frequency compared to RD patients. AEs that required physician consultation or hospitalization occurred in all study groups after either CoronaVac or BioNTech. Increased frequency of flares in BS and FMF compared to that seen in RD might reflect defects in innate immunity and deserves further investigation.

There were also AEs that required medical attention in all study groups following CoronaVac (BS: 5.5%, FMF: 3.3%, and RD:2.9%) or BioNTech (BS: 5.4%, FMF: 1.9%, and RD: 4.7%). The main causes for medical assistance were disease flare and cardiovascular events. Patients with BS (16.0%) and FMF (17.4%) were found to flare significantly more frequently when compared to those with RD (6.0%) (p < 0.001). This was true for either vaccine. BS patients reported mainly skin-mucosa lesions; there were however, 11 (4.3%) who developed major organ attack such as uveitis, thrombosis or stroke. Flare in FMF patients were associated mainly with acute serositis with or without fever. Arthralgia/arthritis or inflammatory back pain were observed mainly in the RD group. Our study demonstrates that BS and FMF patients vaccinated with either CoronaVac or BioNTech demonstrated similar AE profile and frequency compared to RD patients. AEs that required physician consultation or hospitalization occurred in all study groups after either CoronaVac or BioNTech. Increased frequency of flares in BS and FMF compared to that seen in RD might reflect defects in innate immunity and deserves further investigation. Caution should be required when monitoring these patients after vaccination.",

METHODS: The study included 30 FMF patients with homozygous M694V mutation in remission under colchicine therapy, 12 asymptomatic FMF carriers with heterozygous M694V mutation, and 41 age-sex-matched healthy controls. All patients underwent detailed eye examination, and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT), macular vascular densities, and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) areas were measured using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography. RESULTS: In this study, the mean pRNFL thickness was statistically significantly thinner (p=0.010) in the FMF patients group compared to the FMF carriers group and the healthy control group, especially in the inferior quadrant of pRNFL (p=0.042). The CMT in asymptomatic FMF carriers group was statistically significantly thicker than in FMF patients group (p=0.037), especially the superior and inferior quadrants of macula were affected (p=0.024; p=0.020, respectively). In addition, this study showed that the changes of pRNFL thickness and CMT in pediatric patients with FMF were moderately correlated with the duration of diagnosis. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of macular vascular densities and FAZ values. CONCLUSION: FMF is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease that causes multi-organ involvement, and this study showed that posterior segment ocular parameters could be affected not only in FMF patients but also in asymptomatic FMF carriers.",

Our aim was to report pregnancy in our AAA patients and discuss the outcome through a literature review. METHODS: French cases were identified through the Reference Center for Auto-Inflammatory Diseases and Amyloidosis and a systematic literature review was performed.

                    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an important and preventable cause of chronic kidney disease due to secondary amyloidosis. Although colchicine is the first-line therapy in patients with FMF with 60% to 65% complete remission rates, 5% to 10% of patients are colchicine-resistant and 5% to 10% of them are intolerant to the therapy. Anti-interleukin-1 agents, such as anakinra and canakinumab, are safe and efficient therapeutic options in patients with colchicine resistance or intolerance. However, the data on management of these targeted agents is limited in recipients of kidney transplant (RKT). In this case series, we aim to share our experience on canakinumab therapy of 4 RKTs with FMF-related amyloidosis, who were followed up in our clinic between 2010 and 2017. All of the 4 patients with end-stage renal disease were colchicine- resistant and on other alternative therapies, which provided poor disease control. For efficient control of secondary amyloidosis, canakinumab therapy was initiated in 1 of the patients before the renal transplant, and for the remaining patients after renal transplant. Any serious adverse effect, development of proteinuria, or graft dysfunction has not been observed in any of the patients. Under the canakinumab treatment, complete clinical responses, prevent typical familial Mediterranean fever attacks with fever and arthritis and abdominal pain, normalized serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels were achieved in all patients. Canakinumab treatment is a safe and effective therapeutic option for RKTs with FMF who are resistant or intolerant to colchicine and anakinra.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Long-term kidney transplantation (KT) results in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)-related amyloidosis are not well studied. This study reviewed the long-term survival outcomes of FMF patients who underwent KT. METHODS: We compared the outcomes of 31 patients who underwent (KT) for biopsy-proven amyloidosis secondary to FMF with 31 control patients (five with diabetes mellitus and 26 with nondiabetic kidney disease) undergoing KT between 1994 and 2021 at Baskent University Hospital. All data were recorded retrospectively from patients' files. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE (QUARTILE DEVIATION: QD) at the time of KT in the FMF and control group were 31 (6.7) and 33 (11), respectively. The median follow-up period (QD) after KT was 108 (57) months in the FMF and 132 (72) months in the control group. In the FMF group, graft and patient survivals were 71% and 84% at 5 years and 45% and 48% at 10 years, respectively. In the control group, graft and patient survivals were 79% and 100% at 5 years and 63% and 71% at 10 years, respectively. Patient survival in the FMF group at 5 years was significantly lower than in the control group (p = .045). There was no statistically significant difference between the FMF and control groups in terms of graft and patient survival, and serum creatinine levels at 10 years. All patients were given triple immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Three patients received anakinra and one received canakinumab in addition to colchicine treatment. One FMF patient also underwent heart transplantation due to AA amyloidosis. Of the FMF patients, 11 died during follow-up. CONCLUSION: We have found that the long-term outcome of KT in patients with FMF amyloidosis is numerically worse but not statistically different from the control group. However, short- and long-term complications still need to be resolved.",

The study was planned within a national network of 21 different centers. Demographics, FMF-related clinical and genetic characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes were obtained. A total of 822 patients with FMF (mean age of 36 years) were included in the study. Fifty-nine of them (7%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by real-time PCR test or chest CT findings. Most FMF patients with COVID-19 (58) had mild and moderate disease activity. All patients were on colchicine treatment. However, 8 of them (13.6%) were not compliant with colchicine use and 9 of them (15.3%) were colchicine resistant. Twelve FMF patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized. There were 4 patients requiring oxygen support. COVID-19 related complications were observed in 2 patients (1 thromboembolism, 1 acute respiratory distress syndrome). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with FMF were older than non-hospitalized patients (median ages: 51 and 31 years, respectively; p: 0.002). Other FMF-related characteristics were similar between the groups. FMF-related characteristics were not found to be associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Thus, FMF may not be a risk factor for poor COVID-19 outcomes.",
