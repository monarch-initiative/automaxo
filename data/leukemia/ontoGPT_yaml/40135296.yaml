input_text: Effects of Venetoclax Combined with Azacitidine on the Immune Function
  and Quality of Life in Patients with Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Aims/Background
  Patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poor prognosis and limited
  treatment options. The combination of azacitidine and venetoclax has demonstrated
  some efficacy in relapsed AML. This study aimed to investigate the effects of venetoclax
  combined with azacitidine on immune function and quality of life in patients with
  relapsed AML. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 104
  patients with relapsed AML who were admitted to the First People's Hospital of Fuyang
  from January 2020 to January 2024. The patients were divided into a combination
  group (n = 53, treated with a combination of venetoclax and azacitidine) and an
  azacitidine group (n = 51, treated with azacitidine) according to the treatment
  protocol. Hematological parameters (proportion of bone marrow progenitor cells [PBMPC],
  white blood cell count [WBC], platelet count [PLT], neutrophil count [NEUT], and
  hemoglobin [Hb]), serum immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgA, and IgM) and
  inflammatory factor (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha])
  levels, as well as European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality
  of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores were compared between the two groups, and adverse
  reactions were recorded. Results The remission rate in the combination group (66.0%)
  was significantly higher than that in the azacitidine group (45.1%, p < 0.05). Both
  azacitidine monotherapy and the combination therapy with venetoclax improved hematological
  indicators and quality of life while reducing serum immunoglobulin levels and inflammatory
  factors. Compared with the azacitidine group, the combination group demonstrated
  a significant reduction in PBMPC (p < 0.05), alongside an increase in WBC, PLT,
  NEUT, and Hb (p < 0.05). Additionally, combination therapy led to a greater reduction
  in serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, IL-6, and TNF-alpha compared to azacitidine alone
  (p < 0.05). Moreover, combination therapy significantly improved scores for physical,
  emotional, cognitive, social function, and general health status (p < 0.05), while
  reducing scores for nausea, dyspnea, insomnia, pain, and constipation (p < 0.05).
  Importantly, there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions
  between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion The combination of venetoclax and
  azacitidine could regulate the immune function, improve hematological indicators
  and quality of life, without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions in patients
  with relapsed AML.
