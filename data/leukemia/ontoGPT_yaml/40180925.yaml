input_text: 'Donor-derived CARCIK-CD19 cells engineered with Sleeping Beauty transposon
  in acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapsed after allogeneic transplantation. Non-viral
  engineering can ease CAR-T cell production and reduce regulatory and cost requirements.
  We utilized Sleeping Beauty transposon to engineer donor-derived anti-CD19.CD28.OX40.CD3zeta
  T cells differentiated in cytokine-induced killer (CARCIK-CD19) for B-cell precursor
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). We report the results of CARCIK-CD19 observed
  in 36 patients (4 children and 32 adults) treated according to the final recommended
  dose. Cytokine release syndrome of grade 2 or lower occurred in 15 patients, ICANS
  grade 2 in 1 patient, and late-onset peripheral neurotoxicity of grade 3 in 2 patients.
  GVHD never occurred after treatment with allogeneic CARCIK-CD19. Complete remission
  was achieved by 30 out of 36 patients (83.3%), with MRD negativity in 89% of responders.
  With a median follow-up of 2.2 years, the 1-year overall survival was 57.0%, and
  event-free survival was 32.0%. The median duration of response at 1 year was 38.6%.
  CAR-T cells expanded rapidly after infusion and remained detectable for over 2 years.
  Integration site analysis after infusion showed a high clonal diversity. These data
  demonstrated that SB-engineered CAR-T cells are safe and induce durable remission
  in heavily pretreated patients with BCP-ALL relapsed after alloHSCT. Trial registration:
  The phase 1/2 and phase II trials are registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT#03389035
  and NCT#05252403.'
