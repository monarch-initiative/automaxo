input_text: 'Oral decitabine in acute myeloid leukemia: assessing efficacy, safety,
  and future implications for older patients. INTRODUCTION: Older patients with acute
  myeloid leukemia (AML) are often unsuitable for standard treatments and traditionally
  have a dismal prognosis. For 20 years, hypomethylating agents (HMAs), as single
  agents and recently as a backbone with venetoclax, have been used in this setting.
  The oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine (C-DEC), which is therapeutically
  and pharmacologically equivalent to the intravenous (IV) formulation (IV-DEC), has
  expanded the therapeutic arsenal for AML, allowing for better convenience of administration.
  This review provides an overview of C-DEC, current clinical applications, and ongoing
  clinical studies, highlighting its potential role in managing AML in older patients.
  AREAS COVERED: For the aim of this review, the authors searched the current English
  literature on C-DEC in AML patients through PubMed, using several pertinent keywords.
  To summarize the most recent developments as up-to-date as possible, we considered,
  with a few exceptions, only papers published over the last three years until March
  2025. EXPERT OPINION: Compared to IV-DEC, C-DEC provides similar therapeutic exposure
  and efficacy with an optional safety profile, enhanced treatment adherence, reduced
  treatment burden, and required healthcare facilities compared to those associated
  with IV-DEC, providing a precious tool to manage older and unfit AML patients.'
