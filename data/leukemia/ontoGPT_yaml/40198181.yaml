input_text: '[Myositis secondary to all-transretinoic acid during induction in acute
  promyelocytic leukemia]. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a specific subtype
  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by the presence of the 15;17 translocation,
  that generates the PML/RARalpha fusion gene. First-line induction treatment includes
  the combination of all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide, with which
  complete response rates greater than 90% are achieved. Although the combination
  is very effective, there are adverse reactions associated with the treatment, which
  include cellular differentiation syndrome, headache, fatigue, elevated triglycerides,
  and myositis. The latter is rare and is manifested by intense muscle pain a few
  days after starting ATRA. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values are not always elevated
  and this can make diagnosis difficult with delayed treatment and increased risk
  of complications. We report the case of a woman with APL who, during the induction
  phase of treatment, presented myositis of the pelvic muscles and lower extremities
  secondary to the administration of ATRA. The condition resolved after the administration
  of corticosteroids and temporary suspension of ATRA, with no recurrence after its
  restart.'
