input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of decitabine combined with arsenic trioxide in elderly
  high-risk myelodysplastic neoplasm patients: a retrospective study. OBJECTIVES:
  Elderly patients with high-risk myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS) face poor outcomes
  with limited treatment options, often progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
  This study investigates the efficacy and safety of combining decitabine (DAC) with
  arsenic trioxide (ATO) as a novel therapeutic approach. METHODS: A retrospective
  analysis was conducted on 120 elderly high-risk MDS patients, with 52 receiving
  ATO-DAC (ATO-DAC group) and 68 receiving DAC monotherapy (DAC group). Treatment
  outcomes were assessed through overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival
  (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Adverse events were recorded and compared between
  the two groups. RESULTS: The ATO-DAC group demonstrated a significantly higher ORR
  of 78.85% compared to 52.94% in the DAC group (P = 0.026). Median PFS was 7.5 months
  for the ATO-DAC group versus 5.0 months for the DAC group (P = 0.021), and median
  OS was 14.5 months compared to 11.5 months, respectively (P = 0.034). Although adverse
  events were more frequent in the ATO-DAC group, the safety profile remained manageable.
  These findings suggest that the ATO-DAC combination provides superior efficacy compared
  to DAC monotherapy. DISCUSSION: The combination of DAC and ATO offers a promising
  and innovative treatment option for elderly high-risk MDS patients, enhancing response
  rates and survival outcomes while maintaining a manageable safety profile. CONCLUSION:
  This study underscores the clinical relevance of this regimen, warranting further
  investigation in prospective trials.'
