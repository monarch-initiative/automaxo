input_text: "Ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation: a two-decade
  single-center experience with 451 children and adolescents. BACKGROUND: Ovarian
  tissue cryopreservation (OTC) is the only fertility preservation option for premenarcheal
  girls before gonadotoxic treatment, but is still considered to be experimental in
  pediatric patients. This study investigated storage behaviors across different age
  groups to refine counseling approaches for pediatric patients. METHODS: This retrospective
  study analyzed data from children (0-14 years), adolescents (15-19 years), and adults
  (>= 20 years) who underwent OTC between 2000-2021 at the University Hospital Bonn's
  cryobank. Comparison to adults (age >= 20 years) was conducted. RESULTS: Of 2,475
  patients, 6% were children and 12% adolescents. Sarcoma was most common in children,
  lymphoma in adolescents. Adults had longer active storage than children (5.5 vs.
  4.7 years, p = 0.011), but for active storage >= 10 years, children and adolescents
  stored longer than adults (13.1 and 12.6 vs. 11.8 years, p <= 0.01). The proportion
  of adolescents increased, while that of children decreased in long-term storage.
  Median ovarian cortex surface before cryopreservation was 3.5 cm2 in children and
  4.5 cm2 in adolescents. Leukemia and sarcoma had the highest mortality rates in
  children (25% and 13.5%). Overall, pregnancy and birth rates following ovarian tissue
  transplantation (OTT) were 34.5% and 24.1%, respectively. Among adolescents, pregnancy
  rates were 33.3% after OTT and 27.3% without OTT, while all children without OTT
  achieved pregnancy (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents represent a small
  subset of OTC patients, with indications linked to common pediatric malignancies.
  For active storage >= 10 years, they store longer than adults, likely due to delayed
  reproduction or awaiting in vitro growth / in vitro maturation in hematological
  cases. Overall, adults store longer, but adolescent storage has risen over time
  possibly due to higher child mortality and previously limited OTC use in younger
  patients. Mean ovarian cortex surface data may guide pediatric tissue harvest recommendations,
  with unilateral oophorectomy advised. Fertility preservation counseling and cost
  coverage should be standard for pediatric patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment.
  A tailored approach to OTC indications is essential, especially in high-mortality
  cancers like leukemia or sarcoma. Favorable pregnancy rates observed, even without
  OTT, suggest possible OTC overutilization, highlighting the need for individualized
  strategies and careful clinical decision-making to balance risks and preserve reproductive
  potential."
