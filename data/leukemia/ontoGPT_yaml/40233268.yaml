input_text: Single-cell RNA Sequencing Contributes to the Treatment of Acute Myeloid
  Leukaemia With Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Chemotherapy, and Immunotherapy.
  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by altered maturation and differentiation
  of myeloid blasts, as well as transcriptional/epigenetic alterations and impaired
  apoptosis, all of which lead to excessive proliferation of malignant blood cells
  in the bone marrow. It is these mutations that cause tumor heterogeneity, which
  is linked to a higher risk of relapse and death and makes anti-AML treatments like
  HSCT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (ICI, CAR T-cell-based therapies, and cancer
  vaccines) less effective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) also makes it possible
  to find cellular subclones and profile tumors, which opens up new diagnostic and
  therapeutic targets for better AML management. The HSCT process works better when
  genetic and transcriptional information about the patient and donor stem cells is
  collected. This saves time and lowers the risk of harmful side effects happening
  in the body.
