input_text: "[Efficacy and safety analysis of venetoclax in combination with multidrug
  chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage].
  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with
  multidrug chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia of ambiguous
  lineage (ALAL) . Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed
  on patients with newly diagnosed ALAL who were hospitalized at Jiangsu Provincial
  People's Hospital from June 2021 to July 2024. Of the 13 patients who received initial
  induction therapy with venetoclax combined with multidrug chemotherapy, 8 received
  VAA+P regimen, and 5 received V+IA regimen. Patients with FLT3 mutation were treated
  with FLT3 inhibitor, and Ph(+) patients received an additional tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
  Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events were analyzed.
  Results: According to the World Health Organization 5th edition of the classification
  of hematolymphoid tumors, the immunophenotypes were T/myeloid mixed-phenotype acute
  leukemia (MPAL) (n=4), B/myeloid MPAL (n=7), and ALAL- not otherwise specified (n=2).
  Of the seven patients with B/myeloid MPAL, four were Ph(+) and belonged to the group
  with specific gene abnormalities of ALAL. Three patients had FLT3 mutation (one
  with FLT3-TKD mutation and two with FLT3-ITD mutation). Prior to the second course
  of consolidation therapy, the efficacy of venetoclax induction therapy was evaluated,
  and a complete response rate of 100% was achieved in 13 patients. In the subsequent
  consolidation therapy phase, one patient discontinued treatment and was lost to
  follow-up; nine patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
  four of whom died due to posttransplant complications and five achieved DFS. Of
  the three patients (>=70 years old) who received consolidation therapy as before,
  two achieved DFS and one died due to central nervous system leukemia. The median
  OS time was not reached in 13 patients; the 75th percentile survival time was 12.0
  months, with a 12-month cumulative survival rate of 64.5%. The median DFS time was
  not reached in all patients; the 75th percentile DFS time was 8.2 months, with a
  12-month cumulative DFS rate of 67.1%. All patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic
  toxicity, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, during and after induction
  therapy. All patients recovered hematopoietic function after the initial induction
  therapy, with no fatal hemorrhage, tumor lysis syndrome, neurological adverse events,
  or grade 3 or higher organ toxicity, excluding preexisting conditions. Conclusion:
  Venetoclax in combination with multidrug chemotherapy was effective and associated
  with tolerable adverse reactions in patients with newly diagnosed ALAL."
