input_text: 'The Effects of Adding G-CSF to the Induction Therapy of Patients with
  AML Being Treated with the 7+3 Protocol: A Retrospective Comparative Study. BACKGROUND:
  Although some new treatment protocols have been developed, 7+3 chemotherapy is still
  the most widely used treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction therapy.
  Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a widely used treatment modality
  for myelosuppression after chemotherapy as it accelerates myeloid healing and reduces
  the incidence and severity of fever and infections. Most current guidelines recommend
  primary G-CSF prophylaxis in solid cancer patients with a risk of >=20% febrile
  neutropenia. However, the use of G-CSF in the induction treatment of AML is controversial
  as it increases the proliferation of leukemic blasts in vitro. AIM: This study was
  to investigate the effects of G-CSF use in AML induction therapy on survival. METHODS:
  The study group included 36 patients over the age of 18 with bone marrow blast rate
  >20% who were diagnosed with AML [M0-M5 according to FAB (French-American-British)
  classification] using diagnostic tests, such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy
  between 2016 and 2020. Eighteen of these patients were from a center that employed
  prophylactic G-CSF during induction therapy, and the remaining 18 patients were
  from another center that did not employ prophylactic G-CSF during induction therapy.
  The characteristics of the patients were reviewed retrospectively from their files.
  The induction therapy used was 7+3 (7-day cytarabine +3-day idarubicin) chemotherapy
  regimen. RESULTS: Although not reaching statistically significant levels, the use
  of G-CSF in AML induction therapy was found to provide both OS and PFS advantages.
  In addition, patients who used G-SF had statistically significantly fewer intensive
  care unit (ICU) stays than those who did not use it. CONCLUSION: Although the use
  of G-CSF in induction therapy of AML patients did not significantly increase survival
  rates, it caused a statistically significant decrease in the need for intensive
  care. However, larger-scale studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to
  confirm the results of this study.'
