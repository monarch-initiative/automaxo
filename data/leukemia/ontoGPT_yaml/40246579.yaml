input_text: 'CD22-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells for children
  and adults with relapse of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after CD19-directed
  immunotherapy. BACKGROUND: Relapse of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
  with CD19-antigen loss after CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell
  therapy has a dismal prognosis. Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient
  population are urgently needed. METHODS: We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB
  CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and
  adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated
  dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early
  cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, all with relapse
  after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric,
  n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6
  (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded
  to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up
  of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to
  76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients
  received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses;
  one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events
  after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the
  only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like
  syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed
  robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days
  postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved
  a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile
  and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development
  of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with
  HCT or other novel strategies. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: NCT02650414 and NCT03620058.'
