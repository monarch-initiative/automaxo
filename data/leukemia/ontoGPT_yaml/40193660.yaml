input_text: "Uncovering non-autoimmune hypothyroidism: A case report of rhabdomyolysis
  and myocarditis mimicking acute coronary syndrome. RATIONALE: Non-autoimmune hypothyroidism
  is a rare but significant cause of rhabdomyolysis and myocarditis, which can mimic
  acute coronary syndrome. Early recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism are crucial,
  especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where delayed diagnosis
  may lead to life-threatening complications such as acute kidney injury. PATIENT
  CONCERNS: A 71-year-old male with diabetes, CKD stage G3aA3, and a history of chronic
  myelogenous leukemia presented with myalgia, anorexia, and anuria. He also reported
  intermittent chest pain for 1 month, progressing to severe symptoms including decreased
  urine output and anuria. DIAGNOSES: Laboratory findings revealed acute kidney injury
  (serum creatinine: 12.14 mg/dL), extreme elevations in muscle enzymes (creatine
  kinase: 250,000 IU/L), and cardiac biomarkers (troponin-T: 543 ng/L). Initial management
  did not improve his condition. On day 15, thyroid function tests confirmed non-autoimmune
  hypothyroidism (TSH: 55.58 muIU/mL, free T4: 0.06 ng/dL). INTERVENTIONS: The patient
  underwent hemodialysis and conservative treatment initially, followed by levothyroxine
  replacement therapy on day 16. OUTCOMES: Renal function, urine output, and muscle
  enzyme levels gradually improved after thyroid hormone supplementation. By discharge
  on day 40, the patient's serum creatinine decreased to 3.08 mg/dL, and hemodialysis
  was discontinued. At 7 months posttreatment, his renal function stabilized at CKD
  stage G3bA2 with normal thyroid function. LESSONS: This case highlights the importance
  of considering hypothyroidism in patients with unexplained rhabdomyolysis and persistent
  cardiac symptoms, particularly in those with CKD. Early thyroid function testing
  can lead to timely treatment and improved outcomes in such complex cases."
