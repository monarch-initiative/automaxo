input_text: 'Randomised controlled trial of a psychosocial digital health application
  to promote coping for caregivers of patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell
  transplantation: a study protocol for the BMT-CARE app. INTRODUCTION: Caregivers
  of patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) experience
  tremendous psychological distress before, during and after HSCT. However, few interventions
  are tailored to the protracted needs of these caregivers while considering scalability
  and accessibility. We previously developed an evidence-based intervention for caregivers
  of patients undergoing HSCT that improved quality of life (QOL), caregiving burden
  and mood. We have since adapted this clinician-delivered intervention into a self-administered,
  digital health application (BMT-CARE app) and are currently evaluating the effect
  of this intervention on QOL in caregivers of patients receiving HSCT. METHODS AND
  ANALYSIS: The study design is a non-blinded randomised controlled trial of a digital
  health intervention for caregivers of patients undergoing HSCT at the Massachusetts
  General Hospital Cancer Center. We are enrolling and randomising 125 caregivers
  to receive the BMT-CARE app or usual care in a 1:1 assignment, stratifying by transplant
  type (autologous vs allogeneic). Caregivers assigned to the BMT-CARE app complete
  five self-guided modules designed to improve coping and stress management prior
  to and up to 60 days post-HSCT. The modules include interactive, gamified features
  and video vignettes to optimise engagement. Participants complete questionnaires
  at baseline and days 10, 60 and 100 post-HSCT. The primary outcome is comparison
  of QOL at day 60 post-HSCT. Secondary outcomes include caregiver burden, anxiety
  and depression symptoms, as well as post-traumatic stress symptoms. We are also
  exploring the usability of the BMT-CARE app to inform refinements prior to future
  testing. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is funded by the Leukemia and Lymphoma
  Society and approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review
  Board (Protocol #22-634 v.1.5). The results of this study will be reported in accordance
  with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for non-pharmacological
  trials. Results will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed
  journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05709912; Pre-results.'
