input_text: 'Impact of lenalidomide consolidation on health-related quality of life
  in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: ancillary study of the phase III CLL6-RESIDUUM
  trial. BACKGROUND: Within the French-Australian CLL6 RESIDUUM trial, an ancillary
  study aimed at assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients
  with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving a two-year consolidation of lenalidomide
  (LEN) or observation (OBS) after classical immunochemotherapy leaving them with
  detectable residual disease. METHODS: Data from French patients involved in this
  the trial were used here. The EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire was completed
  by patients at baseline, and then at months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 after consolidation.
  Repeated measures mixed-effects models were used to assess HRQoL changes between
  baseline and each checkpoint for each HRQoL scale. RESULTS: Baseline data showed
  overall a good global health status with mean scores of 76.3 and 72.1 in the LEN
  and OBS arms respectively, on the 0-100 scale. At 12 months, LEN patients had significantly
  more diarrhea than OBS patients (p = 0.003) and social functioning was significantly
  impaired at month 18 (p = 0.05). A 10-point difference appeared in the LEN arm for
  dyspnea and digestive disorders from month 12 on. Multivariate analysis showed a
  deleterious effect of LEN on global health (p = 0.02) and functional scales (p =
  0.003). CONCLUSION: This study provides HRQoL values in a French cohort of CLL patients
  in consolidation treatment. Supplementation with lenalidomide as consolidation therapy
  in CLL leads to late health deterioration, especially diarrhea, after 12 months
  of treatment. Quantitative assessment of HRQoL should be balanced against benefits
  in disease control to determine overall health benefits.'
