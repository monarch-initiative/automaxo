input_text: Nationwide study of COVID-19 outcomes in hematologic patients following
  bone marrow transplantation. Background Patients with hematological malignancies
  (HMs), particularly those who have undergone bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell
  transplantation (HSCT), are at greater risk for morbidity and mortality due to immunosuppression.
  The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these vulnerabilities in HM patients, although
  comprehensive data specifically on HSCT recipients are limited. Objective This study
  investigated the clinical and demographic profiles of HSCT recipients hospitalized
  with COVID-19 in Spain. We also identified factors associated with in-hospital mortality
  in HSCT patients. Methods We conducted a nationwide, retrospective analysis using
  data from the Spanish National Health System. We included hospitalized patients
  with HMs and COVID-19 infection from 2020 to 2022. We used descriptive statistics,
  multivariate logistic regression, and survival analyses to assess predictors of
  mortality. Results In total, 35,648 patients with HMs were included, of whom 2,324
  (6.5%) had undergone HSCT. The in-hospital mortality rate for HSCT recipients was
  13%, lower than the 20% observed in non-HSCT patients. Older age, dementia, acute
  leukemia, and solid tumors were independently associated with increased mortality.
  In spite of their immunosuppressed state, HSCT recipients experienced relatively
  favorable outcomes, suggesting partial immune recovery following transplantation.
  Conclusions HSCT recipients with COVID-19 present different clinical characteristics
  and mortality risks than non-recipients. These findings indicate the need for specific
  management strategies for this vulnerable population. Further research is needed
  to explore immunological recovery and the transplant-specific factors that may influence
  COVID-19 outcomes.
