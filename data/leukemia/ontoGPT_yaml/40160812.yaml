input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in managing cytokine release syndrome
  after CD19 CAR-T therapy for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
  Purpose: CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has shown promise
  in treating relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL),
  but cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains a significant side effect. Methods:
  This retrospective cohort study investigated the use of tocilizumab for managing
  CAR-T-related CRS in 45 R/R B-ALL patients. Results: Of these, 17 patients received
  tocilizumab, resulting in a significant reduction in the duration of grade 3 CRS
  compared to those who did not receive the drug. Additionally, 10 patients showed
  decreased cytokine levels.Importantly, tocilizumab did not impair CAR-T cell expansion
  or efficacy, nor did it increase the incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: These
  findings suggest that tocilizumab may be an effective and safe strategy for mitigating
  CAR-T-related CRS in R/R B-ALL patients, potentially improving patient outcomes
  and survival.'
