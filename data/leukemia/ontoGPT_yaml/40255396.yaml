input_text: 'Development and validation of a disulfidptosis-related genes signature
  for predicting outcomes and immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. Background:
  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy with poor outcomes and
  high recurrence. Disulfidptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death driven by
  aberrant disulfide bonds and F-actin collapse, provides insights into cancer progression
  and treatment. Methods: We investigated the correlation network and prognostic values
  of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in AML. Unsupervised clustering was performed
  to reveal distinct disulfidptosis-related AML subtypes. We implemented the differential
  analysis and enrichment analysis to explore the difference of the distinct subtypes
  in biological processes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)
  Cox model was used to generate a disulfidptosis-related signature. We employed the
  ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, and scRNA analyses to assess the tumor microenvironment of
  AML. Moreover, experiments validated the functions of PTPN6 and CSK in OCI-AML2
  cells. Results: We identified 10 prognostic DRGs and revealed two disulfidptosis
  subtypes. DRGs significantly affected immune processes like interferon-gamma response
  and MHC class II antigen presentation. LASSO algorithm was implemented to established
  a 6-gene signature (HLA-DRB5, CCDC124, PTPN6, HLA-DMA, CSK, ISG15) that predicted
  prognosis in two validation cohorts more robustly than other signatures. Disulfidptosis
  was correlated with tumor microenvironment immune cells, especially monocytes. The
  two risk subgroups differed significantly in susceptibilities of multiple chemotherapy
  drugs, indicating disulfidptosis as a potential therapeutic target. Knockdown of
  PTPN6 and CSK inhibited the proliferation of AML cells and increased apoptosis.
  Conclusions: Our study provides insights into DRG prognoses and immunomodulation,
  establishing a robust 6-gene risk model for predicting AML outcomes that may enhance
  precision medicine and treatment strategies.'
