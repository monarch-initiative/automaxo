input_text: 'T-bet overexpression enhances CAR T cell effector functions and antigen
  sensitivity. BACKGROUND: T cells modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor
  (CAR) are successful against B-lineage malignancies but fail to induce durable remissions
  in up to half of patients and have shown limited efficacy against other types of
  cancer. Strategies to improve CAR T cell potency and responses to low antigen densities
  without inducing CAR T cell dysfunction or limiting persistence are necessary to
  expand durability of remissions. METHODS: We overexpressed T-bet in human and mouse
  CAR T cells to mimic exposure to signal 3 cytokines during T cell priming to promote
  T helper cell 1 (Th1) polarization of CD4+CAR T cells with the goal of enhancing
  antitumor activity. Using human CAR T cells and xenograft models we interrogated
  the impact of T-bet overexpression on CAR T cell antitumor activity in vitro and
  in vivo. We also used a syngeneic murine CAR T cell model to study the impact of
  T-bet overexpression on long-term persistence and secondary responses to tumor rechallenge.
  RESULTS: T-bet overexpression reduced expression of the Th2 cytokine interleukin
  4 and promoted polyfunctional production of Th1-associated cytokines in response
  to CAR stimulation. T-bet overexpression enhanced some effector functions in vitro
  but did not improve CAR T cell-mediated control of leukemia expressing high levels
  of antigen in vivo. T-bet overexpression also improved effector function of murine
  CD19 CAR T cells with no impairment to the persistence or ability of persistent
  CAR T cells to re-expand and clear a secondary leukemia challenge. Finally, T-bet
  overexpression promoted enhanced in vitro function against leukemia expressing low
  levels of CD19, which translated to improved control of CD19lo leukemia in vivo
  by human C19 CAR T cells containing a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. CONCLUSIONS: Together,
  our data demonstrate that T-bet overexpression induces a reduction in Th2 cytokine
  production, an increase in polyfunctional Th1 cytokine production and enhances 4-1BB
  CAR T cell activity against cancers expressing low levels of target antigen without
  promoting a loss in functional CAR T cell persistence.'
