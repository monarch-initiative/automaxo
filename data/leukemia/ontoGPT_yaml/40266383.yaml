input_text: 'CAR T-cells for acute leukemias in children: current status, challenges,
  and future directions. CAR T-cells therapy is seen as one of the most promising
  immunotherapies for leukemias, since targeting CD19 has revolutionized the treatment
  of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in children,
  adolescents, and young adults. Early phase clinical trials have shown a very high
  initial response rate confirmed by follow up and real-world studies. However, almost
  half of patients relapse with the available commercial product currently suggesting
  the need of a consolidative treatment after CAR T-cell infusion in well-defined
  cases, according to several pre- and post-CAR clinical and biological factors. This
  finding highlights that numerous challenges exist before the extension of CAR T-cell
  indications (first relapse and high-risk first line) in the field of B-ALL: to enhance
  persistence of CAR T-cells to avoid CD19-positive relapse and to avoid CD19-negative
  relapse by reducing tumor burden pre-CAR-T infusion and/or by multitargeting. Promising
  approaches with exciting early clinical data are emerging in the field of T-cell
  ALL. The use of CAR T-cells for acute myeloid leukemias remains challenging due
  to the lack of leukemia-specific antigens and to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.'
