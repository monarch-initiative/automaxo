input_text: '[Progress in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid
  leukemia]. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant disease of myeloid hematopoietic
  stem/progenitor cells. Although new drugs have emerged in recent years, the status
  of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in AML still remains irreplaceable.
  This article reviews the adjustment of indications for HSCT in AML, donor selection,
  and updates of conditioning regimens, new prevention strategies for post-transplant
  relapse, new targeted drugs, immunotherapy combined with HSCT to improve the prognosis
  of relapsed and refractory AML, and optimization of transplantation technology for
  elderly AML.'
