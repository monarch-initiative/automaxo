input_text: 'Comparative efficacy of venetoclax-based regiments in the management
  of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a systematic review and metanalysis. Chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are common lymphoproliferative
  diseases in the elderly, accounting for 33% of all leukemias. The use of targeted
  therapies has significantly changed the management landscape of CLL/SLL. However,
  the efficacy of specific targeted therapies, such as venetoclax-based therapies,
  is limited. This review, therefore, aims to summarize the current evidence on the
  effectiveness and safety of venetoclax-based treatments in the management of CLL/SLL.
  We conducted a comprehensive search of three electronic databases, PubMed, Science
  Direct and Google Scholar, for all relevant articles. The reported outcomes were
  then analyzed using the statistical software Review Manager (RevMan 5.4.1). Our
  electronic search yielded 347 articles, of which only five were included in the
  review. We pooled the outcomes from 2195 patients. Our analysis found that venetoclax-based
  therapies significantly increased progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.30; 95%
  CI [0.21, 0.43] p < 0.00001), overall survival (OS) (HR 0.60; 95% CI [0.45, 0.80]
  p = 0.0004), and time to the next treatment (TTNT) (HR 0.29; 95% [0.18, 0.46] p
  < 0.00001). Additionally, we found the comparative safety of venetoclax-based therapies
  to other combination therapies. Our study found that venetoclax-based therapies
  are superior to other combination therapies in prolonging survival. Furthermore,
  they are comparable in safety to standard chemotherapy regimens and cost-effective.
  The findings of this review provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of venetoclax-based
  regimens in CLL/SLL. However, further research is required to determine the best
  comparative regimen and the feasibility of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with
  CLL/SLL.'
