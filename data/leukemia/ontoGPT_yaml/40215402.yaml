input_text: 'Development of an eHealth Mindfulness-Based Music Therapy Intervention
  for Adults Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: Qualitative
  Study. Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT)
  is an effective treatment for various hematologic cancers, though it often results
  in severe side effects and psychological distress, which can negatively impact health
  outcomes. Integrative therapies like mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR),
  mindfulness meditation (MM), and music therapy (MT) yield promising results in enhancing
  both psychosocial outcomes (eg, reducing anxiety and depression) and physiological
  adaptation (eg, decreasing inflammation) in cancer patients. Objective: We developed
  and refined, using focus groups and environmental and field testing, an eHealth-delivered
  mindfulness-based music therapy (eMBMT) intervention aimed at improving health-related
  quality of life, symptom burden (ie, pain, fatigue, and sleep), disease activity
  (ie, chronic graft-versus-host disease, cytomegalovirus activation, and infections)
  and psychosocial (ie, depression, anxiety, and cancer-specific distress) and physiological
  adaptation (ie, inflammation and immune reconstitution) tailored to adults receiving
  allo-SCT. Methods: eMBMT intervention content is grounded in MT, MM, and MBSR, developed
  by a multidisciplinary team, and adapted for adults undergoing allo-SCT. eMBMT content
  was refined through focus groups and usability and field testing. Focus groups used
  a semistructured interview guide, while field testing used the "think aloud" method.
  Usability was evaluated using the 30-item Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of
  Use (USE) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics analyzed the USE questionnaire and
  participant characteristics, while rapid qualitative analysis was applied to focus
  groups and field-testing sessions. Survivors eligible to participate in the focus
  groups and usability and field testing were adults (>18 years old) who received
  an allo-SCT (<36 months) for myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or
  chronic myeloid leukemia, and were in remission for greater than 3 months. Results:
  During the focus groups, participants (n=11; mean age 43.6, SD 17.8 years) provided
  qualitative feedback highlighting the shock of diagnosis, challenges during hospitalization,
  and coping strategies posttreatment. The eMBMT platform received positive evaluations
  for usefulness (mean 6.47, SD 0.29), ease of use (mean 6.92, SD 0.60), and satisfaction
  (mean 6.16, SD 0.82). Key themes from field testing highlighted the significance
  of social support, hope, and maintaining an active lifestyle. Suggestions for improvement
  included incorporating more representative content, reducing text, enhancing guidance,
  offering diverse music options, and streamlining blood sample collection. Conclusions:
  The eMBMT intervention is a comprehensive, user-friendly eHealth tool tailored to
  the unique needs of allo-SCT patients. The positive feedback and identified areas
  for improvement underscore its potential to enhance well-being, symptom management,
  and overall quality of life for cancer survivors. A future pilot randomized controlled
  trial will further evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
  of the eMBMT intervention in improving health-related quality of life, symptom burden,
  disease activity, and psychosocial and physiological adaptation.'
