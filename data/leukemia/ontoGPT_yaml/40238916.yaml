input_text: Preclinical development of anti-CD21 chimeric antigen receptor T cells
  to treat T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients with relapsed/refractory
  (r/r) T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have a dismal prognosis, highlighting
  the urgent need for effective therapies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell
  approaches targeting pan-T cell antigens may be limited by T cell aplasia and fratricide,
  necessitating "rescue" allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this
  study, we identify CD21, a pan-B cell marker, as a promising target for T-ALL immunotherapy.
  CD21 is expressed in 50% of T-ALL cases at diagnosis but in fewer than 10% of mature
  T cells. We observed that CAR-T cells targeting membrane-distal CD21 epitopes were
  ineffective, likely because of the bulky, glycosylated nature of the antigen. However,
  when we engineered CAR-T cells to target membrane-proximal CD21 epitopes using an
  antigen-binding fragment (Fab)-CAR design, we demonstrated robust activity against
  T-ALL cell lines, primary tumors, and patient-derived xenografts in both in vitro
  and in vivo models. The enhanced efficacy of this Fab-CAR design was driven by its
  high stability and reduced surface expression, addressing limitations of traditional
  CAR constructs. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase axis up-regulated CD21 expression in T-ALL, further enhancing the potency
  of anti-CD21 CAR-T cells in vitro and in a patient-derived xenograft in vivo model.
  This study establishes CD21 as a viable CAR-T target and highlights advances in
  CAR design for bulky antigens, as well as the potential for pharmacological strategies
  to augment target expression. Anti-CD21 CAR-T cells represent a promising therapeutic
  option for improving outcomes for patients with T-ALL.
