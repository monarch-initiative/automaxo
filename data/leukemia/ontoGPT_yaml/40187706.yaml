input_text: "Controlled release of dasatinib from cyclodextrin-based inclusion complexes
  by mechanochemistry: A computational and experimental study. Dasatinib, a potent
  tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is widely used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia and
  Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, its poor
  aqueous solubility and high first-pass metabolism result in limited oral bioavailability
  and potentially severe side effects, such as cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and
  pulmonary complications, which are intensified by rapid concentration peaks in the
  bloodstream. To address these challenges, this study examines the development of
  a controlled-release formulation of dasatinib using cyclodextrins as macrocyclic
  receptors to form inclusion complexes. Cyclodextrins, known for their ability to
  form host-guest complexes, enhance drug solubility and stability while enabling
  controlled drug release and aligning with green chemistry principles when synthesized
  mechanochemically. Different solid-state and solution-based characterization methods
  confirmed successful complexation and drug amorphization. Additionally, molecular
  dynamics simulations provided valuable insights into the binding interactions between
  dasatinib and cyclodextrins in both gas-phase and aqueous medium, simulating experimental
  conditions in the absence of a solvent and a physiological environment. Formulated
  tablets exhibited enhanced solubility and improved in vitro release profiles, suggesting
  a potential reduction in adverse side effects and improved patient compliance. The
  results demonstrate the efficacy of cyclodextrins as carriers for dasatinib, highlighting
  their potential to improve the drug's therapeutic profile in leukemia treatment
  by facilitating a steady, controlled release and minimizing toxicity."
