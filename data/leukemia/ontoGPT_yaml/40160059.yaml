input_text: 'Outcome of Induction Chemotherapy with the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-95
  Regimen in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Patients: A Quasi-Experimental Study. Response
  to induction chemotherapy plays a major role in prognosis of acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL). The objective of this study was to explore the outcome of induction
  chemotherapy with the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) -95 regimen in ALL patients
  admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh. This quasi-experimental study
  was conducted among 50 ALL patients admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH),
  Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2020 to June 2020. All patients received induction
  therapy with the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-95 regimen following pre-induction prednisolone
  therapy. Outcomes were defined as complete remission (CR) and undetectable minimal
  residual disease (MRD). There was significant clinical and hematological improvement
  after induction chemotherapy with the BFM regimen. A total of 68.0% patients achieved
  complete remission. Negative MRD was achieved in 66.0% patients. In addition, 72.0%
  of the patients had a good response to pre-induction prednisolone therapy. Positive
  outcomes were not associated with the clinical presentation or disease characteristics
  of the ALL patients. Induction chemotherapy with the BFM-95 regimen is effective
  in the majority of ALL patients irrespective of clinical presentation or disease
  characteristics.'
