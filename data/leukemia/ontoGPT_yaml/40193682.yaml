input_text: 'The adult HNRNPH1::ERG positive acute myeloid leukemia with clear lower
  remission and worse prognosis: A case report and review of the literature. RATIONALE:
  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) derived from t(5;21)(q35;q22) translocation, post-transcriptional
  translation, forming the HNRNPH1::ERG fusion gene is a rare group of recurrent chromosomal
  abnormality myeloid malignancies. Only 1 adult case of AML has been reported so
  far. Here we identified a disparate adult case of HNRNPH1::ERG positive AML with
  clear breakpoint locations by utilizing The RNA sequencing(RNA-seq) and we addressed
  the clinical, treatment, pathological and molecular mechanism, along with a review
  of the literature. PATIENTS CONCERNS: A 54-year-old man visited our department with
  fever and fatigue for 10 days. DIAGNOSES: Diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML) through morphology, immunology, Cytogenetics, and Molecular biology (MICM)
  typing, with a confirmed HNRNPH1-ERG fusion gene. INTERVENTIONS: Multiple induction
  chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy was performed. OUTCOMES: He died in
  February 2024. LESSONS: In our review, Only 1 adult case of AML has been reported
  so far. To summarize the 5 cases in the studies, the HNRNPH1::ERG positive AML cases
  had a significantly higher blast cell counts and more frequently companied with
  rare gene mutations, which characterized poorer prognosis and lower remission in
  adult HNRNPH1::ERG positive AML.'
