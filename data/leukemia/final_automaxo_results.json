Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. METHODS: We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 55 patients treated with the VHA regimen. The overall response rate (ORR) was 92.7% (51/55, 95% CI 82%-98%), and the composite complete remission (CRc) rate was 87.3% (48/55, 95% CI 76%-95%). Among the 48 patients who achieved CRc, 91.7% (44/48, 95% CI 67%-90%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 85.4% (41/48, 95% CI 72%-94%) reached measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative CR. In the adverse-risk group, ORR and CRc were 95% (19/20, 95% CI 75%-100%) and 75% (15/20, 95% CI 51%-91%), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (32.7%), pneumonia (16.3%), and sepsis (9.1%). Median overall survival (OS) was 26 months, while event-free survival (EFS) was not reached. One-year OS was 83%, and one-year EFS was 82%. These preliminary data suggest that the VHA regimen achieves a very high rate of CR and low toxicity, particularly for adverse-risk AML patients.",

METHODS: Clinical data are reported from 394 ND patients with FLT3-mutated AML enrolled in the retrospective observational Italian Cohort Study on FLT3-mutated patients with AML and treated with an upfront intensive regimen with (FLT3i group, n = 92) or without (CT group, n = 302) the addition of a FLT3i. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 34.5 months, an effectiveness benefit obtained by FLT3i incorporation both in terms of overall survival (median, 34.9 in the FLT3i vs 12.7 months in the CT group, p < .01) and relapse-free survival (median, 18.9 in the FLT3i vs 7.6 months in the CT group, p = .01) was documented, with a higher composite complete remission rate (75.4% in the FLT3i vs 62.4% in the CT group, p = .052). FLT3i benefit seemed to be independent from the transplant rate. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the benefit of FLT3i addition to upfront intensive treatment in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML patients was confirmed in a large, real-life cohort study.",

Efforts to improve outcomes have included the use of high-dose cytarabine in combination with nucleoside analogs, such as cladribine. The authors evaluated combined cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine (CLIA) in a phase 2 trial of 66 patients with R/R AML. METHODS: Patients received induction with cladribine 5 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1-5), cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1-5), and idarubicin 10 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1-3; CLIA). Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (days 1-14) was added for FLT3-mutated AML. RESULTS: The composite response rate (complete remission [CR] plus complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) was 33%; salvage 1 (S1) patients (n = 35) had a CR/CRi rate of 49%. After a 61-month median follow-up, the median overall survival (OS) was 7.9 months, with a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 9.1 months for those in CR/CRi. The median OS for S1 patients was 12 months, with a median RFS of 10.3 months. For those who received CLIA with sorafenib (n = 22), the CR/CRi rate was 41%, median OS was 8.8 months, and median RFS was 3.8 months. Landmark analysis demonstrated superior OS for patients who proceeded to transplantation compared with patients who did not (median OS, 78 vs. 8.8 months, respectively; p < .001). The 4-week and 8-week mortality rates were 6% and 17%, respectively. Most grade >3 adverse events were related to infection and elevated liver function tests. CONCLUSIONS: CLIA is effective for patients with R/R AML and offers a safety profile similar to that of other intensive regimens (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02115295).",

Adding the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) to IST could improve hematologic responses in patients with SAA; however, limited data exist for elder patients. Here, we report on the efficacy and prognostic factors associated with porcine ATG and CsA with or without TPO-RA as first-line therapy in elderly patients with SAA. Porcine ATG was administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d for 5 days. CsA was administered orally, maintaining plasma trough concentrations of 150-250 microg/L. Eltrombopag was administered at a dose of 75-150 mg/day, and hetrombopag was administered orally at a dose of 15 mg/day. One hundred and twenty-eight SAA patients, with a median age of 63 (60-73) years old, were included in this study, including 44 very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) patients. All patients completed the porcine ATG treatment, and mild serum sicknesses were observed. Ten patients (2 SAA patients and 8 VSAA patients) died within 3 months of ATG initiation (early death), with severe infections being the main cause of death. Sixty-nine patients achieved a hematologic response at 6 months, with an overall response (OR) rate of 53.9%. The complete hematologic response (CR) rate at 6 months was 18.0%. The addition of TPO-RA to IST did not improve the OR and CR rates; nonetheless, early death was significantly lower (0%) in patients receiving TPO-RA compared to those not receiving TPO-RA (12%). Patients were followed up for a median of 28 (0.1-117) months. The OR rate at the last follow-up was 62.5%, while the CR rate was 36.7%. One patient progressed to myelodysplastic syndrome, one to leukemia, one to hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and five developed clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The 2-year overall survival rate and failure-free survival rate were 86.0% (95% CI: 78.1-91.3%) and 70.5% (95% CI: 61.3-77.9%), respectively. A baseline neutrophil count of < 0.05 x 109/L was identified as an independent prognostic factor for early death. Age younger than 65 years, a baseline reticulocyte count of >= 7 x 109/L, and the absence of fever before and within 3 months following ATG treatment were independent predictors for hematologic response at 6 months. In conclusion, treatment with porcine ATG and CsA was safe and effective in elderly patients with SAA. An extremely low baseline neutrophil count indicated a high risk of early death.",

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n = 73) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n = 51), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P = 0.002). The median times to best response were 1.1 and 2.7 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P < 0.001). More patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (47%) than in the DEC-C cohort (16%, P < 0.001). The 4- and 8-week mortality did not significantly differ between the DEC-C and DEC-C-Ven cohorts. Patients in the DEC-C-Ven cohort had a more profound neutropenia at days 15 and 21 of the first cycle. The median overall survival was 24 and 19 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P = 0.89), and the median event-free survival durations were 18 and 10 months (P = 0.026).

                    "abstract": "Hypomethylating agents (HMA) are indicated in the treatment of higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n = 73) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n = 51), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P = 0.002). The median times to best response were 1.1 and 2.7 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P < 0.001). More patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (47%) than in the DEC-C cohort (16%, P < 0.001). The 4- and 8-week mortality did not significantly differ between the DEC-C and DEC-C-Ven cohorts. Patients in the DEC-C-Ven cohort had a more profound neutropenia at days 15 and 21 of the first cycle. The median overall survival was 24 and 19 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P = 0.89), and the median event-free survival durations were 18 and 10 months (P = 0.026). In conclusion, the addition of Ven resulted in improved response rates and outcomes in specific subgroups; prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. METHODS: We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

Method: Clinical data of patients with hematological malignancies undergoing haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) at the Children's Hospital of Soochow University from January 2020 to June 2023 were collected. This study primarily aims to investigate the association between pre-conditioning ALC and clinical outcomes in pediatric acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes patients receiving myeloablative haplo-HSCT. Results: We included 130 patients treated at the Children's Hospital of Soochow University from January 2020 to June 2023. According to the cutoff of 500/mul, patients were divided into high and low ALC groups. Patients in the high ALC group experienced a higher incidence of II-IV acute GVHD (30.2% versus 13.6%, P = 0.034), 3-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates (OS: 88.5% +- 3.7% versus 66.9% +- 7.9%, P = 0.013; RFS: 81.4% +- 4.1% versus 56.5% +- 8.1%, P < 0.001), and lower cumulative incidence of relapse (11.3% versus 27.4%, P = 0.013). Pre-conditioning ALC < 500/mul independently predicted worse OS, RFS, and higher relapse risk in multivariate analysis. However, there was no significant difference in immune reconstitution between the two groups. Conclusion: Pre-conditioning ALC was a significant prognostic factor in pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative haplo-HSCT. Further research is needed to explore whether pre-conditioning ALC can serve as a reference for adjusting ATG dosing.",

First-line induction treatment includes the combination of all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide, with which complete response rates greater than 90% are achieved. Although the combination is very effective, there are adverse reactions associated with the treatment, which include cellular differentiation syndrome, headache, fatigue, elevated triglycerides, and myositis. The latter is rare and is manifested by intense muscle pain a few days after starting ATRA. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values are not always elevated and this can make diagnosis difficult with delayed treatment and increased risk of complications. We report the case of a woman with APL who, during the induction phase of treatment, presented myositis of the pelvic muscles and lower extremities secondary to the administration of ATRA. The condition resolved after the administration of corticosteroids and temporary suspension of ATRA, with no recurrence after its restart.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often unsuitable for standard treatments and traditionally have a dismal prognosis. For 20 years, hypomethylating agents (HMAs), as single agents and recently as a backbone with venetoclax, have been used in this setting. The oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine (C-DEC), which is therapeutically and pharmacologically equivalent to the intravenous (IV) formulation (IV-DEC), has expanded the therapeutic arsenal for AML, allowing for better convenience of administration. This review provides an overview of C-DEC, current clinical applications, and ongoing clinical studies, highlighting its potential role in managing AML in older patients. AREAS COVERED: For the aim of this review, the authors searched the current English literature on C-DEC in AML patients through PubMed, using several pertinent keywords. To summarize the most recent developments as up-to-date as possible, we considered, with a few exceptions, only papers published over the last three years until March 2025. EXPERT OPINION: Compared to IV-DEC, C-DEC provides similar therapeutic exposure and efficacy with an optional safety profile, enhanced treatment adherence, reduced treatment burden, and required healthcare facilities compared to those associated with IV-DEC, providing a precious tool to manage older and unfit AML patients.",

Patients with PNH are known to have an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We report a case of a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with AML 13 years after a diagnosis of PNH. Gene mutations associated with MDS were detected. She did not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine. Unrelated bone marrow transplantation was performed with a myeloablative conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (12 Gy). Ravulizumab was administered until 47 days after transplantation. She achieved CR after transplantation with complete donor engraftment. The transplantation was successful without severe complications such as graft-versus-host disease or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Further accumulation of cases is necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of anti-complement inhibitors in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

Sixty-seven adults with MDS were enrolled (part 1, 40 with low/intermediate-1 or intermediate-2/high IPSS risk status; part 2, 27 with intermediate-2/high IPSS risk status). Primary safety endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints included evaluation of clinical outcomes, survival, and pharmacokinetics. Dose-limiting toxicities were experienced by no patients in part 1 and 3 patients (11%) in part 2. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea and fatigue (40% each) in part 1 and fatigue (44%) and anemia (37%) in part 2. In parts 1 and 2, 15% of patients experienced marrow complete response as their best overall response, according to IWG criteria. Hematologic improvement was observed in 35% and 30% of patients respectively in part 1 and part 2. The study was terminated early due to limited efficacy.",

Among the 8 patients who achieved remission after CD7 CAR-T cell infusion, 5 patients received consolidation allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Compared with 3 patients who did not undergo consolidation allo-HSCT, patients with allo-HSCT as consolidation showed a trend toward better OS (allo-HSCT vs. control: 6-month OS, 60% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.073) and better PFS (allo-HSCT vs. control: 6-month PFS, 60% vs. 0%, p = 0.022). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in all patients (grade 1-2 in 67% of patients, grade 3 in 33% of patients), and one patient experienced neurotoxicity. CD7 CAR-T cell therapy is a promising option for R/R T-ALL/LBL patients with manageable adverse events. Moreover, CD7 CAR-T cell infusion followed by consolidation allo-HSCT in R/R T-ALL/LBL patients might play an important role in prolonging remission duration.",

The median follow-up time was 1215 days (103-3173 days). The median number of administered AZA cycles was 8. The 2-year relapse-free survival was 86.8% (46/53) in the AZA group compared with 76.1% (70/92) in the control group (P = 0.121). The 2-year overall survival in the AZA and control groups were 88.7% (47/53) and 82.6% (76/92), respectively (P = 0.326). Six patients (11.3%) in the AZA group experienced relapse, all of whom had a minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive status pre-HSCT. A total of 17 (32.1%) patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events. In the preemptive therapy group, 70% (7/10) of the patients achieved complete remission after AZA treatment. AZA maintenance therapy following allo-HSCT is well tolerated and further follow-up and a larger group of patients will be necessary to confirm the potential to prevent relapse. The pre-transplant MRD status was identified as an important factor affecting the efficacy of AZA maintenance therapy.",

We report the results of CARCIK-CD19 observed in 36 patients (4 children and 32 adults) treated according to the final recommended dose. Cytokine release syndrome of grade 2 or lower occurred in 15 patients, ICANS grade 2 in 1 patient, and late-onset peripheral neurotoxicity of grade 3 in 2 patients. GVHD never occurred after treatment with allogeneic CARCIK-CD19. Complete remission was achieved by 30 out of 36 patients (83.3%), with MRD negativity in 89% of responders. With a median follow-up of 2.2 years, the 1-year overall survival was 57.0%, and event-free survival was 32.0%. The median duration of response at 1 year was 38.6%. CAR-T cells expanded rapidly after infusion and remained detectable for over 2 years. Integration site analysis after infusion showed a high clonal diversity. These data demonstrated that SB-engineered CAR-T cells are safe and induce durable remission in heavily pretreated patients with BCP-ALL relapsed after alloHSCT.

Megakaryocytes maintain hematopoietic stem cell microenvironment through inflammatory and immunological responses. The primary objective of this research was to investigate the clinical impact of BM-MK counts in high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Three hundred and forty-six patients (median age, 42 (15-71) years; male/female, 207/139) participated in the study. Based on the BM-MK counts on day + 100 of alloHSCT, the study population was classified into normal/high-MK+100 and low-MK+100 groups. The probabilities of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly better in the normal/high-MK+100 group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Nonrelapse mortality was found to be reduced in the same group of patients (p = 0.012). BM-MK+100 count, which was indicated to be a predictor for relapse after alloHSCT (p = 0.018), represented a considerable impact on PFS and OS (p = 0.017, p = 0.009). Megakaryocytes have regulatory roles in association with a comprehensive cytokine network in the BM microenvironment. Although the localization of MKs may be determinative for their spectrum of efficacy, distinct biological subgroups may also help to clarify the heterogeneity of their functional features. Prospective efforts in larger populations are required to illuminate the potential prognostic role of MKs in alloHSCT recipients.",

Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed on patients with newly diagnosed ALAL who were hospitalized at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital from June 2021 to July 2024. Of the 13 patients who received initial induction therapy with venetoclax combined with multidrug chemotherapy, 8 received VAA+P regimen, and 5 received V+IA regimen. Patients with FLT3 mutation were treated with FLT3 inhibitor, and Ph(+) patients received an additional tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events were analyzed. Results: According to the World Health Organization 5th edition of the classification of hematolymphoid tumors, the immunophenotypes were T/myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) (n=4), B/myeloid MPAL (n=7), and ALAL- not otherwise specified (n=2). Of the seven patients with B/myeloid MPAL, four were Ph(+) and belonged to the group with specific gene abnormalities of ALAL. Three patients had FLT3 mutation (one with FLT3-TKD mutation and two with FLT3-ITD mutation). Prior to the second course of consolidation therapy, the efficacy of venetoclax induction therapy was evaluated, and a complete response rate of 100% was achieved in 13 patients. In the subsequent consolidation therapy phase, one patient discontinued treatment and was lost to follow-up; nine patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, four of whom died due to posttransplant complications and five achieved DFS. Of the three patients (>=70 years old) who received consolidation therapy as before, two achieved DFS and one died due to central nervous system leukemia. The median OS time was not reached in 13 patients; the 75th percentile survival time was 12.0 months, with a 12-month cumulative survival rate of 64.5%. The median DFS time was not reached in all patients; the 75th percentile DFS time was 8.2 months, with a 12-month cumulative DFS rate of 67.1%. All patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, during and after induction therapy. All patients recovered hematopoietic function after the initial induction therapy, with no fatal hemorrhage, tumor lysis syndrome, neurological adverse events, or grade 3 or higher organ toxicity, excluding preexisting conditions. Conclusion: Venetoclax in combination with multidrug chemotherapy was effective and associated with tolerable adverse reactions in patients with newly diagnosed ALAL.",

As CAR-T usage expands, hyperinflammatory toxicities resembling hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) syndrome are increasingly recognized. Immune effector cell-associated HLH-like syndrome (IEC-HS) describes HLH-like symptoms attributable to CAR-T cell therapy, often presenting as CRS resolves. Treatments for IEC-HS are adapted from primary HLH, including corticosteroids, the recombinant human interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist anakinra and the Janus Kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib. Emapalumab, an anti-IFN-gamma antibody, is promising but underexplored in adult IEC-HS cases. We report an adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patient treated with brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel). The patient developed CRS, refractory neurotoxicity, and IEC-HS with worsening multiorgan failure and hyperinflammatory markers. Treatment included tocilizumab, high-dose corticosteroids, anakinra, siltuximab, and ruxolitinib. Despite aggressive management, hyperinflammation and neurotoxicity persisted. Emapalumab was initiated on day +11, resulting in normalization of the biochemical parameters and full neurological recovery by day +21. The patient recovered from IEC-HS and underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This case highlights the role of emapalumab in managing refractory IEC-HS and persistent neurotoxicity in adults, underscoring the need for targeted interventions in severe CAR-T complications.",

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the venetoclax-homoharringtonine-cytarabine (VHA) regimen in patients with newly diagnosed (ND) AML. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 55 patients treated with the VHA regimen. The overall response rate (ORR) was 92.7% (51/55, 95% CI 82%-98%), and the composite complete remission (CRc) rate was 87.3% (48/55, 95% CI 76%-95%). Among the 48 patients who achieved CRc, 91.7% (44/48, 95% CI 67%-90%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 85.4% (41/48, 95% CI 72%-94%) reached measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative CR. In the adverse-risk group, ORR and CRc were 95% (19/20, 95% CI 75%-100%) and 75% (15/20, 95% CI 51%-91%), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (32.7%), pneumonia (16.3%), and sepsis (9.1%). Median overall survival (OS) was 26 months, while event-free survival (EFS) was not reached. One-year OS was 83%, and one-year EFS was 82%. These preliminary data suggest that the VHA regimen achieves a very high rate of CR and low toxicity, particularly for adverse-risk AML patients.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the incidence and risk factors of invasive fungal infection (IFI) among patients with haematological malignancies (HM) in a tertiary hospital from Malaysia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in a teaching hospital involving HM patients, admitted for chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Each admission for either chemotherapy or HSCT was considered as a separate event. Patients were followed up for development of IFI from the time of each admission to time of discharge or time of death. Outcomes of patients with IFI upon discharge were recorded. Clinical and mycological data during each admission were collected and analysed. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients with mean age of 58.8+-15.5 years were recruited. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the most common diagnosis (45.8%). A total of 132 admissions were analysed from these 83 patients. Antifungal prophylaxes were prescribed in 94.7% of admissions with fluconazole being the most common agent used (88.6%). The incidence of proven and probable IFI was 7.6%. Candida tropicalis was the most common fungi isolated from these patients (22.7%), followed by Candida krusei (13.6%). The mortality rate due to IFI was 17.6%. Patients with AML and those with concomitant bacteraemia were associated with higher risk of IFI (odds ratio [OR] 3.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-11.71, p=0.029 and OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.37-12.66, p=0.009, respectively), while the use of antifungal prophylaxis was associated with lower IFI risk (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.83, p=0.045). After multivariate analysis, the use of antifungal prophylaxis remains significantly associated with lower risk of IFI (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.01-0.62, p=0.019). CONCLUSION: IFI remains one of serious complications of HM patients undergoing chemotherapy and HSCT, most commonly due to non-albicans Candida spp. Appropriate antifungal prophylaxis is therefore crucial in the prevention of breakthrough IFI.",

This study investigates the efficacy and safety of combining decitabine (DAC) with arsenic trioxide (ATO) as a novel therapeutic approach. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 elderly high-risk MDS patients, with 52 receiving ATO-DAC (ATO-DAC group) and 68 receiving DAC monotherapy (DAC group). Treatment outcomes were assessed through overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Adverse events were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The ATO-DAC group demonstrated a significantly higher ORR of 78.85% compared to 52.94% in the DAC group (P = 0.026). Median PFS was 7.5 months for the ATO-DAC group versus 5.0 months for the DAC group (P = 0.021), and median OS was 14.5 months compared to 11.5 months, respectively (P = 0.034). Although adverse events were more frequent in the ATO-DAC group, the safety profile remained manageable. These findings suggest that the ATO-DAC combination provides superior efficacy compared to DAC monotherapy. DISCUSSION: The combination of DAC and ATO offers a promising and innovative treatment option for elderly high-risk MDS patients, enhancing response rates and survival outcomes while maintaining a manageable safety profile. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the clinical relevance of this regimen, warranting further investigation in prospective trials.",

                    "abstract": "Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a serious complication of chemotherapy that often leads to hospitalization in cancer patients. It is now well-established that carefully selected patients can be safely treated on an outpatient basis. The objective of this study was to assess the number and proportion of patients hospitalized for FN in a university hospital setting who would have met the low-risk criteria for FN, and whether these patients experienced favorable outcomes during hospitalization. We conducted a retrospective study of all patients admitted for FN at three hospitals in Quebec City between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2019. Patients with leukemia and those who had undergone stem cell transplants were excluded. A retrospective chart review was performed to establish the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score for each patient. Based on predefined criteria, we also determined whether the clinical course was favorable or unfavorable. A total of 177 hospitalizations met our inclusion criteria. We found that 101/177 (57.1%) of the hospitalized patients met the low-risk FN criteria according to their MASCC score. Among these, 74/177 (41.8%) met all the criteria for outpatient treatment. The majority of these patients had a favorable outcome (70/74, 94.6%). In contrast, among patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria for outpatient treatment, 44.7% (46/103) experienced favorable outcomes during their hospitalization. These data highlight the importance of patient selection for outpatient care.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years. The outcomes in older or unfit AML patients on intensive chemotherapy are poor, and thus, it is necessary to explore alternative strategies. In recent years, non-intensive therapies have transformed the standard of care for this population. Despite the increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies in this area, the optimal treatment approach remains unclear. METHODS: We sourced four databases, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, until July 07, 2024, to identify all Phase II/III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating low-intensity treatments for older AML patients. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), overall response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) graded >= 3 were analyzed using a Bayesian fixed-effects network meta-analysis (NMA). RESULTS: A total of 4920 patients across 26 trials were included. In terms of improving OS, AZA + VEN, LDAC + glasdegib, and LDAC + VEN (SUCRA = 0.936, 0.898, and 0.718, respectively) were the most effective treatments. For CR, ORR, and CRi, AZA + VEN ranked highest among all therapies (SUCRA = 0.836, 0.911, and 0.829, respectively). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and network meta-analysis suggest that AZA + VEN is superior to the current standard of care, particularly in improving OS, CR, ORR, and CRi. LDAC + glasdegib also demonstrated promising efficacy and warrants further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare and highly malignant hematological tumor that occurs in children. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the primary treatment for the vast majority of children with JMML. However, busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning regimens do not effectively solve the problem of low survival and high recurrence rates after transplantation. We previously achieved good results in the treatment of JMML with complementary transplantation and found that only one of the five patients who relapsed had umbilical cord blood (UCB) engraftment (blood 2019 134:4181). To further investigate the feasibility of UCB transplantation in JMML, we developed a novel regimen and performed a long-term follow-up analysis to evaluate its effectiveness and safety. In this multicenter, single-arm, retrospective clinical study, 17 children with JMML were treated with a novel regimen consisting of haploid immune cell infusion combined with UCB transplantation. After a median follow-up of 48 months, relapse was observed in 1 in 17 patients, with a cumulative relapse incidence rate of 6.7%. The 5-year overall and event-free survival rates were 87.4% and 82.4%, respectively. Among the included patients, seven experienced grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), including two patients with grade III-IV acute GVHD, resulting in cumulative incidence rates of 41.0% and 11.8%, respectively. Additionally, a total of two patients in the cohort developed chronic GVHD, and the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 5 years was 11.8%. Conclusion: Our results suggest that, combined with a suitable regimen, UCB transplantation may be an effective and safe option for the treatment of JMML.",

We utilized Sleeping Beauty transposon to engineer donor-derived anti-CD19.CD28.OX40.CD3zeta T cells differentiated in cytokine-induced killer (CARCIK-CD19) for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). We report the results of CARCIK-CD19 observed in 36 patients (4 children and 32 adults) treated according to the final recommended dose. Cytokine release syndrome of grade 2 or lower occurred in 15 patients, ICANS grade 2 in 1 patient, and late-onset peripheral neurotoxicity of grade 3 in 2 patients. GVHD never occurred after treatment with allogeneic CARCIK-CD19. Complete remission was achieved by 30 out of 36 patients (83.3%), with MRD negativity in 89% of responders. With a median follow-up of 2.2 years, the 1-year overall survival was 57.0%, and event-free survival was 32.0%. The median duration of response at 1 year was 38.6%. CAR-T cells expanded rapidly after infusion and remained detectable for over 2 years. Integration site analysis after infusion showed a high clonal diversity. These data demonstrated that SB-engineered CAR-T cells are safe and induce durable remission in heavily pretreated patients with BCP-ALL relapsed after alloHSCT.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for T-ALL/LBL has shown encouraging results in the early stages of clinical trials. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 12 patients with R/R T-ALL/LBL who received CD7 CAR-T cell therapy. Eleven patients received autologous CAR-T cells, while one patient received allogeneic CAR-T cells. On Day 28 post-infusion, 67% (8/12) of patients achieved an overall response (ORR). At a median follow-up of 134 (14-925) days, the median overall survival (OS) was 134 days, and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 81 days. Among the 8 patients who achieved remission after CD7 CAR-T cell infusion, 5 patients received consolidation allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Compared with 3 patients who did not undergo consolidation allo-HSCT, patients with allo-HSCT as consolidation showed a trend toward better OS (allo-HSCT vs. control: 6-month OS, 60% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.073) and better PFS (allo-HSCT vs. control: 6-month PFS, 60% vs. 0%, p = 0.022). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in all patients (grade 1-2 in 67% of patients, grade 3 in 33% of patients), and one patient experienced neurotoxicity. CD7 CAR-T cell therapy is a promising option for R/R T-ALL/LBL patients with manageable adverse events. Moreover, CD7 CAR-T cell infusion followed by consolidation allo-HSCT in R/R T-ALL/LBL patients might play an important role in prolonging remission duration.",

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for T-ALL/LBL has shown encouraging results in the early stages of clinical trials. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 12 patients with R/R T-ALL/LBL who received CD7 CAR-T cell therapy. Eleven patients received autologous CAR-T cells, while one patient received allogeneic CAR-T cells. On Day 28 post-infusion, 67% (8/12) of patients achieved an overall response (ORR). At a median follow-up of 134 (14-925) days, the median overall survival (OS) was 134 days, and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 81 days. Among the 8 patients who achieved remission after CD7 CAR-T cell infusion, 5 patients received consolidation allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Compared with 3 patients who did not undergo consolidation allo-HSCT, patients with allo-HSCT as consolidation showed a trend toward better OS (allo-HSCT vs. control: 6-month OS, 60% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.073) and better PFS (allo-HSCT vs. control: 6-month PFS, 60% vs. 0%, p = 0.022). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in all patients (grade 1-2 in 67% of patients, grade 3 in 33% of patients), and one patient experienced neurotoxicity. CD7 CAR-T cell therapy is a promising option for R/R T-ALL/LBL patients with manageable adverse events. Moreover, CD7 CAR-T cell infusion followed by consolidation allo-HSCT in R/R T-ALL/LBL patients might play an important role in prolonging remission duration.",

Patients with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are at a higher risk of developing hematologic disorders. Despite advances in treatment, extramedullary relapse remains a challenge, particularly when it manifests as spinal cord compression leading to paraplegia, a rare but severe complication. METHODS: We describe the clinical course of an 11-year-old male with Trisomy 21, diagnosed with B-ALL. The patient was treated with standard chemotherapy (VDLP regimen) followed by central nervous system prophylaxis through lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy. Despite achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, the patient developed progressive lower back pain and acute paraplegia. Imaging studies and subsequent spinal surgery were performed to diagnose and manage the spinal cord lesion. RESULTS: The patient's spinal pathology confirmed a relapse of B-ALL with extramedullary involvement. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed markers consistent with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Chemotherapy-induced remission was initially achieved, but the patient experienced bone marrow suppression after each cycle, leading to further hospitalization and supportive treatments. Postsurgical findings showed no CNS involve-ment, and bone marrow MRD remained negative. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the complexity of managing B-ALL in children with Trisomy 21, who may be prone to extramedullary relapse despite systemic remission. Early recognition of spinal symptoms and prompt surgical intervention are critical in preventing irreversible neurological damage such as paraplegia. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in high-risk populations.",

While advances in chemotherapy and targeted and immunotherapies have improved overall survival, relapsed or refractory (r/r) adult ALL is associated with poor outcomes. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative option, achieving high remission rates even in heavily pretreated patients. However, relapse is common. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), a traditional cornerstone of remission consolidation, may improve long-term outcomes but carries risks of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and morbidity. Most evidence for HCT after CAR T therapy comes from retrospective analyses of subgroups from CAR T cell trials, with small sample sizes and inconsistent data on transplant procedures and outcomes. Despite these limitations, consolidative allo-HCT appears to prolong relapse-free survival (RFS). While overall survival (OS) benefits are in question, extended remission duration has been observed. Nonrelapse mortality (including TRM), ranging from 2.4 to 35%, underscores the need for careful patient selection. Emerging real-world data affirm these findings but highlight the importance of individualized decisions based on disease and treatment history. This review examines current evidence on the sequential use of CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy and allo-HCT in adults with r/r B-ALL.",

                    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by altered maturation and differentiation of myeloid blasts, as well as transcriptional/epigenetic alterations and impaired apoptosis, all of which lead to excessive proliferation of malignant blood cells in the bone marrow. It is these mutations that cause tumor heterogeneity, which is linked to a higher risk of relapse and death and makes anti-AML treatments like HSCT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (ICI, CAR T-cell-based therapies, and cancer vaccines) less effective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) also makes it possible to find cellular subclones and profile tumors, which opens up new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for better AML management. The HSCT process works better when genetic and transcriptional information about the patient and donor stem cells is collected. This saves time and lowers the risk of harmful side effects happening in the body.",

However, since the approval of both compounds, more and more Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKis) and B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors (BCL2is) have been discovered. Their efficacy and safety are the reasons for their use in monotherapy among both treatment-naive and relapsed patients with CLL. Currently, several ongoing clinical trials are investigating the rationale for the combination of BCL2is and BTKis. In this review, we discuss the recent advancements in the field of co-therapy with BTKis and BCL2is.",

The patients were divided into a combination group (n = 53, treated with a combination of venetoclax and azacitidine) and an azacitidine group (n = 51, treated with azacitidine) according to the treatment protocol. Hematological parameters (proportion of bone marrow progenitor cells [PBMPC], white blood cell count [WBC], platelet count [PLT], neutrophil count [NEUT], and hemoglobin [Hb]), serum immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgA, and IgM) and inflammatory factor (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) levels, as well as European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores were compared between the two groups, and adverse reactions were recorded.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed on patients with newly diagnosed ALAL who were hospitalized at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital from June 2021 to July 2024. Of the 13 patients who received initial induction therapy with venetoclax combined with multidrug chemotherapy, 8 received VAA+P regimen, and 5 received V+IA regimen. Patients with FLT3 mutation were treated with FLT3 inhibitor, and Ph(+) patients received an additional tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events were analyzed. Results: According to the World Health Organization 5th edition of the classification of hematolymphoid tumors, the immunophenotypes were T/myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) (n=4), B/myeloid MPAL (n=7), and ALAL- not otherwise specified (n=2). Of the seven patients with B/myeloid MPAL, four were Ph(+) and belonged to the group with specific gene abnormalities of ALAL. Three patients had FLT3 mutation (one with FLT3-TKD mutation and two with FLT3-ITD mutation). Prior to the second course of consolidation therapy, the efficacy of venetoclax induction therapy was evaluated, and a complete response rate of 100% was achieved in 13 patients. In the subsequent consolidation therapy phase, one patient discontinued treatment and was lost to follow-up; nine patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, four of whom died due to posttransplant complications and five achieved DFS. Of the three patients (>=70 years old) who received consolidation therapy as before, two achieved DFS and one died due to central nervous system leukemia. The median OS time was not reached in 13 patients; the 75th percentile survival time was 12.0 months, with a 12-month cumulative survival rate of 64.5%. The median DFS time was not reached in all patients; the 75th percentile DFS time was 8.2 months, with a 12-month cumulative DFS rate of 67.1%. All patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, during and after induction therapy. All patients recovered hematopoietic function after the initial induction therapy, with no fatal hemorrhage, tumor lysis syndrome, neurological adverse events, or grade 3 or higher organ toxicity, excluding preexisting conditions. Conclusion: Venetoclax in combination with multidrug chemotherapy was effective and associated with tolerable adverse reactions in patients with newly diagnosed ALAL.",

Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed on patients with newly diagnosed ALAL who were hospitalized at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital from June 2021 to July 2024. Of the 13 patients who received initial induction therapy with venetoclax combined with multidrug chemotherapy, 8 received VAA+P regimen, and 5 received V+IA regimen. Patients with FLT3 mutation were treated with FLT3 inhibitor, and Ph(+) patients received an additional tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events were analyzed. Results: According to the World Health Organization 5th edition of the classification of hematolymphoid tumors, the immunophenotypes were T/myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) (n=4), B/myeloid MPAL (n=7), and ALAL- not otherwise specified (n=2). Of the seven patients with B/myeloid MPAL, four were Ph(+) and belonged to the group with specific gene abnormalities of ALAL. Three patients had FLT3 mutation (one with FLT3-TKD mutation and two with FLT3-ITD mutation). Prior to the second course of consolidation therapy, the efficacy of venetoclax induction therapy was evaluated, and a complete response rate of 100% was achieved in 13 patients. In the subsequent consolidation therapy phase, one patient discontinued treatment and was lost to follow-up; nine patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, four of whom died due to posttransplant complications and five achieved DFS. Of the three patients (>=70 years old) who received consolidation therapy as before, two achieved DFS and one died due to central nervous system leukemia. The median OS time was not reached in 13 patients; the 75th percentile survival time was 12.0 months, with a 12-month cumulative survival rate of 64.5%. The median DFS time was not reached in all patients; the 75th percentile DFS time was 8.2 months, with a 12-month cumulative DFS rate of 67.1%. All patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, during and after induction therapy. All patients recovered hematopoietic function after the initial induction therapy, with no fatal hemorrhage, tumor lysis syndrome, neurological adverse events, or grade 3 or higher organ toxicity, excluding preexisting conditions. Conclusion: Venetoclax in combination with multidrug chemotherapy was effective and associated with tolerable adverse reactions in patients with newly diagnosed ALAL.",

For 20 years, hypomethylating agents (HMAs), as single agents and recently as a backbone with venetoclax, have been used in this setting. The oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine (C-DEC), which is therapeutically and pharmacologically equivalent to the intravenous (IV) formulation (IV-DEC), has expanded the therapeutic arsenal for AML, allowing for better convenience of administration. This review provides an overview of C-DEC, current clinical applications, and ongoing clinical studies, highlighting its potential role in managing AML in older patients. AREAS COVERED: For the aim of this review, the authors searched the current English literature on C-DEC in AML patients through PubMed, using several pertinent keywords. To summarize the most recent developments as up-to-date as possible, we considered, with a few exceptions, only papers published over the last three years until March 2025. EXPERT OPINION: Compared to IV-DEC, C-DEC provides similar therapeutic exposure and efficacy with an optional safety profile, enhanced treatment adherence, reduced treatment burden, and required healthcare facilities compared to those associated with IV-DEC, providing a precious tool to manage older and unfit AML patients.",

These drugs were first-in-class medicines that revolutionized CLL management, extending patients' overall survival even in cases refractory to immunochemotherapy. However, since the approval of both compounds, more and more Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKis) and B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors (BCL2is) have been discovered. Their efficacy and safety are the reasons for their use in monotherapy among both treatment-naive and relapsed patients with CLL. Currently, several ongoing clinical trials are investigating the rationale for the combination of BCL2is and BTKis. In this review, we discuss the recent advancements in the field of co-therapy with BTKis and BCL2is.",

                    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Non-autoimmune hypothyroidism is a rare but significant cause of rhabdomyolysis and myocarditis, which can mimic acute coronary syndrome. Early recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism are crucial, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where delayed diagnosis may lead to life-threatening complications such as acute kidney injury. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old male with diabetes, CKD stage G3aA3, and a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia presented with myalgia, anorexia, and anuria. He also reported intermittent chest pain for 1 month, progressing to severe symptoms including decreased urine output and anuria. DIAGNOSES: Laboratory findings revealed acute kidney injury (serum creatinine: 12.14 mg/dL), extreme elevations in muscle enzymes (creatine kinase: 250,000 IU/L), and cardiac biomarkers (troponin-T: 543 ng/L). Initial management did not improve his condition. On day 15, thyroid function tests confirmed non-autoimmune hypothyroidism (TSH: 55.58 muIU/mL, free T4: 0.06 ng/dL). INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent hemodialysis and conservative treatment initially, followed by levothyroxine replacement therapy on day 16. OUTCOMES: Renal function, urine output, and muscle enzyme levels gradually improved after thyroid hormone supplementation. By discharge on day 40, the patient's serum creatinine decreased to 3.08 mg/dL, and hemodialysis was discontinued. At 7 months posttreatment, his renal function stabilized at CKD stage G3bA2 with normal thyroid function. LESSONS: This case highlights the importance of considering hypothyroidism in patients with unexplained rhabdomyolysis and persistent cardiac symptoms, particularly in those with CKD. Early thyroid function testing can lead to timely treatment and improved outcomes in such complex cases.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Within the French-Australian CLL6 RESIDUUM trial, an ancillary study aimed at assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving a two-year consolidation of lenalidomide (LEN) or observation (OBS) after classical immunochemotherapy leaving them with detectable residual disease. METHODS: Data from French patients involved in this the trial were used here. The EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire was completed by patients at baseline, and then at months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 after consolidation. Repeated measures mixed-effects models were used to assess HRQoL changes between baseline and each checkpoint for each HRQoL scale. RESULTS: Baseline data showed overall a good global health status with mean scores of 76.3 and 72.1 in the LEN and OBS arms respectively, on the 0-100 scale. At 12 months, LEN patients had significantly more diarrhea than OBS patients (p = 0.003) and social functioning was significantly impaired at month 18 (p = 0.05). A 10-point difference appeared in the LEN arm for dyspnea and digestive disorders from month 12 on. Multivariate analysis showed a deleterious effect of LEN on global health (p = 0.02) and functional scales (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study provides HRQoL values in a French cohort of CLL patients in consolidation treatment. Supplementation with lenalidomide as consolidation therapy in CLL leads to late health deterioration, especially diarrhea, after 12 months of treatment. Quantitative assessment of HRQoL should be balanced against benefits in disease control to determine overall health benefits.",

A prospective phase II study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) combined with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in newly diagnosed older and unfit AML patients.MethodsTwenty-two patients were enrolled and deemed evaluable. The study included one cycle of induction and four cycles of consolidation, followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsThe median age of enrolled patients was 71.5 years (range, 63 to 82 years), and 16 patients (72.7%) were over 70 years of age. The overall response rate (ORR) was 77.3% (n = 17) and the complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi) rate was 63.6% (n = 14) after the first induction cycle. With a median follow-up of 12.4 months, eight patients (57.1%) relapsed, with a median time to relapse of 12.3 months. The median duration of response (DOR) was 11.9 months (95% CI, 6.4 to NA months), the median overall survival (OS) was 15 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 21.6 months), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 15.1 months). Common grade 3 or greater adverse events included febrile neutropenia (77.8%) and infection (63.6%), with pneumonia being the most common (10, 45.5%). There was one death (4.5%) within 30 days.ConclusionThe combination of PLD, LDAC, and G-CSF is well-tolerated and exhibits high rates of CR/CRi and low early mortality, providing an attractive treatment option for newly diagnosed elderly and unfit AML patients.",

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. METHODS: We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

Early phase clinical trials have shown a very high initial response rate confirmed by follow up and real-world studies. However, almost half of patients relapse with the available commercial product currently suggesting the need of a consolidative treatment after CAR T-cell infusion in well-defined cases, according to several pre- and post-CAR clinical and biological factors. This finding highlights that numerous challenges exist before the extension of CAR T-cell indications (first relapse and high-risk first line) in the field of B-ALL: to enhance persistence of CAR T-cells to avoid CD19-positive relapse and to avoid CD19-negative relapse by reducing tumor burden pre-CAR-T infusion and/or by multitargeting. Promising approaches with exciting early clinical data are emerging in the field of T-cell ALL. The use of CAR T-cells for acute myeloid leukemias remains challenging due to the lack of leukemia-specific antigens and to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

However, to date, no case-control studies or prospective trials in relapsed/refractory T-ALL have been conducted to compare venetoclax-based therapies with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies, owing to the disease's rarity and the challenging treatment landscape.

Our results indicated that venetoclax-based chemotherapy achieved comparable outcomes with heavily cytotoxic agents in complete remission rates (58.3% vs. 41.7%, P = 0.759), renal dysfunction (0% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.478), infections (50.0% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.400), and thrombocytopenia duration (17.0 vs. 14.5 days, P = 0.434) between the venetoclax and non-venetoclax cohorts. Additionally, venetoclax-treated patients experienced fewer non-hematological adverse events, such as elevated liver enzymes than conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies (0% vs. 41.6%, P = 0.014), which may be attributed to reduced use of intensive cytotoxic agents like pegylated asparaginase in the venetoclax cohort. Venetoclax-based low-intensity chemotherapy might have a relatively favorable safety profile and non-inferior efficacy compared to conventional cytotoxic regimens. Therefore, venetoclax-based low-intensity chemotherapy might become a potential treatment option, especially for frail patients or those with poor hepatic function who were unable to tolerate multiple cytotoxic therapies.",

This study investigates the efficacy and safety of combining decitabine (DAC) with arsenic trioxide (ATO) as a novel therapeutic approach. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 elderly high-risk MDS patients, with 52 receiving ATO-DAC (ATO-DAC group) and 68 receiving DAC monotherapy (DAC group). Treatment outcomes were assessed through overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Adverse events were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The ATO-DAC group demonstrated a significantly higher ORR of 78.85% compared to 52.94% in the DAC group (P = 0.026). Median PFS was 7.5 months for the ATO-DAC group versus 5.0 months for the DAC group (P = 0.021), and median OS was 14.5 months compared to 11.5 months, respectively (P = 0.034). Although adverse events were more frequent in the ATO-DAC group, the safety profile remained manageable. These findings suggest that the ATO-DAC combination provides superior efficacy compared to DAC monotherapy. DISCUSSION: The combination of DAC and ATO offers a promising and innovative treatment option for elderly high-risk MDS patients, enhancing response rates and survival outcomes while maintaining a manageable safety profile. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the clinical relevance of this regimen, warranting further investigation in prospective trials.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

                    "abstract": "The prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia has significantly improved with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, indefinite TKI treatment can lead to adverse effects and high costs. Recent studies have suggested that treatment-free remission (TFR) is achievable in patients with a deep molecular response (DMR). The present multicenter, retrospective observational study conducted in Japan evaluated the applicability of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2020 TKI discontinuation criteria, which recommend TKI therapy of >= 5 years with sustained MR4 for >= 3 years or MR4.5 for >= 2 years. A total of 100 patients who discontinued TKI therapy were analyzed, with 70 meeting the ELN2020 criteria. The overall 12-month TFR rate was 71.9 %. Univariate analysis showed that both the duration of DMR and TKI therapy were significantly associated with TFR, with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.305 and 0.450, respectively. Only DMR duration remained significant (HR 0.362) in multivariate analysis. Patients who lost MMR after TKI discontinuation rapidly re-achieved molecular response upon TKI resumption. The most common reason for TKI discontinuation was elective cessation, followed by adverse events, among which pleural effusion due to dasatinib was the most frequent. The results of this study, the first to assess the ELN2020 criteria in a Japanese cohort, suggest that the criteria are applicable in real-world clinical practice.",

His disease was refractory to treatment, but went into remission after a third regimen, venetoclax plus azacitidine (Ven+Aza). However, the disease relapsed during treatment for an infection, and he underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant while not in remission. He did not achieve remission after transplantation, but treatment with azacitidine and early discontinuation of immunosuppressants led to remission. However, relapse occurred on day250 in the form of pericardial effusion. After drainage, Ven+Aza therapy was started again, and the pericardial effusion disappeared rapidly. The patient has been continuing the same treatment, and has remained in remission for more than 15 months. Isolated extramedullary relapse caused by pericardial effusion is rare, and this case illustrates that Ven+Aza therapy may be effective.",

                    "abstract": "Venetoclax (VEN)--based induction therapy has demonstrated considerable promise in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the optimal VEN-based combination therapy remains to be established. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the venetoclax-homoharringtonine-cytarabine (VHA) regimen in patients with newly diagnosed (ND) AML. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 55 patients treated with the VHA regimen. The overall response rate (ORR) was 92.7% (51/55, 95% CI 82%-98%), and the composite complete remission (CRc) rate was 87.3% (48/55, 95% CI 76%-95%). Among the 48 patients who achieved CRc, 91.7% (44/48, 95% CI 67%-90%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 85.4% (41/48, 95% CI 72%-94%) reached measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative CR. In the adverse-risk group, ORR and CRc were 95% (19/20, 95% CI 75%-100%) and 75% (15/20, 95% CI 51%-91%), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (32.7%), pneumonia (16.3%), and sepsis (9.1%). Median overall survival (OS) was 26 months, while event-free survival (EFS) was not reached. One-year OS was 83%, and one-year EFS was 82%. These preliminary data suggest that the VHA regimen achieves a very high rate of CR and low toxicity, particularly for adverse-risk AML patients.",

Integrative therapies like mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness meditation (MM), and music therapy (MT) yield promising results in enhancing both psychosocial outcomes (eg, reducing anxiety and depression) and physiological adaptation (eg, decreasing inflammation) in cancer patients. Objective: We developed and refined, using focus groups and environmental and field testing, an eHealth-delivered mindfulness-based music therapy (eMBMT) intervention aimed at improving health-related quality of life, symptom burden (ie, pain, fatigue, and sleep), disease activity (ie, chronic graft-versus-host disease, cytomegalovirus activation, and infections) and psychosocial (ie, depression, anxiety, and cancer-specific distress) and physiological adaptation (ie, inflammation and immune reconstitution) tailored to adults receiving allo-SCT. Methods: eMBMT intervention content is grounded in MT, MM, and MBSR, developed by a multidisciplinary team, and adapted for adults undergoing allo-SCT. eMBMT content was refined through focus groups and usability and field testing. Focus groups used a semistructured interview guide, while field testing used the \"think aloud\" method. Usability was evaluated using the 30-item Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use (USE) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics analyzed the USE questionnaire and participant characteristics, while rapid qualitative analysis was applied to focus groups and field-testing sessions. Survivors eligible to participate in the focus groups and usability and field testing were adults (>18 years old) who received an allo-SCT (<36 months) for myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia, and were in remission for greater than 3 months. Results: During the focus groups, participants (n=11; mean age 43.6, SD 17.8 years) provided qualitative feedback highlighting the shock of diagnosis, challenges during hospitalization, and coping strategies posttreatment. The eMBMT platform received positive evaluations for usefulness (mean 6.47, SD 0.29), ease of use (mean 6.92, SD 0.60), and satisfaction (mean 6.16, SD 0.82). Key themes from field testing highlighted the significance of social support, hope, and maintaining an active lifestyle. Suggestions for improvement included incorporating more representative content, reducing text, enhancing guidance, offering diverse music options, and streamlining blood sample collection. Conclusions: The eMBMT intervention is a comprehensive, user-friendly eHealth tool tailored to the unique needs of allo-SCT patients. The positive feedback and identified areas for improvement underscore its potential to enhance well-being, symptom management, and overall quality of life for cancer survivors. A future pilot randomized controlled trial will further evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the eMBMT intervention in improving health-related quality of life, symptom burden, disease activity, and psychosocial and physiological adaptation.",

Integrative therapies like mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness meditation (MM), and music therapy (MT) yield promising results in enhancing both psychosocial outcomes (eg, reducing anxiety and depression) and physiological adaptation (eg, decreasing inflammation) in cancer patients. Objective: We developed and refined, using focus groups and environmental and field testing, an eHealth-delivered mindfulness-based music therapy (eMBMT) intervention aimed at improving health-related quality of life, symptom burden (ie, pain, fatigue, and sleep), disease activity (ie, chronic graft-versus-host disease, cytomegalovirus activation, and infections) and psychosocial (ie, depression, anxiety, and cancer-specific distress) and physiological adaptation (ie, inflammation and immune reconstitution) tailored to adults receiving allo-SCT. Methods: eMBMT intervention content is grounded in MT, MM, and MBSR, developed by a multidisciplinary team, and adapted for adults undergoing allo-SCT. eMBMT content was refined through focus groups and usability and field testing. Focus groups used a semistructured interview guide, while field testing used the \"think aloud\" method. Usability was evaluated using the 30-item Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use (USE) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics analyzed the USE questionnaire and participant characteristics, while rapid qualitative analysis was applied to focus groups and field-testing sessions.

However, the influence of obesity and related comorbidities on treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles remains unclear. This retrospective study included 115 patients treated with CAR-T therapy at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2017 to October 2023. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities. Clinical outcomes, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) severity, treatment efficacy, Overall Survival (OS), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), were analyzed. Logistic regression models assessed the relationships between covariates and clinical outcomes. The median BMI was 21.91 (IQR 19.265-24.365). Among the patients, 32 were overweight, and only one had a BMI over 30. Severe CRS occurred in 16 patients, with a higher proportion in those with obesity or related conditions (10.4% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.01). Hyperlipidemia significantly increased the risk of severe CRS (OR = 3.730, CI [1.204-11.556], p = 0.022). However, being overweight, having diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or fatty liver were not significantly associated with severe CRS. Elevated total cholesterol was moderately correlated with increased Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (R = 0.637, p < 0.001) and weakly with Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) (R = 0.337, p < 0.001). Besides, overweight patients had a lower proportion of CAR-T cells post-infusion (OR = 0.98, CI [0.961-1.0], p = 0.048). Obesity and related comorbidities did not significantly impact treatment efficacy. However, hyperlipidemia was associated with an increased risk of severe CRS, emphasizing the need for tailored risk management strategies in CAR-T therapy.

Early phase clinical trials have shown a very high initial response rate confirmed by follow up and real-world studies. However, almost half of patients relapse with the available commercial product currently suggesting the need of a consolidative treatment after CAR T-cell infusion in well-defined cases, according to several pre- and post-CAR clinical and biological factors. This finding highlights that numerous challenges exist before the extension of CAR T-cell indications (first relapse and high-risk first line) in the field of B-ALL: to enhance persistence of CAR T-cells to avoid CD19-positive relapse and to avoid CD19-negative relapse by reducing tumor burden pre-CAR-T infusion and/or by multitargeting. Promising approaches with exciting early clinical data are emerging in the field of T-cell ALL. The use of CAR T-cells for acute myeloid leukemias remains challenging due to the lack of leukemia-specific antigens and to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

Sixty-seven adults with MDS were enrolled (part 1, 40 with low/intermediate-1 or intermediate-2/high IPSS risk status; part 2, 27 with intermediate-2/high IPSS risk status). Primary safety endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints included evaluation of clinical outcomes, survival, and pharmacokinetics. Dose-limiting toxicities were experienced by no patients in part 1 and 3 patients (11%) in part 2. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea and fatigue (40% each) in part 1 and fatigue (44%) and anemia (37%) in part 2. In parts 1 and 2, 15% of patients experienced marrow complete response as their best overall response, according to IWG criteria.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To elucidate emerging trends and predictors for optimizing treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHOD: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Bias assessment was conducted using Cochrane's risk of bias tool, while statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. RESULTS: We included 44 studies and the pooled results showed that high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) in induction therapy significantly improved the complete remission (CR) rate than standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) in younger adults but not older adults (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12-1.49, P=0.0004 and OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.29, P=0.87, respectively). In consolidation therapy, HDAC showed a significant benefit in event-free survival (EFS) over SDAC (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04-1.62, P=0.02). The pooled analysis also revealed that idarubicin (IDR) was associated with improved CR rates than daunorubicin (DNR) (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-1.76, P=0.04). However, the results do not substantiate the claim that IDR is better than mitoxantrone (MTZ) or that DNR is superior to MTZ in inducing CR (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.72-1.08, P=0.22 and OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72-1.01, P=0.06, respectively). The evidence has also shown that the pooled composite complete response (CRc) rates for FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib, gilteritinib, and quizartinib were 56%, 31%, and 36%, respectively. The pooled results further showed that the overall CRc for patients receiving IDH inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors were 49.6% (95% CI: 37-63) and 26% (95% CI: 18.7-35), respectively. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are valuable treatment options for AML patients. However, the efficacy of these AML treatments may vary depending on AML status and patient characteristics such as age and cytogenetic risk.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Within the French-Australian CLL6 RESIDUUM trial, an ancillary study aimed at assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving a two-year consolidation of lenalidomide (LEN) or observation (OBS) after classical immunochemotherapy leaving them with detectable residual disease. METHODS: Data from French patients involved in this the trial were used here. The EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire was completed by patients at baseline, and then at months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 after consolidation. Repeated measures mixed-effects models were used to assess HRQoL changes between baseline and each checkpoint for each HRQoL scale. RESULTS: Baseline data showed overall a good global health status with mean scores of 76.3 and 72.1 in the LEN and OBS arms respectively, on the 0-100 scale. At 12 months, LEN patients had significantly more diarrhea than OBS patients (p = 0.003) and social functioning was significantly impaired at month 18 (p = 0.05). A 10-point difference appeared in the LEN arm for dyspnea and digestive disorders from month 12 on. Multivariate analysis showed a deleterious effect of LEN on global health (p = 0.02) and functional scales (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study provides HRQoL values in a French cohort of CLL patients in consolidation treatment. Supplementation with lenalidomide as consolidation therapy in CLL leads to late health deterioration, especially diarrhea, after 12 months of treatment. Quantitative assessment of HRQoL should be balanced against benefits in disease control to determine overall health benefits.",

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these vulnerabilities in HM patients, although comprehensive data specifically on HSCT recipients are limited. Objective This study investigated the clinical and demographic profiles of HSCT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain. We also identified factors associated with in-hospital mortality in HSCT patients. Methods We conducted a nationwide, retrospective analysis using data from the Spanish National Health System. We included hospitalized patients with HMs and COVID-19 infection from 2020 to 2022. We used descriptive statistics, multivariate logistic regression, and survival analyses to assess predictors of mortality. Results In total, 35,648 patients with HMs were included, of whom 2,324 (6.5%) had undergone HSCT. The in-hospital mortality rate for HSCT recipients was 13%, lower than the 20% observed in non-HSCT patients. Older age, dementia, acute leukemia, and solid tumors were independently associated with increased mortality. In spite of their immunosuppressed state, HSCT recipients experienced relatively favorable outcomes, suggesting partial immune recovery following transplantation. Conclusions HSCT recipients with COVID-19 present different clinical characteristics and mortality risks than non-recipients. These findings indicate the need for specific management strategies for this vulnerable population. Further research is needed to explore immunological recovery and the transplant-specific factors that may influence COVID-19 outcomes.",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a potential cure but is hindered by various limitations. Emerging immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy and blinatumomab, have shown potential as bridging strategies to HSCT in relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Tongji Hospital from March 2017 to March 2023 and involved 36 R/R B-ALL patients who underwent HSCT. Prior to transplantation, 27 patients received CD19/CD22 CAR-T therapy, while 9 received blinatumomab. The outcomes assessed included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), graft-versus-host disease-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM), with comparisons between treatment groups. Hematopoietic reconstitution and transplant-related complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 28.07 months (range: 2.29-92.21 months). The 2-year OS, PFS, GRFS, and NRM rates of the entire cohort were 76.54%, 54.97%, 40.12%, and 9.93%, respectively. In the CAR-T and blinatumomab treatment groups before transplantation, the 2-year OS rates were 73.89% and 88.89% (P = 0.862), the PFS rates were 59.03% and 44.44% (P = 0.501), the GRFS rates were 47.86% and 13.89% (P = 0.083), and the NRM rates were 8.52% and 11.11% (P = 0.713), respectively. The safety profiles were similar, with no significant differences observed in hematopoietic reconstitution, infection, incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or chronic GVHD incidence between the CAR-T and blinatumomab groups. CONCLUSION: CAR-T and blinatumomab therapies demonstrate comparable safety and efficacy as bridging treatments to HSCT in patients with R/R B-ALL. Further studies are needed to optimize these treatment strategies.",

However, the influence of obesity and related comorbidities on treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles remains unclear. This retrospective study included 115 patients treated with CAR-T therapy at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2017 to October 2023. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities. Clinical outcomes, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) severity, treatment efficacy, Overall Survival (OS), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), were analyzed. Logistic regression models assessed the relationships between covariates and clinical outcomes. The median BMI was 21.91 (IQR 19.265-24.365). Among the patients, 32 were overweight, and only one had a BMI over 30. Severe CRS occurred in 16 patients, with a higher proportion in those with obesity or related conditions (10.4% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.01). Hyperlipidemia significantly increased the risk of severe CRS (OR = 3.730, CI [1.204-11.556], p = 0.022). However, being overweight, having diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or fatty liver were not significantly associated with severe CRS. Elevated total cholesterol was moderately correlated with increased Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (R = 0.637, p < 0.001) and weakly with Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) (R = 0.337, p < 0.001). Besides, overweight patients had a lower proportion of CAR-T cells post-infusion (OR = 0.98, CI [0.961-1.0], p = 0.048). Obesity and related comorbidities did not significantly impact treatment efficacy. However, hyperlipidemia was associated with an increased risk of severe CRS, emphasizing the need for tailored risk management strategies in CAR-T therapy.

Patients with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are at a higher risk of developing hematologic disorders. Despite advances in treatment, extramedullary relapse remains a challenge, particularly when it manifests as spinal cord compression leading to paraplegia, a rare but severe complication. METHODS: We describe the clinical course of an 11-year-old male with Trisomy 21, diagnosed with B-ALL. The patient was treated with standard chemotherapy (VDLP regimen) followed by central nervous system prophylaxis through lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy. Despite achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, the patient developed progressive lower back pain and acute paraplegia. Imaging studies and subsequent spinal surgery were performed to diagnose and manage the spinal cord lesion. RESULTS: The patient's spinal pathology confirmed a relapse of B-ALL with extramedullary involvement. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed markers consistent with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Chemotherapy-induced remission was initially achieved, but the patient experienced bone marrow suppression after each cycle, leading to further hospitalization and supportive treatments. Postsurgical findings showed no CNS involve-ment, and bone marrow MRD remained negative. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the complexity of managing B-ALL in children with Trisomy 21, who may be prone to extramedullary relapse despite systemic remission. Early recognition of spinal symptoms and prompt surgical intervention are critical in preventing irreversible neurological damage such as paraplegia. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in high-risk populations.",

METHOD: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Bias assessment was conducted using Cochrane's risk of bias tool, while statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. RESULTS: We included 44 studies and the pooled results showed that high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) in induction therapy significantly improved the complete remission (CR) rate than standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) in younger adults but not older adults (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12-1.49, P=0.0004 and OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.29, P=0.87, respectively). In consolidation therapy, HDAC showed a significant benefit in event-free survival (EFS) over SDAC (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04-1.62, P=0.02). The pooled analysis also revealed that idarubicin (IDR) was associated with improved CR rates than daunorubicin (DNR) (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-1.76, P=0.04). However, the results do not substantiate the claim that IDR is better than mitoxantrone (MTZ) or that DNR is superior to MTZ in inducing CR (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.72-1.08, P=0.22 and OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72-1.01, P=0.06, respectively). The evidence has also shown that the pooled composite complete response (CRc) rates for FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib, gilteritinib, and quizartinib were 56%, 31%, and 36%, respectively. The pooled results further showed that the overall CRc for patients receiving IDH inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors were 49.6% (95% CI: 37-63) and 26% (95% CI: 18.7-35), respectively. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are valuable treatment options for AML patients. However, the efficacy of these AML treatments may vary depending on AML status and patient characteristics such as age and cytogenetic risk.",

                    "abstract": "Old individuals are at a high risk of developing aplastic anemia, and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) based on anti-human T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA) is recommended for treating severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Adding the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) to IST could improve hematologic responses in patients with SAA; however, limited data exist for elder patients. Here, we report on the efficacy and prognostic factors associated with porcine ATG and CsA with or without TPO-RA as first-line therapy in elderly patients with SAA. Porcine ATG was administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d for 5 days. CsA was administered orally, maintaining plasma trough concentrations of 150-250 microg/L. Eltrombopag was administered at a dose of 75-150 mg/day, and hetrombopag was administered orally at a dose of 15 mg/day. One hundred and twenty-eight SAA patients, with a median age of 63 (60-73) years old, were included in this study, including 44 very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) patients. All patients completed the porcine ATG treatment, and mild serum sicknesses were observed. Ten patients (2 SAA patients and 8 VSAA patients) died within 3 months of ATG initiation (early death), with severe infections being the main cause of death. Sixty-nine patients achieved a hematologic response at 6 months, with an overall response (OR) rate of 53.9%. The complete hematologic response (CR) rate at 6 months was 18.0%. The addition of TPO-RA to IST did not improve the OR and CR rates; nonetheless, early death was significantly lower (0%) in patients receiving TPO-RA compared to those not receiving TPO-RA (12%). Patients were followed up for a median of 28 (0.1-117) months. The OR rate at the last follow-up was 62.5%, while the CR rate was 36.7%. One patient progressed to myelodysplastic syndrome, one to leukemia, one to hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and five developed clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The 2-year overall survival rate and failure-free survival rate were 86.0% (95% CI: 78.1-91.3%) and 70.5% (95% CI: 61.3-77.9%), respectively. A baseline neutrophil count of < 0.05 x 109/L was identified as an independent prognostic factor for early death. Age younger than 65 years, a baseline reticulocyte count of >= 7 x 109/L, and the absence of fever before and within 3 months following ATG treatment were independent predictors for hematologic response at 6 months. In conclusion, treatment with porcine ATG and CsA was safe and effective in elderly patients with SAA. An extremely low baseline neutrophil count indicated a high risk of early death.",

                    "abstract": "The treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in adults remains a significant therapeutic challenge. While advances in chemotherapy and targeted and immunotherapies have improved overall survival, relapsed or refractory (r/r) adult ALL is associated with poor outcomes. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative option, achieving high remission rates even in heavily pretreated patients. However, relapse is common. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), a traditional cornerstone of remission consolidation, may improve long-term outcomes but carries risks of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and morbidity. Most evidence for HCT after CAR T therapy comes from retrospective analyses of subgroups from CAR T cell trials, with small sample sizes and inconsistent data on transplant procedures and outcomes. Despite these limitations, consolidative allo-HCT appears to prolong relapse-free survival (RFS). While overall survival (OS) benefits are in question, extended remission duration has been observed. Nonrelapse mortality (including TRM), ranging from 2.4 to 35%, underscores the need for careful patient selection. Emerging real-world data affirm these findings but highlight the importance of individualized decisions based on disease and treatment history. This review examines current evidence on the sequential use of CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy and allo-HCT in adults with r/r B-ALL.",

                    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by altered maturation and differentiation of myeloid blasts, as well as transcriptional/epigenetic alterations and impaired apoptosis, all of which lead to excessive proliferation of malignant blood cells in the bone marrow. It is these mutations that cause tumor heterogeneity, which is linked to a higher risk of relapse and death and makes anti-AML treatments like HSCT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (ICI, CAR T-cell-based therapies, and cancer vaccines) less effective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) also makes it possible to find cellular subclones and profile tumors, which opens up new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for better AML management. The HSCT process works better when genetic and transcriptional information about the patient and donor stem cells is collected. This saves time and lowers the risk of harmful side effects happening in the body.",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a potential cure but is hindered by various limitations. Emerging immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy and blinatumomab, have shown potential as bridging strategies to HSCT in relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Tongji Hospital from March 2017 to March 2023 and involved 36 R/R B-ALL patients who underwent HSCT. Prior to transplantation, 27 patients received CD19/CD22 CAR-T therapy, while 9 received blinatumomab. The outcomes assessed included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), graft-versus-host disease-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM), with comparisons between treatment groups. Hematopoietic reconstitution and transplant-related complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 28.07 months (range: 2.29-92.21 months). The 2-year OS, PFS, GRFS, and NRM rates of the entire cohort were 76.54%, 54.97%, 40.12%, and 9.93%, respectively. In the CAR-T and blinatumomab treatment groups before transplantation, the 2-year OS rates were 73.89% and 88.89% (P = 0.862), the PFS rates were 59.03% and 44.44% (P = 0.501), the GRFS rates were 47.86% and 13.89% (P = 0.083), and the NRM rates were 8.52% and 11.11% (P = 0.713), respectively. The safety profiles were similar, with no significant differences observed in hematopoietic reconstitution, infection, incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or chronic GVHD incidence between the CAR-T and blinatumomab groups. CONCLUSION: CAR-T and blinatumomab therapies demonstrate comparable safety and efficacy as bridging treatments to HSCT in patients with R/R B-ALL.

A prospective phase II study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) combined with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in newly diagnosed older and unfit AML patients.MethodsTwenty-two patients were enrolled and deemed evaluable. The study included one cycle of induction and four cycles of consolidation, followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsThe median age of enrolled patients was 71.5 years (range, 63 to 82 years), and 16 patients (72.7%) were over 70 years of age. The overall response rate (ORR) was 77.3% (n = 17) and the complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi) rate was 63.6% (n = 14) after the first induction cycle. With a median follow-up of 12.4 months, eight patients (57.1%) relapsed, with a median time to relapse of 12.3 months. The median duration of response (DOR) was 11.9 months (95% CI, 6.4 to NA months), the median overall survival (OS) was 15 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 21.6 months), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 15.1 months). Common grade 3 or greater adverse events included febrile neutropenia (77.8%) and infection (63.6%), with pneumonia being the most common (10, 45.5%). There was one death (4.5%) within 30 days.ConclusionThe combination of PLD, LDAC, and G-CSF is well-tolerated and exhibits high rates of CR/CRi and low early mortality, providing an attractive treatment option for newly diagnosed elderly and unfit AML patients.",

METHODS: A retrospective, observational medical record review was conducted of patients with AML in remission after induction therapy and who initiated treatment with oral-AZA between March 2021 and July 2023 in Canada. Real-world relapse-free survival and overall survival outcomes were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. RESULTS: Data from 119 patients were analyzed. The median age at oral-AZA initiation was 62.5 years. Most patients had favorable (39.5%) or intermediate (39.5%) genetic risk per the 2017/2022 European LeukemiaNet classification. Nearly all patients (99.2%) received cytarabine-based induction regimens. A total of 55.5% of patients received consolidation therapy, with a median of two cycles. After a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 68.1% of all patients were still receiving oral-AZA at last follow-up. After oral-AZA treatment, 21.0% of patients relapsed. Rates of real-world relapse-free survival and overall survival at 12 months from oral-AZA initiation were 66.9% and 74.5%, respectively. During oral-AZA treatment, 67.2% of patients experienced >=1 adverse event. Concomitant antiemetic treatment was received by 78.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: These findings provide real-world evidence further supporting the use of oral-AZA as a standard-of-care maintenance therapy in current routine clinical practice for patients with AML in remission who do not receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These results may inform a broader clinical audience because of the inclusion of patients with diverse demographic and clinical characteristics.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although some new treatment protocols have been developed, 7+3 chemotherapy is still the most widely used treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction therapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a widely used treatment modality for myelosuppression after chemotherapy as it accelerates myeloid healing and reduces the incidence and severity of fever and infections. Most current guidelines recommend primary G-CSF prophylaxis in solid cancer patients with a risk of >=20% febrile neutropenia. However, the use of G-CSF in the induction treatment of AML is controversial as it increases the proliferation of leukemic blasts in vitro. AIM: This study was to investigate the effects of G-CSF use in AML induction therapy on survival. METHODS: The study group included 36 patients over the age of 18 with bone marrow blast rate >20% who were diagnosed with AML [M0-M5 according to FAB (French-American-British) classification] using diagnostic tests, such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy between 2016 and 2020. Eighteen of these patients were from a center that employed prophylactic G-CSF during induction therapy, and the remaining 18 patients were from another center that did not employ prophylactic G-CSF during induction therapy. The characteristics of the patients were reviewed retrospectively from their files. The induction therapy used was 7+3 (7-day cytarabine +3-day idarubicin) chemotherapy regimen. RESULTS: Although not reaching statistically significant levels, the use of G-CSF in AML induction therapy was found to provide both OS and PFS advantages. In addition, patients who used G-SF had statistically significantly fewer intensive care unit (ICU) stays than those who did not use it. CONCLUSION: Although the use of G-CSF in induction therapy of AML patients did not significantly increase survival rates, it caused a statistically significant decrease in the need for intensive care. However, larger-scale studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm the results of this study.",

We report a case of a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with AML 13 years after a diagnosis of PNH. Gene mutations associated with MDS were detected. She did not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine. Unrelated bone marrow transplantation was performed with a myeloablative conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (12 Gy). Ravulizumab was administered until 47 days after transplantation. She achieved CR after transplantation with complete donor engraftment. The transplantation was successful without severe complications such as graft-versus-host disease or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.

                    "abstract": "Venetoclax (VEN)--based induction therapy has demonstrated considerable promise in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the optimal VEN-based combination therapy remains to be established. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the venetoclax-homoharringtonine-cytarabine (VHA) regimen in patients with newly diagnosed (ND) AML. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 55 patients treated with the VHA regimen. The overall response rate (ORR) was 92.7% (51/55, 95% CI 82%-98%), and the composite complete remission (CRc) rate was 87.3% (48/55, 95% CI 76%-95%). Among the 48 patients who achieved CRc, 91.7% (44/48, 95% CI 67%-90%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 85.4% (41/48, 95% CI 72%-94%) reached measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative CR. In the adverse-risk group, ORR and CRc were 95% (19/20, 95% CI 75%-100%) and 75% (15/20, 95% CI 51%-91%), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (32.7%), pneumonia (16.3%), and sepsis (9.1%). Median overall survival (OS) was 26 months, while event-free survival (EFS) was not reached. One-year OS was 83%, and one-year EFS was 82%. These preliminary data suggest that the VHA regimen achieves a very high rate of CR and low toxicity, particularly for adverse-risk AML patients.",

We utilized Sleeping Beauty transposon to engineer donor-derived anti-CD19.CD28.OX40.CD3zeta T cells differentiated in cytokine-induced killer (CARCIK-CD19) for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). We report the results of CARCIK-CD19 observed in 36 patients (4 children and 32 adults) treated according to the final recommended dose. Cytokine release syndrome of grade 2 or lower occurred in 15 patients, ICANS grade 2 in 1 patient, and late-onset peripheral neurotoxicity of grade 3 in 2 patients. GVHD never occurred after treatment with allogeneic CARCIK-CD19. Complete remission was achieved by 30 out of 36 patients (83.3%), with MRD negativity in 89% of responders. With a median follow-up of 2.2 years, the 1-year overall survival was 57.0%, and event-free survival was 32.0%. The median duration of response at 1 year was 38.6%. CAR-T cells expanded rapidly after infusion and remained detectable for over 2 years. Integration site analysis after infusion showed a high clonal diversity. These data demonstrated that SB-engineered CAR-T cells are safe and induce durable remission in heavily pretreated patients with BCP-ALL relapsed after alloHSCT.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a common malignancy in children. Patients with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are at a higher risk of developing hematologic disorders. Despite advances in treatment, extramedullary relapse remains a challenge, particularly when it manifests as spinal cord compression leading to paraplegia, a rare but severe complication. METHODS: We describe the clinical course of an 11-year-old male with Trisomy 21, diagnosed with B-ALL. The patient was treated with standard chemotherapy (VDLP regimen) followed by central nervous system prophylaxis through lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy. Despite achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, the patient developed progressive lower back pain and acute paraplegia. Imaging studies and subsequent spinal surgery were performed to diagnose and manage the spinal cord lesion. RESULTS: The patient's spinal pathology confirmed a relapse of B-ALL with extramedullary involvement. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed markers consistent with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Chemotherapy-induced remission was initially achieved, but the patient experienced bone marrow suppression after each cycle, leading to further hospitalization and supportive treatments. Postsurgical findings showed no CNS involve-ment, and bone marrow MRD remained negative. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the complexity of managing B-ALL in children with Trisomy 21, who may be prone to extramedullary relapse despite systemic remission. Early recognition of spinal symptoms and prompt surgical intervention are critical in preventing irreversible neurological damage such as paraplegia. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in high-risk populations.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years. The outcomes in older or unfit AML patients on intensive chemotherapy are poor, and thus, it is necessary to explore alternative strategies. In recent years, non-intensive therapies have transformed the standard of care for this population. Despite the increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies in this area, the optimal treatment approach remains unclear. METHODS: We sourced four databases, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, until July 07, 2024, to identify all Phase II/III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating low-intensity treatments for older AML patients. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), overall response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) graded >= 3 were analyzed using a Bayesian fixed-effects network meta-analysis (NMA). RESULTS: A total of 4920 patients across 26 trials were included. In terms of improving OS, AZA + VEN, LDAC + glasdegib, and LDAC + VEN (SUCRA = 0.936, 0.898, and 0.718, respectively) were the most effective treatments. For CR, ORR, and CRi, AZA + VEN ranked highest among all therapies (SUCRA = 0.836, 0.911, and 0.829, respectively). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and network meta-analysis suggest that AZA + VEN is superior to the current standard of care, particularly in improving OS, CR, ORR, and CRi. LDAC + glasdegib also demonstrated promising efficacy and warrants further investigation.",

METHODS: Data from French patients involved in this the trial were used here. The EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire was completed by patients at baseline, and then at months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 after consolidation. Repeated measures mixed-effects models were used to assess HRQoL changes between baseline and each checkpoint for each HRQoL scale. RESULTS: Baseline data showed overall a good global health status with mean scores of 76.3 and 72.1 in the LEN and OBS arms respectively, on the 0-100 scale. At 12 months, LEN patients had significantly more diarrhea than OBS patients (p = 0.003) and social functioning was significantly impaired at month 18 (p = 0.05). A 10-point difference appeared in the LEN arm for dyspnea and digestive disorders from month 12 on. Multivariate analysis showed a deleterious effect of LEN on global health (p = 0.02) and functional scales (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study provides HRQoL values in a French cohort of CLL patients in consolidation treatment. Supplementation with lenalidomide as consolidation therapy in CLL leads to late health deterioration, especially diarrhea, after 12 months of treatment. Quantitative assessment of HRQoL should be balanced against benefits in disease control to determine overall health benefits.",

                    "title": "Impact of lenalidomide consolidation on health-related quality of life in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: ancillary study of the phase III CLL6-RESIDUUM trial.",
                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Within the French-Australian CLL6 RESIDUUM trial, an ancillary study aimed at assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving a two-year consolidation of lenalidomide (LEN) or observation (OBS) after classical immunochemotherapy leaving them with detectable residual disease. METHODS: Data from French patients involved in this the trial were used here. The EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire was completed by patients at baseline, and then at months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 after consolidation. Repeated measures mixed-effects models were used to assess HRQoL changes between baseline and each checkpoint for each HRQoL scale. RESULTS: Baseline data showed overall a good global health status with mean scores of 76.3 and 72.1 in the LEN and OBS arms respectively, on the 0-100 scale. At 12 months, LEN patients had significantly more diarrhea than OBS patients (p = 0.003) and social functioning was significantly impaired at month 18 (p = 0.05). A 10-point difference appeared in the LEN arm for dyspnea and digestive disorders from month 12 on. Multivariate analysis showed a deleterious effect of LEN on global health (p = 0.02) and functional scales (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study provides HRQoL values in a French cohort of CLL patients in consolidation treatment. Supplementation with lenalidomide as consolidation therapy in CLL leads to late health deterioration, especially diarrhea, after 12 months of treatment. Quantitative assessment of HRQoL should be balanced against benefits in disease control to determine overall health benefits.",

However, the influence of obesity and related comorbidities on treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles remains unclear. This retrospective study included 115 patients treated with CAR-T therapy at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2017 to October 2023. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities. Clinical outcomes, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) severity, treatment efficacy, Overall Survival (OS), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), were analyzed. Logistic regression models assessed the relationships between covariates and clinical outcomes. The median BMI was 21.91 (IQR 19.265-24.365). Among the patients, 32 were overweight, and only one had a BMI over 30. Severe CRS occurred in 16 patients, with a higher proportion in those with obesity or related conditions (10.4% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.01). Hyperlipidemia significantly increased the risk of severe CRS (OR = 3.730, CI [1.204-11.556], p = 0.022). However, being overweight, having diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or fatty liver were not significantly associated with severe CRS. Elevated total cholesterol was moderately correlated with increased Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (R = 0.637, p < 0.001) and weakly with Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) (R = 0.337, p < 0.001). Besides, overweight patients had a lower proportion of CAR-T cells post-infusion (OR = 0.98, CI [0.961-1.0], p = 0.048). Obesity and related comorbidities did not significantly impact treatment efficacy. However, hyperlipidemia was associated with an increased risk of severe CRS, emphasizing the need for tailored risk management strategies in CAR-T therapy.

Additionally, venetoclax-treated patients experienced fewer non-hematological adverse events, such as elevated liver enzymes than conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies (0% vs. 41.6%, P = 0.014), which may be attributed to reduced use of intensive cytotoxic agents like pegylated asparaginase in the venetoclax cohort.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a common malignancy in children. Patients with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are at a higher risk of developing hematologic disorders. Despite advances in treatment, extramedullary relapse remains a challenge, particularly when it manifests as spinal cord compression leading to paraplegia, a rare but severe complication. METHODS: We describe the clinical course of an 11-year-old male with Trisomy 21, diagnosed with B-ALL. The patient was treated with standard chemotherapy (VDLP regimen) followed by central nervous system prophylaxis through lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy. Despite achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, the patient developed progressive lower back pain and acute paraplegia. Imaging studies and subsequent spinal surgery were performed to diagnose and manage the spinal cord lesion. RESULTS: The patient's spinal pathology confirmed a relapse of B-ALL with extramedullary involvement. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed markers consistent with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Chemotherapy-induced remission was initially achieved, but the patient experienced bone marrow suppression after each cycle, leading to further hospitalization and supportive treatments. Postsurgical findings showed no CNS involve-ment, and bone marrow MRD remained negative. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the complexity of managing B-ALL in children with Trisomy 21, who may be prone to extramedullary relapse despite systemic remission. Early recognition of spinal symptoms and prompt surgical intervention are critical in preventing irreversible neurological damage such as paraplegia. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in high-risk populations.",

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. METHODS: We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study describes baseline and clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, survival, and safety outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received oral azacitidine (oral-AZA) maintenance therapy in Canada following its approval in 2021. METHODS: A retrospective, observational medical record review was conducted of patients with AML in remission after induction therapy and who initiated treatment with oral-AZA between March 2021 and July 2023 in Canada. Real-world relapse-free survival and overall survival outcomes were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. RESULTS: Data from 119 patients were analyzed. The median age at oral-AZA initiation was 62.5 years. Most patients had favorable (39.5%) or intermediate (39.5%) genetic risk per the 2017/2022 European LeukemiaNet classification. Nearly all patients (99.2%) received cytarabine-based induction regimens. A total of 55.5% of patients received consolidation therapy, with a median of two cycles. After a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 68.1% of all patients were still receiving oral-AZA at last follow-up. After oral-AZA treatment, 21.0% of patients relapsed. Rates of real-world relapse-free survival and overall survival at 12 months from oral-AZA initiation were 66.9% and 74.5%, respectively. During oral-AZA treatment, 67.2% of patients experienced >=1 adverse event. Concomitant antiemetic treatment was received by 78.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: These findings provide real-world evidence further supporting the use of oral-AZA as a standard-of-care maintenance therapy in current routine clinical practice for patients with AML in remission who do not receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These results may inform a broader clinical audience because of the inclusion of patients with diverse demographic and clinical characteristics.",

A prospective phase II study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) combined with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in newly diagnosed older and unfit AML patients.MethodsTwenty-two patients were enrolled and deemed evaluable. The study included one cycle of induction and four cycles of consolidation, followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsThe median age of enrolled patients was 71.5 years (range, 63 to 82 years), and 16 patients (72.7%) were over 70 years of age. The overall response rate (ORR) was 77.3% (n = 17) and the complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi) rate was 63.6% (n = 14) after the first induction cycle. With a median follow-up of 12.4 months, eight patients (57.1%) relapsed, with a median time to relapse of 12.3 months. The median duration of response (DOR) was 11.9 months (95% CI, 6.4 to NA months), the median overall survival (OS) was 15 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 21.6 months), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 15.1 months). Common grade 3 or greater adverse events included febrile neutropenia (77.8%) and infection (63.6%), with pneumonia being the most common (10, 45.5%). There was one death (4.5%) within 30 days.ConclusionThe combination of PLD, LDAC, and G-CSF is well-tolerated and exhibits high rates of CR/CRi and low early mortality, providing an attractive treatment option for newly diagnosed elderly and unfit AML patients.",

Methods: This retrospective cohort study investigated the use of tocilizumab for managing CAR-T-related CRS in 45 R/R B-ALL patients. Results: Of these, 17 patients received tocilizumab, resulting in a significant reduction in the duration of grade 3 CRS compared to those who did not receive the drug. Additionally, 10 patients showed decreased cytokine levels.Importantly, tocilizumab did not impair CAR-T cell expansion or efficacy, nor did it increase the incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: These findings suggest that tocilizumab may be an effective and safe strategy for mitigating CAR-T-related CRS in R/R B-ALL patients, potentially improving patient outcomes and survival.",

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. METHODS: We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

The combination of azacitidine and venetoclax has demonstrated some efficacy in relapsed AML. This study aimed to investigate the effects of venetoclax combined with azacitidine on immune function and quality of life in patients with relapsed AML. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 104 patients with relapsed AML who were admitted to the First People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 2020 to January 2024. The patients were divided into a combination group (n = 53, treated with a combination of venetoclax and azacitidine) and an azacitidine group (n = 51, treated with azacitidine) according to the treatment protocol. Hematological parameters (proportion of bone marrow progenitor cells [PBMPC], white blood cell count [WBC], platelet count [PLT], neutrophil count [NEUT], and hemoglobin [Hb]), serum immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgA, and IgM) and inflammatory factor (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) levels, as well as European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores were compared between the two groups, and adverse reactions were recorded. Results The remission rate in the combination group (66.0%) was significantly higher than that in the azacitidine group (45.1%, p < 0.05). Both azacitidine monotherapy and the combination therapy with venetoclax improved hematological indicators and quality of life while reducing serum immunoglobulin levels and inflammatory factors. Compared with the azacitidine group, the combination group demonstrated a significant reduction in PBMPC (p < 0.05), alongside an increase in WBC, PLT, NEUT, and Hb (p < 0.05). Additionally, combination therapy led to a greater reduction in serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, IL-6, and TNF-alpha compared to azacitidine alone (p < 0.05). Moreover, combination therapy significantly improved scores for physical, emotional, cognitive, social function, and general health status (p < 0.05), while reducing scores for nausea, dyspnea, insomnia, pain, and constipation (p < 0.05). Importantly, there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion The combination of venetoclax and azacitidine could regulate the immune function, improve hematological indicators and quality of life, without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions in patients with relapsed AML.",

However, since the approval of both compounds, more and more Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKis) and B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitors (BCL2is) have been discovered. Their efficacy and safety are the reasons for their use in monotherapy among both treatment-naive and relapsed patients with CLL. Currently, several ongoing clinical trials are investigating the rationale for the combination of BCL2is and BTKis. In this review, we discuss the recent advancements in the field of co-therapy with BTKis and BCL2is.",

Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed on patients with newly diagnosed ALAL who were hospitalized at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital from June 2021 to July 2024. Of the 13 patients who received initial induction therapy with venetoclax combined with multidrug chemotherapy, 8 received VAA+P regimen, and 5 received V+IA regimen. Patients with FLT3 mutation were treated with FLT3 inhibitor, and Ph(+) patients received an additional tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events were analyzed. Results: According to the World Health Organization 5th edition of the classification of hematolymphoid tumors, the immunophenotypes were T/myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) (n=4), B/myeloid MPAL (n=7), and ALAL- not otherwise specified (n=2). Of the seven patients with B/myeloid MPAL, four were Ph(+) and belonged to the group with specific gene abnormalities of ALAL. Three patients had FLT3 mutation (one with FLT3-TKD mutation and two with FLT3-ITD mutation). Prior to the second course of consolidation therapy, the efficacy of venetoclax induction therapy was evaluated, and a complete response rate of 100% was achieved in 13 patients. In the subsequent consolidation therapy phase, one patient discontinued treatment and was lost to follow-up; nine patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, four of whom died due to posttransplant complications and five achieved DFS. Of the three patients (>=70 years old) who received consolidation therapy as before, two achieved DFS and one died due to central nervous system leukemia. The median OS time was not reached in 13 patients; the 75th percentile survival time was 12.0 months, with a 12-month cumulative survival rate of 64.5%. The median DFS time was not reached in all patients; the 75th percentile DFS time was 8.2 months, with a 12-month cumulative DFS rate of 67.1%. All patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, during and after induction therapy. All patients recovered hematopoietic function after the initial induction therapy, with no fatal hemorrhage, tumor lysis syndrome, neurological adverse events, or grade 3 or higher organ toxicity, excluding preexisting conditions. Conclusion: Venetoclax in combination with multidrug chemotherapy was effective and associated with tolerable adverse reactions in patients with newly diagnosed ALAL.",

Early phase clinical trials have shown a very high initial response rate confirmed by follow up and real-world studies. However, almost half of patients relapse with the available commercial product currently suggesting the need of a consolidative treatment after CAR T-cell infusion in well-defined cases, according to several pre- and post-CAR clinical and biological factors. This finding highlights that numerous challenges exist before the extension of CAR T-cell indications (first relapse and high-risk first line) in the field of B-ALL: to enhance persistence of CAR T-cells to avoid CD19-positive relapse and to avoid CD19-negative relapse by reducing tumor burden pre-CAR-T infusion and/or by multitargeting. Promising approaches with exciting early clinical data are emerging in the field of T-cell ALL. The use of CAR T-cells for acute myeloid leukemias remains challenging due to the lack of leukemia-specific antigens and to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

She did not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine. Unrelated bone marrow transplantation was performed with a myeloablative conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (12 Gy). Ravulizumab was administered until 47 days after transplantation. She achieved CR after transplantation with complete donor engraftment.

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. METHODS: We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

                    "abstract": "Old individuals are at a high risk of developing aplastic anemia, and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) based on anti-human T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA) is recommended for treating severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Adding the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) to IST could improve hematologic responses in patients with SAA; however, limited data exist for elder patients. Here, we report on the efficacy and prognostic factors associated with porcine ATG and CsA with or without TPO-RA as first-line therapy in elderly patients with SAA. Porcine ATG was administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d for 5 days. CsA was administered orally, maintaining plasma trough concentrations of 150-250 microg/L. Eltrombopag was administered at a dose of 75-150 mg/day, and hetrombopag was administered orally at a dose of 15 mg/day. One hundred and twenty-eight SAA patients, with a median age of 63 (60-73) years old, were included in this study, including 44 very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) patients. All patients completed the porcine ATG treatment, and mild serum sicknesses were observed. Ten patients (2 SAA patients and 8 VSAA patients) died within 3 months of ATG initiation (early death), with severe infections being the main cause of death. Sixty-nine patients achieved a hematologic response at 6 months, with an overall response (OR) rate of 53.9%. The complete hematologic response (CR) rate at 6 months was 18.0%. The addition of TPO-RA to IST did not improve the OR and CR rates; nonetheless, early death was significantly lower (0%) in patients receiving TPO-RA compared to those not receiving TPO-RA (12%). Patients were followed up for a median of 28 (0.1-117) months. The OR rate at the last follow-up was 62.5%, while the CR rate was 36.7%. One patient progressed to myelodysplastic syndrome, one to leukemia, one to hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and five developed clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The 2-year overall survival rate and failure-free survival rate were 86.0% (95% CI: 78.1-91.3%) and 70.5% (95% CI: 61.3-77.9%), respectively. A baseline neutrophil count of < 0.05 x 109/L was identified as an independent prognostic factor for early death. Age younger than 65 years, a baseline reticulocyte count of >= 7 x 109/L, and the absence of fever before and within 3 months following ATG treatment were independent predictors for hematologic response at 6 months. In conclusion, treatment with porcine ATG and CsA was safe and effective in elderly patients with SAA. An extremely low baseline neutrophil count indicated a high risk of early death.",

                    "abstract": "Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a serious complication of chemotherapy that often leads to hospitalization in cancer patients. It is now well-established that carefully selected patients can be safely treated on an outpatient basis. The objective of this study was to assess the number and proportion of patients hospitalized for FN in a university hospital setting who would have met the low-risk criteria for FN, and whether these patients experienced favorable outcomes during hospitalization. We conducted a retrospective study of all patients admitted for FN at three hospitals in Quebec City between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2019. Patients with leukemia and those who had undergone stem cell transplants were excluded. A retrospective chart review was performed to establish the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score for each patient. Based on predefined criteria, we also determined whether the clinical course was favorable or unfavorable. A total of 177 hospitalizations met our inclusion criteria. We found that 101/177 (57.1%) of the hospitalized patients met the low-risk FN criteria according to their MASCC score. Among these, 74/177 (41.8%) met all the criteria for outpatient treatment. The majority of these patients had a favorable outcome (70/74, 94.6%). In contrast, among patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria for outpatient treatment, 44.7% (46/103) experienced favorable outcomes during their hospitalization. These data highlight the importance of patient selection for outpatient care.",

A prospective phase II study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) combined with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in newly diagnosed older and unfit AML patients.MethodsTwenty-two patients were enrolled and deemed evaluable. The study included one cycle of induction and four cycles of consolidation, followed by maintenance therapy.ResultsThe median age of enrolled patients was 71.5 years (range, 63 to 82 years), and 16 patients (72.7%) were over 70 years of age. The overall response rate (ORR) was 77.3% (n = 17) and the complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi) rate was 63.6% (n = 14) after the first induction cycle. With a median follow-up of 12.4 months, eight patients (57.1%) relapsed, with a median time to relapse of 12.3 months. The median duration of response (DOR) was 11.9 months (95% CI, 6.4 to NA months), the median overall survival (OS) was 15 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 21.6 months), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 15.1 months). Common grade 3 or greater adverse events included febrile neutropenia (77.8%) and infection (63.6%), with pneumonia being the most common (10, 45.5%). There was one death (4.5%) within 30 days.ConclusionThe combination of PLD, LDAC, and G-CSF is well-tolerated and exhibits high rates of CR/CRi and low early mortality, providing an attractive treatment option for newly diagnosed elderly and unfit AML patients.",

However, the influence of obesity and related comorbidities on treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles remains unclear. This retrospective study included 115 patients treated with CAR-T therapy at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2017 to October 2023. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities. Clinical outcomes, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) severity, treatment efficacy, Overall Survival (OS), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), were analyzed. Logistic regression models assessed the relationships between covariates and clinical outcomes. The median BMI was 21.91 (IQR 19.265-24.365). Among the patients, 32 were overweight, and only one had a BMI over 30. Severe CRS occurred in 16 patients, with a higher proportion in those with obesity or related conditions (10.4% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.01). Hyperlipidemia significantly increased the risk of severe CRS (OR = 3.730, CI [1.204-11.556], p = 0.022). However, being overweight, having diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or fatty liver were not significantly associated with severe CRS. Elevated total cholesterol was moderately correlated with increased Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (R = 0.637, p < 0.001) and weakly with Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) (R = 0.337, p < 0.001). Besides, overweight patients had a lower proportion of CAR-T cells post-infusion (OR = 0.98, CI [0.961-1.0], p = 0.048). Obesity and related comorbidities did not significantly impact treatment efficacy. However, hyperlipidemia was associated with an increased risk of severe CRS, emphasizing the need for tailored risk management strategies in CAR-T therapy.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Elderly patients with high-risk myelodysplastic neoplasm (MDS) face poor outcomes with limited treatment options, often progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study investigates the efficacy and safety of combining decitabine (DAC) with arsenic trioxide (ATO) as a novel therapeutic approach. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 elderly high-risk MDS patients, with 52 receiving ATO-DAC (ATO-DAC group) and 68 receiving DAC monotherapy (DAC group). Treatment outcomes were assessed through overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Adverse events were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The ATO-DAC group demonstrated a significantly higher ORR of 78.85% compared to 52.94% in the DAC group (P = 0.026). Median PFS was 7.5 months for the ATO-DAC group versus 5.0 months for the DAC group (P = 0.021), and median OS was 14.5 months compared to 11.5 months, respectively (P = 0.034). Although adverse events were more frequent in the ATO-DAC group, the safety profile remained manageable. These findings suggest that the ATO-DAC combination provides superior efficacy compared to DAC monotherapy. DISCUSSION: The combination of DAC and ATO offers a promising and innovative treatment option for elderly high-risk MDS patients, enhancing response rates and survival outcomes while maintaining a manageable safety profile. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the clinical relevance of this regimen, warranting further investigation in prospective trials.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although some new treatment protocols have been developed, 7+3 chemotherapy is still the most widely used treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction therapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a widely used treatment modality for myelosuppression after chemotherapy as it accelerates myeloid healing and reduces the incidence and severity of fever and infections. Most current guidelines recommend primary G-CSF prophylaxis in solid cancer patients with a risk of >=20% febrile neutropenia. However, the use of G-CSF in the induction treatment of AML is controversial as it increases the proliferation of leukemic blasts in vitro. AIM: This study was to investigate the effects of G-CSF use in AML induction therapy on survival. METHODS: The study group included 36 patients over the age of 18 with bone marrow blast rate >20% who were diagnosed with AML [M0-M5 according to FAB (French-American-British) classification] using diagnostic tests, such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy between 2016 and 2020. Eighteen of these patients were from a center that employed prophylactic G-CSF during induction therapy, and the remaining 18 patients were from another center that did not employ prophylactic G-CSF during induction therapy. The characteristics of the patients were reviewed retrospectively from their files. The induction therapy used was 7+3 (7-day cytarabine +3-day idarubicin) chemotherapy regimen. RESULTS: Although not reaching statistically significant levels, the use of G-CSF in AML induction therapy was found to provide both OS and PFS advantages. In addition, patients who used G-SF had statistically significantly fewer intensive care unit (ICU) stays than those who did not use it. CONCLUSION: Although the use of G-CSF in induction therapy of AML patients did not significantly increase survival rates, it caused a statistically significant decrease in the need for intensive care. However, larger-scale studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm the results of this study.",

Early phase clinical trials have shown a very high initial response rate confirmed by follow up and real-world studies. However, almost half of patients relapse with the available commercial product currently suggesting the need of a consolidative treatment after CAR T-cell infusion in well-defined cases, according to several pre- and post-CAR clinical and biological factors. This finding highlights that numerous challenges exist before the extension of CAR T-cell indications (first relapse and high-risk first line) in the field of B-ALL: to enhance persistence of CAR T-cells to avoid CD19-positive relapse and to avoid CD19-negative relapse by reducing tumor burden pre-CAR-T infusion and/or by multitargeting. Promising approaches with exciting early clinical data are emerging in the field of T-cell ALL. The use of CAR T-cells for acute myeloid leukemias remains challenging due to the lack of leukemia-specific antigens and to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

Early recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism are crucial, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where delayed diagnosis may lead to life-threatening complications such as acute kidney injury. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old male with diabetes, CKD stage G3aA3, and a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia presented with myalgia, anorexia, and anuria. He also reported intermittent chest pain for 1 month, progressing to severe symptoms including decreased urine output and anuria. DIAGNOSES: Laboratory findings revealed acute kidney injury (serum creatinine: 12.14 mg/dL), extreme elevations in muscle enzymes (creatine kinase: 250,000 IU/L), and cardiac biomarkers (troponin-T: 543 ng/L). Initial management did not improve his condition. On day 15, thyroid function tests confirmed non-autoimmune hypothyroidism (TSH: 55.58 muIU/mL, free T4: 0.06 ng/dL). INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent hemodialysis and conservative treatment initially, followed by levothyroxine replacement therapy on day 16. OUTCOMES: Renal function, urine output, and muscle enzyme levels gradually improved after thyroid hormone supplementation. By discharge on day 40, the patient's serum creatinine decreased to 3.08 mg/dL, and hemodialysis was discontinued. At 7 months posttreatment, his renal function stabilized at CKD stage G3bA2 with normal thyroid function. LESSONS: This case highlights the importance of considering hypothyroidism in patients with unexplained rhabdomyolysis and persistent cardiac symptoms, particularly in those with CKD. Early thyroid function testing can lead to timely treatment and improved outcomes in such complex cases.",

However, indefinite TKI treatment can lead to adverse effects and high costs. Recent studies have suggested that treatment-free remission (TFR) is achievable in patients with a deep molecular response (DMR). The present multicenter, retrospective observational study conducted in Japan evaluated the applicability of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2020 TKI discontinuation criteria, which recommend TKI therapy of >= 5 years with sustained MR4 for >= 3 years or MR4.5 for >= 2 years. A total of 100 patients who discontinued TKI therapy were analyzed, with 70 meeting the ELN2020 criteria. The overall 12-month TFR rate was 71.9 %. Univariate analysis showed that both the duration of DMR and TKI therapy were significantly associated with TFR, with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.305 and 0.450, respectively. Only DMR duration remained significant (HR 0.362) in multivariate analysis. Patients who lost MMR after TKI discontinuation rapidly re-achieved molecular response upon TKI resumption. The most common reason for TKI discontinuation was elective cessation, followed by adverse events, among which pleural effusion due to dasatinib was the most frequent. The results of this study, the first to assess the ELN2020 criteria in a Japanese cohort, suggest that the criteria are applicable in real-world clinical practice.",

Among the patients, 32 were overweight, and only one had a BMI over 30. Severe CRS occurred in 16 patients, with a higher proportion in those with obesity or related conditions (10.4% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.01). Hyperlipidemia significantly increased the risk of severe CRS (OR = 3.730, CI [1.204-11.556], p = 0.022). However, being overweight, having diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or fatty liver were not significantly associated with severe CRS. Elevated total cholesterol was moderately correlated with increased Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (R = 0.637, p < 0.001) and weakly with Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) (R = 0.337, p < 0.001). Besides, overweight patients had a lower proportion of CAR-T cells post-infusion (OR = 0.98, CI [0.961-1.0], p = 0.048). Obesity and related comorbidities did not significantly impact treatment efficacy. However, hyperlipidemia was associated with an increased risk of severe CRS, emphasizing the need for tailored risk management strategies in CAR-T therapy.

Routine blood tests at her previous medical institution revealed a decreased white blood cell count, leading to a diagnosis of low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. During observation, the disease progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and she was subsequently referred to our hospital. At the time of AML diagnosis, bone marrow examination detected minor BCR-ABL mRNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a positive BCR-ABL fusion signal in 7.5% of bone marrow cells. Treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine was initiated, and led to hematological remission after one cycle. A bone marrow examination after two cycles confirmed the maintenance of hematological remission, and RT-PCR showed reduced minor BCR-ABL mRNA levels. AML with BCR-ABL1 fusion generally has a poor prognosis and has no established treatment, but in this case, treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine successfully induced remission and demonstrated potential efficacy against BCR-ABL fusion-positive clones.",

It is these mutations that cause tumor heterogeneity, which is linked to a higher risk of relapse and death and makes anti-AML treatments like HSCT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (ICI, CAR T-cell-based therapies, and cancer vaccines) less effective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) also makes it possible to find cellular subclones and profile tumors, which opens up new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for better AML management. The HSCT process works better when genetic and transcriptional information about the patient and donor stem cells is collected.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a common malignancy in children. Patients with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are at a higher risk of developing hematologic disorders. Despite advances in treatment, extramedullary relapse remains a challenge, particularly when it manifests as spinal cord compression leading to paraplegia, a rare but severe complication. METHODS: We describe the clinical course of an 11-year-old male with Trisomy 21, diagnosed with B-ALL. The patient was treated with standard chemotherapy (VDLP regimen) followed by central nervous system prophylaxis through lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy. Despite achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, the patient developed progressive lower back pain and acute paraplegia. Imaging studies and subsequent spinal surgery were performed to diagnose and manage the spinal cord lesion. RESULTS: The patient's spinal pathology confirmed a relapse of B-ALL with extramedullary involvement. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed markers consistent with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Chemotherapy-induced remission was initially achieved, but the patient experienced bone marrow suppression after each cycle, leading to further hospitalization and supportive treatments. Postsurgical findings showed no CNS involve-ment, and bone marrow MRD remained negative. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the complexity of managing B-ALL in children with Trisomy 21, who may be prone to extramedullary relapse despite systemic remission. Early recognition of spinal symptoms and prompt surgical intervention are critical in preventing irreversible neurological damage such as paraplegia. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in high-risk populations.",

                    "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are common lymphoproliferative diseases in the elderly, accounting for 33% of all leukemias. The use of targeted therapies has significantly changed the management landscape of CLL/SLL. However, the efficacy of specific targeted therapies, such as venetoclax-based therapies, is limited. This review, therefore, aims to summarize the current evidence on the effectiveness and safety of venetoclax-based treatments in the management of CLL/SLL. We conducted a comprehensive search of three electronic databases, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar, for all relevant articles. The reported outcomes were then analyzed using the statistical software Review Manager (RevMan 5.4.1). Our electronic search yielded 347 articles, of which only five were included in the review. We pooled the outcomes from 2195 patients. Our analysis found that venetoclax-based therapies significantly increased progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.30; 95% CI [0.21, 0.43] p < 0.00001), overall survival (OS) (HR 0.60; 95% CI [0.45, 0.80] p = 0.0004), and time to the next treatment (TTNT) (HR 0.29; 95% [0.18, 0.46] p < 0.00001). Additionally, we found the comparative safety of venetoclax-based therapies to other combination therapies. Our study found that venetoclax-based therapies are superior to other combination therapies in prolonging survival. Furthermore, they are comparable in safety to standard chemotherapy regimens and cost-effective. The findings of this review provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of venetoclax-based regimens in CLL/SLL. However, further research is required to determine the best comparative regimen and the feasibility of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with CLL/SLL.",

METHOD: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Bias assessment was conducted using Cochrane's risk of bias tool, while statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. RESULTS: We included 44 studies and the pooled results showed that high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) in induction therapy significantly improved the complete remission (CR) rate than standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) in younger adults but not older adults (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12-1.49, P=0.0004 and OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.29, P=0.87, respectively). In consolidation therapy, HDAC showed a significant benefit in event-free survival (EFS) over SDAC (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04-1.62, P=0.02). The pooled analysis also revealed that idarubicin (IDR) was associated with improved CR rates than daunorubicin (DNR) (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-1.76, P=0.04). However, the results do not substantiate the claim that IDR is better than mitoxantrone (MTZ) or that DNR is superior to MTZ in inducing CR (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.72-1.08, P=0.22 and OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72-1.01, P=0.06, respectively). The evidence has also shown that the pooled composite complete response (CRc) rates for FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib, gilteritinib, and quizartinib were 56%, 31%, and 36%, respectively. The pooled results further showed that the overall CRc for patients receiving IDH inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors were 49.6% (95% CI: 37-63) and 26% (95% CI: 18.7-35), respectively. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are valuable treatment options for AML patients. However, the efficacy of these AML treatments may vary depending on AML status and patient characteristics such as age and cytogenetic risk.",

Sixty-seven adults with MDS were enrolled (part 1, 40 with low/intermediate-1 or intermediate-2/high IPSS risk status; part 2, 27 with intermediate-2/high IPSS risk status). Primary safety endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints included evaluation of clinical outcomes, survival, and pharmacokinetics. Dose-limiting toxicities were experienced by no patients in part 1 and 3 patients (11%) in part 2. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea and fatigue (40% each) in part 1 and fatigue (44%) and anemia (37%) in part 2. In parts 1 and 2, 15% of patients experienced marrow complete response as their best overall response, according to IWG criteria.

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years. The outcomes in older or unfit AML patients on intensive chemotherapy are poor, and thus, it is necessary to explore alternative strategies. In recent years, non-intensive therapies have transformed the standard of care for this population. Despite the increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies in this area, the optimal treatment approach remains unclear. METHODS: We sourced four databases, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, until July 07, 2024, to identify all Phase II/III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating low-intensity treatments for older AML patients. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), overall response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs) graded >= 3 were analyzed using a Bayesian fixed-effects network meta-analysis (NMA). RESULTS: A total of 4920 patients across 26 trials were included. In terms of improving OS, AZA + VEN, LDAC + glasdegib, and LDAC + VEN (SUCRA = 0.936, 0.898, and 0.718, respectively) were the most effective treatments. For CR, ORR, and CRi, AZA + VEN ranked highest among all therapies (SUCRA = 0.836, 0.911, and 0.829, respectively). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and network meta-analysis suggest that AZA + VEN is superior to the current standard of care, particularly in improving OS, CR, ORR, and CRi. LDAC + glasdegib also demonstrated promising efficacy and warrants further investigation.",

                    "abstract": "The treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in adults remains a significant therapeutic challenge. While advances in chemotherapy and targeted and immunotherapies have improved overall survival, relapsed or refractory (r/r) adult ALL is associated with poor outcomes. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative option, achieving high remission rates even in heavily pretreated patients. However, relapse is common. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), a traditional cornerstone of remission consolidation, may improve long-term outcomes but carries risks of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and morbidity. Most evidence for HCT after CAR T therapy comes from retrospective analyses of subgroups from CAR T cell trials, with small sample sizes and inconsistent data on transplant procedures and outcomes. Despite these limitations, consolidative allo-HCT appears to prolong relapse-free survival (RFS). While overall survival (OS) benefits are in question, extended remission duration has been observed. Nonrelapse mortality (including TRM), ranging from 2.4 to 35%, underscores the need for careful patient selection. Emerging real-world data affirm these findings but highlight the importance of individualized decisions based on disease and treatment history. This review examines current evidence on the sequential use of CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy and allo-HCT in adults with r/r B-ALL.",

                    "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a kind of leukemia that arises due to the translocation betwixt chromosomes 9 and 22. Philadelphia chromosome is characterized by the BCR::ABL fusion gene, which results from this recombination. It transcribes into active tyrosine kinase variants such as P185, P190, P210, and P230, depending on breakpoint chain variations. The fusion protein, encodes tyrosine kinases with varying exons, resulting in uncontrollable ATP-utilizing downstream signaling activities. Targeted therapy with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is used to combat BCR::ABL fusion kinases and increase the survival rate of patients. However, the incidence of TKI resistance among CML patients is widely noticed around the world. Hence, an elaborate and accurate understanding of the structural interactions between BCR::ABL encoded tyrosine kinases, which are responsible for sensitivity and resistance, is mandatory for hassle-free targeted therapy. This review is intended to cover the reported structural interactions between BCR::ABL variants and TKI ligands in detail to highlight strategies that may be applied in the near future to overcome the resistance and other cross-reactions.",

First-line induction treatment includes the combination of all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide, with which complete response rates greater than 90% are achieved. Although the combination is very effective, there are adverse reactions associated with the treatment, which include cellular differentiation syndrome, headache, fatigue, elevated triglycerides, and myositis. The latter is rare and is manifested by intense muscle pain a few days after starting ATRA. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values are not always elevated and this can make diagnosis difficult with delayed treatment and increased risk of complications. We report the case of a woman with APL who, during the induction phase of treatment, presented myositis of the pelvic muscles and lower extremities secondary to the administration of ATRA.

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n = 73) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n = 51), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P = 0.002). The median times to best response were 1.1 and 2.7 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P < 0.001). More patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (47%) than in the DEC-C cohort (16%, P < 0.001). The 4- and 8-week mortality did not significantly differ between the DEC-C and DEC-C-Ven cohorts. Patients in the DEC-C-Ven cohort had a more profound neutropenia at days 15 and 21 of the first cycle. The median overall survival was 24 and 19 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P = 0.89), and the median event-free survival durations were 18 and 10 months (P = 0.026). In conclusion, the addition of Ven resulted in improved response rates and outcomes in specific subgroups; prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains challenging because of poor responses to chemotherapy. Efforts to improve outcomes have included the use of high-dose cytarabine in combination with nucleoside analogs, such as cladribine. The authors evaluated combined cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine (CLIA) in a phase 2 trial of 66 patients with R/R AML. METHODS: Patients received induction with cladribine 5 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1-5), cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1-5), and idarubicin 10 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1-3; CLIA). Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (days 1-14) was added for FLT3-mutated AML. RESULTS: The composite response rate (complete remission [CR] plus complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi]) was 33%; salvage 1 (S1) patients (n = 35) had a CR/CRi rate of 49%. After a 61-month median follow-up, the median overall survival (OS) was 7.9 months, with a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 9.1 months for those in CR/CRi. The median OS for S1 patients was 12 months, with a median RFS of 10.3 months. For those who received CLIA with sorafenib (n = 22), the CR/CRi rate was 41%, median OS was 8.8 months, and median RFS was 3.8 months. Landmark analysis demonstrated superior OS for patients who proceeded to transplantation compared with patients who did not (median OS, 78 vs. 8.8 months, respectively; p < .001). The 4-week and 8-week mortality rates were 6% and 17%, respectively. Most grade >3 adverse events were related to infection and elevated liver function tests. CONCLUSIONS: CLIA is effective for patients with R/R AML and offers a safety profile similar to that of other intensive regimens (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02115295).",

Routine blood tests at her previous medical institution revealed a decreased white blood cell count, leading to a diagnosis of low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. During observation, the disease progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and she was subsequently referred to our hospital. At the time of AML diagnosis, bone marrow examination detected minor BCR-ABL mRNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a positive BCR-ABL fusion signal in 7.5% of bone marrow cells. Treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine was initiated, and led to hematological remission after one cycle. A bone marrow examination after two cycles confirmed the maintenance of hematological remission, and RT-PCR showed reduced minor BCR-ABL mRNA levels. AML with BCR-ABL1 fusion generally has a poor prognosis and has no established treatment, but in this case, treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine successfully induced remission and demonstrated potential efficacy against BCR-ABL fusion-positive clones.",

Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed on patients with newly diagnosed ALAL who were hospitalized at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital from June 2021 to July 2024. Of the 13 patients who received initial induction therapy with venetoclax combined with multidrug chemotherapy, 8 received VAA+P regimen, and 5 received V+IA regimen. Patients with FLT3 mutation were treated with FLT3 inhibitor, and Ph(+) patients received an additional tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events were analyzed. Results: According to the World Health Organization 5th edition of the classification of hematolymphoid tumors, the immunophenotypes were T/myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) (n=4), B/myeloid MPAL (n=7), and ALAL- not otherwise specified (n=2). Of the seven patients with B/myeloid MPAL, four were Ph(+) and belonged to the group with specific gene abnormalities of ALAL. Three patients had FLT3 mutation (one with FLT3-TKD mutation and two with FLT3-ITD mutation). Prior to the second course of consolidation therapy, the efficacy of venetoclax induction therapy was evaluated, and a complete response rate of 100% was achieved in 13 patients. In the subsequent consolidation therapy phase, one patient discontinued treatment and was lost to follow-up; nine patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, four of whom died due to posttransplant complications and five achieved DFS. Of the three patients (>=70 years old) who received consolidation therapy as before, two achieved DFS and one died due to central nervous system leukemia. The median OS time was not reached in 13 patients; the 75th percentile survival time was 12.0 months, with a 12-month cumulative survival rate of 64.5%. The median DFS time was not reached in all patients; the 75th percentile DFS time was 8.2 months, with a 12-month cumulative DFS rate of 67.1%. All patients experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, during and after induction therapy. All patients recovered hematopoietic function after the initial induction therapy, with no fatal hemorrhage, tumor lysis syndrome, neurological adverse events, or grade 3 or higher organ toxicity, excluding preexisting conditions. Conclusion: Venetoclax in combination with multidrug chemotherapy was effective and associated with tolerable adverse reactions in patients with newly diagnosed ALAL.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Routine blood tests at her previous medical institution revealed a decreased white blood cell count, leading to a diagnosis of low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. During observation, the disease progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and she was subsequently referred to our hospital. At the time of AML diagnosis, bone marrow examination detected minor BCR-ABL mRNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a positive BCR-ABL fusion signal in 7.5% of bone marrow cells. Treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine was initiated, and led to hematological remission after one cycle. A bone marrow examination after two cycles confirmed the maintenance of hematological remission, and RT-PCR showed reduced minor BCR-ABL mRNA levels. AML with BCR-ABL1 fusion generally has a poor prognosis and has no established treatment, but in this case, treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine successfully induced remission and demonstrated potential efficacy against BCR-ABL fusion-positive clones.",

His disease was refractory to treatment, but went into remission after a third regimen, venetoclax plus azacitidine (Ven+Aza). However, the disease relapsed during treatment for an infection, and he underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant while not in remission. He did not achieve remission after transplantation, but treatment with azacitidine and early discontinuation of immunosuppressants led to remission. However, relapse occurred on day250 in the form of pericardial effusion. After drainage, Ven+Aza therapy was started again, and the pericardial effusion disappeared rapidly. The patient has been continuing the same treatment, and has remained in remission for more than 15 months. Isolated extramedullary relapse caused by pericardial effusion is rare, and this case illustrates that Ven+Aza therapy may be effective.",

However, indefinite TKI treatment can lead to adverse effects and high costs. Recent studies have suggested that treatment-free remission (TFR) is achievable in patients with a deep molecular response (DMR). The present multicenter, retrospective observational study conducted in Japan evaluated the applicability of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2020 TKI discontinuation criteria, which recommend TKI therapy of >= 5 years with sustained MR4 for >= 3 years or MR4.5 for >= 2 years. A total of 100 patients who discontinued TKI therapy were analyzed, with 70 meeting the ELN2020 criteria. The overall 12-month TFR rate was 71.9 %. Univariate analysis showed that both the duration of DMR and TKI therapy were significantly associated with TFR, with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.305 and 0.450, respectively. Only DMR duration remained significant (HR 0.362) in multivariate analysis. Patients who lost MMR after TKI discontinuation rapidly re-achieved molecular response upon TKI resumption. The most common reason for TKI discontinuation was elective cessation, followed by adverse events, among which pleural effusion due to dasatinib was the most frequent. The results of this study, the first to assess the ELN2020 criteria in a Japanese cohort, suggest that the criteria are applicable in real-world clinical practice.",

However, evidence regarding FLT3i adoption in routine clinical practice is still scarce. METHODS: Clinical data are reported from 394 ND patients with FLT3-mutated AML enrolled in the retrospective observational Italian Cohort Study on FLT3-mutated patients with AML and treated with an upfront intensive regimen with (FLT3i group, n = 92) or without (CT group, n = 302) the addition of a FLT3i. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 34.5 months, an effectiveness benefit obtained by FLT3i incorporation both in terms of overall survival (median, 34.9 in the FLT3i vs 12.7 months in the CT group, p < .01) and relapse-free survival (median, 18.9 in the FLT3i vs 7.6 months in the CT group, p = .01) was documented, with a higher composite complete remission rate (75.4% in the FLT3i vs 62.4% in the CT group, p = .052). FLT3i benefit seemed to be independent from the transplant rate. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the benefit of FLT3i addition to upfront intensive treatment in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML patients was confirmed in a large, real-life cohort study.",

                    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Caregivers of patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) experience tremendous psychological distress before, during and after HSCT. However, few interventions are tailored to the protracted needs of these caregivers while considering scalability and accessibility. We previously developed an evidence-based intervention for caregivers of patients undergoing HSCT that improved quality of life (QOL), caregiving burden and mood. We have since adapted this clinician-delivered intervention into a self-administered, digital health application (BMT-CARE app) and are currently evaluating the effect of this intervention on QOL in caregivers of patients receiving HSCT. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study design is a non-blinded randomised controlled trial of a digital health intervention for caregivers of patients undergoing HSCT at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. We are enrolling and randomising 125 caregivers to receive the BMT-CARE app or usual care in a 1:1 assignment, stratifying by transplant type (autologous vs allogeneic). Caregivers assigned to the BMT-CARE app complete five self-guided modules designed to improve coping and stress management prior to and up to 60 days post-HSCT. The modules include interactive, gamified features and video vignettes to optimise engagement. Participants complete questionnaires at baseline and days 10, 60 and 100 post-HSCT. The primary outcome is comparison of QOL at day 60 post-HSCT. Secondary outcomes include caregiver burden, anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as post-traumatic stress symptoms. We are also exploring the usability of the BMT-CARE app to inform refinements prior to future testing. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is funded by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (Protocol #22-634 v.1.5). The results of this study will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for non-pharmacological trials. Results will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05709912; Pre-results.",

Emapalumab, an anti-IFN-gamma antibody, is promising but underexplored in adult IEC-HS cases. We report an adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patient treated with brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel). The patient developed CRS, refractory neurotoxicity, and IEC-HS with worsening multiorgan failure and hyperinflammatory markers. Treatment included tocilizumab, high-dose corticosteroids, anakinra, siltuximab, and ruxolitinib. Despite aggressive management, hyperinflammation and neurotoxicity persisted. Emapalumab was initiated on day +11, resulting in normalization of the biochemical parameters and full neurological recovery by day +21. The patient recovered from IEC-HS and underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This case highlights the role of emapalumab in managing refractory IEC-HS and persistent neurotoxicity in adults, underscoring the need for targeted interventions in severe CAR-T complications.",

For 20 years, hypomethylating agents (HMAs), as single agents and recently as a backbone with venetoclax, have been used in this setting. The oral combination of decitabine and cedazuridine (C-DEC), which is therapeutically and pharmacologically equivalent to the intravenous (IV) formulation (IV-DEC), has expanded the therapeutic arsenal for AML, allowing for better convenience of administration. This review provides an overview of C-DEC, current clinical applications, and ongoing clinical studies, highlighting its potential role in managing AML in older patients. AREAS COVERED: For the aim of this review, the authors searched the current English literature on C-DEC in AML patients through PubMed, using several pertinent keywords. To summarize the most recent developments as up-to-date as possible, we considered, with a few exceptions, only papers published over the last three years until March 2025. EXPERT OPINION: Compared to IV-DEC, C-DEC provides similar therapeutic exposure and efficacy with an optional safety profile, enhanced treatment adherence, reduced treatment burden, and required healthcare facilities compared to those associated with IV-DEC, providing a precious tool to manage older and unfit AML patients.",

The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n = 73) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n = 51), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P = 0.002). The median times to best response were 1.1 and 2.7 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P < 0.001). More patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (47%) than in the DEC-C cohort (16%, P < 0.001). The 4- and 8-week mortality did not significantly differ between the DEC-C and DEC-C-Ven cohorts. Patients in the DEC-C-Ven cohort had a more profound neutropenia at days 15 and 21 of the first cycle. The median overall survival was 24 and 19 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P = 0.89), and the median event-free survival durations were 18 and 10 months (P = 0.026). In conclusion, the addition of Ven resulted in improved response rates and outcomes in specific subgroups; prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

                    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a powerful adoptive immunotherapy associated with significant toxicity, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). As CAR-T usage expands, hyperinflammatory toxicities resembling hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) syndrome are increasingly recognized. Immune effector cell-associated HLH-like syndrome (IEC-HS) describes HLH-like symptoms attributable to CAR-T cell therapy, often presenting as CRS resolves. Treatments for IEC-HS are adapted from primary HLH, including corticosteroids, the recombinant human interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist anakinra and the Janus Kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib. Emapalumab, an anti-IFN-gamma antibody, is promising but underexplored in adult IEC-HS cases. We report an adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patient treated with brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel). The patient developed CRS, refractory neurotoxicity, and IEC-HS with worsening multiorgan failure and hyperinflammatory markers. Treatment included tocilizumab, high-dose corticosteroids, anakinra, siltuximab, and ruxolitinib. Despite aggressive management, hyperinflammation and neurotoxicity persisted. Emapalumab was initiated on day +11, resulting in normalization of the biochemical parameters and full neurological recovery by day +21. The patient recovered from IEC-HS and underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This case highlights the role of emapalumab in managing refractory IEC-HS and persistent neurotoxicity in adults, underscoring the need for targeted interventions in severe CAR-T complications.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

                    "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are common lymphoproliferative diseases in the elderly, accounting for 33% of all leukemias. The use of targeted therapies has significantly changed the management landscape of CLL/SLL. However, the efficacy of specific targeted therapies, such as venetoclax-based therapies, is limited. This review, therefore, aims to summarize the current evidence on the effectiveness and safety of venetoclax-based treatments in the management of CLL/SLL. We conducted a comprehensive search of three electronic databases, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar, for all relevant articles. The reported outcomes were then analyzed using the statistical software Review Manager (RevMan 5.4.1). Our electronic search yielded 347 articles, of which only five were included in the review. We pooled the outcomes from 2195 patients. Our analysis found that venetoclax-based therapies significantly increased progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.30; 95% CI [0.21, 0.43] p < 0.00001), overall survival (OS) (HR 0.60; 95% CI [0.45, 0.80] p = 0.0004), and time to the next treatment (TTNT) (HR 0.29; 95% [0.18, 0.46] p < 0.00001). Additionally, we found the comparative safety of venetoclax-based therapies to other combination therapies. Our study found that venetoclax-based therapies are superior to other combination therapies in prolonging survival. Furthermore, they are comparable in safety to standard chemotherapy regimens and cost-effective. The findings of this review provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of venetoclax-based regimens in CLL/SLL. However, further research is required to determine the best comparative regimen and the feasibility of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with CLL/SLL.",

In patients with low absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) before conditioning, weight-based dosing of ATG may cause overexposure, negatively impacting prognosis. Method: Clinical data of patients with hematological malignancies undergoing haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) at the Children's Hospital of Soochow University from January 2020 to June 2023 were collected. This study primarily aims to investigate the association between pre-conditioning ALC and clinical outcomes in pediatric acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes patients receiving myeloablative haplo-HSCT. Results: We included 130 patients treated at the Children's Hospital of Soochow University from January 2020 to June 2023. According to the cutoff of 500/mul, patients were divided into high and low ALC groups. Patients in the high ALC group experienced a higher incidence of II-IV acute GVHD (30.2% versus 13.6%, P = 0.034), 3-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates (OS: 88.5% +- 3.7% versus 66.9% +- 7.9%, P = 0.013; RFS: 81.4% +- 4.1% versus 56.5% +- 8.1%, P < 0.001), and lower cumulative incidence of relapse (11.3% versus 27.4%, P = 0.013). Pre-conditioning ALC < 500/mul independently predicted worse OS, RFS, and higher relapse risk in multivariate analysis. However, there was no significant difference in immune reconstitution between the two groups. Conclusion: Pre-conditioning ALC was a significant prognostic factor in pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative haplo-HSCT. Further research is needed to explore whether pre-conditioning ALC can serve as a reference for adjusting ATG dosing.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Within the French-Australian CLL6 RESIDUUM trial, an ancillary study aimed at assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving a two-year consolidation of lenalidomide (LEN) or observation (OBS) after classical immunochemotherapy leaving them with detectable residual disease. METHODS: Data from French patients involved in this the trial were used here. The EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire was completed by patients at baseline, and then at months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 after consolidation. Repeated measures mixed-effects models were used to assess HRQoL changes between baseline and each checkpoint for each HRQoL scale. RESULTS: Baseline data showed overall a good global health status with mean scores of 76.3 and 72.1 in the LEN and OBS arms respectively, on the 0-100 scale. At 12 months, LEN patients had significantly more diarrhea than OBS patients (p = 0.003) and social functioning was significantly impaired at month 18 (p = 0.05). A 10-point difference appeared in the LEN arm for dyspnea and digestive disorders from month 12 on. Multivariate analysis showed a deleterious effect of LEN on global health (p = 0.02) and functional scales (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study provides HRQoL values in a French cohort of CLL patients in consolidation treatment. Supplementation with lenalidomide as consolidation therapy in CLL leads to late health deterioration, especially diarrhea, after 12 months of treatment. Quantitative assessment of HRQoL should be balanced against benefits in disease control to determine overall health benefits.",

Among the 8 patients who achieved remission after CD7 CAR-T cell infusion, 5 patients received consolidation allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Compared with 3 patients who did not undergo consolidation allo-HSCT, patients with allo-HSCT as consolidation showed a trend toward better OS (allo-HSCT vs. control: 6-month OS, 60% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.073) and better PFS (allo-HSCT vs. control: 6-month PFS, 60% vs. 0%, p = 0.022). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in all patients (grade 1-2 in 67% of patients, grade 3 in 33% of patients), and one patient experienced neurotoxicity. CD7 CAR-T cell therapy is a promising option for R/R T-ALL/LBL patients with manageable adverse events. Moreover, CD7 CAR-T cell infusion followed by consolidation allo-HSCT in R/R T-ALL/LBL patients might play an important role in prolonging remission duration.",

We retrospectively analyzed data for 144 patients with APL (t-APL, n = 20 and de novo APL, n = 124) who received a first allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2020. We found no significant differences in survival between the t-APL and de novo APL groups. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 53.8% in the t-APL group and 52.4% in the de novo APL group. However, as previously reported, patients without complete remission (CR) at HCT had significantly worse OS than those with CR (P = 0.004). The 3-year OS rates were 61.1% in patients with CR and 36.5% in those without CR. These findings suggest that allogeneic HCT may be considered a viable treatment option for patients with t-APL and de novo APL, with an emphasis on achieving CR before transplantation to optimize outcomes. However, clinicians should be aware of the potential for worse outcomes in male patients and those with lower performance status, highlighting the need for personalized treatment approaches and careful patient selection.",

Early recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism are crucial, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where delayed diagnosis may lead to life-threatening complications such as acute kidney injury. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old male with diabetes, CKD stage G3aA3, and a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia presented with myalgia, anorexia, and anuria. He also reported intermittent chest pain for 1 month, progressing to severe symptoms including decreased urine output and anuria. DIAGNOSES: Laboratory findings revealed acute kidney injury (serum creatinine: 12.14 mg/dL), extreme elevations in muscle enzymes (creatine kinase: 250,000 IU/L), and cardiac biomarkers (troponin-T: 543 ng/L). Initial management did not improve his condition. On day 15, thyroid function tests confirmed non-autoimmune hypothyroidism (TSH: 55.58 muIU/mL, free T4: 0.06 ng/dL). INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent hemodialysis and conservative treatment initially, followed by levothyroxine replacement therapy on day 16. OUTCOMES: Renal function, urine output, and muscle enzyme levels gradually improved after thyroid hormone supplementation. By discharge on day 40, the patient's serum creatinine decreased to 3.08 mg/dL, and hemodialysis was discontinued. At 7 months posttreatment, his renal function stabilized at CKD stage G3bA2 with normal thyroid function. LESSONS: This case highlights the importance of considering hypothyroidism in patients with unexplained rhabdomyolysis and persistent cardiac symptoms, particularly in those with CKD. Early thyroid function testing can lead to timely treatment and improved outcomes in such complex cases.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a common malignancy in children. Patients with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are at a higher risk of developing hematologic disorders. Despite advances in treatment, extramedullary relapse remains a challenge, particularly when it manifests as spinal cord compression leading to paraplegia, a rare but severe complication. METHODS: We describe the clinical course of an 11-year-old male with Trisomy 21, diagnosed with B-ALL. The patient was treated with standard chemotherapy (VDLP regimen) followed by central nervous system prophylaxis through lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy. Despite achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, the patient developed progressive lower back pain and acute paraplegia. Imaging studies and subsequent spinal surgery were performed to diagnose and manage the spinal cord lesion. RESULTS: The patient's spinal pathology confirmed a relapse of B-ALL with extramedullary involvement. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed markers consistent with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Chemotherapy-induced remission was initially achieved, but the patient experienced bone marrow suppression after each cycle, leading to further hospitalization and supportive treatments. Postsurgical findings showed no CNS involve-ment, and bone marrow MRD remained negative. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the complexity of managing B-ALL in children with Trisomy 21, who may be prone to extramedullary relapse despite systemic remission. Early recognition of spinal symptoms and prompt surgical intervention are critical in preventing irreversible neurological damage such as paraplegia. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in high-risk populations.",

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the incidence and risk factors of invasive fungal infection (IFI) among patients with haematological malignancies (HM) in a tertiary hospital from Malaysia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in a teaching hospital involving HM patients, admitted for chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Each admission for either chemotherapy or HSCT was considered as a separate event. Patients were followed up for development of IFI from the time of each admission to time of discharge or time of death. Outcomes of patients with IFI upon discharge were recorded. Clinical and mycological data during each admission were collected and analysed. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients with mean age of 58.8+-15.5 years were recruited. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the most common diagnosis (45.8%). A total of 132 admissions were analysed from these 83 patients. Antifungal prophylaxes were prescribed in 94.7% of admissions with fluconazole being the most common agent used (88.6%). The incidence of proven and probable IFI was 7.6%. Candida tropicalis was the most common fungi isolated from these patients (22.7%), followed by Candida krusei (13.6%). The mortality rate due to IFI was 17.6%. Patients with AML and those with concomitant bacteraemia were associated with higher risk of IFI (odds ratio [OR] 3.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-11.71, p=0.029 and OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.37-12.66, p=0.009, respectively), while the use of antifungal prophylaxis was associated with lower IFI risk (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.83, p=0.045). After multivariate analysis, the use of antifungal prophylaxis remains significantly associated with lower risk of IFI (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.01-0.62, p=0.019). CONCLUSION: IFI remains one of serious complications of HM patients undergoing chemotherapy and HSCT, most commonly due to non-albicans Candida spp. Appropriate antifungal prophylaxis is therefore crucial in the prevention of breakthrough IFI.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key proinflammatory cytokine associated with sepsis and its complications. This case study explored the use of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) combined with Cytosorb in managing pediatric patients with leukemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and elevated IL-6 levels. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old boy with Fanconi anemia presented with pancytopenia, fever, and necrotic lesions, indicative of mucormycosis. Following the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the patient experienced severe complications, including septic shock. Despite appropriate treatment, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and IL-6, were significantly elevated. CRRT with Cytosorb was initiated to manage hypercytokinemia and improve the patient's clinical status. INTERVENTION: The CRRT procedure utilizes citrate as an anticoagulant because of severe thrombocytopenia. The treatment lasted for 20 h, during which the inflammatory biomarkers were monitored. The post-treatment results indicated a significant reduction in IL-6 levels within 24 h and a decrease in PCT levels at 8 h. CRP levels gradually declined over 40 h. OUTCOME: The patient exhibited marked clinical improvement, with significant healing of cutaneous lesions and stabilization of inflammatory markers, allowing transfer to the ward for continued chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that CRRT combined with cytosorb may be a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing complex cases of septic shock. The observed reduction in inflammatory markers, particularly IL-6, warrants further investigation. Concurrent antimicrobial, antifungal, and dexamethasone treatments for IRIS may have influenced the observed outcomes in this single case. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate the specific contribution of Cytosorb-CRRT and assess its long-term efficacy and safety in similar patient populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.

It is these mutations that cause tumor heterogeneity, which is linked to a higher risk of relapse and death and makes anti-AML treatments like HSCT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (ICI, CAR T-cell-based therapies, and cancer vaccines) less effective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) also makes it possible to find cellular subclones and profile tumors, which opens up new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for better AML management.

                    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the incidence and risk factors of invasive fungal infection (IFI) among patients with haematological malignancies (HM) in a tertiary hospital from Malaysia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in a teaching hospital involving HM patients, admitted for chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Each admission for either chemotherapy or HSCT was considered as a separate event. Patients were followed up for development of IFI from the time of each admission to time of discharge or time of death. Outcomes of patients with IFI upon discharge were recorded. Clinical and mycological data during each admission were collected and analysed. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients with mean age of 58.8+-15.5 years were recruited. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the most common diagnosis (45.8%). A total of 132 admissions were analysed from these 83 patients. Antifungal prophylaxes were prescribed in 94.7% of admissions with fluconazole being the most common agent used (88.6%). The incidence of proven and probable IFI was 7.6%. Candida tropicalis was the most common fungi isolated from these patients (22.7%), followed by Candida krusei (13.6%). The mortality rate due to IFI was 17.6%. Patients with AML and those with concomitant bacteraemia were associated with higher risk of IFI (odds ratio [OR] 3.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-11.71, p=0.029 and OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.37-12.66, p=0.009, respectively), while the use of antifungal prophylaxis was associated with lower IFI risk (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.83, p=0.045). After multivariate analysis, the use of antifungal prophylaxis remains significantly associated with lower risk of IFI (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.01-0.62, p=0.019). CONCLUSION: IFI remains one of serious complications of HM patients undergoing chemotherapy and HSCT, most commonly due to non-albicans Candida spp. Appropriate antifungal prophylaxis is therefore crucial in the prevention of breakthrough IFI.",

                    "abstract": "Hypomethylating agents (HMA) are indicated in the treatment of higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The combination of hypomethylating agents with venetoclax (Ven) has demonstrated promising results in these diseases, although randomized clinical trials are needed for validation. In this retrospective study, we compared two matched cohorts of patients with MDS or CMML: one receiving oral decitabine-cedazuridine (DEC-C, n = 73) and one receiving DEC-C and Ven (DEC-C-Ven, n = 51), in three contemporary clinical trials. The aim is to determine the impact of the addition of Ven to HMA in MDS and CMML. Individuals were matched using a propensity score approach that was based on the IPSS-M score and age. All patients had excess blasts; 84% were diagnosed with MDS and 16% with CMML. Most patients had high- or very high-risk disease, according to the revised IPSS-R. The overall response rate was superior in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (90% vs 64%, P = 0.002). The median times to best response were 1.1 and 2.7 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P < 0.001). More patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the DEC-C-Ven cohort (47%) than in the DEC-C cohort (16%, P < 0.001). The 4- and 8-week mortality did not significantly differ between the DEC-C and DEC-C-Ven cohorts. Patients in the DEC-C-Ven cohort had a more profound neutropenia at days 15 and 21 of the first cycle. The median overall survival was 24 and 19 months for the DEC-C-Ven and DEC-C cohorts, respectively (P = 0.89), and the median event-free survival durations were 18 and 10 months (P = 0.026). In conclusion, the addition of Ven resulted in improved response rates and outcomes in specific subgroups; prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

Routine blood tests at her previous medical institution revealed a decreased white blood cell count, leading to a diagnosis of low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. During observation, the disease progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and she was subsequently referred to our hospital. At the time of AML diagnosis, bone marrow examination detected minor BCR-ABL mRNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a positive BCR-ABL fusion signal in 7.5% of bone marrow cells. Treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine was initiated, and led to hematological remission after one cycle. A bone marrow examination after two cycles confirmed the maintenance of hematological remission, and RT-PCR showed reduced minor BCR-ABL mRNA levels. AML with BCR-ABL1 fusion generally has a poor prognosis and has no established treatment, but in this case, treatment with venetoclax and azacitidine successfully induced remission and demonstrated potential efficacy against BCR-ABL fusion-positive clones.",

Novel immunotherapeutic strategies for this patient population are urgently needed. METHODS: We tested a novel, fully human anti-CD22/4-1BB CAR T-cell construct, CART22-65s, in parallel phase I studies for pediatric and adult B-ALL. After lymphodepletion, CART22-65s was infused using a 3-day fractionated dosing scheme, allowing for omission of the second and third doses in cases of early cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients, all with relapse after prior CD19-directed immunotherapy, were enrolled. Of 19 infused patients (pediatric, n=17; adult, n=2), 14 (74%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including 4 of 6 (67%) patients refractory to prior inotuzumab. Five of 14 patients in a CR proceeded to consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With a median follow-up of 38 months, the 12-month relapse-free survival rate was 38.4% (95% CI 19.3% to 76.5%) and overall survival rate was 52.6% (95% CI 34.3% to 80.6%). Two patients received additional CART22-65s treatments for subsequent CD22-positive relapses; one achieved another CR. All CRS (n=17, 89%) and neurotoxicity (n=4, 21%) events after initial infusion were grades 1-2. The only grade 3 CRS/neurotoxicity and the only high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis-like syndrome occurred in the retreatment setting. In vivo cellular kinetic data revealed robust CART22-65s proliferation by quantitative PCR peaking at a median of 20 days postinfusion, with the cells persisting out to month 42 in one patient who achieved a long-term remission with CART22-65s alone. CONCLUSIONS: The favorable safety profile and high remission rates in exceedingly refractory B-ALL support the continued development of CART22-65s but also highlight the need to use the product in combination with HCT or other novel strategies.

However, the influence of obesity and related comorbidities on treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles remains unclear. This retrospective study included 115 patients treated with CAR-T therapy at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2017 to October 2023. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities. Clinical outcomes, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) severity, treatment efficacy, Overall Survival (OS), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), were analyzed. Logistic regression models assessed the relationships between covariates and clinical outcomes. The median BMI was 21.91 (IQR 19.265-24.365). Among the patients, 32 were overweight, and only one had a BMI over 30. Severe CRS occurred in 16 patients, with a higher proportion in those with obesity or related conditions (10.4% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.01). Hyperlipidemia significantly increased the risk of severe CRS (OR = 3.730, CI [1.204-11.556], p = 0.022). However, being overweight, having diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or fatty liver were not significantly associated with severe CRS. Elevated total cholesterol was moderately correlated with increased Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (R = 0.637, p < 0.001) and weakly with Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) (R = 0.337, p < 0.001). Besides, overweight patients had a lower proportion of CAR-T cells post-infusion (OR = 0.98, CI [0.961-1.0], p = 0.048). Obesity and related comorbidities did not significantly impact treatment efficacy. However, hyperlipidemia was associated with an increased risk of severe CRS, emphasizing the need for tailored risk management strategies in CAR-T therapy.

                    "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are common lymphoproliferative diseases in the elderly, accounting for 33% of all leukemias. The use of targeted therapies has significantly changed the management landscape of CLL/SLL. However, the efficacy of specific targeted therapies, such as venetoclax-based therapies, is limited. This review, therefore, aims to summarize the current evidence on the effectiveness and safety of venetoclax-based treatments in the management of CLL/SLL. We conducted a comprehensive search of three electronic databases, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar, for all relevant articles. The reported outcomes were then analyzed using the statistical software Review Manager (RevMan 5.4.1). Our electronic search yielded 347 articles, of which only five were included in the review. We pooled the outcomes from 2195 patients. Our analysis found that venetoclax-based therapies significantly increased progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.30; 95% CI [0.21, 0.43] p < 0.00001), overall survival (OS) (HR 0.60; 95% CI [0.45, 0.80] p = 0.0004), and time to the next treatment (TTNT) (HR 0.29; 95% [0.18, 0.46] p < 0.00001). Additionally, we found the comparative safety of venetoclax-based therapies to other combination therapies. Our study found that venetoclax-based therapies are superior to other combination therapies in prolonging survival. Furthermore, they are comparable in safety to standard chemotherapy regimens and cost-effective. The findings of this review provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of venetoclax-based regimens in CLL/SLL. However, further research is required to determine the best comparative regimen and the feasibility of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with CLL/SLL.",

Early phase clinical trials have shown a very high initial response rate confirmed by follow up and real-world studies. However, almost half of patients relapse with the available commercial product currently suggesting the need of a consolidative treatment after CAR T-cell infusion in well-defined cases, according to several pre- and post-CAR clinical and biological factors. This finding highlights that numerous challenges exist before the extension of CAR T-cell indications (first relapse and high-risk first line) in the field of B-ALL: to enhance persistence of CAR T-cells to avoid CD19-positive relapse and to avoid CD19-negative relapse by reducing tumor burden pre-CAR-T infusion and/or by multitargeting. Promising approaches with exciting early clinical data are emerging in the field of T-cell ALL. The use of CAR T-cells for acute myeloid leukemias remains challenging due to the lack of leukemia-specific antigens and to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.",

Here, we report on the efficacy and prognostic factors associated with porcine ATG and CsA with or without TPO-RA as first-line therapy in elderly patients with SAA. Porcine ATG was administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d for 5 days. CsA was administered orally, maintaining plasma trough concentrations of 150-250 microg/L. Eltrombopag was administered at a dose of 75-150 mg/day, and hetrombopag was administered orally at a dose of 15 mg/day. One hundred and twenty-eight SAA patients, with a median age of 63 (60-73) years old, were included in this study, including 44 very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) patients. All patients completed the porcine ATG treatment, and mild serum sicknesses were observed. Ten patients (2 SAA patients and 8 VSAA patients) died within 3 months of ATG initiation (early death), with severe infections being the main cause of death. Sixty-nine patients achieved a hematologic response at 6 months, with an overall response (OR) rate of 53.9%. The complete hematologic response (CR) rate at 6 months was 18.0%. The addition of TPO-RA to IST did not improve the OR and CR rates; nonetheless, early death was significantly lower (0%) in patients receiving TPO-RA compared to those not receiving TPO-RA (12%). Patients were followed up for a median of 28 (0.1-117) months. The OR rate at the last follow-up was 62.5%, while the CR rate was 36.7%. One patient progressed to myelodysplastic syndrome, one to leukemia, one to hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and five developed clonal chromosomal abnormalities.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the primary treatment for the vast majority of children with JMML. However, busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning regimens do not effectively solve the problem of low survival and high recurrence rates after transplantation. We previously achieved good results in the treatment of JMML with complementary transplantation and found that only one of the five patients who relapsed had umbilical cord blood (UCB) engraftment (blood 2019 134:4181). To further investigate the feasibility of UCB transplantation in JMML, we developed a novel regimen and performed a long-term follow-up analysis to evaluate its effectiveness and safety. In this multicenter, single-arm, retrospective clinical study, 17 children with JMML were treated with a novel regimen consisting of haploid immune cell infusion combined with UCB transplantation. After a median follow-up of 48 months, relapse was observed in 1 in 17 patients, with a cumulative relapse incidence rate of 6.7%. The 5-year overall and event-free survival rates were 87.4% and 82.4%, respectively. Among the included patients, seven experienced grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), including two patients with grade III-IV acute GVHD, resulting in cumulative incidence rates of 41.0% and 11.8%, respectively. Additionally, a total of two patients in the cohort developed chronic GVHD, and the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 5 years was 11.8%. Conclusion: Our results suggest that, combined with a suitable regimen, UCB transplantation may be an effective and safe option for the treatment of JMML.",

                    "abstract": "Old individuals are at a high risk of developing aplastic anemia, and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) based on anti-human T-lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA) is recommended for treating severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Adding the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) to IST could improve hematologic responses in patients with SAA; however, limited data exist for elder patients. Here, we report on the efficacy and prognostic factors associated with porcine ATG and CsA with or without TPO-RA as first-line therapy in elderly patients with SAA. Porcine ATG was administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/kg/d for 5 days. CsA was administered orally, maintaining plasma trough concentrations of 150-250 microg/L. Eltrombopag was administered at a dose of 75-150 mg/day, and hetrombopag was administered orally at a dose of 15 mg/day. One hundred and twenty-eight SAA patients, with a median age of 63 (60-73) years old, were included in this study, including 44 very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) patients. All patients completed the porcine ATG treatment, and mild serum sicknesses were observed. Ten patients (2 SAA patients and 8 VSAA patients) died within 3 months of ATG initiation (early death), with severe infections being the main cause of death. Sixty-nine patients achieved a hematologic response at 6 months, with an overall response (OR) rate of 53.9%. The complete hematologic response (CR) rate at 6 months was 18.0%. The addition of TPO-RA to IST did not improve the OR and CR rates; nonetheless, early death was significantly lower (0%) in patients receiving TPO-RA compared to those not receiving TPO-RA (12%). Patients were followed up for a median of 28 (0.1-117) months. The OR rate at the last follow-up was 62.5%, while the CR rate was 36.7%. One patient progressed to myelodysplastic syndrome, one to leukemia, one to hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and five developed clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The 2-year overall survival rate and failure-free survival rate were 86.0% (95% CI: 78.1-91.3%) and 70.5% (95% CI: 61.3-77.9%), respectively. A baseline neutrophil count of < 0.05 x 109/L was identified as an independent prognostic factor for early death. Age younger than 65 years, a baseline reticulocyte count of >= 7 x 109/L, and the absence of fever before and within 3 months following ATG treatment were independent predictors for hematologic response at 6 months. In conclusion, treatment with porcine ATG and CsA was safe and effective in elderly patients with SAA. An extremely low baseline neutrophil count indicated a high risk of early death.",

                    "abstract": "Background Patients with hematological malignancies (HMs), particularly those who have undergone bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), are at greater risk for morbidity and mortality due to immunosuppression. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these vulnerabilities in HM patients, although comprehensive data specifically on HSCT recipients are limited. Objective This study investigated the clinical and demographic profiles of HSCT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain. We also identified factors associated with in-hospital mortality in HSCT patients. Methods We conducted a nationwide, retrospective analysis using data from the Spanish National Health System. We included hospitalized patients with HMs and COVID-19 infection from 2020 to 2022. We used descriptive statistics, multivariate logistic regression, and survival analyses to assess predictors of mortality. Results In total, 35,648 patients with HMs were included, of whom 2,324 (6.5%) had undergone HSCT. The in-hospital mortality rate for HSCT recipients was 13%, lower than the 20% observed in non-HSCT patients. Older age, dementia, acute leukemia, and solid tumors were independently associated with increased mortality. In spite of their immunosuppressed state, HSCT recipients experienced relatively favorable outcomes, suggesting partial immune recovery following transplantation. Conclusions HSCT recipients with COVID-19 present different clinical characteristics and mortality risks than non-recipients. These findings indicate the need for specific management strategies for this vulnerable population. Further research is needed to explore immunological recovery and the transplant-specific factors that may influence COVID-19 outcomes.",

Patients with PNH are known to have an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We report a case of a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with AML 13 years after a diagnosis of PNH. Gene mutations associated with MDS were detected. She did not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine. Unrelated bone marrow transplantation was performed with a myeloablative conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (12 Gy). Ravulizumab was administered until 47 days after transplantation. She achieved CR after transplantation with complete donor engraftment. The transplantation was successful without severe complications such as graft-versus-host disease or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Further accumulation of cases is necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of anti-complement inhibitors in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",
