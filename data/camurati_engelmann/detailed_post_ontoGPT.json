A 26 year old female presented with a history of grinding pain in the limbs for over 20 years. Strong painkillers would temporally relieve the pain. She had an asthenic stature with generalised reduction in muscle bulk. Plain x-rays revealed the characteristic symmetrical thickening and sclerosis of the diaphyses of the appendicular skeleton and skull base, which is pathognomonic of Camurati-Engelmann's disease. Involvement of the metaphyses of these long bones as well as the metacarpal bones makes this an unusual case.",

OBJECTIVE: To describe presenting symptoms, evaluation findings, and surgical management of cranial base hyperostosis in patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). DESIGN: Retrospective study and literature review. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. PATIENTS: A total of 306 patients diagnosed as having CED, including 12 primarily evaluated at our institution between 1968 and 2008, and 294 identified in the international literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presenting symptoms, methods of diagnosis, treatment strategies, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three of 306 patients (56.5%) had radiographically proven skull base hyperostosis, whereas less than one-fourth were symptomatic. The most common manifestations of cranial base involvement were hearing loss (19.0%), headache (10.4%), exophthalmos (8.2%), and frontal bossing (7.2%); less common were vision changes, vertigo, facial weakness, symptomatic brainstem compression, facial numbness, and hyposmia. Although corticosteroids and bisphosphates may treat torso and extremity involvement, they demonstrate no benefit for symptomatic skull base disease. In select symptomatic patients, aggressive decompression surgery may provide the only means of treatment. Decompression surgery is more challenging with thick sclerotic bone, loss or obscuration of bony landmarks, and decreased supratentorial space. Patients must be counseled on the increased risks associated with surgery and the potential for redeposition of bone and recurrence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include CED in the differential diagnosis for patients with radiographic evidence of skull base thickening and synchronous cranial neuropathies or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. In mild forms of the disease, the clinical course of patients should be followed with serial examination, audiometric testing, and radiography. In select patients with progressive cranial base symptoms, aggressive wide decompression of involved neurovascular structures may provide benefit.",

RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three of 306 patients (56.5%) had radiographically proven skull base hyperostosis, whereas less than one-fourth were symptomatic. The most common manifestations of cranial base involvement were hearing loss (19.0%), headache (10.4%), exophthalmos (8.2%), and frontal bossing (7.2%); less common were vision changes, vertigo, facial weakness, symptomatic brainstem compression, facial numbness, and hyposmia. Although corticosteroids and bisphosphates may treat torso and extremity involvement, they demonstrate no benefit for symptomatic skull base disease. In select symptomatic patients, aggressive decompression surgery may provide the only means of treatment. Decompression surgery is more challenging with thick sclerotic bone, loss or obscuration of bony landmarks, and decreased supratentorial space. Patients must be counseled on the increased risks associated with surgery and the potential for redeposition of bone and recurrence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include CED in the differential diagnosis for patients with radiographic evidence of skull base thickening and synchronous cranial neuropathies or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. In mild forms of the disease, the clinical course of patients should be followed with serial examination, audiometric testing, and radiography. In select patients with progressive cranial base symptoms, aggressive wide decompression of involved neurovascular structures may provide benefit.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED; MIM 131300), or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare autosomal dominant bone disease, which is caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene on chromosome 19q13.1-13.3. Extremely variable penetrance has been reported to be associated with CED, the most common features of which are limb pain, waddling gait and muscle weakness. The present study reported on a consanguineous Chinese family with one affected individual that initially presented with exophthalmos, which has not previously been reported as an initial manifestation of CED. The proband was a 22-year-old woman that presented with progressive proptosis. Except for increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, no other biochemical abnormalities were detected. Whole-body radiological and bone scintigraphic investigations revealed that hyperostosis and sclerosis predominantly affected the cranial bones, including the skull base, and only mildly affected the long bones. A heterozygous mutation involving a G to A transition at the cDNA position +653 of TGFbeta1 was detected in the patient only, but not in her family members, by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI DNA sequencer (Model 377). Based on the clinical, biochemical, radiological and genetic findings, a diagnosis of CED was confirmed. Considering the phenotypic variability associated with CED and the unique manifestations of the patient described in the present study, CED should be taken into account regarding the differential diagnosis of exophthalmos.

The two patients experienced waddling gait, muscular weakness and growth developmental delay. X-ray radiography revealed typical fusiform thickening of the diaphyseal portions of the long bones. The abnormal uptake of tracer Tc-99m was visualized in the skull and both sides of the upper humeri, ulnas, radii, femurs and tibias using bone scintigraphy. Serum levels of the bone formation marker procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and the bone resorption marker beta-isomerized C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) in the 6-year-old patient were significantly increased compared with the normal value range, while only the beta-CTX levels were elevated in the 16-year-old patient. A heterozygous missense mutation p.Arg218Cys in exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene was detected in the two patients, while their parents had normal wild-type genotypes. In conclusion, the p.Arg218Cys mutation was shown to contribute to the clinical phenotypes in two pediatric patients with CED. The results of this study suggest that abnormal bone turnover marker levels, typical radiological findings and mutations in the TGFbeta1 gene are three important factors in the diagnosis of sporadic CED cases.",

OBJECTIVE: To describe presenting symptoms, evaluation findings, and surgical management of cranial base hyperostosis in patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). DESIGN: Retrospective study and literature review. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. PATIENTS: A total of 306 patients diagnosed as having CED, including 12 primarily evaluated at our institution between 1968 and 2008, and 294 identified in the international literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presenting symptoms, methods of diagnosis, treatment strategies, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three of 306 patients (56.5%) had radiographically proven skull base hyperostosis, whereas less than one-fourth were symptomatic. The most common manifestations of cranial base involvement were hearing loss (19.0%), headache (10.4%), exophthalmos (8.2%), and frontal bossing (7.2%); less common were vision changes, vertigo, facial weakness, symptomatic brainstem compression, facial numbness, and hyposmia. Although corticosteroids and bisphosphates may treat torso and extremity involvement, they demonstrate no benefit for symptomatic skull base disease. In select symptomatic patients, aggressive decompression surgery may provide the only means of treatment. Decompression surgery is more challenging with thick sclerotic bone, loss or obscuration of bony landmarks, and decreased supratentorial space. Patients must be counseled on the increased risks associated with surgery and the potential for redeposition of bone and recurrence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include CED in the differential diagnosis for patients with radiographic evidence of skull base thickening and synchronous cranial neuropathies or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. In mild forms of the disease, the clinical course of patients should be followed with serial examination, audiometric testing, and radiography. In select patients with progressive cranial base symptoms, aggressive wide decompression of involved neurovascular structures may provide benefit.",

Camurati-Engelmann (CE) is a very rare disease affecting one in every million persons worldwide. It is characterized by an enlargement of long bones. We aimed to assess bone characteristics in three siblings with different tools. Even if there was an excess of bone density, quality seemed to be deteriorated. INTRODUCTION: CE disease is a rare monogenic disorder affecting approximately one in every million persons worldwide. It is mainly characterized by a progressive hyperostosis of the periosteum and endosteum of the diaphysis of long bones. Limited data are available about bone characteristics in these patients. In three siblings with CE disease, we aimed to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and material characteristics at tissue level using bone impact reference point indentation. METHODS: Clinical data were collected and a general laboratory workup was performed. At the lumbar spine and hip, BMD and TBS were measured using DXA imaging. Bone material strength index (BMSi) was measured by bone impact microindentation using an Osteoprobe instrument. RESULTS: All three cases had densitometric values consistent with high bone mass (sum of Z-score at the lumbar spine and hip > 4). Hip BMD was extremely high in all three siblings at both total hip and femoral neck, while at the lumbar spine, two of them had normal values but the third again had very high BMD. TBS values were in the normal range. In contrast, BMSi measurements were at low or very low levels, compared with normal controls. CONCLUSION: Despite strikingly increased BMD and normal microarchitecture, BMSi is affected in patients with CE. Microindentation could be an appropriate tool for assessing bone fragility in these patients. Bone disease in this group of patients requires further study to better understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms and their alterations.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED; MIM 131300), or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare autosomal dominant bone disease, which is caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene on chromosome 19q13.1-13.3. Extremely variable penetrance has been reported to be associated with CED, the most common features of which are limb pain, waddling gait and muscle weakness. The present study reported on a consanguineous Chinese family with one affected individual that initially presented with exophthalmos, which has not previously been reported as an initial manifestation of CED. The proband was a 22-year-old woman that presented with progressive proptosis. Except for increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, no other biochemical abnormalities were detected. Whole-body radiological and bone scintigraphic investigations revealed that hyperostosis and sclerosis predominantly affected the cranial bones, including the skull base, and only mildly affected the long bones. A heterozygous mutation involving a G to A transition at the cDNA position +653 of TGFbeta1 was detected in the patient only, but not in her family members, by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI DNA sequencer (Model 377). Based on the clinical, biochemical, radiological and genetic findings, a diagnosis of CED was confirmed. Considering the phenotypic variability associated with CED and the unique manifestations of the patient described in the present study, CED should be taken into account regarding the differential diagnosis of exophthalmos.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CAEND) in Chinese individuals. METHODS: We recruited six patients aged 14 to 45 years in three unrelated families with CAEND, including five females and one male. Clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, and radiographic examinations were analyzed. The TGFB1 gene variants were further identified by Sanger sequencing. In addition, one female patient was followed up for 5 years. RESULTS: The onset age of the patients ranged from 1 to 6 years. All of them had family histories and consisted of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Gait disturbance, fatigue, progressive bone pain, muscle atrophy, and weakness were the main complaints. Laboratory examinations revealed that the inflammatory markers were at high levels, in addition to the increased bone metabolism indicators. The thickened diaphysis of long bones and the narrowed medullary cavity was observed by radiography. Furthermore, bone scintigraphy detected abnormal symmetrical radioactive concentrations in the affected regions of bone. Sanger sequencing identified a missense heterozygous variant in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene in families 1 and 2, resulting in Arg218Cys, which confirmed CAEND. Moreover, one novel variant c.669C > G in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene harboring Cys223Trp was detected in family 3. Subsequent bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant was pathogenic. Of interest, III:2 in family 3 experienced heart valve defects and tachycardia at birth, which had never been reported in CAEND patients before. Moreover, the response to drug treatment is also full of contradictions and is worthy of further study. CONCLUSION: Besides the typical CAEND manifestations, the new phenotypic characteristics of tachycardia and heart valve defects were first reported in one woman carrying the novel variant p.Cys223Trp in TGFB1 the gene. In addition, we demonstrated that increased bone metabolism indicators and inflammatory markers may possess auxiliary diagnosis for CAEND.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and major causative gene in pediatric patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). Biochemical and radiographic examinations, bone scintigraphy and genetic analyses were performed in two affected males and their parents. The two patients experienced waddling gait, muscular weakness and growth developmental delay. X-ray radiography revealed typical fusiform thickening of the diaphyseal portions of the long bones. The abnormal uptake of tracer Tc-99m was visualized in the skull and both sides of the upper humeri, ulnas, radii, femurs and tibias using bone scintigraphy. Serum levels of the bone formation marker procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and the bone resorption marker beta-isomerized C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) in the 6-year-old patient were significantly increased compared with the normal value range, while only the beta-CTX levels were elevated in the 16-year-old patient. A heterozygous missense mutation p.Arg218Cys in exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene was detected in the two patients, while their parents had normal wild-type genotypes. In conclusion, the p.Arg218Cys mutation was shown to contribute to the clinical phenotypes in two pediatric patients with CED. The results of this study suggest that abnormal bone turnover marker levels, typical radiological findings and mutations in the TGFbeta1 gene are three important factors in the diagnosis of sporadic CED cases.",

OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia as a result of mutations in the transforming growth factor gene TGFbeta1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS: Genetic analysis of the TGFbeta1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia, and menstrual irregularity. RESULTS: The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg/day, as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFbeta1 on the mechanism of the disease, and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands, remains unclear.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) in conjunction with hypogonadism, an association that has not been previously described. METHODS: We present the clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic features of our case. In addition, we review the molecular genetics of CED. RESULTS: CED is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of the skeleton, characterized by bilaterally symmetric, progressive dysplasia of the bones. The typical features of this disorder are hyperostotic and sclerotic changes in the bones, primarily of the extremities. Our patient, a 49-year-old male resident of a nursing home, presented with muscle weakness, waddling gait, bone pain, and increased fatigability, usual features of CED (which had been formally diagnosed when he was 8 years old). He also had hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and almost undetectable serum testosterone. The gene responsible for CED has been mapped to the same locus as the gene for the synthesis of transforming growth factor (TGF-b 1). Mutations in the TGF b 1 gene have been identified in patients with CED. TGF-b 1 also has an important role in reproductive function, both during embryogenesis and in adulthood. It has predominant effects on steroidogenesis as well as spermatogenesis. We discuss the hormonal and histopathologic changes in our patient and postulate that the association of CED with hypogonadism could be attributable to the impaired regulation of gonadal growth and steroidogenesis, in which TGF-b 1 has an important role. CONCLUSION: We propose that the association of CED with hypogonadism could be explained on the basis of a common underlying mutation in the TGF b 1 gene, leading to accumulation of excessive TGF-b 1.",

OBJECTIVE: A case report of a patient diagnosed with Camurati-Engelmann Disease (CED) in association with the functional hypothalamic amenorrhea disturbances. CED is a very rare genetically determined disorder classified as a type of bone dysplasia. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, 3rd grade Medical University Hospital. PATIENT: Twenty-one years old female patient with CED admitted to the hospital because of primary amenorrhea. Her history revealed skeletal deformities and hearing impairment. METHODS: Clinical examination, ultrasound, laboratory evaluations (including serum gonadotropins (FSH, LH) at basal state and after stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, serum basal estradiol) radiological studies (X-ray of the head, the lumbar spine and lower extremities; a computed tomography of the head), G-banding karyotype, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Hormonal serum evaluations were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction and the product was directly sequenced. RESULTS: The hormonal analysis was characteristic for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Radiological and molecular analyses confirmed CED diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic amenorrhea in a patient with CED may be explained as a consequence of fat hypotrophy and very low body mass index. Therefore, impairment within hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients with CED should be treated with special attention.",

Progressive sclerosis of cranial nerve foramina has been implicated in cranial nerve deficits. including facial nerve palsy, vestibular disturbances, and hearing loss. Two patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease and concomitant sensorineural hearing loss are presented. Both patients were evaluated for cochlear implantation. One patient was successfully implanted after preoperative imaging revealed no involvement of the internal auditory canals. The porous nature of the affected bone, however. necessitated the inactivation of 1 electrode to prevent facial nerve stimulation. A second patient was rejected as a potential implant recipient due, in part, to narrow internal auditory canals and rapidly progressive disease.

CASE: A 44-year-old woman presented with easy fatigability, diplopia, dizziness, and a 2-year history of pelvic, hip, and lower extremity aching and pain. Radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and histopathologic imaging studies were obtained. Hypersclerosis of the affected bones led to the initiation of a sclerotic bone dysplasia workup and sequencing of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene located on chromosome 19q13 revealed a heterozygous rare missense variant in exon-4, leading to a final diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). Medical treatment thus far has had a minimal effect on her symptoms, and the patient continues to be followed. CONCLUSIONS: This specific mutation has been reported only once previously in a patient with CED. This case report expands the typical phenotype associated with CED in association with the c.667T>C, p.Cys223Arg variant.",

Since conservative treatment with corticosteroids, calcitonin and diphosphonates is hardly successful and compression of the cranial nerves practically absent, surgical treatment with decompression should be considered. Differential diagnosis against other bone affections with deafness depends on age, typical x-ray findings, local distribution and clinical signs.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED, OMIM 131300), or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia, caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene. We describe the first Indian CED family with genetic confirmation and presenting manifestations. The proband is a 17-year-old woman who presented with lower limb pain and proximal muscle weakness. Skeletal radiographs of the long bones revealed cortical, periosteal, and endosteal thickenings, predominantly affecting the diaphyses of the long bones. On detailed evaluation, there was a strong family history of bone disorder with similar symptoms of pain and radiological findings in several family members. Exon sequencing of the TGFbeta1 gene was performed in available family members. Based on clinical and radiographic studies and its familial nature, a diagnosis of CED was made and confirmed by mutation analysis. A heterozygous G to A transition in exon 4 of the TGFbeta1 gene (R218H) was detected in 5 out of 10 available family members, including 4 affecteds and 1 asymptomatic individual. Many of our affected individuals responded to glucocorticoids and cortical windowing. CED is a rare genetic disease with variable clinical manifestations and incomplete penetrance. CED needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of nonspecific limb pain and waddling gait in all young individuals. ",

Characteristic symptoms of crippling pain in both legs, severe aching in both forearms, and episodic temporofrontal and occipital headache were only partially regulated by corticosteroid treatment. However, pregnancy resulted in a progressive disappearance of these symptoms, allowing withdrawal of steroid treatment. Tc-99m MDP scintigraphy performed immediately after delivery showed a decrease of the intense uptake in the forearms, tibiae, and skull, which had been documented prior to pregnancy. However, widespread pain recurred within 6 weeks after delivery, accompanied by a recurrence of multiple severely hyperactive foci on bone scintigraphy.

OBJECTIVE: To describe presenting symptoms, evaluation findings, and surgical management of cranial base hyperostosis in patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). DESIGN: Retrospective study and literature review. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. PATIENTS: A total of 306 patients diagnosed as having CED, including 12 primarily evaluated at our institution between 1968 and 2008, and 294 identified in the international literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presenting symptoms, methods of diagnosis, treatment strategies, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three of 306 patients (56.5%) had radiographically proven skull base hyperostosis, whereas less than one-fourth were symptomatic. The most common manifestations of cranial base involvement were hearing loss (19.0%), headache (10.4%), exophthalmos (8.2%), and frontal bossing (7.2%); less common were vision changes, vertigo, facial weakness, symptomatic brainstem compression, facial numbness, and hyposmia. Although corticosteroids and bisphosphates may treat torso and extremity involvement, they demonstrate no benefit for symptomatic skull base disease. In select symptomatic patients, aggressive decompression surgery may provide the only means of treatment. Decompression surgery is more challenging with thick sclerotic bone, loss or obscuration of bony landmarks, and decreased supratentorial space. Patients must be counseled on the increased risks associated with surgery and the potential for redeposition of bone and recurrence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include CED in the differential diagnosis for patients with radiographic evidence of skull base thickening and synchronous cranial neuropathies or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. In mild forms of the disease, the clinical course of patients should be followed with serial examination, audiometric testing, and radiography. In select patients with progressive cranial base symptoms, aggressive wide decompression of involved neurovascular structures may provide benefit.",

                    "text": "Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease: Technical Note. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a genetic bone-modeling disorder mainly caused by mutations in the gene that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Symptoms of CED include bone pain, fractures, and dysplasia. Currently, effective therapies for bone fracture and dysplasia in CED are urgently needed. We have demonstrated that TGF-beta1 is a coupling factor for bone remodeling and is aberrantly activated in CED. Daily injection of TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor (TbetaR1I) attenuated CED symptoms, but this systemic administration caused serious side effects. In this study, we created a conjugate linking TbetaR1I and alendronate, which delivered TbetaR1I specifically to bone. After weekly injection of the conjugate for 8 weeks, normal bone morphology and remodeling in CED mice was maintained with a minimum effective dose 700 times lower than TbetaR1I injection. Additionally, we found that the conjugate restored normal bone turnover by reducing the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, maintained a regular osteogenic microenvironment by regulating the formation of CD31 and Endomucin double-positive vessels, and preserved ordinary bone formation via inhibition of the migration of leptin-receptor-positive cells. Thus, targeting delivery of TbetaR1I to bone is a promising therapy for CED and other uncoupled bone remodeling disorders.",

Estimated number of patients with CAEND in Japan is approximately 50-60 by our epidemiological survey. We have reported that domain-specific mutations in transforming growth factor-beta1 gene(TGFB1) cause CAEND. Mutations in latency associated peptide(LAP) domain of TGF-beta1 destabilize the complex and may hyperactivate TGF signal pathway. We tried to establish CAEND model mice by gene-targeting, but could not because of spermatogenesis defects in chimera mice. We also failed using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Alternatively, we established CAEND patient-derived iPS cells, and are advancing research with them to develop novel therapeutic agents for CAEND.",

It is characterized by hyperostosis of the long bones and the skull, Clinically patient will have limb pain, proximal muscle weakness a wide-based gait. The gene causing CED is located on chromosome 19, this region contains the gene encoding the TGF Beta -1. The diagnosis of CED is established in a proband with the characteristic radiographic findings and molecular genetic testing for TGF Beta-1 mutation. Treatment is with corticosteroids and Losartan. MATERIALS: A 40 year old lady presented with complaints of Left lower limb pain for 1 year duration. On examination there was tenderness of left greater trochanter, proximal and distal femur was present. Blood investigations showed high PTH and low Vitamin-D3. Imaging showed non specific sclerotic lesions in femur. As patient brother had limp since childhood genetic disorders were and a provisional diagnosis of sclerotic bone disease probable Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia was considered. PET-CT was done which revealed abnormal osteoblastic activity in both femurs, focal hyperostosis in humeral diaphysis suggestive of CED. She was tested Positive for TGF beta 1 mutation consistent with CED. He was started on LOSARTAN. On follow up patient is pain free. RESULT: Her brother was also evaluated in view of his limp and he was also diagnosed as CED. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis in this case was based on the clinical history, family history and characteristic radiological findings and genetic testing which confirmed TGF Beta-1 mutation. Family history is crucial in this case which led to diagnosis. References Van Hul W, Boudin E, Vanhoenacker FM, et al. Camurati Engelmann disease. Calcif Tissue Int 2019;104(5):554-560.

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant type of bone dysplasia. This review is based on the unpublished and detailed clinical, radiological, and molecular findings in 14 CED families, comprising 41 patients, combined with data from 10 other previously reported CED families. For all 100 cases, molecular evidence for CED was available, as a mutation was detected in TGFB1, the gene encoding transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. Pain in the extremities was the most common clinical symptom, present in 68% of the patients. A waddling gait (48%), easy fatigability (44%), and muscle weakness (39%) were other important features. Radiological symptoms were not fully penetrant, with 94% of the patients showing the typical long bone involvement. A large percentage of the patients also showed involvement of the skull (54%) and pelvis (63%). The review provides an overview of possible treatments, diagnostic guidelines, and considerations for prenatal testing. The detailed description of such a large set of CED patients will be of value in establishing the correct diagnosis, genetic counselling, and treatment.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) [OMIM 131300] is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bone pain and osteosclerosis affecting the diaphysis of long bones. It has been previously reported that CED is caused by mutations of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta1) gene on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Until now, seven mutations (LLL12-13ins, Y81H, R156C, R218C, R218H, H222D, C225R) in Australian, French, Belgian, Japanese, and European families have been reported and these data showed that there was no correlation between the nature of the mutations and the variability of the clinical manifestations. In this study, we found a Chinese family with CED and observed some intra-familial clinical variability and symptoms that became more severe with the age. A new TGF beta1 mutation (E169K) in exon 2 was identified in the Chinese family using polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing analysis of PCR products and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. This mutation has not been previously reported in other countries in the world.",

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) in conjunction with hypogonadism, an association that has not been previously described. METHODS: We present the clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic features of our case. In addition, we review the molecular genetics of CED. RESULTS: CED is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of the skeleton, characterized by bilaterally symmetric, progressive dysplasia of the bones. The typical features of this disorder are hyperostotic and sclerotic changes in the bones, primarily of the extremities. Our patient, a 49-year-old male resident of a nursing home, presented with muscle weakness, waddling gait, bone pain, and increased fatigability, usual features of CED (which had been formally diagnosed when he was 8 years old). He also had hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and almost undetectable serum testosterone. The gene responsible for CED has been mapped to the same locus as the gene for the synthesis of transforming growth factor (TGF-b 1). Mutations in the TGF b 1 gene have been identified in patients with CED. TGF-b 1 also has an important role in reproductive function, both during embryogenesis and in adulthood. It has predominant effects on steroidogenesis as well as spermatogenesis. We discuss the hormonal and histopathologic changes in our patient and postulate that the association of CED with hypogonadism could be attributable to the impaired regulation of gonadal growth and steroidogenesis, in which TGF-b 1 has an important role. CONCLUSION: We propose that the association of CED with hypogonadism could be explained on the basis of a common underlying mutation in the TGF b 1 gene, leading to accumulation of excessive TGF-b 1.",

Since the generation of Tgfb1 knockout mice, there has been extraordinary progress in understanding its physiological and pathophysiological function. Here, we report the generation of a conditional knockout allele for Tgfb1 in which its exon 6 is flanked with LoxP sites. As proof of principle, we crossed these mice to LckCre transgenic mice and specifically disrupted Tgfb1 in T cells. The results indicate that T-cell-produced TGFbeta1 is required for normal in vivo regulation of peripheral T-cell activation, maintenance of T-cell homeostasis, and suppression of autoimmunity.",

BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CAEND) in Chinese individuals. METHODS: We recruited six patients aged 14 to 45 years in three unrelated families with CAEND, including five females and one male. Clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, and radiographic examinations were analyzed. The TGFB1 gene variants were further identified by Sanger sequencing. In addition, one female patient was followed up for 5 years. RESULTS: The onset age of the patients ranged from 1 to 6 years. All of them had family histories and consisted of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Gait disturbance, fatigue, progressive bone pain, muscle atrophy, and weakness were the main complaints. Laboratory examinations revealed that the inflammatory markers were at high levels, in addition to the increased bone metabolism indicators. The thickened diaphysis of long bones and the narrowed medullary cavity was observed by radiography. Furthermore, bone scintigraphy detected abnormal symmetrical radioactive concentrations in the affected regions of bone. Sanger sequencing identified a missense heterozygous variant in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene in families 1 and 2, resulting in Arg218Cys, which confirmed CAEND. Moreover, one novel variant c.669C > G in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene harboring Cys223Trp was detected in family 3. Subsequent bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant was pathogenic. Of interest, III:2 in family 3 experienced heart valve defects and tachycardia at birth, which had never been reported in CAEND patients before. Moreover, the response to drug treatment is also full of contradictions and is worthy of further study. CONCLUSION: Besides the typical CAEND manifestations, the new phenotypic characteristics of tachycardia and heart valve defects were first reported in one woman carrying the novel variant p.Cys223Trp in TGFB1 the gene. In addition, we demonstrated that increased bone metabolism indicators and inflammatory markers may possess auxiliary diagnosis for CAEND.",

Camurati-Engelmann (CE) is a very rare disease affecting one in every million persons worldwide. It is characterized by an enlargement of long bones. We aimed to assess bone characteristics in three siblings with different tools. Even if there was an excess of bone density, quality seemed to be deteriorated. INTRODUCTION: CE disease is a rare monogenic disorder affecting approximately one in every million persons worldwide. It is mainly characterized by a progressive hyperostosis of the periosteum and endosteum of the diaphysis of long bones. Limited data are available about bone characteristics in these patients. In three siblings with CE disease, we aimed to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and material characteristics at tissue level using bone impact reference point indentation. METHODS: Clinical data were collected and a general laboratory workup was performed. At the lumbar spine and hip, BMD and TBS were measured using DXA imaging. Bone material strength index (BMSi) was measured by bone impact microindentation using an Osteoprobe instrument. RESULTS: All three cases had densitometric values consistent with high bone mass (sum of Z-score at the lumbar spine and hip > 4). Hip BMD was extremely high in all three siblings at both total hip and femoral neck, while at the lumbar spine, two of them had normal values but the third again had very high BMD. TBS values were in the normal range. In contrast, BMSi measurements were at low or very low levels, compared with normal controls. CONCLUSION: Despite strikingly increased BMD and normal microarchitecture, BMSi is affected in patients with CE. Microindentation could be an appropriate tool for assessing bone fragility in these patients. Bone disease in this group of patients requires further study to better understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms and their alterations.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED, OMIM 131300), or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia, caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene. We describe the first Indian CED family with genetic confirmation and presenting manifestations. The proband is a 17-year-old woman who presented with lower limb pain and proximal muscle weakness. Skeletal radiographs of the long bones revealed cortical, periosteal, and endosteal thickenings, predominantly affecting the diaphyses of the long bones. On detailed evaluation, there was a strong family history of bone disorder with similar symptoms of pain and radiological findings in several family members. Exon sequencing of the TGFbeta1 gene was performed in available family members. Based on clinical and radiographic studies and its familial nature, a diagnosis of CED was made and confirmed by mutation analysis. A heterozygous G to A transition in exon 4 of the TGFbeta1 gene (R218H) was detected in 5 out of 10 available family members, including 4 affecteds and 1 asymptomatic individual. Many of our affected individuals responded to glucocorticoids and cortical windowing. CED is a rare genetic disease with variable clinical manifestations and incomplete penetrance. CED needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of nonspecific limb pain and waddling gait in all young individuals. ",

OBJECTIVE: A case report of a patient diagnosed with Camurati-Engelmann Disease (CED) in association with the functional hypothalamic amenorrhea disturbances. CED is a very rare genetically determined disorder classified as a type of bone dysplasia. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, 3rd grade Medical University Hospital. PATIENT: Twenty-one years old female patient with CED admitted to the hospital because of primary amenorrhea. Her history revealed skeletal deformities and hearing impairment. METHODS: Clinical examination, ultrasound, laboratory evaluations (including serum gonadotropins (FSH, LH) at basal state and after stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, serum basal estradiol) radiological studies (X-ray of the head, the lumbar spine and lower extremities; a computed tomography of the head), G-banding karyotype, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Hormonal serum evaluations were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction and the product was directly sequenced. RESULTS: The hormonal analysis was characteristic for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Radiological and molecular analyses confirmed CED diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic amenorrhea in a patient with CED may be explained as a consequence of fat hypotrophy and very low body mass index. Therefore, impairment within hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients with CED should be treated with special attention.",

OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive bone dysplasia due to mutations in the transforming factor gene TGFB1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the TGFB1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia and menstrual irregularity. The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg per day as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFB1 on the mechanism of the disease itself and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands remain unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is important for future treatment options and better quality of life of such patients.",

OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive bone dysplasia due to mutations in the transforming factor gene TGFB1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the TGFB1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia and menstrual irregularity. The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg per day as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFB1 on the mechanism of the disease itself and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands remain unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is important for future treatment options and better quality of life of such patients.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant type of bone dysplasia. This review is based on the unpublished and detailed clinical, radiological, and molecular findings in 14 CED families, comprising 41 patients, combined with data from 10 other previously reported CED families. For all 100 cases, molecular evidence for CED was available, as a mutation was detected in TGFB1, the gene encoding transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. Pain in the extremities was the most common clinical symptom, present in 68% of the patients. A waddling gait (48%), easy fatigability (44%), and muscle weakness (39%) were other important features. Radiological symptoms were not fully penetrant, with 94% of the patients showing the typical long bone involvement. A large percentage of the patients also showed involvement of the skull (54%) and pelvis (63%). The review provides an overview of possible treatments, diagnostic guidelines, and considerations for prenatal testing. The detailed description of such a large set of CED patients will be of value in establishing the correct diagnosis, genetic counselling, and treatment.",

Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD) (Camurati-Engelmann disease) is an autosomal dominant craniotubular dysplasia characterized by hyperostosis and sclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones and the skull. Mutations in transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) were recently found in patients with PDD. We report on a four-generation pedigree with seven individuals affected by PDD, linkage and mutational analysis results, and review the literature. This pedigree demonstrates the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, remarkable variation in expressivity, and reduced penetrance. The most severely affected individual had progression of mild skull hyperostosis to severe skull thickening and cranial nerve compression over 30 years. His carrier father remained asymptomatic into his ninth decade and had no radiographic hyperostosis or sclerosis of the bones. Symptomatic relatives presented with lower limb pain and weakness. They were initially diagnosed with a variety of other conditions. Two of the symptomatic individuals were treated successfully with prednisone. We genotyped 7 markers from chromosome region 19q13.1-13.3 in 15 relatives and confirmed linkage to this region in this family. We screened the TGFB1 gene for mutations and identified a missense mutation resulting in an R218H substitution in the affected individuals, the asymptomatic obligate carrier, and another unaffected relative. We genotyped the family for seven known TGFB1 polymorphisms and a novel TAAA tetranucleotide repeat in intron 1. These polymorphisms did not appear to account for the variability in disease severity in this family. Our review illustrates how the disorder can significantly compromise health. Cranial involvement, which occurs in 61% of patients, can be severe, entrapping cranial nerves or causing increased intracranial pressure. Therapy with corticosteroids should be attempted in all symptomatic patients.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED, OMIM 131300), or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia, caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene. We describe the first Indian CED family with genetic confirmation and presenting manifestations. The proband is a 17-year-old woman who presented with lower limb pain and proximal muscle weakness. Skeletal radiographs of the long bones revealed cortical, periosteal, and endosteal thickenings, predominantly affecting the diaphyses of the long bones. On detailed evaluation, there was a strong family history of bone disorder with similar symptoms of pain and radiological findings in several family members. Exon sequencing of the TGFbeta1 gene was performed in available family members. Based on clinical and radiographic studies and its familial nature, a diagnosis of CED was made and confirmed by mutation analysis. A heterozygous G to A transition in exon 4 of the TGFbeta1 gene (R218H) was detected in 5 out of 10 available family members, including 4 affecteds and 1 asymptomatic individual. Many of our affected individuals responded to glucocorticoids and cortical windowing. CED is a rare genetic disease with variable clinical manifestations and incomplete penetrance. CED needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of nonspecific limb pain and waddling gait in all young individuals. ",

Radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and histopathologic imaging studies were obtained. Hypersclerosis of the affected bones led to the initiation of a sclerotic bone dysplasia workup and sequencing of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene located on chromosome 19q13 revealed a heterozygous rare missense variant in exon-4, leading to a final diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED).

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal-dominant skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) gene. In this study, a retrospective review of patients with CED evaluated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, China, between November 30, 2000 and November 30, 2020 was conducted. Data including demographic data, manifestations, and examination results were characterized. Furthermore, bone geometry, density, and microarchitecture were assessed and bone strength was estimated by HR-pQCT. Results showed the median age at onset was 2.5 years. Common manifestations included pain in the lower limbs (94%, 17/18), abnormal gait (89%, 16/18), genu valgum (89%, 16/18), reduced subcutaneous fat (78%, 14/18), delayed puberty (73%, 8/11), muscle weakness (67%, 12/18), hearing loss (39%, 7/18), hepatosplenomegaly (39%, 7/18), exophthalmos or impaired vision or visual field defect (33%, 6/18), and anemia (33%, 7/18). Twenty-five percent (4/16) of patients had short stature. Serum level of alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 41% (7/17) of patients whereas beta-C-terminal telopeptide was elevated in 91% of patients (10/11). Among 12 patients, the Z-scores of two patients were greater than 2.5 at the femur neck and the Z-scores of five patients were lower than -2.5 at the femur neck and/or lumbar spine. HR-pQCT results showed lower volumetric BMD (vBMD), altered bone microstructure and lower estimated bone strength at the distal radius and tibia in patients with CED compared with controls. In addition, total volume bone mineral density and cortical volumetric bone mineral density at the radius were negatively correlated with age in patients with CED, but positively correlated with age in controls. In conclusion, the largest case series of CED with characterized clinical features in a Chinese population was reported here. In addition, HR-pQCT was used to investigate bone microstructure at the distal radius and tibia in nine patients with CED, and the alteration of bone density, microstructure, and strength was shown for the first time.   2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).",

Progressive sclerosis of cranial nerve foramina has been implicated in cranial nerve deficits. including facial nerve palsy, vestibular disturbances, and hearing loss. Two patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease and concomitant sensorineural hearing loss are presented. Both patients were evaluated for cochlear implantation. One patient was successfully implanted after preoperative imaging revealed no involvement of the internal auditory canals. The porous nature of the affected bone, however. necessitated the inactivation of 1 electrode to prevent facial nerve stimulation. A second patient was rejected as a potential implant recipient due, in part, to narrow internal auditory canals and rapidly progressive disease.

BACKGROUND: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare disorder, with approximately 250 described cases in the literature. Treatment options are limited and have been suboptimal so far. PATIENT AND METHODS: A prepubertal girl aged 9 years was diagnosed with CED. Treatment with losartan was initiated at a daily dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Over a period of 12 weeks, the dose was gradually increased to 1.0 mg/kg/d. The patient was reviewed in clinic regularly and underwent thorough clinical assessments 9, 17, and 38 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: The patient experienced marked clinical improvements with losartan. In particular, losartan treatment led to the complete elimination of the previously severe and incapacitating pain, with an increased ability to walk and perform physical activities. There was also a considerable improvement in body composition with increased lean and adipose tissue. Notably, the improvement in fat deposition had not been previously observed with other treatments in CED. Hematology, liver, and renal function tests were within normal ranges at presentation and remained so over the course of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In light of our findings, losartan may be a useful option in CED management.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bone pain and osteosclerosis affecting the diaphysis of long bones. CED is caused by various missense mutations in the TGFB1 gene that encodes TGFbeta1, the most common of which is an arginine-cysteine amino acid change at codon 218 (R218C) in the latency-associated peptide domain of TGFbeta1. We studied osteoclast formation in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from three related CED patients harboring the R218C mutation, in comparison with one family-based and several unrelated controls. Osteoclast formation was enhanced approximately 5-fold (P < 0.001) and bone resorption approximately 10-fold (P < 0.001) in CED patients, and the increase in osteoclast formation was inhibited by soluble TGFbeta type II receptor. Total serum TGFbeta1 levels were similar in affected and unaffected subjects, but concentrations of active TGFbeta1 in conditioned medium of osteoclast cultures was higher in the three CED patients than in the unaffected family member. We concluded that the R218C mutation increases TGFbeta1 bioactivity and enhances osteoclast formation in vitro. The activation of osteoclast activity noted here is consistent with clinical reports that have shown biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption as well as bone formation in CED.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bone pain and osteosclerosis affecting the diaphysis of long bones. CED is caused by various missense mutations in the TGFB1 gene that encodes TGFbeta1, the most common of which is an arginine-cysteine amino acid change at codon 218 (R218C) in the latency-associated peptide domain of TGFbeta1. We studied osteoclast formation in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from three related CED patients harboring the R218C mutation, in comparison with one family-based and several unrelated controls. Osteoclast formation was enhanced approximately 5-fold (P < 0.001) and bone resorption approximately 10-fold (P < 0.001) in CED patients, and the increase in osteoclast formation was inhibited by soluble TGFbeta type II receptor. Total serum TGFbeta1 levels were similar in affected and unaffected subjects, but concentrations of active TGFbeta1 in conditioned medium of osteoclast cultures was higher in the three CED patients than in the unaffected family member. We concluded that the R218C mutation increases TGFbeta1 bioactivity and enhances osteoclast formation in vitro. The activation of osteoclast activity noted here is consistent with clinical reports that have shown biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption as well as bone formation in CED.",

Symptoms of CED include bone pain, fractures, and dysplasia. Currently, effective therapies for bone fracture and dysplasia in CED are urgently needed.

After weekly injection of the conjugate for 8 weeks, normal bone morphology and remodeling in CED mice was maintained with a minimum effective dose 700 times lower than TbetaR1I injection. Additionally, we found that the conjugate restored normal bone turnover by reducing the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, maintained a regular osteogenic microenvironment by regulating the formation of CD31 and Endomucin double-positive vessels, and preserved ordinary bone formation via inhibition of the migration of leptin-receptor-positive cells.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CAEND) in Chinese individuals. METHODS: We recruited six patients aged 14 to 45 years in three unrelated families with CAEND, including five females and one male. Clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, and radiographic examinations were analyzed. The TGFB1 gene variants were further identified by Sanger sequencing. In addition, one female patient was followed up for 5 years. RESULTS: The onset age of the patients ranged from 1 to 6 years. All of them had family histories and consisted of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Gait disturbance, fatigue, progressive bone pain, muscle atrophy, and weakness were the main complaints. Laboratory examinations revealed that the inflammatory markers were at high levels, in addition to the increased bone metabolism indicators. The thickened diaphysis of long bones and the narrowed medullary cavity was observed by radiography. Furthermore, bone scintigraphy detected abnormal symmetrical radioactive concentrations in the affected regions of bone. Sanger sequencing identified a missense heterozygous variant in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene in families 1 and 2, resulting in Arg218Cys, which confirmed CAEND. Moreover, one novel variant c.669C > G in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene harboring Cys223Trp was detected in family 3. Subsequent bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant was pathogenic. Of interest, III:2 in family 3 experienced heart valve defects and tachycardia at birth, which had never been reported in CAEND patients before. Moreover, the response to drug treatment is also full of contradictions and is worthy of further study. CONCLUSION: Besides the typical CAEND manifestations, the new phenotypic characteristics of tachycardia and heart valve defects were first reported in one woman carrying the novel variant p.Cys223Trp in TGFB1 the gene. In addition, we demonstrated that increased bone metabolism indicators and inflammatory markers may possess auxiliary diagnosis for CAEND.",

Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD) (Camurati-Engelmann disease) is an autosomal dominant craniotubular dysplasia characterized by hyperostosis and sclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones and the skull. Mutations in transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) were recently found in patients with PDD. We report on a four-generation pedigree with seven individuals affected by PDD, linkage and mutational analysis results, and review the literature. This pedigree demonstrates the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, remarkable variation in expressivity, and reduced penetrance. The most severely affected individual had progression of mild skull hyperostosis to severe skull thickening and cranial nerve compression over 30 years. His carrier father remained asymptomatic into his ninth decade and had no radiographic hyperostosis or sclerosis of the bones. Symptomatic relatives presented with lower limb pain and weakness. They were initially diagnosed with a variety of other conditions. Two of the symptomatic individuals were treated successfully with prednisone. We genotyped 7 markers from chromosome region 19q13.1-13.3 in 15 relatives and confirmed linkage to this region in this family. We screened the TGFB1 gene for mutations and identified a missense mutation resulting in an R218H substitution in the affected individuals, the asymptomatic obligate carrier, and another unaffected relative. We genotyped the family for seven known TGFB1 polymorphisms and a novel TAAA tetranucleotide repeat in intron 1. These polymorphisms did not appear to account for the variability in disease severity in this family. Our review illustrates how the disorder can significantly compromise health. Cranial involvement, which occurs in 61% of patients, can be severe, entrapping cranial nerves or causing increased intracranial pressure. Therapy with corticosteroids should be attempted in all symptomatic patients.",

Radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and histopathologic imaging studies were obtained. Hypersclerosis of the affected bones led to the initiation of a sclerotic bone dysplasia workup and sequencing of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene located on chromosome 19q13 revealed a heterozygous rare missense variant in exon-4, leading to a final diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). Medical treatment thus far has had a minimal effect on her symptoms, and the patient continues to be followed.

BACKGROUND: Camurati-Engelmann disease is an extremely rare disease characterized by hyperostosis of multiple long bones. This condition is caused by heterozygous mutations in the TGFB1 gene. METHODS: We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 4 Korean patients with this rare disease diagnosed at Asan Medical Center in Korea between June 2012 and May 2016, to increase awareness about this condition among general physicians and orthopedists. The presenting features, biochemical findings, radiographic and nuclear imaging findings, molecular analysis, and treatment outcomes of 4 patients were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two patients had sporadic disease, whereas the other 2 were familial cases. The average age at symptom onset was 8.8 +- 5.5 (4-14) years. Symptoms included waddling gait or leg pain. Bone pain and easy fatigability were documented in all patients. Skeletal deformities such as osteoporosis, genu valgum, and severe scoliosis were observed. Visual and otologic manifestations presenting as exophthalmos, retinal detachment, and vestibulopathy were found in 3 patients. Skeletal survey showed diaphyseal expansion with diffuse cortical thickening of long bones in all patients. Bone scintigraphy images showed increased uptake of radioactive material in the calvarium and diaphysis of long bones. The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 46.5 +- 22.2 (20-72) mm/h. Sequence analysis of TGFB1 revealed the previously reported mutations p.Arg218His, p.Arg218Cys, and p.Glu169Lys. Corticosteroid was effective in relieving pain, and losartan was used as maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that this rare condition can be suspected in patients with characteristic symptoms and skeletal findings. Considering the presence of effective medical treatment, efforts are needed to identify more cases.",

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and radiographs of type I CED patients with special reference to the mode of presentation, process of diagnostic work-up, and disease course.

Group II had 3 patients who mainly presented with limb pain at age 15, 20, and 54 years, respectively. Radiographic evaluation and molecular genetic test led to the diagnosis of CED.

For all 100 cases, molecular evidence for CED was available, as a mutation was detected in TGFB1, the gene encoding transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. Pain in the extremities was the most common clinical symptom, present in 68% of the patients. A waddling gait (48%), easy fatigability (44%), and muscle weakness (39%) were other important features. Radiological symptoms were not fully penetrant, with 94% of the patients showing the typical long bone involvement. A large percentage of the patients also showed involvement of the skull (54%) and pelvis (63%). The review provides an overview of possible treatments, diagnostic guidelines, and considerations for prenatal testing. The detailed description of such a large set of CED patients will be of value in establishing the correct diagnosis, genetic counselling, and treatment.",

                    "text": "Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease: Technical Note. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis.",

OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann's disease, also known as progressive diaphysial dysplasia, is a disorder of the bone metabolism. Neurological manifestations of progressive diaphysial dysplasia include cranial nerve dysfunction, generalized weakness, cerebellar herniation, and increased intracranial pressure. In the past, surgical intervention has been of limited and temporary benefit. We present two patients with cranial hyperostosis secondary to Camurati-Engelmann's disease who were treated successfully with a single surgery involving a combination of multiple craniotomies for cranial vault decompression. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two patients presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure secondary to Camurati-Engelmann's syndrome. Radiological workup revealed marked cranial hyperostosis. INTERVENTION: The patients underwent aggressive cranial vault decompression. Multiple craniotomies were performed, and the inner table was then drilled down until the bone was 1 cm thick. CONCLUSION: Effective surgical options are needed for clinically significant cranial hyperostosis. In an effort to further define operative management in these patients, we describe a single, aggressive surgical procedure that may be used for successful cranial decompression.",

We report the first Korean family with an affected mother and son who were diagnosed with CED. The proband is a 19-yr-old male with a history of abnormal gait since the age of 2. He also suffered from proximal muscle weakness, pain in the extremities, and easy fatigability. Skeletal radiographs of the long bones revealed cortical, periosteal, and endosteal thickenings, predominantly affecting the diaphyses of the upper and lower extremities. No other bony abnormalities were noted in the skull and spine and no remarkable findings were seen on laboratory tests. The patient's mother had a long-standing history of mild limb pain. Under the impression of CED on radiographic studies, we performed mutation analysis.

Radiographs of the long bones of a 9-year-old boy presenting with waddling gait, muscular weakness, underweight, and severe skeletal pain showed symmetric diaphyseal cortical thickening pathognomonic for CED. The diagnosis was verified by detecting a mutation in exon 4 of the TGF-beta1 gene. Full body bone mineral densitometry studies performed before treatment with prednisolone were indicative for osteoporosis (Z-scores for the lumbar spine and femoral neck -2.3 and -3.2, respectively). A transiliac bone biopsy showed markedly reduced trabecular bone volume. Oral prednisolone was initiated, and subsequently, pamidronate infusions were commenced in an attempt to prevent progression of osteoporosis.

During the study, we encountered two unrelated girls, aged 17 and 11 years, who had clinical manifestations of the disorder, such as marfanoid habitus, waddling gait, muscular weakness, intense leg pain, flexion contracture of the hip and knee joints, delayed sexual development, increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Radiographic studies in the two girls demonstrated not only diaphyseal dysplasia (cortical thickening of the diaphyses) resembling that of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia but also metaphyseal expansion of the long bones, coarse and thick trabeculae of the long and short tubular bones, striations in the spinal, pelvic, and long bones, and cranial sclerosis restricted to the petromastoid regions. These radiographic changes were overall identical with those seen in hyperostosis generalisata with striations of the bones rather than those in progressive diaphyseal dysplasia. Polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing of all exons and their flanking regions of TGFB1 did not detect any mutations. PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the TGF-beta type 1 receptor gene (TGFBR1) did not demonstrate any aberrant DNA fragments. We concluded from these findings that the two girls we described belong to a unique entity distinct from either of the two disorders.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) [OMIM 131300] is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bone pain and osteosclerosis affecting the diaphysis of long bones. It has been previously reported that CED is caused by mutations of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta1) gene on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Until now, seven mutations (LLL12-13ins, Y81H, R156C, R218C, R218H, H222D, C225R) in Australian, French, Belgian, Japanese, and European families have been reported and these data showed that there was no correlation between the nature of the mutations and the variability of the clinical manifestations. In this study, we found a Chinese family with CED and observed some intra-familial clinical variability and symptoms that became more severe with the age. A new TGF beta1 mutation (E169K) in exon 2 was identified in the Chinese family using polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing analysis of PCR products and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. This mutation has not been previously reported in other countries in the world.",

OBJECTIVE: A case report of a patient diagnosed with Camurati-Engelmann Disease (CED) in association with the functional hypothalamic amenorrhea disturbances. CED is a very rare genetically determined disorder classified as a type of bone dysplasia. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, 3rd grade Medical University Hospital. PATIENT: Twenty-one years old female patient with CED admitted to the hospital because of primary amenorrhea. Her history revealed skeletal deformities and hearing impairment. METHODS: Clinical examination, ultrasound, laboratory evaluations (including serum gonadotropins (FSH, LH) at basal state and after stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, serum basal estradiol) radiological studies (X-ray of the head, the lumbar spine and lower extremities; a computed tomography of the head), G-banding karyotype, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Hormonal serum evaluations were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction and the product was directly sequenced. RESULTS: The hormonal analysis was characteristic for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Radiological and molecular analyses confirmed CED diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic amenorrhea in a patient with CED may be explained as a consequence of fat hypotrophy and very low body mass index. Therefore, impairment within hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients with CED should be treated with special attention.",

We recently found mutations of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) gene (TGFB1) in 9 families, in which progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease) is segregating [Kinoshita et al., 2000: Nat Genetics 26:19-20]. During the study, we encountered two unrelated girls, aged 17 and 11 years, who had clinical manifestations of the disorder, such as marfanoid habitus, waddling gait, muscular weakness, intense leg pain, flexion contracture of the hip and knee joints, delayed sexual development, increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Radiographic studies in the two girls demonstrated not only diaphyseal dysplasia (cortical thickening of the diaphyses) resembling that of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia but also metaphyseal expansion of the long bones, coarse and thick trabeculae of the long and short tubular bones, striations in the spinal, pelvic, and long bones, and cranial sclerosis restricted to the petromastoid regions. These radiographic changes were overall identical with those seen in hyperostosis generalisata with striations of the bones rather than those in progressive diaphyseal dysplasia. Polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing of all exons and their flanking regions of TGFB1 did not detect any mutations. PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the TGF-beta type 1 receptor gene (TGFBR1) did not demonstrate any aberrant DNA fragments. We concluded from these findings that the two girls we described belong to a unique entity distinct from either of the two disorders.",

                    "text": "Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease: Technical Note. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis.",

OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive bone dysplasia due to mutations in the transforming factor gene TGFB1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the TGFB1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia and menstrual irregularity. The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg per day as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFB1 on the mechanism of the disease itself and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands remain unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is important for future treatment options and better quality of life of such patients.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant type of bone dysplasia. This review is based on the unpublished and detailed clinical, radiological, and molecular findings in 14 CED families, comprising 41 patients, combined with data from 10 other previously reported CED families. For all 100 cases, molecular evidence for CED was available, as a mutation was detected in TGFB1, the gene encoding transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. Pain in the extremities was the most common clinical symptom, present in 68% of the patients. A waddling gait (48%), easy fatigability (44%), and muscle weakness (39%) were other important features. Radiological symptoms were not fully penetrant, with 94% of the patients showing the typical long bone involvement. A large percentage of the patients also showed involvement of the skull (54%) and pelvis (63%). The review provides an overview of possible treatments, diagnostic guidelines, and considerations for prenatal testing. The detailed description of such a large set of CED patients will be of value in establishing the correct diagnosis, genetic counselling, and treatment.",

Progressive sclerosis of cranial nerve foramina has been implicated in cranial nerve deficits. including facial nerve palsy, vestibular disturbances, and hearing loss. Two patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease and concomitant sensorineural hearing loss are presented. Both patients were evaluated for cochlear implantation. One patient was successfully implanted after preoperative imaging revealed no involvement of the internal auditory canals. The porous nature of the affected bone, however. necessitated the inactivation of 1 electrode to prevent facial nerve stimulation. A second patient was rejected as a potential implant recipient due, in part, to narrow internal auditory canals and rapidly progressive disease.

                    "text": "Significant Improvement After Surgery for a Symptomatic Osteoblastoma in a Patient with Camurati-Engelmann Disease: Case Report and Literature Review. Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia characterized as diaphyseal hyperostosis and sclerosis of the long bones. Corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, and losartan have been reported to be effective systemic medications used to reduce CED symptoms. There are no reports of osteoblastoma in patients with CED, and osteoblastoma in the distal radius is rare. We present a patient diagnosed with CED, based on radiological and histological examinations, at 11 years old. At 22 years old, she experienced severe pain in her right forearm and was treated with bisphosphonate, losartan, and prednisolone; however, the pain continued. An expansive and sclerotic lesion at the distal radius was observed on radiography. A follow-up plain radiograph indicated that the lesion was growing. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed solitary, intense radiotracer uptake, and a biopsy and surgical resection were performed due to suspected malignancy. Pathologic analysis showed anastomosing bony trabeculae rimmed by osteoblasts observed in a loose fibrovascular stroma. The lesion was diagnosed as an osteoblastoma. Following bone excision and artificial bone grafting, the patient's severe pain almost completely disappeared. At final follow-up, no evidence of osteoblastoma recurrence was noted. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of osteoblastoma arising in a patient with CED. Bone excision and artificial bone grafting may be a treatment option for local symptomatic osteoblastoma in patients with CED.",

                    "text": "Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease: Technical Note. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis.",

CASE: A 44-year-old woman presented with easy fatigability, diplopia, dizziness, and a 2-year history of pelvic, hip, and lower extremity aching and pain. Radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and histopathologic imaging studies were obtained. Hypersclerosis of the affected bones led to the initiation of a sclerotic bone dysplasia workup and sequencing of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene located on chromosome 19q13 revealed a heterozygous rare missense variant in exon-4, leading to a final diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). Medical treatment thus far has had a minimal effect on her symptoms, and the patient continues to be followed. CONCLUSIONS: This specific mutation has been reported only once previously in a patient with CED.

Hyperphosphatasia is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a generalized skeletal disease and increased alkaline phosphatase. Increased bone remodeling secondary to increased osteoclastic activity appears to be the underlying feature of these disorders. These disorders include juvenile Paget's disease, expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia, hyperostosis generalisata with striations, and Camurati-Engelmann's disease, type II. The genetic mutations for a number of these disorders have been identified. We present a patient with congenital hyperphosphatasia whose clinical and radiographic features were somewhat different from these other well-defined syndromes. The patient was followed for 45 years until his death of at age 49. The patient had massive osteoectasia with dense striations involving the entire shaft of his long bones. His spine, pelvis, short tubular bones, and calvarium were also involved. He suffered hearing loss and optic atrophy, but he kept his teeth throughout his life. He was tall with a marfanoid habitus, and he had hypogonadism and hypothyroidism. There was no evidence of mental retardation, and other laboratory studies where within normal limits. This case, as well as other manifestations of hyperphosphatasia, attests to the complexity of the bone remodeling system.",

BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CAEND) in Chinese individuals. METHODS: We recruited six patients aged 14 to 45 years in three unrelated families with CAEND, including five females and one male. Clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, and radiographic examinations were analyzed. The TGFB1 gene variants were further identified by Sanger sequencing. In addition, one female patient was followed up for 5 years. RESULTS: The onset age of the patients ranged from 1 to 6 years. All of them had family histories and consisted of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Gait disturbance, fatigue, progressive bone pain, muscle atrophy, and weakness were the main complaints. Laboratory examinations revealed that the inflammatory markers were at high levels, in addition to the increased bone metabolism indicators. The thickened diaphysis of long bones and the narrowed medullary cavity was observed by radiography. Furthermore, bone scintigraphy detected abnormal symmetrical radioactive concentrations in the affected regions of bone. Sanger sequencing identified a missense heterozygous variant in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene in families 1 and 2, resulting in Arg218Cys, which confirmed CAEND. Moreover, one novel variant c.669C > G in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene harboring Cys223Trp was detected in family 3. Subsequent bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant was pathogenic. Of interest, III:2 in family 3 experienced heart valve defects and tachycardia at birth, which had never been reported in CAEND patients before. Moreover, the response to drug treatment is also full of contradictions and is worthy of further study. CONCLUSION: Besides the typical CAEND manifestations, the new phenotypic characteristics of tachycardia and heart valve defects were first reported in one woman carrying the novel variant p.Cys223Trp in TGFB1 the gene. In addition, we demonstrated that increased bone metabolism indicators and inflammatory markers may possess auxiliary diagnosis for CAEND.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and major causative gene in pediatric patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). Biochemical and radiographic examinations, bone scintigraphy and genetic analyses were performed in two affected males and their parents. The two patients experienced waddling gait, muscular weakness and growth developmental delay. X-ray radiography revealed typical fusiform thickening of the diaphyseal portions of the long bones. The abnormal uptake of tracer Tc-99m was visualized in the skull and both sides of the upper humeri, ulnas, radii, femurs and tibias using bone scintigraphy. Serum levels of the bone formation marker procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and the bone resorption marker beta-isomerized C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) in the 6-year-old patient were significantly increased compared with the normal value range, while only the beta-CTX levels were elevated in the 16-year-old patient. A heterozygous missense mutation p.Arg218Cys in exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene was detected in the two patients, while their parents had normal wild-type genotypes. In conclusion, the p.Arg218Cys mutation was shown to contribute to the clinical phenotypes in two pediatric patients with CED. The results of this study suggest that abnormal bone turnover marker levels, typical radiological findings and mutations in the TGFbeta1 gene are three important factors in the diagnosis of sporadic CED cases.",

A 40-year-old white man with a 3-year history of mild to severe right thigh and knee pain was referred for radiographic investigation. Radiographs show a fusiform, bilaterally symmetrical enlargement of the diaphyses and metaphyses of the long bones (femur, tibia, fibula, radius and ulna). A narrowed medullary cavity is illustrated on CT scan of the femur. All bones show periosteal and endosteal bone formation. There is no history of familial involvement, trauma, infection or systemic illness. Blood chemistry could not point out any abnormality. Radiographic findings and clinical history suggest the diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease, also known as progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD). This case is of interest because of its rare metaphyseal involvement, mild form and sporadic presentation.",

They did not have dysmorphic features or abnormal gaits. Radiographic studies of the mother revealed diaphyseal sclerosis of the tibia and spondylosis of the thoracal and lumbar vertebrae.

We report on a 46-year-old mother of Moroccan origin, suffering mainly from painful, swollen legs, and her 26-year-old son who had experienced intense pain in his legs, without fever, for approximately 3 years. They did not have dysmorphic features or abnormal gaits. Radiographic studies of the mother revealed diaphyseal sclerosis of the tibia and spondylosis of the thoracal and lumbar vertebrae. The son had sclerosis of the diaphyses of the metacarpalia of the left hand, the femur and the fibula. The other parts of the skeleton were normal. Several osteosclerotic/hyperostotic disorders, such as melorheostosis (present mostly in sporadic cases and affecting lower extremities) and van Buchem's disease (autosomal recessive and commonly affecting the mandible) were considered as a diagnosis in the proposita. However, similar symptoms in the son of the proposita suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This brought us to the diagnosis of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD) or Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by limb pain, reduced muscle mass, weakness, a waddling gait, progressive periosteal and endosteal sclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones and sclerosis of the skull base. Mutations in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 gene on chromosome 19q13.1 have been reported to cause this disorder. The diagnosis of PDD/CED in this family was confirmed at the molecular level by detection of a C-to-T transition at position 466, leading to an arginine-to-cysteine amino acid change (position 156) in exon 2 of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) gene.",

PATIENT: Twenty-one years old female patient with CED admitted to the hospital because of primary amenorrhea. Her history revealed skeletal deformities and hearing impairment. METHODS: Clinical examination, ultrasound, laboratory evaluations (including serum gonadotropins (FSH, LH) at basal state and after stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, serum basal estradiol) radiological studies (X-ray of the head, the lumbar spine and lower extremities; a computed tomography of the head), G-banding karyotype, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Hormonal serum evaluations were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction and the product was directly sequenced. RESULTS: The hormonal analysis was characteristic for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Radiological and molecular analyses confirmed CED diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic amenorrhea in a patient with CED may be explained as a consequence of fat hypotrophy and very low body mass index. Therefore, impairment within hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients with CED should be treated with special attention.",

He suffered leg pain and weakness since childhood and reportedly grew until his late 20s, reaching 7 feet in height. He had deafness, perforated nasal septum, torus palatinus, disproportionately long limbs with knock-knees, low muscle mass, and pseudoclubbing. Radiographs revealed generalized skeletal abnormalities, including wide bones and cortical and trabecular bone thickening in keeping with CED, except that long bone ends were also affected. Lumbar spine and hip BMD Z-scores were + 7.7 and + 4.4, respectively. Biochemical markers of bone turnover were elevated. Hypocalciuria accompanied low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels. Pituitary hypogonadism and low serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 were present. Karyotype was normal. Despite vitamin D repletion, iliac crest histology revealed severe osteomalacia.

Both individuals were heterozygous for a novel 12-bp duplication (c.27_38dup, p.L10_L13dup) in exon 1 of TGFbeta1, predicting four additional leucine residues in the latency-associated-peptide segment of TGFbeta1, consistent with CED. The son was also homozygous for a single base transversion in TNFSF11, predicting a nonconservative amino acid change (c.107C > G, p.Pro36Arg) in the intracellular domain of RANKL that was heterozygous in his nonconsanguineous parents. This TNFSF11 variant was not found in the SNP Database, nor in published TNFSF11 association studies, but it occurred in four of the 134 TNFSF11 alleles (3.0%) we tested randomly among individuals without CED.

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare sclerosing bone disorder in humans with autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the gene (TGFB1) that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are causative for CED. TGF-beta1 signaling is enhanced by the CED-causing mutations. In this study, we performed Tgfb1 mutation screening in an ENU-mutagenized mouse genomic DNA library. We identified a missense mutation in which cysteine was substituted by serine at position 225 (p.C225S), that corresponded to the CED-causing mutation (p.C225R). TGF-beta1 mutant protein carrying p.C225S was secreted normally into the extracellular space. Reporter gene assays showed that the p.C225S mutants enhanced TGF-beta signaling at the same level as p.C225R mutants. We generated p.C225S homozygous mice and confirmed that the mature TGF-beta1 levels in the culture supernatants of the calvarial cells from the homozygotes were significantly higher than those from wild-type mice. Although the skull and femur are sclerotic in CED, these phenotypes were not observed in p.C225S homozygous mice. These results suggest that human and mouse bone tissue react differently to TGF-beta1. These findings are useful to pharmacological studies using mouse models in developing drugs that will target TGF-beta signaling.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal-dominant skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) gene. In this study, a retrospective review of patients with CED evaluated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, China, between November 30, 2000 and November 30, 2020 was conducted. Data including demographic data, manifestations, and examination results were characterized. Furthermore, bone geometry, density, and microarchitecture were assessed and bone strength was estimated by HR-pQCT. Results showed the median age at onset was 2.5 years. Common manifestations included pain in the lower limbs (94%, 17/18), abnormal gait (89%, 16/18), genu valgum (89%, 16/18), reduced subcutaneous fat (78%, 14/18), delayed puberty (73%, 8/11), muscle weakness (67%, 12/18), hearing loss (39%, 7/18), hepatosplenomegaly (39%, 7/18), exophthalmos or impaired vision or visual field defect (33%, 6/18), and anemia (33%, 7/18). Twenty-five percent (4/16) of patients had short stature. Serum level of alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 41% (7/17) of patients whereas beta-C-terminal telopeptide was elevated in 91% of patients (10/11). Among 12 patients, the Z-scores of two patients were greater than 2.5 at the femur neck and the Z-scores of five patients were lower than -2.5 at the femur neck and/or lumbar spine. HR-pQCT results showed lower volumetric BMD (vBMD), altered bone microstructure and lower estimated bone strength at the distal radius and tibia in patients with CED compared with controls. In addition, total volume bone mineral density and cortical volumetric bone mineral density at the radius were negatively correlated with age in patients with CED, but positively correlated with age in controls. In conclusion, the largest case series of CED with characterized clinical features in a Chinese population was reported here. In addition, HR-pQCT was used to investigate bone microstructure at the distal radius and tibia in nine patients with CED, and the alteration of bone density, microstructure, and strength was shown for the first time.   2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).",

                    "text": "Orthopedic Manifestations of Type I Camurati-Engelmann Disease. BACKGROUND: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare genetic skeletal disorder characterized by limb pain, muscle emaciation and weakness, and cortical thickening of the diaphysis of long bones. It is caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) (type I) or other unknown gene(s) (type II). We present 8 consecutive patients with type I CED. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and radiographs of type I CED patients with special reference to the mode of presentation, process of diagnostic work-up, and disease course. They were 4 sporadic patients, and two pairs of mother and son. RESULTS: We categorized the mode of presentation into three groups. Group I had 4 patients who mainly presented with motor disturbances in young age. They drew medical attention for waddling gait, awkward ambulation or running, difficulty in going upstairs, or a positive Gower's sign at age 4 to 6 years. Subsequent development of limb pain and radiographic abnormality led to the diagnosis of CED at age 6 to 29 years. Group II had 3 patients who mainly presented with limb pain at age 15, 20, and 54 years, respectively. Radiographic evaluation and molecular genetic test led to the diagnosis of CED. The remaining 1 patient (group III) was asymptomatic until age 9 years when bony lesions at the tibiae were found incidentally. For the last 10 years, he intermittently complained of leg pain in the morning or after sports activities, which did not interfere with daily life. All the patients in group I showed a body mass index in the underweight range (< 18.4 kg/m2). At the latest follow-up, 4 patients in groups I and II required medication for the limb pain. CONCLUSIONS: CED presents with a wide range of severity. Awareness of this rare disease entity may be the key to timely correct diagnosis. This disease entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of limb pain or motor disturbance in children to avoid unnecessary diagnostic work-up.",

BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CAEND) in Chinese individuals. METHODS: We recruited six patients aged 14 to 45 years in three unrelated families with CAEND, including five females and one male. Clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, and radiographic examinations were analyzed. The TGFB1 gene variants were further identified by Sanger sequencing. In addition, one female patient was followed up for 5 years. RESULTS: The onset age of the patients ranged from 1 to 6 years. All of them had family histories and consisted of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Gait disturbance, fatigue, progressive bone pain, muscle atrophy, and weakness were the main complaints. Laboratory examinations revealed that the inflammatory markers were at high levels, in addition to the increased bone metabolism indicators. The thickened diaphysis of long bones and the narrowed medullary cavity was observed by radiography. Furthermore, bone scintigraphy detected abnormal symmetrical radioactive concentrations in the affected regions of bone. Sanger sequencing identified a missense heterozygous variant in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene in families 1 and 2, resulting in Arg218Cys, which confirmed CAEND. Moreover, one novel variant c.669C > G in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene harboring Cys223Trp was detected in family 3. Subsequent bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant was pathogenic. Of interest, III:2 in family 3 experienced heart valve defects and tachycardia at birth, which had never been reported in CAEND patients before. Moreover, the response to drug treatment is also full of contradictions and is worthy of further study. CONCLUSION: Besides the typical CAEND manifestations, the new phenotypic characteristics of tachycardia and heart valve defects were first reported in one woman carrying the novel variant p.Cys223Trp in TGFB1 the gene. In addition, we demonstrated that increased bone metabolism indicators and inflammatory markers may possess auxiliary diagnosis for CAEND.",

Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD) (Camurati-Engelmann disease) is an autosomal dominant craniotubular dysplasia characterized by hyperostosis and sclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones and the skull. Mutations in transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) were recently found in patients with PDD. We report on a four-generation pedigree with seven individuals affected by PDD, linkage and mutational analysis results, and review the literature. This pedigree demonstrates the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, remarkable variation in expressivity, and reduced penetrance. The most severely affected individual had progression of mild skull hyperostosis to severe skull thickening and cranial nerve compression over 30 years. His carrier father remained asymptomatic into his ninth decade and had no radiographic hyperostosis or sclerosis of the bones. Symptomatic relatives presented with lower limb pain and weakness. They were initially diagnosed with a variety of other conditions. Two of the symptomatic individuals were treated successfully with prednisone. We genotyped 7 markers from chromosome region 19q13.1-13.3 in 15 relatives and confirmed linkage to this region in this family. We screened the TGFB1 gene for mutations and identified a missense mutation resulting in an R218H substitution in the affected individuals, the asymptomatic obligate carrier, and another unaffected relative. We genotyped the family for seven known TGFB1 polymorphisms and a novel TAAA tetranucleotide repeat in intron 1. These polymorphisms did not appear to account for the variability in disease severity in this family. Our review illustrates how the disorder can significantly compromise health. Cranial involvement, which occurs in 61% of patients, can be severe, entrapping cranial nerves or causing increased intracranial pressure. Therapy with corticosteroids should be attempted in all symptomatic patients.",

Radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and histopathologic imaging studies were obtained. Hypersclerosis of the affected bones led to the initiation of a sclerotic bone dysplasia workup and sequencing of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene located on chromosome 19q13 revealed a heterozygous rare missense variant in exon-4, leading to a final diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED).

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) [OMIM 131300] is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bone pain and osteosclerosis affecting the diaphysis of long bones. It has been previously reported that CED is caused by mutations of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta1) gene on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Until now, seven mutations (LLL12-13ins, Y81H, R156C, R218C, R218H, H222D, C225R) in Australian, French, Belgian, Japanese, and European families have been reported and these data showed that there was no correlation between the nature of the mutations and the variability of the clinical manifestations. In this study, we found a Chinese family with CED and observed some intra-familial clinical variability and symptoms that became more severe with the age. A new TGF beta1 mutation (E169K) in exon 2 was identified in the Chinese family using polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing analysis of PCR products and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. This mutation has not been previously reported in other countries in the world.",

During the time, neuromuscular disease was suspected, but not confirmed. Elevated bone alkaline phosphatase as well as other bone turnover markers (osteocalcin, procollagen, telopeptide) indicated further skeletal evaluation. Symmetrical enhanced uptake on technetium methylene diphosphonate [99mTc]MPD bone scintigraphy at diaphyses of longitudinal bones and scull matched cortical thickening of long bones and sclerosis of the scull seen at radiograms. Those findings pointed to Camurati-Engelmann disease misdiagnosed for the long time. This rare genetic autosomal dominant disorder was retrospectively diagnosed in asymptomatic father too on the basis of bone scans done long time ago. Old family member scans confirmed heredity pattern of the disease.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED, MIM # 131300) was diagnosed in a 27-year-old woman, who had pain in her lower legs. There was no history of hearing loss (or CED) in her family. She had been suffering from progressive hearing impairment since childhood. Serial audiograms demonstrated progressive mixed hearing loss from the age of 11 years onwards, for which she underwent successful stapes surgery bilaterally at the age of 13-18 years. Clinical ('juvenile') otosclerosis was found with stapes footplate fixation. Unfortunately, the sensorineural hearing loss component proved to be progressive bilaterally after surgery. At the age of 30 years, she experienced more rapid deterioration of her hearing loss in the right ear and episodes of vertigo. Vestibular examinations demonstrated progressive vestibular impairment 'otospongiotic' lesions with encroachment on the cochlear and vestibular labyrinth were found on high resolution CT scans at the age of 40 years; the internal auditory canal was normal bilaterally. CED may have formed a chance combination with juvenile otosclerosis in our patient, or otosclerosis may be part of the CED phenotype.",

                    "text": "Significant Improvement After Surgery for a Symptomatic Osteoblastoma in a Patient with Camurati-Engelmann Disease: Case Report and Literature Review. Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia characterized as diaphyseal hyperostosis and sclerosis of the long bones. Corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, and losartan have been reported to be effective systemic medications used to reduce CED symptoms. There are no reports of osteoblastoma in patients with CED, and osteoblastoma in the distal radius is rare. We present a patient diagnosed with CED, based on radiological and histological examinations, at 11 years old. At 22 years old, she experienced severe pain in her right forearm and was treated with bisphosphonate, losartan, and prednisolone; however, the pain continued. An expansive and sclerotic lesion at the distal radius was observed on radiography. A follow-up plain radiograph indicated that the lesion was growing. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed solitary, intense radiotracer uptake, and a biopsy and surgical resection were performed due to suspected malignancy. Pathologic analysis showed anastomosing bony trabeculae rimmed by osteoblasts observed in a loose fibrovascular stroma. The lesion was diagnosed as an osteoblastoma. Following bone excision and artificial bone grafting, the patient's severe pain almost completely disappeared. At final follow-up, no evidence of osteoblastoma recurrence was noted. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of osteoblastoma arising in a patient with CED. Bone excision and artificial bone grafting may be a treatment option for local symptomatic osteoblastoma in patients with CED.",

                    "text": "Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease: Technical Note. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis.",

OBJECTIVE: To describe presenting symptoms, evaluation findings, and surgical management of cranial base hyperostosis in patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). DESIGN: Retrospective study and literature review. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. PATIENTS: A total of 306 patients diagnosed as having CED, including 12 primarily evaluated at our institution between 1968 and 2008, and 294 identified in the international literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presenting symptoms, methods of diagnosis, treatment strategies, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three of 306 patients (56.5%) had radiographically proven skull base hyperostosis, whereas less than one-fourth were symptomatic. The most common manifestations of cranial base involvement were hearing loss (19.0%), headache (10.4%), exophthalmos (8.2%), and frontal bossing (7.2%); less common were vision changes, vertigo, facial weakness, symptomatic brainstem compression, facial numbness, and hyposmia. Although corticosteroids and bisphosphates may treat torso and extremity involvement, they demonstrate no benefit for symptomatic skull base disease. In select symptomatic patients, aggressive decompression surgery may provide the only means of treatment. Decompression surgery is more challenging with thick sclerotic bone, loss or obscuration of bony landmarks, and decreased supratentorial space. Patients must be counseled on the increased risks associated with surgery and the potential for redeposition of bone and recurrence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include CED in the differential diagnosis for patients with radiographic evidence of skull base thickening and synchronous cranial neuropathies or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. In mild forms of the disease, the clinical course of patients should be followed with serial examination, audiometric testing, and radiography. In select patients with progressive cranial base symptoms, aggressive wide decompression of involved neurovascular structures may provide benefit.",

Clinically, the patients suffer from bone pain, easy fatigability, and decreased muscle mass and weakness in the proximal parts of the lower limbs resulting in gait disturbances. The disease-causing mutations are located within the TGFbeta-1 gene and expected to or thought to disrupt the binding between TGFbeta1 and its latency-associated peptide resulting in an increased signaling of the pathway and subsequently accelerated bone turnover. In preclinical studies, it was shown that targeting the type I receptor ameliorates the high bone turnover. In patients, treatment options are currently mostly limited to corticosteroids that may relieve the pain, and improve the muscle weakness and fatigue.

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare sclerosing bone disorder in humans with autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the gene (TGFB1) that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are causative for CED. TGF-beta1 signaling is enhanced by the CED-causing mutations. In this study, we performed Tgfb1 mutation screening in an ENU-mutagenized mouse genomic DNA library. We identified a missense mutation in which cysteine was substituted by serine at position 225 (p.C225S), that corresponded to the CED-causing mutation (p.C225R). TGF-beta1 mutant protein carrying p.C225S was secreted normally into the extracellular space. Reporter gene assays showed that the p.C225S mutants enhanced TGF-beta signaling at the same level as p.C225R mutants. We generated p.C225S homozygous mice and confirmed that the mature TGF-beta1 levels in the culture supernatants of the calvarial cells from the homozygotes were significantly higher than those from wild-type mice. Although the skull and femur are sclerotic in CED, these phenotypes were not observed in p.C225S homozygous mice. These results suggest that human and mouse bone tissue react differently to TGF-beta1. These findings are useful to pharmacological studies using mouse models in developing drugs that will target TGF-beta signaling.",

We retrospectively enrolled a 66-year-old female patient with osteoporosis in CED who underwent denosumab therapy for 14 months. Denosumab was commenced after 3 years of alendronate treatment. Fourteen months later, lumbar and total hip bone mineral density showed gains of 5.9% and 6.4%, respectively. Bone turnover markers were also improved during follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare disorder, with approximately 250 described cases in the literature. Treatment options are limited and have been suboptimal so far. PATIENT AND METHODS: A prepubertal girl aged 9 years was diagnosed with CED. Treatment with losartan was initiated at a daily dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Over a period of 12 weeks, the dose was gradually increased to 1.0 mg/kg/d. The patient was reviewed in clinic regularly and underwent thorough clinical assessments 9, 17, and 38 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: The patient experienced marked clinical improvements with losartan. In particular, losartan treatment led to the complete elimination of the previously severe and incapacitating pain, with an increased ability to walk and perform physical activities. There was also a considerable improvement in body composition with increased lean and adipose tissue. Notably, the improvement in fat deposition had not been previously observed with other treatments in CED. Hematology, liver, and renal function tests were within normal ranges at presentation and remained so over the course of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In light of our findings, losartan may be a useful option in CED management.",

The case of a woman suffering from progressive diaphyseal dysplasia is presented. Characteristic symptoms of crippling pain in both legs, severe aching in both forearms, and episodic temporofrontal and occipital headache were only partially regulated by corticosteroid treatment. However, pregnancy resulted in a progressive disappearance of these symptoms, allowing withdrawal of steroid treatment. Tc-99m MDP scintigraphy performed immediately after delivery showed a decrease of the intense uptake in the forearms, tibiae, and skull, which had been documented prior to pregnancy. However, widespread pain recurred within 6 weeks after delivery, accompanied by a recurrence of multiple severely hyperactive foci on bone scintigraphy. Alterations of immune modulated processes and changes in bone mineral homeostasis and in endogenous cortisol metabolism during pregnancy can be considered as possible explanations for the temporary improvement in clinical and scintigraphic signs of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia in this patient.",

The most common clinical manifestations were chronic skeletal pain, waddling gait, muscular weakness. PATIENT CONCERNS: We described that a 27-year-old male with a 1-year history of intermittent tetany was referred for bone scintigraphy. The whole body bone scan images showed abnormal increased uptake of the tracer in the long bones of the upper and lower extremities as well as in the skull. DIAGNOSES: Combined the family history, the findings of the images and the genetic study, the diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease was confirmed. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The patient responded well to the treatment of calcium gluconate. LESSONS: Bone scintigraphy would be helpful in the diagnosis and assessing the severity of Camurati-Engelmann disease.",

The case of a woman suffering from progressive diaphyseal dysplasia is presented. Characteristic symptoms of crippling pain in both legs, severe aching in both forearms, and episodic temporofrontal and occipital headache were only partially regulated by corticosteroid treatment. However, pregnancy resulted in a progressive disappearance of these symptoms, allowing withdrawal of steroid treatment. Tc-99m MDP scintigraphy performed immediately after delivery showed a decrease of the intense uptake in the forearms, tibiae, and skull, which had been documented prior to pregnancy. However, widespread pain recurred within 6 weeks after delivery, accompanied by a recurrence of multiple severely hyperactive foci on bone scintigraphy. Alterations of immune modulated processes and changes in bone mineral homeostasis and in endogenous cortisol metabolism during pregnancy can be considered as possible explanations for the temporary improvement in clinical and scintigraphic signs of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia in this patient.",

BACKGROUND: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare disorder, with approximately 250 described cases in the literature. Treatment options are limited and have been suboptimal so far. PATIENT AND METHODS: A prepubertal girl aged 9 years was diagnosed with CED. Treatment with losartan was initiated at a daily dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Over a period of 12 weeks, the dose was gradually increased to 1.0 mg/kg/d. The patient was reviewed in clinic regularly and underwent thorough clinical assessments 9, 17, and 38 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: The patient experienced marked clinical improvements with losartan. In particular, losartan treatment led to the complete elimination of the previously severe and incapacitating pain, with an increased ability to walk and perform physical activities. There was also a considerable improvement in body composition with increased lean and adipose tissue. Notably, the improvement in fat deposition had not been previously observed with other treatments in CED. Hematology, liver, and renal function tests were within normal ranges at presentation and remained so over the course of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In light of our findings, losartan may be a useful option in CED management.",

Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (MIM 131300), also known as Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), is a rare autosomal dominant craniotubular dysplasia caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) gene. Radiographs of the long bones of a 9-year-old boy presenting with waddling gait, muscular weakness, underweight, and severe skeletal pain showed symmetric diaphyseal cortical thickening pathognomonic for CED. The diagnosis was verified by detecting a mutation in exon 4 of the TGF-beta1 gene. Full body bone mineral densitometry studies performed before treatment with prednisolone were indicative for osteoporosis (Z-scores for the lumbar spine and femoral neck -2.3 and -3.2, respectively). A transiliac bone biopsy showed markedly reduced trabecular bone volume. Oral prednisolone was initiated, and subsequently, pamidronate infusions were commenced in an attempt to prevent progression of osteoporosis. To our knowledge, this is the first time bone biopsy and bone mineral densitometry studies have been performed and bisphosphonate treatment evaluated in a child with CED.",

Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD), a rare disorder of bones, in recent years has been accepted as a systemic disease within the spectrum of connective tissue disorders associated with immunological abnormalities. Steroids have been used in the treatment of PDD with variable success. In this report PDD is described in a 5-year-old boy who presented with leg pain, fatigue, headache and anorexia with an onset in infancy. Physical examination revealed a waddling gait, thorax deformity and thickening in the upper extremities. The diagnosis was made by radiologic demonstration of cortical thickening and a narrowed medullary cavity of the long bones of extremities. Bone scintigraphy showed areas of increased osteoblastic activity in the diaphyseal part of the long bones of extremities and the skull. Electron microscopic examination revealed myopathic and vascular changes. Serum immunoglobulin A, G and M levels were elevated and CD4 positive T cell numbers were low. Deflazacort, a steroid with a similar anti-inflammatory effect to prednisolone but with fewer adverse effects, was started in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. Deflazacort treatment resulted in clinical and radiological improvement within 12 months with no side effects. In conclusion, steroids may be recommended as an effective method of treatment in PDD and deflazacort may be a safe alternative steroid.",

OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia as a result of mutations in the transforming growth factor gene TGFbeta1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS: Genetic analysis of the TGFbeta1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia, and menstrual irregularity. RESULTS: The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg/day, as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFbeta1 on the mechanism of the disease, and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands, remains unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease are important for future treatment options and a better quality of life of such patients.",

OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia as a result of mutations in the transforming growth factor gene TGFbeta1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS: Genetic analysis of the TGFbeta1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia, and menstrual irregularity. RESULTS: The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg/day, as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFbeta1 on the mechanism of the disease, and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands, remains unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease are important for future treatment options and a better quality of life of such patients.",

UNLABELLED: Schnitzler's syndrome is a rare disease characterized by a monoclonal IgM (or IgG) paraprotein, a nonpruritic urticarial skin rash, and 2 (or 3) of the following: recurrent fever, objective signs of abnormal bone remodeling, elevated CRP level or leukocytosis, and a neutrophilic infiltrate on skin biopsy. It responds well to treatment with the interleukine-1-inhibitor anakinra. We report the bone scintigraphy and MRI findings in a 45 years old man with this syndrome and compare them with data from the literature. CONCLUSION: None of the imaging findings are specific, but they lead to a differential diagnosis including infiltrative diseases (e.g. systemic mastocytosis or Erdheim-Chester disease) and dysplastic diseases (e.g. melorheostosis, Camurati-Engelmann disease or van Buchem disease). The bone scintigraphy pattern may be very suggestive of the correct diagnosis and of bone involvement in this syndrome.",

BACKGROUND: Camurati-Engelmann disease is an extremely rare disease characterized by hyperostosis of multiple long bones. This condition is caused by heterozygous mutations in the TGFB1 gene. METHODS: We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 4 Korean patients with this rare disease diagnosed at Asan Medical Center in Korea between June 2012 and May 2016, to increase awareness about this condition among general physicians and orthopedists. The presenting features, biochemical findings, radiographic and nuclear imaging findings, molecular analysis, and treatment outcomes of 4 patients were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two patients had sporadic disease, whereas the other 2 were familial cases. The average age at symptom onset was 8.8 +- 5.5 (4-14) years. Symptoms included waddling gait or leg pain. Bone pain and easy fatigability were documented in all patients. Skeletal deformities such as osteoporosis, genu valgum, and severe scoliosis were observed. Visual and otologic manifestations presenting as exophthalmos, retinal detachment, and vestibulopathy were found in 3 patients. Skeletal survey showed diaphyseal expansion with diffuse cortical thickening of long bones in all patients. Bone scintigraphy images showed increased uptake of radioactive material in the calvarium and diaphysis of long bones. The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 46.5 +- 22.2 (20-72) mm/h. Sequence analysis of TGFB1 revealed the previously reported mutations p.Arg218His, p.Arg218Cys, and p.Glu169Lys. Corticosteroid was effective in relieving pain, and losartan was used as maintenance therapy.

Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD) (Camurati-Engelmann disease) is an autosomal dominant craniotubular dysplasia characterized by hyperostosis and sclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones and the skull. Mutations in transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) were recently found in patients with PDD. We report on a four-generation pedigree with seven individuals affected by PDD, linkage and mutational analysis results, and review the literature. This pedigree demonstrates the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, remarkable variation in expressivity, and reduced penetrance. The most severely affected individual had progression of mild skull hyperostosis to severe skull thickening and cranial nerve compression over 30 years. His carrier father remained asymptomatic into his ninth decade and had no radiographic hyperostosis or sclerosis of the bones. Symptomatic relatives presented with lower limb pain and weakness. They were initially diagnosed with a variety of other conditions. Two of the symptomatic individuals were treated successfully with prednisone. We genotyped 7 markers from chromosome region 19q13.1-13.3 in 15 relatives and confirmed linkage to this region in this family. We screened the TGFB1 gene for mutations and identified a missense mutation resulting in an R218H substitution in the affected individuals, the asymptomatic obligate carrier, and another unaffected relative. We genotyped the family for seven known TGFB1 polymorphisms and a novel TAAA tetranucleotide repeat in intron 1. These polymorphisms did not appear to account for the variability in disease severity in this family. Our review illustrates how the disorder can significantly compromise health. Cranial involvement, which occurs in 61% of patients, can be severe, entrapping cranial nerves or causing increased intracranial pressure.

                    "text": "Reduced Dentin Matrix Protein Expression in Camurati-Engelmann Disease Transgenic Mouse Model. UNLABELLED: Overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) has been shown to lead to mineralization defects in both the enamel and dentin layers of teeth. A TGFB1 point mutation (H222D), derived from published cases of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), has been shown to constitutively activate TGF-beta1, leading to excess bone matrix production. Although CED has been well documented in clinical case reports, there are no published studies on the effect of CED on the dentition. The objective of this study was to determine the dental manifestations of hyperactivated TGF-beta1 signaling using an established mouse model of CED-derived TGF-beta1 mutation. Murine dental tissues were studied via radiography, micro-CT, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Results showed that initial decreased dental mineralized tissue density is resolved. Proliferation assays of incisor pulp and alveolar bone cell cultures revealed that cells from transgenic animals displayed a reduced rate of growth compared to alveolar bone cultures from wild-type mice. TGF-beta family gene expression analysis indicated significant fold changes in the expression of Alpl, Bmp2-5, Col-1, -2, -4, and -6, Fgf, Mmp, Runx2, Tgfb3, Tfgbr3, and Vdr genes. Assessment of SIBLINGs revealed downregulation of Ibsp, Dmp1, Dspp, Mepe, and Spp1, as well as reduced staining for BMP-2 and VDR in mesenchymal-derived pulp tissue in CED animals. Treatment of dental pulp cells with recombinant human TGF-beta1 resulted in increased SIBLING gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide in vivo evidence suggesting that TFG-beta1 mediates expression of important dentin extracellular matrix components secreted by dental pulp, and when unbalanced, may contribute to abnormal dentin disorders.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant type of bone dysplasia. This review is based on the unpublished and detailed clinical, radiological, and molecular findings in 14 CED families, comprising 41 patients, combined with data from 10 other previously reported CED families. For all 100 cases, molecular evidence for CED was available, as a mutation was detected in TGFB1, the gene encoding transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. Pain in the extremities was the most common clinical symptom, present in 68% of the patients. A waddling gait (48%), easy fatigability (44%), and muscle weakness (39%) were other important features. Radiological symptoms were not fully penetrant, with 94% of the patients showing the typical long bone involvement. A large percentage of the patients also showed involvement of the skull (54%) and pelvis (63%). The review provides an overview of possible treatments, diagnostic guidelines, and considerations for prenatal testing. The detailed description of such a large set of CED patients will be of value in establishing the correct diagnosis, genetic counselling, and treatment.",

OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia as a result of mutations in the transforming growth factor gene TGFbeta1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS: Genetic analysis of the TGFbeta1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia, and menstrual irregularity. RESULTS: The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg/day, as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFbeta1 on the mechanism of the disease, and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands, remains unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease are important for future treatment options and a better quality of life of such patients.",

OBJECTIVE: A case report of a patient diagnosed with Camurati-Engelmann Disease (CED) in association with the functional hypothalamic amenorrhea disturbances. CED is a very rare genetically determined disorder classified as a type of bone dysplasia. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, 3rd grade Medical University Hospital. PATIENT: Twenty-one years old female patient with CED admitted to the hospital because of primary amenorrhea. Her history revealed skeletal deformities and hearing impairment. METHODS: Clinical examination, ultrasound, laboratory evaluations (including serum gonadotropins (FSH, LH) at basal state and after stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, serum basal estradiol) radiological studies (X-ray of the head, the lumbar spine and lower extremities; a computed tomography of the head), G-banding karyotype, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Hormonal serum evaluations were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction and the product was directly sequenced. RESULTS: The hormonal analysis was characteristic for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Radiological and molecular analyses confirmed CED diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic amenorrhea in a patient with CED may be explained as a consequence of fat hypotrophy and very low body mass index. Therefore, impairment within hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients with CED should be treated with special attention.",

                    "text": "Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease: Technical Note. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED, MIM # 131300) was diagnosed in a 27-year-old woman, who had pain in her lower legs. There was no history of hearing loss (or CED) in her family. She had been suffering from progressive hearing impairment since childhood. Serial audiograms demonstrated progressive mixed hearing loss from the age of 11 years onwards, for which she underwent successful stapes surgery bilaterally at the age of 13-18 years. Clinical ('juvenile') otosclerosis was found with stapes footplate fixation. Unfortunately, the sensorineural hearing loss component proved to be progressive bilaterally after surgery. At the age of 30 years, she experienced more rapid deterioration of her hearing loss in the right ear and episodes of vertigo. Vestibular examinations demonstrated progressive vestibular impairment 'otospongiotic' lesions with encroachment on the cochlear and vestibular labyrinth were found on high resolution CT scans at the age of 40 years; the internal auditory canal was normal bilaterally. CED may have formed a chance combination with juvenile otosclerosis in our patient, or otosclerosis may be part of the CED phenotype.",

Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the TGFB1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia and menstrual irregularity. The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg per day as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFB1 on the mechanism of the disease itself and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands remain unclear.

Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED; MIM 131300), or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare autosomal dominant bone disease, which is caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene on chromosome 19q13.1-13.3. Extremely variable penetrance has been reported to be associated with CED, the most common features of which are limb pain, waddling gait and muscle weakness. The present study reported on a consanguineous Chinese family with one affected individual that initially presented with exophthalmos, which has not previously been reported as an initial manifestation of CED. The proband was a 22-year-old woman that presented with progressive proptosis. Except for increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, no other biochemical abnormalities were detected. Whole-body radiological and bone scintigraphic investigations revealed that hyperostosis and sclerosis predominantly affected the cranial bones, including the skull base, and only mildly affected the long bones. A heterozygous mutation involving a G to A transition at the cDNA position +653 of TGFbeta1 was detected in the patient only, but not in her family members, by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI DNA sequencer (Model 377). Based on the clinical, biochemical, radiological and genetic findings, a diagnosis of CED was confirmed. Considering the phenotypic variability associated with CED and the unique manifestations of the patient described in the present study, CED should be taken into account regarding the differential diagnosis of exophthalmos.

Characteristic symptoms of crippling pain in both legs, severe aching in both forearms, and episodic temporofrontal and occipital headache were only partially regulated by corticosteroid treatment. However, pregnancy resulted in a progressive disappearance of these symptoms, allowing withdrawal of steroid treatment. Tc-99m MDP scintigraphy performed immediately after delivery showed a decrease of the intense uptake in the forearms, tibiae, and skull, which had been documented prior to pregnancy. However, widespread pain recurred within 6 weeks after delivery, accompanied by a recurrence of multiple severely hyperactive foci on bone scintigraphy. Alterations of immune modulated processes and changes in bone mineral homeostasis and in endogenous cortisol metabolism during pregnancy can be considered as possible explanations for the temporary improvement in clinical and scintigraphic signs of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia in this patient.",

BACKGROUND: To investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CAEND) in Chinese individuals. METHODS: We recruited six patients aged 14 to 45 years in three unrelated families with CAEND, including five females and one male. Clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, and radiographic examinations were analyzed. The TGFB1 gene variants were further identified by Sanger sequencing. In addition, one female patient was followed up for 5 years. RESULTS: The onset age of the patients ranged from 1 to 6 years. All of them had family histories and consisted of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Gait disturbance, fatigue, progressive bone pain, muscle atrophy, and weakness were the main complaints. Laboratory examinations revealed that the inflammatory markers were at high levels, in addition to the increased bone metabolism indicators. The thickened diaphysis of long bones and the narrowed medullary cavity was observed by radiography. Furthermore, bone scintigraphy detected abnormal symmetrical radioactive concentrations in the affected regions of bone. Sanger sequencing identified a missense heterozygous variant in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene in families 1 and 2, resulting in Arg218Cys, which confirmed CAEND. Moreover, one novel variant c.669C > G in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene harboring Cys223Trp was detected in family 3. Subsequent bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant was pathogenic. Of interest, III:2 in family 3 experienced heart valve defects and tachycardia at birth, which had never been reported in CAEND patients before. Moreover, the response to drug treatment is also full of contradictions and is worthy of further study. CONCLUSION: Besides the typical CAEND manifestations, the new phenotypic characteristics of tachycardia and heart valve defects were first reported in one woman carrying the novel variant p.Cys223Trp in TGFB1 the gene. In addition, we demonstrated that increased bone metabolism indicators and inflammatory markers may possess auxiliary diagnosis for CAEND.",

OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia as a result of mutations in the transforming growth factor gene TGFbeta1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS: Genetic analysis of the TGFbeta1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia, and menstrual irregularity. RESULTS: The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg/day, as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFbeta1 on the mechanism of the disease, and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands, remains unclear.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and major causative gene in pediatric patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). Biochemical and radiographic examinations, bone scintigraphy and genetic analyses were performed in two affected males and their parents. The two patients experienced waddling gait, muscular weakness and growth developmental delay. X-ray radiography revealed typical fusiform thickening of the diaphyseal portions of the long bones. The abnormal uptake of tracer Tc-99m was visualized in the skull and both sides of the upper humeri, ulnas, radii, femurs and tibias using bone scintigraphy. Serum levels of the bone formation marker procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and the bone resorption marker beta-isomerized C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) in the 6-year-old patient were significantly increased compared with the normal value range, while only the beta-CTX levels were elevated in the 16-year-old patient. A heterozygous missense mutation p.Arg218Cys in exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) gene was detected in the two patients, while their parents had normal wild-type genotypes. In conclusion, the p.Arg218Cys mutation was shown to contribute to the clinical phenotypes in two pediatric patients with CED. The results of this study suggest that abnormal bone turnover marker levels, typical radiological findings and mutations in the TGFbeta1 gene are three important factors in the diagnosis of sporadic CED cases.",

We present a patient with congenital hyperphosphatasia whose clinical and radiographic features were somewhat different from these other well-defined syndromes. The patient was followed for 45 years until his death of at age 49. The patient had massive osteoectasia with dense striations involving the entire shaft of his long bones. His spine, pelvis, short tubular bones, and calvarium were also involved. He suffered hearing loss and optic atrophy, but he kept his teeth throughout his life. He was tall with a marfanoid habitus, and he had hypogonadism and hypothyroidism. There was no evidence of mental retardation, and other laboratory studies where within normal limits.

OBJECTIVE: A case report of a patient diagnosed with Camurati-Engelmann Disease (CED) in association with the functional hypothalamic amenorrhea disturbances. CED is a very rare genetically determined disorder classified as a type of bone dysplasia. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, 3rd grade Medical University Hospital. PATIENT: Twenty-one years old female patient with CED admitted to the hospital because of primary amenorrhea. Her history revealed skeletal deformities and hearing impairment. METHODS: Clinical examination, ultrasound, laboratory evaluations (including serum gonadotropins (FSH, LH) at basal state and after stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, serum basal estradiol) radiological studies (X-ray of the head, the lumbar spine and lower extremities; a computed tomography of the head), G-banding karyotype, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Hormonal serum evaluations were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction and the product was directly sequenced. RESULTS: The hormonal analysis was characteristic for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Radiological and molecular analyses confirmed CED diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic amenorrhea in a patient with CED may be explained as a consequence of fat hypotrophy and very low body mass index. Therefore, impairment within hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients with CED should be treated with special attention.",

Camurati-Engelmann disease (OMIM 31300) is a rare cranio-tubular bone dysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis of the long bones and skull caused by dominantly-inherited mutations in the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) gene. A wide variation in phenotype has been recognized, even within families carrying the same mutation. In addition, aspects of the natural history of the disorder, in particular whether it is always progressive or can remit spontaneously, remain uncertain. In a large kindred carrying a TGFB1 gene mutation (c.653G > A; p.R218H) we have attempted to clarify the extent of phenotypic variability and the natural history of the disease through detailed individual histories of symptoms, and skeletal imaging by both radiography and scintigraphy. Only one subject had the classical childhood onset with bone pain in the legs and gait disturbance. Eight subjects reported the onset of leg pain in their teenage years that, by their early 20s, had either resolved or persisted at a low level. Two of these eight later developed cranial nerve palsies. There was a wide variation in the radiographic appearance in adults, but disease extent and activity in long bones, as assessed by scintigraphy, was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.025). In younger subjects the radiographic and scintigraphic appearances were concordant, but in older subjects the scintigram could be quiescent despite florid radiographic changes. Sequential scintigrams in two subjects showed reduced activity in the later scan. One subject had suffered meningoencephalitis in early childhood that resulted in paresis of one arm. The affected arm showed markedly less disease involvement, implicating mechanical or growth factors in its etiology. Our data suggest that the natural history of Camurati-Engelmann disease can be benign, and that disease activity commonly attenuates in adulthood.

Camurati-Engelmann disease (OMIM 31300) is a rare cranio-tubular bone dysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis of the long bones and skull caused by dominantly-inherited mutations in the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) gene. A wide variation in phenotype has been recognized, even within families carrying the same mutation. In addition, aspects of the natural history of the disorder, in particular whether it is always progressive or can remit spontaneously, remain uncertain. In a large kindred carrying a TGFB1 gene mutation (c.653G > A; p.R218H) we have attempted to clarify the extent of phenotypic variability and the natural history of the disease through detailed individual histories of symptoms, and skeletal imaging by both radiography and scintigraphy. Only one subject had the classical childhood onset with bone pain in the legs and gait disturbance. Eight subjects reported the onset of leg pain in their teenage years that, by their early 20s, had either resolved or persisted at a low level. Two of these eight later developed cranial nerve palsies. There was a wide variation in the radiographic appearance in adults, but disease extent and activity in long bones, as assessed by scintigraphy, was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.025). In younger subjects the radiographic and scintigraphic appearances were concordant, but in older subjects the scintigram could be quiescent despite florid radiographic changes. Sequential scintigrams in two subjects showed reduced activity in the later scan. One subject had suffered meningoencephalitis in early childhood that resulted in paresis of one arm. The affected arm showed markedly less disease involvement, implicating mechanical or growth factors in its etiology. Our data suggest that the natural history of Camurati-Engelmann disease can be benign, and that disease activity commonly attenuates in adulthood. Severe cases of childhood onset and/or with cranial nerve involvement, may occur only in a minority of mutation carriers.   2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

During therapy, disease activity was assessed serially using bone scintigraphy with Tc-99m HMDP.

We retrospectively enrolled a 66-year-old female patient with osteoporosis in CED who underwent denosumab therapy for 14 months. Denosumab was commenced after 3 years of alendronate treatment. Fourteen months later, lumbar and total hip bone mineral density showed gains of 5.9% and 6.4%, respectively. Bone turnover markers were also improved during follow-up. No fractures or other complications were recorded during the observational period. This is the first study describing denosumab treatment for an osteoporotic CED patient.

The case of a woman suffering from progressive diaphyseal dysplasia is presented. Characteristic symptoms of crippling pain in both legs, severe aching in both forearms, and episodic temporofrontal and occipital headache were only partially regulated by corticosteroid treatment. However, pregnancy resulted in a progressive disappearance of these symptoms, allowing withdrawal of steroid treatment. Tc-99m MDP scintigraphy performed immediately after delivery showed a decrease of the intense uptake in the forearms, tibiae, and skull, which had been documented prior to pregnancy. However, widespread pain recurred within 6 weeks after delivery, accompanied by a recurrence of multiple severely hyperactive foci on bone scintigraphy. Alterations of immune modulated processes and changes in bone mineral homeostasis and in endogenous cortisol metabolism during pregnancy can be considered as possible explanations for the temporary improvement in clinical and scintigraphic signs of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia in this patient.",

                    "text": "Observations on the Natural History of Camurati-Engelmann Disease. Camurati-Engelmann disease (OMIM 31300) is a rare cranio-tubular bone dysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis of the long bones and skull caused by dominantly-inherited mutations in the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) gene. A wide variation in phenotype has been recognized, even within families carrying the same mutation. In addition, aspects of the natural history of the disorder, in particular whether it is always progressive or can remit spontaneously, remain uncertain. In a large kindred carrying a TGFB1 gene mutation (c.653G > A; p.R218H) we have attempted to clarify the extent of phenotypic variability and the natural history of the disease through detailed individual histories of symptoms, and skeletal imaging by both radiography and scintigraphy. Only one subject had the classical childhood onset with bone pain in the legs and gait disturbance. Eight subjects reported the onset of leg pain in their teenage years that, by their early 20s, had either resolved or persisted at a low level. Two of these eight later developed cranial nerve palsies. There was a wide variation in the radiographic appearance in adults, but disease extent and activity in long bones, as assessed by scintigraphy, was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.025). In younger subjects the radiographic and scintigraphic appearances were concordant, but in older subjects the scintigram could be quiescent despite florid radiographic changes. Sequential scintigrams in two subjects showed reduced activity in the later scan. One subject had suffered meningoencephalitis in early childhood that resulted in paresis of one arm. The affected arm showed markedly less disease involvement, implicating mechanical or growth factors in its etiology. Our data suggest that the natural history of Camurati-Engelmann disease can be benign, and that disease activity commonly attenuates in adulthood. Severe cases of childhood onset and/or with cranial nerve involvement, may occur only in a minority of mutation carriers.   2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",
