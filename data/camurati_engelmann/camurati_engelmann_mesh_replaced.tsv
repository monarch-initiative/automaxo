16446922		Rare diseaseD001847.diseaseD001847 can produce many different symptoms, such as involvement restricted to the temporal bone or impairment of other bones. We consider, in this study two entities that are rare diseaseC538271 cases, which are diseaseD010022 and diseaseD003966, the latter being extremely rare. We present two cases of benign form of diseaseD010022 (diseaseD010022), a 9606 of 11 years old and another one of 48 years old, both male, and a 9606 of 28 years old, female, with diseaseD003966. The diseaseD005158 was a manifestation in two of the 9606. We discuss some aspects about the clinical manifestations, radiological findings, as well as differential diagnostic and therapy in view of the complications of the diseases.

Extremely variable penetrance has been reported to be associated with diseaseD003966, the most common features of which are diseaseD010146, diseaseD020234 and diseaseD018908. The present study reported on a consanguineous Chinese family with one affected individual that initially presented with diseaseD005094, which has not previously been reported as an initial manifestation of diseaseD003966. The proband was a 22-year-old 9606 that presented with progressive diseaseD005094. Except for increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, no other biochemical abnormalities were detected. Whole-body radiological and bone scintigraphic investigations revealed that diseaseD015576 and diseaseD012598 predominantly affected the cranial bones, including the skull base, and only mildly affected the long bones. A heterozygous mutation involving a variantrs104894720## of ncbi7040 was detected in the 9606 only, but not in her family members, by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI DNA sequencer (Model 377). Based on the clinical, biochemical, radiological and genetic findings, a diagnosis of diseaseD003966 was confirmed. Considering the phenotypic variability associated with diseaseD003966 and the unique manifestations of the 9606 described in the present study, diseaseD003966 should be taken into account regarding the differential diagnosis of diseaseD005094.

Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select 9606; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a 9606 who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of diseaseD003966 and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and chemicalD014025 mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female 9606 with diseaseD003966 who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of diseaseD019586. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate chemicalD014025 meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the 9606's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some 9606 with diseaseD003966 symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing diseaseD003966 as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a 9606 with diseaseD003966 treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with chemicalD014025 mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to diseaseD015576.

In this report diseaseD003966 is described in a 5-year-old boy who presented with diseaseD010146, diseaseD005221, diseaseD006261 and diseaseD000855 with an onset in infancy. Physical examination revealed a waddling gait, diseaseD019568 and thickening in the upper extremities. The diagnosis was made by radiologic demonstration of cortical thickening and a narrowed medullary cavity of the long bones of extremities. Bone scintigraphy showed areas of increased osteoblastic activity in the diaphyseal part of the long bones of extremities and the skull. Electron microscopic examination revealed diseaseD009135 and vascular changes. Serum immunoglobulin A, G and M levels were elevated and ncbi920 positive T cell numbers were low. chemicalC021988, a chemicalD013256 with a similar anti-diseaseD007249 effect to chemicalD011239 but with fewer adverse effects, was started in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. chemicalC021988 treatment resulted in clinical and radiological improvement within 12 months with no side effects. In conclusion, chemicalD013256 may be recommended as an effective method of treatment in diseaseD003966 and chemicalC021988 may be a safe alternative chemicalD013256.

Since the generation of ncbi21803 knockout 10090, there has been extraordinary progress in understanding its physiological and pathophysiological function. Here, we report the generation of a conditional knockout allele for ncbi21803 in which its exon 6 is flanked with LoxP sites. As proof of principle, we crossed these 10090 to LckCre transgenic 10090 and specifically disrupted ncbi21803 in T cells. The results indicate that T-cell-produced ncbi21803 is required for normal in vivo regulation of peripheral T-cell activation, maintenance of T-cell homeostasis, and suppression of autoimmunity.

So far, little more than one hundred cases have been reported. The diagnosis is based on radiological imaging (traditional X rays and CT scan) and family history. Our 9606 (a 15-year-old male) had high-grade diseaseD019292 producing audiological signs, such as progressive diseaseD003638, persistent diseaseD002558 and diseaseD004433 with progressive diseaseD016893.

Estimated number of 9606 with diseaseD003966 in Japan is approximately 50-60 by our epidemiological survey. We have reported that domain-specific mutations in ncbi7040 gene(TGFB1) cause diseaseD003966. Mutations in latency associated peptide(LAP) domain of ncbi7040 destabilize the complex and may hyperactivate TGF signal pathway. We tried to establish diseaseD003966 model 10090 by gene-targeting, but could not because of spermatogenesis defects in chimera 10090. We also failed using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Alternatively, we established diseaseD003966 9606-derived iPS cells, and are advancing research with them to develop novel therapeutic agents for diseaseD003966.

It is caused by mutations in the ncbi7040 (ncbi7040) (type I) or other unknown gene(s) (type II). We present 8 consecutive 9606 with diseaseC537978. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and radiographs of diseaseC537978 9606 with special reference to the mode of presentation, process of diagnostic work-up, and disease course. They were 4 sporadic 9606, and two pairs of mother and son. RESULTS: We categorized the mode of presentation into three groups. Group I had 4 9606 who mainly presented with diseaseD014832 in young age. They drew medical attention for waddling gait, awkward ambulation or running, difficulty in going upstairs, or a positive Gower's sign at age 4 to 6 years. Subsequent development of diseaseD010146 and diseaseD000089202 led to the diagnosis of diseaseD003966 at age 6 to 29 years. Group II had 3 9606 who mainly presented with diseaseD010146 at age 15, 20, and 54 years, respectively. Radiographic evaluation and molecular genetic test led to the diagnosis of diseaseD003966. The remaining 1 9606 (group III) was asymptomatic until age 9 years when diseaseD000070896 were found incidentally. For the last 10 years, he intermittently complained of diseaseD010146 in the morning or after sports activities, which did not interfere with daily life. All the 9606 in group I showed a body mass index in the underweight range (< 18.4 kg/m2). At the latest follow-up, 4 9606 in groups I and II required medication for the diseaseD010146. CONCLUSIONS: diseaseD003966 presents with a wide range of severity. Awareness of this rare disease entity may be the key to timely correct diagnosis. This disease entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of diseaseD010146 or diseaseD014832 in children to avoid unnecessary diagnostic work-up.

It responds well to treatment with the interleukine-1-inhibitor anakinra. We report the bone scintigraphy and MRI findings in a 45 years old man with this syndrome and compare them with data from the literature. CONCLUSION: None of the imaging findings are specific, but they lead to a differential diagnosis including diseaseD017254 (e.g. diseaseD034721 or diseaseD031249) and diseaseD004416 (e.g. diseaseD008557, diseaseD003966 or diseaseD010009). The bone scintigraphy pattern may be very suggestive of the correct diagnosis and of diseaseD001847 in this syndrome.

A wide variation in phenotype has been recognized, even within families carrying the same mutation. In addition, aspects of the natural history of the disorder, in particular whether it is always progressive or can remit spontaneously, remain uncertain. In a large kindred carrying a ncbi7040 gene mutation (variantrs104894720##; variantrs104894720##) we have attempted to clarify the extent of phenotypic variability and the natural history of the disease through detailed individual histories of symptoms, and skeletal imaging by both radiography and scintigraphy. Only one subject had the classical childhood onset with diseaseD010146 in the legs and diseaseD020233. Eight subjects reported the onset of diseaseD010146 in their teenage years that, by their early 20s, had either resolved or persisted at a low level. Two of these eight later developed diseaseD003389. There was a wide variation in the radiographic appearance in adults, but disease extent and activity in long bones, as assessed by scintigraphy, was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.025). In younger subjects the radiographic and scintigraphic appearances were concordant, but in older subjects the scintigram could be quiescent despite florid radiographic changes. Sequential scintigrams in two subjects showed reduced activity in the later scan. One subject had suffered diseaseD008590 in early childhood that resulted in diseaseD010291 of one arm. The affected arm showed markedly less disease involvement, implicating mechanical or growth factors in its etiology. Our data suggest that the natural history of diseaseD003966 can be benign, and that disease activity commonly attenuates in adulthood. Severe cases of childhood onset and/or with diseaseD003389, may occur only in a minority of mutation carriers.   2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
28842728		Discrepancy between bone density and bone material strength index in three siblings with diseaseD003966.diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) is a very rare disease affecting one in every million persons worldwide. It is characterized by an enlargement of long bones. We aimed to assess bone characteristics in three siblings with different tools. Even if there was an excess of bone density, quality seemed to be deteriorated. INTRODUCTION: diseaseD003966 is a rare diseaseD009358 affecting approximately one in every million persons worldwide. It is mainly characterized by a progressive diseaseD015576 of the periosteum and endosteum of the diaphysis of long bones. Limited data are available about bone characteristics in these 9606. In three siblings with diseaseD003966, we aimed to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and material characteristics at tissue level using bone impact reference point indentation. METHODS: Clinical data were collected and a general laboratory workup was performed. At the lumbar spine and hip, BMD and TBS were measured using DXA imaging. Bone material strength index (BMSi) was measured by bone impact microindentation using an Osteoprobe instrument. RESULTS: All three cases had densitometric values consistent with high bone mass (sum of Z-score at the lumbar spine and hip > 4). Hip BMD was extremely high in all three siblings at both total hip and femoral neck, while at the lumbar spine, two of them had normal values but the third again had very high BMD. TBS values were in the normal range. In contrast, BMSi measurements were at low or very low levels, compared with normal controls. CONCLUSION: Despite strikingly increased BMD and normal microarchitecture, BMSi is affected in 9606 with diseaseD003966. Microindentation could be an appropriate tool for assessing diseaseC536063 in these 9606. diseaseD001847 in this group of 9606 requires further study to better understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms and their alterations.
26286906		Bilateral papilloedema in diseaseD003966.A 23-year-old 9606 presented with bilateral papilloedema in a setting of diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966). She was investigated with neuroimaging showing no diseaseD000080344 or diseaseD056735. Her MRI venogram was normal. Her opening pressure at lumbar puncture and serum alkaline phosphatase were raised. Her papilloedema resolved with long-term use of chemicalD000086. We believe that our 9606 suffered from diseaseD019586 directly as a result of decreasing intracranial volume secondary to diseaseD003966.

Clinically, the 9606 suffer from diseaseD010146, easy fatigability, and diseaseC536030 and diseaseD018908 in the proximal parts of the lower limbs resulting in diseaseD020233. The disease-causing mutations are located within the ncbi7040 gene and expected to or thought to disrupt the binding between ncbi7040 and its latency-associated peptide resulting in an increased signaling of the pathway and subsequently accelerated diseaseD001847. In preclinical studies, it was shown that targeting the type I receptor ameliorates the diseaseD001847. In 9606, treatment options are currently mostly limited to corticosteroids that may relieve the diseaseD010146, and improve the diseaseD018908 and diseaseD005221. In this review, the clinical and radiological characteristics as well as the molecular genetics of this condition are discussed.
16858582		Pitfalls in paediatric diseaseD020233: painless diseaseD001847.INTRODUCTION: We describe three boys who were referred for neurological work-up of a tottering gait and in whom we diagnosed diseaseD001847, namely, diseaseD003966, cartilaginous exostoses and a diseaseD015775 as the underlying causes for the diseaseD020233. CONCLUSION: "diseaseD009461" must be considered even if diseaseD010146 is not a leading symptom in diseaseD020233.

During the study, we encountered two unrelated girls, aged 17 and 11 years, who had clinical manifestations of the disorder, such as diseaseC537724, waddling diseaseD020234, diseaseD018908, intense diseaseD010146, diseaseD006616, delayed sexual development, increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Radiographic studies in the two girls demonstrated not only diseaseD003966 (cortical thickening of the diaphyses) resembling that of progressive diseaseD003966 but also metaphyseal expansion of the long bones, coarse and thick trabeculae of the long and short tubular bones, striations in the spinal, pelvic, and long bones, and diseaseD014402 restricted to the petromastoid regions. These radiographic changes were overall identical with those seen in diseaseC536053 with striations of the bones rather than those in progressive diseaseD003966. Polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing of all exons and their flanking regions of ncbi7040 did not detect any mutations. PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the TGF-beta type 1 receptor gene (ncbi7046) did not demonstrate any aberrant DNA fragments. We concluded from these findings that the two girls we described belong to a unique entity distinct from either of the two disorders.
12789096		diseaseD003966: a case report.diseaseD003966 is a rare condition worldwide. No cases have been documented in Uganda. A 26 year old female presented with a history of grinding diseaseD010146 in the limbs for over 20 years. Strong painkillers would temporally relieve the diseaseD010146. She had an asthenic stature with generalised diseaseD019042. Plain x-rays revealed the characteristic symmetrical thickening and diseaseD012598 of the diaphyses of the appendicular skeleton and skull base, which is pathognomonic of diseaseD003966. Involvement of the metaphyses of these long bones as well as the metacarpal bones makes this an unusual case.

METHODS: Genetic analysis of the ncbi7040 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation variantrs104894721## in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of diseaseD003966, diseaseD006966, and menstrual irregularity. RESULTS: The 9606 responded well to chemicalD011241 5 mg/kg/day, as well as chemicalD002118 and chemicalD014807 supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of variantrs104894721## in ncbi7040 on the mechanism of the disease, and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands, remains unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease are important for future treatment options and a better quality of life of such 9606.

They did not have diseaseD000013 or diseaseD020233. Radiographic studies of the mother revealed diseaseC537613 and diseaseD055009 of the thoracal and lumbar diseaseC562952. The son had diseaseD012598 diaphyses of the metacarpalia of the left hand, the femur and the fibula. The other parts of the skeleton were normal. Several diseaseC535282, such as diseaseD008557 (present mostly in sporadic cases and affecting lower extremities) and diseaseD010009 (autosomal recessive and commonly affecting the mandible) were considered as a diagnosis in the proposita. However, similar symptoms in the son of the proposita suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This brought us to the diagnosis of diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) or diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966), an diseaseD030342 characterized by diseaseD010146, diseaseD009135, diseaseD018908, a diseaseD020234, progressive diseaseD010522 the diaphyses of the long diseaseD001847 and diseaseD019292. Mutations in the ncbi7040 gene on chromosome 19q13.1 have been reported to cause this disorder. The diagnosis of diseaseD003966/diseaseD003966 in this family was confirmed at the molecular level by detection of a variantrs200482214##, leading to an variant#7040# amino acid change (position 156) in exon 2 of the ncbi7040 (ncbi7040) gene.

During the time, diseaseD009468 was suspected, but not confirmed. Elevated bone alkaline phosphatase as well as other bone turnover markers (ncbi632, procollagen, telopeptide) indicated further skeletal evaluation. Symmetrical enhanced uptake on chemicalD013669 [99mTc]MPD bone scintigraphy at diaphyses of longitudinal diseaseD001847 and scull matched cortical thickening of long diseaseD001847 and diseaseD012598 of the scull seen at radiograms. Those findings pointed to diseaseD003966 misdiagnosed for the long time. This rare diseaseD030342 was retrospectively diagnosed in asymptomatic father too on the basis of bone scans done long time ago. Old family member scans confirmed heredity pattern of the disease.
9701854		diseaseD003966. Effects of corticosteroids.diseaseD003966 is an uncommon condition, radiologically characterized by symmetric diseaseC537613 involving the tubular bones. Clinical features include diseaseD010146, diseaseD018908, waddling gait and sometimes diseaseD003638. The evaluation is made by conjunction of radiographic and scintigraphic data. Corticosteroids and analgesics improve the quality of life, decrease the diseaseD010146 but do not alter the course of the disease. The evolution is unpredictable. The history of a 23 year old male with such a disorder is presented hereafter. His clinical course shows a very good response to the administration of corticosteroids, whereas no improvement is observed as far as the radiographic and isotopic features are concerned.

We describe the first Indian diseaseD003966 family with genetic confirmation and presenting manifestations. The proband is a 17-year-old 9606 who presented with diseaseD010146 and proximal diseaseD018908. Skeletal radiographs of the long bones revealed cortical, periosteal, and endosteal thickenings, predominantly affecting the diaphyses of the long bones. On detailed evaluation, there was a strong family history of diseaseD001847 with similar symptoms of diseaseD010146 and radiological findings in several family members. Exon sequencing of the ncbi7040 gene was performed in available family members. Based on clinical and radiographic studies and its familial nature, a diagnosis of diseaseD003966 was made and confirmed by mutation analysis. A heterozygous variant#7040# transition in exon 4 of the ncbi7040 gene (variantrs104894720##) was detected in 5 out of 10 available family members, including 4 affecteds and 1 asymptomatic individual. Many of our affected individuals responded to glucocorticoids and cortical windowing. diseaseD003966 is a rare diseaseD030342 with variable clinical manifestations and incomplete penetrance. diseaseD003966 needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of diseaseD010146 and diseaseD020234 in all young individuals.

We report the first Korean family with an affected mother and son who were diagnosed with diseaseD003966. The proband is a 19-yr-old male with a history of diseaseD020233 since the age of 2. He also suffered from proximal diseaseD018908, diseaseD010146 extremities, and easy fatigability. Skeletal radiographs of the long bones revealed cortical, periosteal, and endosteal thickenings, predominantly affecting the diaphyses of the upper and lower extremities. No other diseaseD018213 were noted in the skull and spine and no remarkable findings were seen on laboratory tests. The 9606's mother had a long-standing history of mild diseaseD010146. Under the impression of diseaseD003966 on radiographic studies, we performed mutation analysis. A heterozygous variant#7040# in exon 4 of the ncbi7040 gene (variantrs104894720##) was detected in the 9606 and his mother.

METHODS: We recruited six 9606 aged 14 to 45 years in three unrelated families with diseaseD003966, including five females and one male. Clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, and radiographic examinations were analyzed. The ncbi7040 gene variants were further identified by Sanger sequencing. In addition, one female 9606 was followed up for 5 years. RESULTS: The onset age of the 9606 ranged from 1 to 6 years. All of them had family histories and consisted of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. diseaseD020233, diseaseD005221, progressive diseaseD010146, diseaseD009133, and diseaseD018908 were the main complaints. Laboratory examinations revealed that the diseaseD007249 markers were at high levels, in addition to the increased bone metabolism indicators. The thickened diaphysis of long bones and the narrowed medullary cavity was observed by radiography. Furthermore, bone scintigraphy detected abnormal symmetrical radioactive concentrations in the affected regions of bone. Sanger sequencing identified a missense heterozygous variant in exon 4 of the ncbi7040 gene in families 1 and 2, resulting in variantrs104894721##, which confirmed diseaseD003966. Moreover, one novel variant variant#7040#c.669C>G in exon 4 of the ncbi7040 gene harboring variant#7040#p.C223W was detected in family 3. Subsequent bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant was pathogenic. Of interest, III:2 in family 3 experienced diseaseD006349 and diseaseD013610 at birth, which had never been reported in diseaseD003966 9606 before. Moreover, the response to drug treatment is also full of contradictions and is worthy of further study. CONCLUSION: Besides the typical diseaseD003966 manifestations, the new phenotypic characteristics of diseaseD013610 and diseaseD006349 were first reported in one 9606 carrying the novel variant variant#7040#p.C223W in ncbi7040 the gene. In addition, we demonstrated that increased bone metabolism indicators and diseaseD007249 markers may possess auxiliary diagnosis for diseaseD003966.

He suffered diseaseD010146 and diseaseD018908 since childhood and reportedly grew until his late 20s, reaching 7 feet in height. He had diseaseD003638, perforated nasal septum, torus palatinus, disproportionately long limbs with diseaseD056304, low muscle mass, and pseudoclubbing. Radiographs revealed generalized diseaseD009139, including wide bones and cortical and trabecular bone thickening in keeping with diseaseD003966, except that long bone ends were also affected. Lumbar spine and hip BMD Z-scores were + 7.7 and + 4.4, respectively. Biochemical markers of bone turnover were elevated. diseaseC564578 accompanied low serum chemicalC104450 (25[OH]D) levels. diseaseD007006 and low serum ncbi3479 were present. Karyotype was normal. Despite chemicalD014807 repletion, iliac crest histology revealed severe diseaseD010018. Exon 1 of ncbi8792 (RANK), exons 2, 3, and 4 of ncbi4041, and all coding exons and adjacent mRNA splice junctions of ncbi4982 (ncbi4982), ncbi8878 (ncbi8878), and ncbi249 (ncbi249) were intact. His asymptomatic and less dysmorphic 5'11'' mother, also with low serum 25(OH)D, had milder clinical, radiological, biochemical, and histopathological findings. Both individuals were heterozygous for a novel 12-bp duplication (variant#7040#c.27_38dup, p.L10_variant#7040#p.L13dup) in exon 1 of ncbi7040, predicting four additional leucine residues in the latency-associated-peptide segment of ncbi7040, consistent with diseaseD003966. The son was also homozygous for a single base transversion in ncbi8600, predicting a nonconservative amino acid change (variantrs138818878##, variantrs138818878##) in the intracellular domain of ncbi8600 that was heterozygous in his nonconsanguineous parents. This ncbi8600 variant was not found in the SNP Database, nor in published ncbi8600 association studies, but it occurred in four of the 134 ncbi8600 alleles (3.0%) we tested randomly among individuals without diseaseD003966. Perhaps the unique phenotype of this diseaseD003966 family is conditioned by altered ncbi8600 activity.
33258798		Looking for new anabolic treatment from rare diseases of bone formation.Bone remodelling is a complex mechanism regulated by osteoclasts and osteoblasts and perturbation of this process leads to the onset of diseases, which may be characterised by altered diseaseD014077 or formation. In this review, we will describe some bone formation-related disorders as diseaseC537525, diseaseD010009, diseaseD007014 and diseaseD003966. In the past decades, the research focused on these rare disorders offered the opportunity to understand important pathways regulating bone formation. Thus, the identification of the molecular defects behind the etiopathology of these diseases will open the way for new therapeutic approaches applicable also to the management of more common diseaseD001847 including diseaseD010024.
1776023		diseaseC537523--a target-site approach.diseaseC537523 are a poorly understood group of diseaseC566440, much of whose etiology is still obscure. The list of conditions constituting this group is relatively short: diseaseD010022 (diseaseD010022), diseaseD058631 (diseaseD009087), enostosis (diseaseD007516), diseaseD010023, diseaseC536053 (diseaseD004194), progressive diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966), diseaseC537613 (diseaseC537613), four types of diseaseD010009 (diseaseD010009, diseaseC536748, diseaseC538335, and diseaseD007918), diseaseC562973, diseaseC536252 (diseaseC536252), diseaseC537519, diseaseD008557 (diseaseD008557), and diseaseC562940. There are instances in which two or more of the above disorders coexist. These are termed "overlap syndromes", most commonly involving diseaseC536053, diseaseD010023, and diseaseD008557. A classification of these diseaseD015792 is elaborated based on a targetsite approach that views them as disturbances in development associated with the processes of either endochondral or intramembranous bone formation, or both. Accumulated evidence suggests that many of these disorders stem from common defects in bone resorption and/or formation during the processes of skeletal maturation and modeling. Finally, the subgroup of overlap syndromes is emphasized as indicating a strong interrelationship between the diseaseC537523, with perhaps a common pathogenesis for many.

It has been previously reported that diseaseD003966 is caused by mutations of the ncbi7040 (ncbi7040) gene on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Until now, seven mutations (LLL12-13ins, variantrs111033611##, variantrs200482214##, variantrs104894721##, variantrs104894720##, variantrs281865485##, variantrs104894719##) in Australian, French, Belgian, Japanese, and European families have been reported and these data showed that there was no correlation between the nature of the mutations and the variability of the clinical manifestations. In this study, we found a Chinese family with diseaseD003966 and observed some intra-familial clinical variability and symptoms that became more severe with the age. A new ncbi7040 mutation (variantrs281865484##) in exon 2 was identified in the Chinese family using polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing analysis of PCR products and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. This mutation has not been previously reported in other countries in the world.

Increased bone remodeling secondary to increased osteoclastic activity appears to be the underlying feature of these disorders. These disorders include diseaseC537701, expansile diseaseC537701, diseaseC536053 striations, and diseaseC564689. The genetic mutations for a number of these disorders have been identified. We present a 9606 with diseaseC537701 whose clinical and radiographic features were somewhat different from these other well-defined syndromes. The 9606 was followed for 45 years until his diseaseD003643 of at age 49. The 9606 had massive diseaseC537701 with dense striations involving the entire shaft of his long bones. His spine, pelvis, short tubular bones, and calvarium were also involved. He suffered diseaseD034381 and diseaseD009896, but he kept his teeth throughout his life. He was tall with a diseaseC537328 habitus, and he had diseaseD007006 and diseaseD007037. There was no evidence of diseaseD008607, and other laboratory studies where within normal limits. This case, as well as other manifestations of diseaseC537701, attests to the complexity of the bone remodeling system.
18514293		Acquired diseaseD001139 secondary to diseaseD015576: a case report and literature review.BACKGROUND: Most cases of generalized diseaseD015576 are associated with diseaseD003966, diseaseC562940, Worth-type diseaseD010009, or diseaseC537525. Infrequently, a diseaseD001139 may also be described. We present the case of a 9606 with acquired diseaseD001139 secondary to hyperostotic skull formation whose findings did not fit into any of the 4 usual conditions. We review the literature on generalized diseaseD015576 and discuss the appropriate treatment based on our analysis of the literature and the 9606's imaging results. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old 9606 presented with diseaseD006261, diseaseD014839, and diseaseD014786. Imaging revealed diseaseD015576 and an acquired diseaseD001139. Intracranial pressure was markedly increased. She underwent a reduction craniotomy with subtemporal decompression and had good clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: diseaseD001139 in association with diseaseD015576 is an unusual finding. Our 9606 could not be classified into any of the 4 main hyperostotic conditions. Careful attention to imaging identified the diseaseD015576 and deflected treatment from the standard for diseaseD001139, suboccipital decompression, which could have proved fatal. Instead, a reduction craniotomy with subtemporal decompression relieved the source of the increased ICP and of the downward tonsilar displacement.

Here we find that seven different 10090 models of 9606 diseaseD009362-representing diseaseD001943, as well as diseaseD009101-exhibited impaired muscle function, implicating a role for the diseaseD009369-bone microenvironment in diseaseD009369-associated diseaseD018908. We found that ncbi21803, released from the bone surface as a result of diseaseD009362-induced diseaseD001847, upregulated ncbi50490 (ncbi50490), resulting in elevated oxidization of skeletal muscle proteins, including the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel (ncbi20190). The oxidized ncbi20190 channels leaked Ca(2+), resulting in lower intracellular signaling, which is required for proper muscle contraction. We found that inhibiting ncbi20190 leakage, ncbi21803 signaling, ncbi21803 release from bone or ncbi50490 activity improved muscle function in 10090 with 0062 diseaseD009362. 9606 with diseaseD001943-associated diseaseD009362 also had oxidized skeletal muscle ncbi20190 that is not seen in normal muscle. Similarly, skeletal diseaseD018908, increased ncbi50490 binding to ncbi20190 and oxidation of ncbi20190 were present in a 10090 model of diseaseD003966, a nonmalignant diseaseD001851 associated with increased ncbi21803 activity. Thus, pathological ncbi21803 release from bone contributes to diseaseD018908 by decreasing Ca(2+)-induced muscle force production.

Corticosteroids, chemicalD004164, and chemicalD019808 have been reported to be effective systemic medications used to reduce diseaseD003966 symptoms. There are no reports of diseaseD018215 in 9606 with diseaseD003966, and diseaseD018215 in the distal radius is rare. We present a 9606 diagnosed with diseaseD003966, based on radiological and histological examinations, at 11 years old. At 22 years old, she experienced severe diseaseD010146 in her right forearm and was treated with chemicalD004164, chemicalD019808, and chemicalD011239; however, the diseaseD010146 continued. An expansive and sclerotic lesion at the distal radius was observed on radiography. A follow-up plain radiograph indicated that the lesion was growing. chemicalD019788 positron emission tomography revealed solitary, intense radiotracer uptake, and a biopsy and surgical resection were performed due to suspected diseaseD009369. Pathologic analysis showed anastomosing bony trabeculae rimmed by osteoblasts observed in a loose fibrovascular stroma. The lesion was diagnosed as an diseaseD018215. Following bone excision and artificial bone grafting, the 9606's severe diseaseD010146 almost completely disappeared. At final follow-up, no evidence of diseaseD018215 recurrence was noted. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of diseaseD018215 arising in a 9606 with diseaseD003966. Bone excision and artificial bone grafting may be a treatment option for local symptomatic diseaseD018215 in 9606 with diseaseD003966.

The authors report on two 9606 with typical presentation of severe diseaseD003966 whose treatment with chemicalD004164 failed to add any improvement beyond that elicited by corticosteroids alone.
2734958		[diseaseD003966 (progressive diseaseD003966). Differential diagnostic problems].The diseaseD003966 is characterized by diseaseD015576, which can appear mainly bilaterally symmetrical at the diaphyses of the long bones, but also at all other bones of the skeleton. The diseaseD003966 is a rare one, up to now hardly more than 120 cases have been published. The rarity explains the fact that the disease is often misdiagnosed and mistaken for other diseaseD001847. This is a case report of a diseaseD003966 which was detected by radiological diagnosis. The problem of differential-diagnosis is described.
23368730	Association|diseaseD003966|ncbi7040	diseaseD000568 in a diseaseD003966--a case report.OBJECTIVE: A case report of a 9606 diagnosed with diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) in association with the functional diseaseD000568. diseaseD003966 is a very rare genetically determined disorder classified as a type of diseaseD001848. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, 3rd grade Medical University Hospital. 9606: Twenty-one years old female 9606 with diseaseD003966 admitted to the hospital because of primary diseaseD000568. Her history revealed diseaseD009140 and diseaseD034381. METHODS: Clinical examination, ultrasound, laboratory evaluations (including serum gonadotropins (FSH, LH) at basal state and after stimulation with ncbi2796, serum basal chemicalD004958) radiological studies (X-ray of the head, the lumbar spine and lower extremities; a computed tomography of the head), G-banding karyotype, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Hormonal serum evaluations were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The exon 4 of the ncbi7040 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction and the product was directly sequenced. RESULTS: The hormonal analysis was characteristic for the diseaseD007006. Radiological and molecular analyses confirmed diseaseD003966 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The diseaseD000568 in a 9606 with diseaseD003966 may be explained as a consequence of diseaseD004620 and very low body mass index. Therefore, diseaseD007029 in 9606 with diseaseD003966 should be treated with special attention.

We studied osteoclast formation in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from three related diseaseD003966 9606 harboring the variantrs104894721## mutation, in comparison with one family-based and several unrelated controls. Osteoclast formation was enhanced approximately 5-fold (P < 0.001) and bone resorption approximately 10-fold (P < 0.001) in diseaseD003966 9606, and the increase in osteoclast formation was inhibited by soluble ncbi7048. Total serum ncbi7040 levels were similar in affected and unaffected subjects, but concentrations of active ncbi7040 in conditioned medium of osteoclast cultures was higher in the three diseaseD003966 9606 than in the unaffected family member. We concluded that the variantrs104894721## mutation increases ncbi7040 bioactivity and enhances osteoclast formation in vitro. The activation of osteoclast activity noted here is consistent with clinical reports that have shown biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption as well as bone formation in diseaseD003966.
9933401		diseaseD003966: a late and sporadic case with metaphyseal involvement.A 40-year-old white man with a 3-year history of mild to severe right diseaseD046788 was referred for radiographic investigation. Radiographs show a fusiform, bilaterally symmetrical enlargement of the diaphyses and metaphyses of the long bones (femur, tibia, fibula, radius and ulna). A narrowed medullary cavity is illustrated on CT scan of the femur. All bones show periosteal and endosteal bone formation. There is no history of familial involvement, diseaseD014947, diseaseD007239 or diseaseD012140. Blood chemistry could not point out any abnormality. Radiographic findings and clinical history suggest the diagnosis of diseaseD003966, also known as progressive diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966). This case is of interest because of its rare metaphyseal involvement, mild form and sporadic presentation.
7917133		diseaseD003966: contribution of bone scintigraphy to genetic counseling.diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) is a rare diseaseD009386 characterized by progressive, bilaterally symmetrical diseaseC537613. Severely affected 9606 show diseaseD018908, waddling gait and severe diseaseD010146 in the extremities. However, clinical and radiological investigations in families with diseaseD003966 demonstrate a wide variability in expression of the manifestations. Asymptomatic 9606 were in several instances diagnosed only after radiologic screening of relatives. Although considered an diseaseD030342, families are described where neither clinical nor radiological manifestations can be demonstrated in direct ancestors of 9606. Combining roentgenographic examination with bone scintigraphy seems therefore necessary in confirming or ruling out diseaseD003966 in each family member.

Five mutations consistently located in the ncbi7040 propeptide have been hitherto identified in 21 families. Here, we report on ncbi7040 mutations in one Australian and six European families. Three distinct mutations were identified among seven families: namely, variantrs104894720## (family 1), variantrs104894721## (families 2, 6, 7) and variantrs104894719## (families 3, 4, 5). The three mutations identified in our pedigrees have been previously observed in families of Japanese and Israeli origin and the variantrs104894721## appears to be the most prevalent mutation worldwide (17/28 reported families). No obvious correlation between the nature of the mutations and the severity of the clinical manifestations could be established, but a marked intrafamilial clinical variability was observed, supporting incomplete penetrance of diseaseD003966. Interestingly, the polymorphisms in the ncbi7040 gene showed no correlation with the severity of the disease. We conclude that diseaseD003966 is a clinically variable condition and that this clinical variability is not accounted for by polymorphisms at the ncbi7040 locus.

During therapy, disease activity was assessed serially using bone scintigraphy with chemicalC024226. With chemicalD000077268 administration, the diseaseD010146 became worse and diaphyseal uptake of chemicalC024226 increased, whereas corticosteroid administration improved the diseaseD010146 and reduced the diaphyseal uptake. In this case, chemicalD000077268 and corticosteroid produced different effects. Bone scintigraphy allowed an objective assessment of the response to these treatments, accurately reflecting clinical symptoms.

Radiographs of the long bones of a 9-year-old boy presenting with diseaseD020234, diseaseD018908, diseaseD013851, and severe diseaseD010146 showed symmetric diaphyseal cortical thickening pathognomonic for diseaseD003966. The diagnosis was verified by detecting a mutation in exon 4 of the ncbi7040 gene. Full body bone mineral densitometry studies performed before treatment with chemicalD011239 were indicative for diseaseD010024 (Z-scores for the lumbar spine and femoral neck -2.3 and -3.2, respectively). A transiliac bone biopsy showed markedly reduced trabecular bone volume. Oral chemicalD011239 was initiated, and subsequently, chemicalD000077268 infusions were commenced in an attempt to prevent progression of diseaseD010024. To our knowledge, this is the first time bone biopsy and bone mineral densitometry studies have been performed and chemicalD004164 treatment evaluated in a child with diseaseD003966.

This rare disorder belongs to the group of diseaseD010009 and affects primarily the diaphyses of long bones. Sporadic as well as familial cases have been observed. Although the cause and pathogenetic mechanism of the disease are unknown, an autosomal dominant inheritance is being discussed. Diagnosis was based on radiological findings, which are presented along with the scintigraphic appearance of the disease.

Radiologically, both had wide medullary cavities with discrete cortical hyperosthosis. Bone marrow was hypocellular.

12846694		diseaseD003966. Review of radioclinical features.PURPOSE: To present a retrospective overview of the clinical and radiological features of diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) in a large family with genetically proven diseaseD003966. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical features and imaging studies were available in 8 affected 9606 out of a large Jewish-Iraqi family with 21 affected members in four generations. The 9606' ages ranged between 7 and 44 years. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent symptoms were diseaseD010146 and diseaseD018908 accompanied by waddling gait. Two 9606 were asymptomatic. Radiologically, the disease can be classified as a diseaseD015576. Typically, fusiform thickening of the diaphyseal portions of the long bones was seen in all 8 9606, but in 1 9606, metaphyseal involvement was observed as well. diseaseD000014 were most often detected before the age of 30, and were usually more extensive at older age. diseaseD000014 may precede the clinical signs. Concomitant broadening of the diaphyses of long bones and narrowing of the medullary canal suggest that both an excessive periosteal apposition of bone and a defective resorption of bone at the endosteal side of the long bones exist.
3220732		diseaseD003966. A case report.diseaseD003966 is a rare diseaseD030342 characterised by diseaseD015576 and diseaseD012598 with a predilection for the long bones of the lower limbs. The authors report a case in an adult with a family history of the disease, and multiple localisations in the diaphyses of the long bones. The site of diseaseD010146 and greatest involvement of the disease was the right tibia and fibula. The affection was treated by drilling and reaming the medullary canal with drills of increasing diameter. This method is easy to carry out, causes little diseaseD014947, and has undoubted advantages in greatly reducing the period of bedrest and aiding functional recovery.

The role of the missense variantrs104894721## mutation in ncbi7040 in bones and endocrine glands.OBJECTIVES: diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) is a rare form of progressive diseaseD001848 due to mutations in the transforming factor gene ncbi7040 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. diseaseD004700 such as diseaseD010024, diseaseD014808, diseaseD011628 and diseaseD007006 may be present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the ncbi7040 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation variantrs104894721## in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of diseaseD003966, diseaseD006966 and menstrual irregularity. The 9606 responded well to chemicalD011241 5 mg/kg per day as well as chemicalD002118 and chemicalD014807 supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of variantrs104894721## in ncbi7040 on the mechanism of the disease itself and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands remain unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is important for future treatment options and better quality of life of such 9606.
10685567		Cochlear implantation for auditory rehabilitation in diseaseD003966.diseaseD003966 (diseaseC537613) is a rare diseaseC538213 involving the diaphyses of the long bones, skull base, and clavicles. Progressive diseaseD003389 has been implicated in diseaseD003389. including diseaseD005155, diseaseD015837, and diseaseD034381. Two 9606 with diseaseD003966 and concomitant diseaseD006319 are presented. Both 9606 were evaluated for cochlear implantation. One 9606 was successfully implanted after preoperative imaging revealed no involvement of the internal auditory canals. The porous nature of the affected bone, however. necessitated the inactivation of 1 electrode to prevent facial nerve stimulation. A second 9606 was rejected as a potential implant recipient due, in part, to narrow internal auditory canals and rapidly progressive disease. The otologic manifestations of diseaseD003966 are reviewed, and issues related to cochlear implantation in this rare disease are discussed.
8894811		diseaseD003966 presenting as 'diseaseD010040'.diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966, MIM # 131300) was diagnosed in a 27-year-old 9606, who had diseaseD010146 her lower diseaseD010264. There was no history of diseaseD034381 (or diseaseD003966) in her family. She had been suffering from progressive diseaseD034381 since childhood. Serial audiograms demonstrated progressive mixed diseaseD034381 from the age of 11 years onwards, for which she underwent successful stapes surgery bilaterally at the age of 13-18 years. Clinical ('juvenile') diseaseD010040 was found with stapes footplate fixation. Unfortunately, the diseaseD006319 component proved to be progressive bilaterally after surgery. At the age of 30 years, she experienced more rapid deterioration of her diseaseD034381 in the right ear and episodes of diseaseD014717. Vestibular examinations demonstrated progressive diseaseD015837 'diseaseD009059 with encroachment on the cochlear and vestibular labyrinth were found on high resolution CT scans at the age of 40 years; the internal auditory canal was normal bilaterally. diseaseD003966 may have formed a chance combination with diseaseD010040 in our 9606, or diseaseD010040 may be part of the diseaseD003966 phenotype.
2548243		[Observations on the diseaseD003966. Demonstration of changes of the petrous bone using high-resolution computed tomography].In diseaseD003966 HR-CT can impressively demonstrate the involvement of the skull base and also correlate well with the clinical symptoms of diseaseD003638, diseaseD015837 and diseaseD005158. Since conservative treatment with corticosteroids, calcitonin and chemicalD004164 is hardly successful and compression of the cranial nerves practically absent, surgical treatment with decompression should be considered. Differential diagnosis against other diseaseD001847 with diseaseD003638 depends on age, typical x-ray findings, local distribution and clinical signs.

A ncbi21803 point mutation (variantrs281865485##), derived from published cases of diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966), has been shown to constitutively activate ncbi21803, leading to excess bone matrix production. Although diseaseD003966 has been well documented in clinical case reports, there are no published studies on the effect of diseaseD003966 on the dentition. The objective of this study was to determine the dental manifestations of hyperactivated ncbi21803 signaling using an established 10090 model of diseaseD003966-derived ncbi21803 mutation. 10090 dental tissues were studied via radiography, micro-CT, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Results showed that initial decreased dental mineralized tissue density is resolved. Proliferation assays of incisor pulp and alveolar bone cell cultures revealed that cells from transgenic animals displayed a reduced rate of growth compared to alveolar bone cultures from wild-type 10090. ncbi21803 family gene expression analysis indicated significant fold changes in the expression of ncbi11647, ncbi12156, ncbi12824, Fgf, Mmp, ncbi12393, ncbi21809, Tfgbr3, and ncbi22337 genes. Assessment of SIBLINGs revealed downregulation of ncbi15891, ncbi13406, ncbi666279, ncbi94111, and ncbi20750, as well as reduced staining for ncbi12156 and ncbi22337 in mesenchymal-derived pulp tissue in diseaseD003966 animals. Treatment of dental pulp cells with recombinant 9606 ncbi7040 resulted in increased SIBLING gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide in vivo evidence suggesting that TFG-beta1 mediates expression of important dentin extracellular matrix components secreted by dental pulp, and when unbalanced, may contribute to abnormal diseaseD003805.
3615880		Progressive diseaseD003966 (Camurati-Engelmann): radiographic follow-up and CT findings.Sixteen 9606 with progressive diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) and aged six months to 76 years were examined. Fourteen cases were hereditary, two were not. The progression of the radiologic manifestations in 13 9606 who were followed up from 1 to 32 years and the computed tomography (CT) scans from five 9606 were obtained. The progression of diseaseD003966 was slow and unpredictable, from minimal endosteal thickening of the mid-diaphyses in one pair of long diseaseD001847 to severe diseaseD012598 of long diseaseD001847, skull, and vertebrae. The severity of the osseous changes was not age dependent. A six-stage system was used to grade the severity of involvement and progression of diseaseD003966. CT scans demonstrated muscle mass that was preserved and showed the distribution of the diseaseC535282, which was irregular and inhomogeneous. CT scanning was advantageous over plain radiography in this respect. Endosteal involvement was more extensive than periosteal thickening. CT scans also showed a distinct pattern of diseaseC535781 that was confined to the posterior areas of the vertebral body and arches. In light of the paucity of characteristic clinical signs of diseaseD003966, the recognition of the radiologic features is mandatory for the diagnosis of this disease.

Although several treatments for diseaseD003966 complicated with diseaseD010024 have been described, it remains controversial whether such therapy is suitable for diseaseD003966 9606. We retrospectively enrolled a 66-year-old female 9606 with diseaseD010024 in diseaseD003966 who underwent chemicalD000069448 therapy for 14 months. chemicalD000069448 was commenced after 3 years of chemicalD019386 treatment. Fourteen months later, lumbar and total hip bone mineral density showed gains of 5.9% and 6.4%, respectively. Bone turnover markers were also improved during follow-up. No diseaseD050723 or other complications were recorded during the observational period. This is the first study describing chemicalD000069448 treatment for an diseaseD003966 9606. Our findings indicate that chemicalD000069448 is an effective therapy option for diseaseD010024 in diseaseD003966.
30091466	Positive_Correlation|diseaseD003966|ncbi21803	Bone-targeted delivery of TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor rescues uncoupled bone remodeling in diseaseD003966.diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) is a genetic diseaseC564010 mainly caused by mutations in the gene that encodes ncbi21803 (ncbi21803). Symptoms of diseaseD003966 include diseaseD010146, diseaseD050723, and diseaseD015792. Currently, effective therapies for diseaseD050723 and diseaseD015792 in diseaseD003966 are urgently needed. We have demonstrated that ncbi21803 is a coupling factor for bone remodeling and is aberrantly activated in diseaseD003966. Daily injection of TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor (TbetaR1I) attenuated diseaseD003966 symptoms, but this systemic administration caused serious side effects. In this study, we created a conjugate linking TbetaR1I and chemicalD019386, which delivered TbetaR1I specifically to bone. After weekly injection of the conjugate for 8 weeks, normal bone morphology and remodeling in diseaseD003966 10090 was maintained with a minimum effective dose 700 times lower than TbetaR1I injection. Additionally, we found that the conjugate restored normal bone turnover by reducing the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, maintained a regular osteogenic microenvironment by regulating the formation of ncbi18613 and ncbi59308 double-positive vessels, and preserved ordinary bone formation via inhibition of the migration of ncbi16847-positive cells. Thus, targeting delivery of TbetaR1I to bone is a promising therapy for diseaseD003966 and other uncoupled diseaseD001847.

Radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and histopathologic imaging studies were obtained. Hypersclerosis of the affected bones led to the initiation of a diseaseC538213 workup and sequencing of the ncbi7040 gene located on chromosome 19q13 revealed a heterozygous rare missense variant in exon-4, leading to a final diagnosis of diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966). Medical treatment thus far has had a minimal effect on her symptoms, and the 9606 continues to be followed. CONCLUSIONS: This specific mutation has been reported only once previously in a 9606 with diseaseD003966. This case report expands the typical phenotype associated with diseaseD003966 in association with the variantrs104894722##, variantrs104894722## variant.
31899347		Genetic testing is useful in adults with limited phenotypes of genetic skeletal conditions.We show the value of genetic screening in 3 adults with limited phenotypes of three diseaseC537523 (diseaseD030342): diseaseD010022 (diseaseD010022), diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) and diseaseD058631. INTRODUCTION: diseaseD010022, diseaseD003966 and diseaseD058631 are three rare diseaseD001847 often diagnosed in childhood. However, some atypical phenotypes raise the problem of delayed diagnosis in adults. Genetic tests may then be useful to establish a formal diagnosis. METHODS: We report 3 cases of adult 9606 with symptomatic or asymptomatic diseaseD001847 for whom the clinical, radiological and biological explorations were atypical and did not allow a formal diagnosis. These unusual descriptions led to the search for genetic mutations. RESULTS: These 3 cases of limited phenotypes were associated with unknown or poorly described variants of 3 rare diseaseD001847. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic tests proved useful to establish the diagnosis and manage the condition of adults with rare diseaseC537523.

In this study, a retrospective review of 9606 with diseaseD003966 evaluated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, China, between November 30, 2000 and November 30, 2020 was conducted. Data including demographic data, manifestations, and examination results were characterized. Furthermore, bone geometry, density, and microarchitecture were assessed and bone strength was estimated by HR-pQCT. Results showed the median age at onset was 2.5 years. Common manifestations included diseaseD010146 in the lower limbs (94%, 17/18), diseaseD020233 (89%, 16/18), diseaseD056304 (89%, 16/18), reduced subcutaneous diseaseD004620 (78%, 14/18), diseaseD011628 (73%, 8/11), diseaseD018908 (67%, 12/18), diseaseD034381 (39%, 7/18), diseaseC535727 (39%, 7/18), diseaseD005094 or diseaseD014786 (33%, 6/18), and diseaseD000740 (33%, 7/18). Twenty-five percent (4/16) of 9606 had diseaseD006130. Serum level of alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 41% (7/17) of 9606 whereas beta-C-terminal telopeptide was elevated in 91% of 9606 (10/11). Among 12 9606, the Z-scores of two 9606 were greater than 2.5 at the femur neck and the Z-scores of five 9606 were lower than -2.5 at the femur neck and/or lumbar spine. HR-pQCT results showed lower volumetric BMD (vBMD), altered bone microstructure and lower estimated bone strength at the distal radius and tibia in 9606 with diseaseD003966 compared with controls. In addition, total volume bone mineral density and cortical volumetric bone mineral density at the radius were negatively correlated with age in 9606 with diseaseD003966, but positively correlated with age in controls. In conclusion, the largest case series of diseaseD003966 with characterized clinical features in a Chinese population was reported here. In addition, HR-pQCT was used to investigate bone microstructure at the distal radius and tibia in nine 9606 with diseaseD003966, and the alteration of bone density, microstructure, and strength was shown for the first time.   2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

This condition is caused by heterozygous mutations in the ncbi7040 gene. METHODS: We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 4 Korean 9606 with this rare disease diagnosed at Asan Medical Center in Korea between June 2012 and May 2016, to increase awareness about this condition among general physicians and orthopedists. The presenting features, biochemical findings, radiographic and nuclear imaging findings, molecular analysis, and treatment outcomes of 4 9606 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two 9606 had sporadic disease, whereas the other 2 were familial cases. The average age at symptom onset was 8.8 +- 5.5 (4-14) years. Symptoms included diseaseD020234 or diseaseD010146. diseaseD010146 and easy fatigability were documented in all 9606. diseaseD009140 such as diseaseD010024, diseaseD056304, and severe diseaseD012600 were observed. Visual and otologic manifestations presenting as diseaseD005094, diseaseD012163, and diseaseD065635 were found in 3 9606. Skeletal survey showed diaphyseal expansion with diffuse cortical thickening of long bones in all 9606. Bone scintigraphy images showed increased uptake of radioactive material in the calvarium and diaphysis of long bones. The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 46.5 +- 22.2 (20-72) mm/h. Sequence analysis of ncbi7040 revealed the previously reported mutations variantrs104894720##, variantrs104894721##, and variantrs281865484##. Corticosteroid was effective in relieving diseaseD010146, and chemicalD019808 was used as maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that this rare condition can be suspected in 9606 with characteristic symptoms and skeletal findings. Considering the presence of effective medical treatment, efforts are needed to identify more cases.
28724827		diseaseD000793 in a case of diseaseD003966.diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) is a rare diseaseD030342 with various phenotypic expressions. The hallmark of the disease is diseaseD003966 with progressive involvement of the metaphysis. Ocular manifestations occur rarely and mainly result from bony overgrowth of the orbit and diseaseD003251. We report a case of diseaseD003966 showing diseaseD000793 (diseaseD000793) in both fundi with no macular involvement and discuss the possible theories of the pathogenesis of AS in this disease.
6472973		diseaseD003966: genetics and clinical and radiologic manifestations.diseaseD003966 was found in a three-generation family including 13 affected individuals, the largest family reported to date. Our study confirms that diseaseD003966, also known as diseaseD003966 or diseaseD003966, is an diseaseD030342 with variable osseous and muscular manifestations. Disease distribution among 9606, within a given 9606, or even in individual bones is unpredictable. The femur is the most commonly and severely affected bone and hence most useful for radiographic screening of possible 9606. Radiographs provide a meaningful assessment of disease activity and extent. The severity of symptoms is generally proportionate to severity of involvement shown by roentgenography. diseaseD005094 due to diseaseC535282 occurred in more than half of the 9606 with diseaseD003966. Twelve-year follow-up of this family, with affected individuals ranging in age from 6 months to 12 years, indicates that diseaseD003966 may progress or become quiescent and be remarkably inactive despite advanced diseaseD010026 and structural diseaseD009140.

This review is based on the unpublished and detailed clinical, radiological, and molecular findings in 14 diseaseD003966 families, comprising 41 9606, combined with data from 10 other previously reported diseaseD003966 families. For all 100 cases, molecular evidence for diseaseD003966 was available, as a mutation was detected in ncbi7040, the gene encoding ncbi7040. diseaseD010146 in the extremities was the most common clinical symptom, present in 68% of the 9606. A diseaseD020234 (48%), easy fatigability (44%), and diseaseD018908 (39%) were other important features. Radiological symptoms were not fully penetrant, with 94% of the 9606 showing the typical diseaseD050398. A large percentage of the 9606 also showed involvement of the skull (54%) and pelvis (63%). The review provides an overview of possible treatments, diagnostic guidelines, and considerations for prenatal testing. The detailed description of such a large set of diseaseD003966 9606 will be of value in establishing the correct diagnosis, genetic counselling, and treatment.

It is characterized by diseaseD050398, Clinically 9606 will have diseaseD010146, proximal diseaseD018908 a wide-based gait. The gene causing diseaseD003966 is located on chromosome 19, this region contains the gene encoding the ncbi7040. The diagnosis of diseaseD003966 is established in a proband with the characteristic radiographic findings and molecular genetic testing for ncbi7040 mutation. Treatment is with corticosteroids and chemicalD019808. MATERIALS: A 40 year old lady presented with complaints of Left diseaseD010146 for 1 year duration. On examination there was diseaseD063806 of left greater trochanter, proximal and distal femur was present. Blood investigations showed high ncbi5741 and low chemicalD002762. Imaging showed non specific diseaseC538213 in femur. As 9606 brother had limp since childhood diseaseD030342 were and a provisional diagnosis of diseaseC538213 probable Progressive diseaseD003966 was considered. PET-CT was done which revealed abnormal osteoblastic activity in both femurs, focal diseaseD015576 in humeral diaphysis suggestive of diseaseD003966. She was tested Positive for ncbi7040 mutation consistent with diseaseD003966. He was started on chemicalD019808. On follow up 9606 is diseaseD010146 free. RESULT: Her brother was also evaluated in view of his limp and he was also diagnosed as diseaseD003966. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis in this case was based on the clinical history, family history and characteristic radiological findings and genetic testing which confirmed ncbi7040 mutation. Family history is crucial in this case which led to diagnosis. References Van Hul W, Boudin E, Vanhoenacker FM, et al. diseaseD003966.

Conservative treatment of diseaseD009408 cranial diseaseC537568 is almost ineffective, but the aim of surgical treatment is decompression of involved diseaseC537568. The differential diagnosis depends on radiological findings and clinical symptoms. Follow-up depends on radiographic examination and skeletal scintigraphy for showing the extent of the disease.

16707036		Unusual otological manifestations in diseaseD003966.diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) is a rare diseaseD009386 affecting mainly the diaphysis of long bones but diseaseD003389 may also develop secondary to diseaseD018213 their foramina, including diseaseD014786, diseaseD005158, diseaseD003638, diseaseD015837 and diseaseD012678 along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. diseaseD003638 has been reported in about 18 per cent of these cases due to narrowing of the internal auditory canals caused by bony encroachment on nerves and vessels. We report an extremely rare case of a 9606 with diseaseD003966 who presented with diseaseD003638 due to gross abnormalities affecting both middle ear and cochlea. The issues relating to the management of these 9606 with diseaseD001847 are discussed.

Mutations in the gene (ncbi7040) that encodes ncbi7040 (ncbi7040) are causative for diseaseD003966. ncbi7040 signaling is enhanced by the diseaseD003966-causing mutations. In this study, we performed ncbi21803 mutation screening in an chemicalD005038-mutagenized 10090 genomic DNA library. We identified a missense mutation in which variantrs104894719## (variantrs104894719##), that corresponded to the diseaseD003966-causing mutation (variantrs104894719##). ncbi7040 mutant protein carrying variantrs104894719## was secreted normally into the extracellular space. Reporter gene assays showed that the variantrs104894719## mutants enhanced ncbi21803 signaling at the same level as variantrs104894719## mutants. We generated variantrs104894719## homozygous 10090 and confirmed that the mature ncbi21803 levels in the culture supernatants of the calvarial cells from the homozygotes were significantly higher than those from wild-type 10090. Although the skull and femur are sclerotic in diseaseD003966, these phenotypes were not observed in variantrs104894719## homozygous 10090. These results suggest that 9606 and 10090 bone tissue react differently to ncbi21803. These findings are useful to pharmacological studies using 10090 models in developing drugs that will target ncbi21803 signaling.
16638728	Association|diseaseD007006|ncbi7040; Association|diseaseD003966|ncbi7040	diseaseD003966 in conjunction with diseaseD007006.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) in conjunction with diseaseD007006, an association that has not been previously described. METHODS: We present the clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic features of our case. In addition, we review the molecular genetics of diseaseD003966. RESULTS: diseaseD003966 is a rare diseaseD000130, characterized by bilaterally symmetric, progressive diseaseD001848. The typical features of this disorder are hyperostotic and sclerotic changes in the bones, primarily of the extremities. Our 9606, a 49-year-old male resident of a nursing home, presented with diseaseD018908, waddling gait, diseaseD010146, and increased fatigability, usual features of diseaseD003966 (which had been formally diagnosed when he was 8 years old). He also had diseaseD007010, diseaseD006947, and almost undetectable serum chemicalD013739. The gene responsible for diseaseD003966 has been mapped to the same locus as the gene for the synthesis of transforming growth factor (ncbi7040). Mutations in the ncbi7040 gene have been identified in 9606 with diseaseD003966. ncbi7040 also has an important role in reproductive function, both during embryogenesis and in adulthood. It has predominant effects on steroidogenesis as well as spermatogenesis. We discuss the hormonal and histopathologic changes in our 9606 and postulate that the association of diseaseD003966 with diseaseD007006 could be attributable to the impaired regulation of gonadal growth and steroidogenesis, in which ncbi7040 has an important role. CONCLUSION: We propose that the association of diseaseD003966 with diseaseD007006 could be explained on the basis of a common underlying mutation in the ncbi7040 gene, leading to accumulation of excessive ncbi7040.

The most common clinical manifestations were diseaseD059350, waddling diseaseD020234, diseaseD018908. 9606 CONCERNS: We described that a 27-year-old male with a 1-year history of intermittent diseaseD013746 was referred for bone scintigraphy. The whole body bone scan images showed abnormal increased uptake of the tracer in the long bones of the upper and lower extremities as well as in the skull. diseaseD065886: Combined the family history, the findings of the images and the genetic study, the diagnosis of diseaseD003966 was confirmed. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The 9606 responded well to the treatment of chemicalD002125. LESSONS: Bone scintigraphy would be helpful in the diagnosis and assessing the severity of diseaseD003966.

Whereas the initial CT scan showed bandlike, undermineralized pericochlear areas, 2 years later, repeat CT performed because of diseaseD034381 showed progression of these findings to the promontory, the round window niche, and the labyrinthine and tympanic segments of the facial nerve canal. MR imaging demonstrated enhancement of the abnormal otic capsule and of the intratemporal and canalicular facial nerve. The differential diagnosis of diseaseD010013 temporal diseaseD001847 includes diseaseD010040, diseaseC537701, otosyphilis, and diseaseD003966.
20566907		Skull base manifestations of diseaseD003966.OBJECTIVE: To describe presenting symptoms, evaluation findings, and surgical management of diseaseC565666 in 9606 with diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966). DESIGN: Retrospective study and literature review. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. 9606: A total of 306 9606 diagnosed as having diseaseD003966, including 12 primarily evaluated at our institution between 1968 and 2008, and 294 identified in the international literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presenting symptoms, methods of diagnosis, treatment strategies, and 9606 outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three of 306 9606 (56.5%) had radiographically proven diseaseD019292, whereas less than one-fourth were symptomatic. The most common manifestations of diseaseC565666 were diseaseD034381 (19.0%), diseaseD006261 (10.4%), diseaseD005094 (8.2%), and diseaseD020233 (7.2%); less common were diseaseD014786, diseaseD014717, diseaseD018908, symptomatic diseaseD009408, diseaseD006987, and diseaseD000086582. Although corticosteroids and bisphosphates may treat torso and extremity involvement, they demonstrate no benefit for symptomatic diseaseD019292. In select symptomatic 9606, aggressive decompression surgery may provide the only means of treatment. Decompression surgery is more challenging with thick sclerotic bone, loss or obscuration of bony landmarks, and decreased supratentorial space. 9606 must be counseled on the increased risks associated with surgery and the potential for redeposition of bone and recurrence of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include diseaseD003966 in the differential diagnosis for 9606 with radiographic evidence of skull diseaseD013585 and synchronous diseaseD003389 or symptoms of diseaseD019586. In mild forms of the disease, the clinical course of 9606 should be followed with serial examination, audiometric testing, and radiography. In select 9606 with progressive cranial base symptoms, aggressive wide decompression of involved neurovascular structures may provide benefit.

Biochemical and radiographic examinations, bone scintigraphy and genetic analyses were performed in two affected males and their parents. The two 9606 experienced diseaseD020234, diseaseD018908 and growth diseaseD002658. X-ray radiography revealed typical fusiform thickening of the diaphyseal portions of the long bones. The abnormal uptake of tracer chemicalD013667 was visualized in the skull and both sides of the upper humeri, ulnas, radii, femurs and tibias using bone scintigraphy. Serum levels of the bone formation marker procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and the bone resorption marker beta-isomerized C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) in the 6-year-old 9606 were significantly increased compared with the normal value range, while only the beta-CTX levels were elevated in the 16-year-old 9606. A heterozygous missense mutation variantrs104894721## in exon 4 of the ncbi7040 (ncbi7040) gene was detected in the two 9606, while their parents had normal wild-type genotypes. In conclusion, the variantrs104894721## mutation was shown to contribute to the clinical phenotypes in two pediatric 9606 with diseaseD003966. The results of this study suggest that abnormal bone turnover marker levels, typical radiological findings and mutations in the ncbi7040 gene are three important factors in the diagnosis of sporadic diseaseD003966 cases.

Mutations in ncbi7040 (ncbi7040) were recently found in 9606 with diseaseD003966. We report on a four-generation pedigree with seven individuals affected by diseaseD003966, linkage and mutational analysis results, and review the literature. This pedigree demonstrates the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, remarkable variation in expressivity, and reduced penetrance. The most severely affected individual had progression of mild diseaseD015576 to severe diseaseD013585 and diseaseD009408 over 30 years. His carrier father remained asymptomatic into his ninth decade and had no diseaseD015576 or diseaseD001847. Symptomatic relatives presented with diseaseD010146 and diseaseD018908. They were initially diagnosed with a variety of other conditions. Two of the symptomatic individuals were treated successfully with chemicalD011241. We genotyped 7 markers from chromosome region 19q13.1-13.3 in 15 relatives and confirmed linkage to this region in this family. We screened the ncbi7040 gene for mutations and identified a missense mutation resulting in an variantrs104894720## substitution in the affected individuals, the asymptomatic obligate carrier, and another unaffected relative. We genotyped the family for seven known ncbi7040 polymorphisms and a novel TAAA tetranucleotide repeat in intron 1. These polymorphisms did not appear to account for the variability in disease severity in this family. Our review illustrates how the disorder can significantly compromise health. Cranial involvement, which occurs in 61% of 9606, can be severe, entrapping cranial nerves or causing diseaseD019586. Therapy with corticosteroids should be attempted in all symptomatic 9606.

8187392	Association|chemicalD006854|diseaseD003966	Progressive diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966). Improvement of clinical signs and of bone scintigraphy during pregnancy.The case of a 9606 suffering from progressive diseaseD003966 is presented. Characteristic symptoms of crippling diseaseD010146 in both legs, severe aching in both forearms, and episodic diseaseD006261 were only partially regulated by corticosteroid treatment. However, pregnancy resulted in a progressive disappearance of these symptoms, allowing withdrawal of chemicalD013256 treatment. chemicalD013669 scintigraphy performed immediately after delivery showed a decrease of the intense uptake in the forearms, tibiae, and skull, which had been documented prior to pregnancy. However, widespread diseaseD010146 recurred within 6 weeks after delivery, accompanied by a recurrence of multiple severely hyperactive foci on bone scintigraphy. Alterations of immune modulated processes and changes in bone mineral homeostasis and in endogenous chemicalD006854 metabolism during pregnancy can be considered as possible explanations for the temporary improvement in clinical and scintigraphic signs of progressive diseaseD003966 in this 9606.
10997431		diseaseC537523: genetic and radioclinical features.Although knowledge of basic genetics in the field of diseaseC537523 is progressing, the radiologist still plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of this relatively poorly understood group of disorders. Based on a target site approach, these anomalies are classified into three groups. Within each group, further differentiation can be made by distinctive clinical findings and by mode of inheritance: (a) diseaseD001848: diseaseD010022 (diseaseD010022), diseaseD058631, enostosis, diseaseD010023, diseaseC536053 (diseaseD004194); (b) diseaseD001848: diseaseD003966 (diseaseD003966) and variants, diseaseD010009 (diseaseD010009) and variants; and (c) mixed diseaseD012598: diseaseD008557 (diseaseD008557) and overlap syndromes.

Treatment options are limited and have been suboptimal so far. 9606 AND METHODS: A prepubertal girl aged 9 years was diagnosed with diseaseD003966. Treatment with chemicalD019808 was initiated at a daily dose of 0.75 mg/kg. Over a period of 12 weeks, the dose was gradually increased to 1.0 mg/kg/d. The 9606 was reviewed in clinic regularly and underwent thorough clinical assessments 9, 17, and 38 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: The 9606 experienced marked clinical improvements with chemicalD019808. In particular, chemicalD019808 treatment led to the complete elimination of the previously severe and incapacitating diseaseD010146, with an increased ability to walk and perform physical activities. There was also a considerable improvement in body composition with increased lean and adipose tissue. Notably, the improvement in fat deposition had not been previously observed with other treatments in diseaseD003966. Hematology, liver, and renal function tests were within normal ranges at presentation and remained so over the course of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In light of our findings, chemicalD019808 may be a useful option in diseaseD003966 management.
15987595		Aggressive cranial vault decompression for diseaseD015576: technical case report of two cases.OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: diseaseD003966, also known as progressive diseaseC537569, is a diseaseD001851. Neurological manifestations of progressive diseaseC537569 include diseaseD003389, generalized diseaseD018908, diseaseD004677, and diseaseD019586. In the past, surgical intervention has been of limited and temporary benefit. We present two 9606 with diseaseD015576 secondary to diseaseD003966 who were treated successfully with a single surgery involving a combination of multiple craniotomies for cranial vault decompression. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two 9606 presented with signs and symptoms of diseaseD019586 secondary to diseaseD003966. Radiological workup revealed marked diseaseD015576. INTERVENTION: The 9606 underwent aggressive cranial vault decompression. Multiple craniotomies were performed, and the inner table was then drilled down until the bone was 1 cm thick. CONCLUSION: Effective surgical options are needed for clinically significant diseaseD015576. In an effort to further define operative management in these 9606, we describe a single, aggressive surgical procedure that may be used for successful cranial decompression.
19943817		Unusual association between diseaseD002812 and diseaseD003966: a case report.This case report describes an diseaseD002812 distal phalanx of the right little finger in a 37-year-old 9606 with diseaseD003966. Curettage of the diseaseD009369 and artificial bone grafting were performed in May 2004. Surgical treatment resulted in a good clinical outcome with no evidence of recurrence at 5-year follow-up. The genetic relationships between diseaseD003966 and diseaseD009369 are discussed.
