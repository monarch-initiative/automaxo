input_text: '[An incidental finding of a progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann
  syndrome)].In a 35 year-old female diaphyseal hyperostosis of femur and tibia indicative
  of a Camurati-Engelmann syndrome (progressive diaphyseal dysplasia) were discovered
  during routine phlebography. This rare disorder belongs to the group of osteochondrodysplasias
  and affects primarily the diaphyses of long bones. Sporadic as well as familial
  cases have been observed. Although the cause and pathogenetic mechanism of the disease
  are unknown, an autosomal dominant inheritance is being discussed. Diagnosis was
  based on radiological findings, which are presented along with the scintigraphic
  appearance of the disease.'
