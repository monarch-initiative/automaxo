input_text: '[Camurati-Engelmann disease (progressive diaphyseal dysplasia). Differential
  diagnostic problems].The Camurati-Engelmann disease is characterized by sclerotical
  hyperostosis, which can appear mainly bilaterally symmetrical at the diaphyses of
  the long bones, but also at all other bones of the skeleton. The Camurati-Engelmann
  disease is a rare one, up to now hardly more than 120 cases have been published.
  The rarity explains the fact that the disease is often misdiagnosed and mistaken
  for other bone diseases. This is a case report of a Camurati-Engelmann disease which
  was detected by radiological diagnosis. The problem of differential-diagnosis is
  described.'
