input_text: 'Efficacy of denosumab therapy after alendronate treatment for a 66-year-old
  woman with Camurati-Engelmann disease and osteoporosis: a case report.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) is characterized by hyperostois of multiple long bones. Although several
  treatments for CED complicated with osteoporosis have been described, it remains
  controversial whether such therapy is suitable for osteoporotic CED patients. We
  retrospectively enrolled a 66-year-old female patient with osteoporosis in CED who
  underwent denosumab therapy for 14 months. Denosumab was commenced after 3 years
  of alendronate treatment. Fourteen months later, lumbar and total hip bone mineral
  density showed gains of 5.9% and 6.4%, respectively. Bone turnover markers were
  also improved during follow-up. No fractures or other complications were recorded
  during the observational period. This is the first study describing denosumab treatment
  for an osteoporotic CED patient. Our findings indicate that denosumab is an effective
  therapy option for osteoporosis in CED.'
