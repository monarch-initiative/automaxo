input_text: Scintigraphic evaluation of pamidronate and corticosteroid therapy in
  a patient with progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease).A 27-year-old
  woman with progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease) received
  pamidronate and corticosteroid therapy for bone pain. During therapy, disease activity
  was assessed serially using bone scintigraphy with Tc-99m HMDP. With pamidronate
  administration, the bone pain became worse and diaphyseal uptake of Tc-99m HMDP
  increased, whereas corticosteroid administration improved the bone pain and reduced
  the diaphyseal uptake. In this case, pamidronate and corticosteroid produced different
  effects. Bone scintigraphy allowed an objective assessment of the response to these
  treatments, accurately reflecting clinical symptoms.
