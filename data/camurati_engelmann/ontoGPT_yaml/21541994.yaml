input_text: "Camurati-Engelmann disease: unique variant featuring a novel mutation
  in TGFbeta1 encoding transforming growth factor beta 1 and a missense change in
  TNFSF11 encoding RANK ligand.We report a 32-year-old man and his 59-year-old mother
  with a unique and extensive variant of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) featuring
  histopathological changes of osteomalacia and alterations within TGFbeta1 and TNFSF11
  encoding TGFbeta1 and RANKL, respectively. He suffered leg pain and weakness since
  childhood and reportedly grew until his late 20s, reaching 7 feet in height. He
  had deafness, perforated nasal septum, torus palatinus, disproportionately long
  limbs with knock-knees, low muscle mass, and pseudoclubbing. Radiographs revealed
  generalized skeletal abnormalities, including wide bones and cortical and trabecular
  bone thickening in keeping with CED, except that long bone ends were also affected.
  Lumbar spine and hip BMD Z-scores were + 7.7 and + 4.4, respectively. Biochemical
  markers of bone turnover were elevated. Hypocalciuria accompanied low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
  D (25[OH]D) levels. Pituitary hypogonadism and low serum insulin-like growth factor
  (IGF)-1 were present. Karyotype was normal. Despite vitamin D repletion, iliac crest
  histology revealed severe osteomalacia. Exon 1 of TNFRSF11A (RANK), exons 2, 3,
  and 4 of LRP5, and all coding exons and adjacent mRNA splice junctions of TNFRSF11B
  (OPG), SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1), and TNSALP (tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase)
  were intact. His asymptomatic and less dysmorphic 5'11'' mother, also with low serum
  25(OH)D, had milder clinical, radiological, biochemical, and histopathological findings.
  Both individuals were heterozygous for a novel 12-bp duplication (c.27_38dup, p.L10_L13dup)
  in exon 1 of TGFbeta1, predicting four additional leucine residues in the latency-associated-peptide
  segment of TGFbeta1, consistent with CED. The son was also homozygous for a single
  base transversion in TNFSF11, predicting a nonconservative amino acid change (c.107C
  > G, p.Pro36Arg) in the intracellular domain of RANKL that was heterozygous in his
  nonconsanguineous parents. This TNFSF11 variant was not found in the SNP Database,
  nor in published TNFSF11 association studies, but it occurred in four of the 134
  TNFSF11 alleles (3.0%) we tested randomly among individuals without CED. Perhaps
  the unique phenotype of this CED family is conditioned by altered RANKL activity."
