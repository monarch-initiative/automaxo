input_text: Rare osteodysplasia of the temporal bone.Temporal bone osteodysplasia
  can produce many different symptoms, such as involvement restricted to the temporal
  bone or impairment of other bones. We consider, in this study two entities that
  are rare osteodysplasia cases, which are osteopetrosis and Camurati-Engelmann disease,
  the latter being extremely rare. We present two cases of benign form of osteopetrosis
  (Albers-Schulenburg's disease), a patient of 11 years old and another one of 48
  years old, both male, and a patient of 28 years old, female, with Camurati-Engelmann's
  disease. The facial palsy was a manifestation in two of the patients. We discuss
  some aspects about the clinical manifestations, radiological findings, as well as
  differential diagnostic and therapy in view of the complications of the diseases.
