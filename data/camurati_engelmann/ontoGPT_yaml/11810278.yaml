input_text: 'Phenotypic variability at the TGF-beta1 locus in Camurati-Engelmann disease.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) [OMIM 131300] is an autosomal dominant sclerosing bone dysplasia recently
  ascribed to mutations of the transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) gene on chromosome
  19q13.1-q13.3. Five mutations consistently located in the TGF-beta1 propeptide have
  been hitherto identified in 21 families. Here, we report on TGF-beta1 mutations
  in one Australian and six European families. Three distinct mutations were identified
  among seven families: namely, R218H (family 1), R218C (families 2, 6, 7) and C225R
  (families 3, 4, 5). The three mutations identified in our pedigrees have been previously
  observed in families of Japanese and Israeli origin and the R218C appears to be
  the most prevalent mutation worldwide (17/28 reported families). No obvious correlation
  between the nature of the mutations and the severity of the clinical manifestations
  could be established, but a marked intrafamilial clinical variability was observed,
  supporting incomplete penetrance of CED. Interestingly, the polymorphisms in the
  TGF-beta1 gene showed no correlation with the severity of the disease. We conclude
  that CED is a clinically variable condition and that this clinical variability is
  not accounted for by polymorphisms at the TGF-beta1 locus.'
