input_text: 'Mild Camurati-Engelamann disease presenting with exophthalmos as the
  first and only manifestation: A case report.Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED; MIM
  131300), or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare autosomal dominant bone
  disease, which is caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1)
  gene on chromosome 19q13.1-13.3. Extremely variable penetrance has been reported
  to be associated with CED, the most common features of which are limb pain, waddling
  gait and muscle weakness. The present study reported on a consanguineous Chinese
  family with one affected individual that initially presented with exophthalmos,
  which has not previously been reported as an initial manifestation of CED. The proband
  was a 22-year-old woman that presented with progressive proptosis. Except for increased
  serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen,
  no other biochemical abnormalities were detected. Whole-body radiological and bone
  scintigraphic investigations revealed that hyperostosis and sclerosis predominantly
  affected the cranial bones, including the skull base, and only mildly affected the
  long bones. A heterozygous mutation involving a G to A transition at the cDNA position
  +653 of TGFbeta1 was detected in the patient only, but not in her family members,
  by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI DNA sequencer (Model 377). Based on the
  clinical, biochemical, radiological and genetic findings, a diagnosis of CED was
  confirmed. Considering the phenotypic variability associated with CED and the unique
  manifestations of the patient described in the present study, CED should be taken
  into account regarding the differential diagnosis of exophthalmos. '
