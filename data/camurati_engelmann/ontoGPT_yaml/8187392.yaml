input_text: Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann's disease). Improvement
  of clinical signs and of bone scintigraphy during pregnancy.The case of a woman
  suffering from progressive diaphyseal dysplasia is presented. Characteristic symptoms
  of crippling pain in both legs, severe aching in both forearms, and episodic temporofrontal
  and occipital headache were only partially regulated by corticosteroid treatment.
  However, pregnancy resulted in a progressive disappearance of these symptoms, allowing
  withdrawal of steroid treatment. Tc-99m MDP scintigraphy performed immediately after
  delivery showed a decrease of the intense uptake in the forearms, tibiae, and skull,
  which had been documented prior to pregnancy. However, widespread pain recurred
  within 6 weeks after delivery, accompanied by a recurrence of multiple severely
  hyperactive foci on bone scintigraphy. Alterations of immune modulated processes
  and changes in bone mineral homeostasis and in endogenous cortisol metabolism during
  pregnancy can be considered as possible explanations for the temporary improvement
  in clinical and scintigraphic signs of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia in this
  patient.
