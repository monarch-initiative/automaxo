input_text: An ENU-induced p.C225S missense mutation in the mouse Tgfb1 gene does
  not cause Camurati-Engelmann disease-like skeletal phenotypes.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) is a rare sclerosing bone disorder in humans with autosomal dominant
  inheritance. Mutations in the gene (TGFB1) that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1
  (TGF-beta1) are causative for CED. TGF-beta1 signaling is enhanced by the CED-causing
  mutations. In this study, we performed Tgfb1 mutation screening in an ENU-mutagenized
  mouse genomic DNA library. We identified a missense mutation in which cysteine was
  substituted by serine at position 225 (p.C225S), that corresponded to the CED-causing
  mutation (p.C225R). TGF-beta1 mutant protein carrying p.C225S was secreted normally
  into the extracellular space. Reporter gene assays showed that the p.C225S mutants
  enhanced TGF-beta signaling at the same level as p.C225R mutants. We generated p.C225S
  homozygous mice and confirmed that the mature TGF-beta1 levels in the culture supernatants
  of the calvarial cells from the homozygotes were significantly higher than those
  from wild-type mice. Although the skull and femur are sclerotic in CED, these phenotypes
  were not observed in p.C225S homozygous mice. These results suggest that human and
  mouse bone tissue react differently to TGF-beta1. These findings are useful to pharmacological
  studies using mouse models in developing drugs that will target TGF-beta signaling.
