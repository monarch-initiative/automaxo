input_text: 'Camurati-Engelmann disease in a family from Croatian Island: an old bone
  scan confirmed pattern of inheritance.34-year old patient had history of muscular
  wasting, easy fatigability, pain in extremities and waddling gait since age of four.
  During the time, neuromuscular disease was suspected, but not confirmed. Elevated
  bone alkaline phosphatase as well as other bone turnover markers (osteocalcin, procollagen,
  telopeptide) indicated further skeletal evaluation. Symmetrical enhanced uptake
  on technetium methylene diphosphonate [99mTc]MPD bone scintigraphy at diaphyses
  of longitudinal bones and scull matched cortical thickening of long bones and sclerosis
  of the scull seen at radiograms. Those findings pointed to Camurati-Engelmann disease
  misdiagnosed for the long time. This rare genetic autosomal dominant disorder was
  retrospectively diagnosed in asymptomatic father too on the basis of bone scans
  done long time ago. Old family member scans confirmed heredity pattern of the disease.'
