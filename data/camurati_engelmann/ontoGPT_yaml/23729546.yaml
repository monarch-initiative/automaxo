input_text: 'A family with Camurati-Engelman disease. The role of the missense p.R218C
  mutation in TGFB1 in bones and endocrine glands. OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive bone dysplasia due to mutations in the
  transforming factor gene TGFB1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications
  such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty and hypogonadotrophic
  hypogonadism may be present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the TGFB1
  gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3
  in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia
  and menstrual irregularity. The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg per
  day as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C
  in TGFB1 on the mechanism of the disease itself and the complications of it in bones
  and endocrine glands remain unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding
  of the pathogenesis of the disease is important for future treatment options and
  better quality of life of such patients.'
