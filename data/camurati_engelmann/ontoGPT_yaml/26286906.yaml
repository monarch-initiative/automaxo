input_text: 'Bilateral papilloedema in Camurati-Engelmann disease. A 23-year-old woman
  presented with bilateral papilloedema in a setting of Camurati-Engelmann disease
  (CED). She was investigated with neuroimaging showing no optic nerve canal stenosis
  or jugular vein canal compromise. Her MRI venogram was normal. Her opening pressure
  at lumbar puncture and serum alkaline phosphatase were raised. Her papilloedema
  resolved with long-term use of acetazolamide. We believe that our patient suffered
  from raised intracranial pressure directly as a result of decreasing intracranial
  volume secondary to CED. '
