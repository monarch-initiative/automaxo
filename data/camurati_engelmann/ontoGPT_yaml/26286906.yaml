input_text: 'Bilateral papilloedema in Camurati-Engelmann disease.A 23-year-old woman
  presented with bilateral papilloedema in a setting of Camurati-Engelmann disease
  (CED). She was investigated with neuroimaging showing no optic nerve canal stenosis
  or jugular vein canal compromise. Her MRI venogram was normal. Her opening pressure
  at lumbar puncture and serum alkaline phosphatase were raised. Her papilloedema
  resolved with long-term use of acetazolamide. We believe that our patient suffered
  from raised intracranial pressure directly as a result of decreasing intracranial
  volume secondary to CED. '

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
