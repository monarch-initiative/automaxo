input_text: 'Skull base manifestations of Camurati-Engelmann disease.OBJECTIVE: To
  describe presenting symptoms, evaluation findings, and surgical management of cranial
  base hyperostosis in patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). DESIGN: Retrospective
  study and literature review. SETTING: The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. PATIENTS:
  A total of 306 patients diagnosed as having CED, including 12 primarily evaluated
  at our institution between 1968 and 2008, and 294 identified in the international
  literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presenting symptoms, methods of diagnosis, treatment
  strategies, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three of 306 patients
  (56.5%) had radiographically proven skull base hyperostosis, whereas less than one-fourth
  were symptomatic. The most common manifestations of cranial base involvement were
  hearing loss (19.0%), headache (10.4%), exophthalmos (8.2%), and frontal bossing
  (7.2%); less common were vision changes, vertigo, facial weakness, symptomatic brainstem
  compression, facial numbness, and hyposmia. Although corticosteroids and bisphosphates
  may treat torso and extremity involvement, they demonstrate no benefit for symptomatic
  skull base disease. In select symptomatic patients, aggressive decompression surgery
  may provide the only means of treatment. Decompression surgery is more challenging
  with thick sclerotic bone, loss or obscuration of bony landmarks, and decreased
  supratentorial space. Patients must be counseled on the increased risks associated
  with surgery and the potential for redeposition of bone and recurrence of symptoms.
  CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include CED in the differential diagnosis for patients
  with radiographic evidence of skull base thickening and synchronous cranial neuropathies
  or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. In mild forms of the disease, the
  clinical course of patients should be followed with serial examination, audiometric
  testing, and radiography. In select patients with progressive cranial base symptoms,
  aggressive wide decompression of involved neurovascular structures may provide benefit.'
