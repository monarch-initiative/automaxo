input_text: 'Genetic testing is useful in adults with limited phenotypes of genetic
  skeletal conditions.We show the value of genetic screening in 3 adults with limited
  phenotypes of three bone sclerosing genetic disease (GD): osteopetrosis (OPT), Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) and pycnodysostosis. INTRODUCTION: OPT, CED and pycnodysostosis are
  three rare bone diseases often diagnosed in childhood. However, some atypical phenotypes
  raise the problem of delayed diagnosis in adults. Genetic tests may then be useful
  to establish a formal diagnosis. METHODS: We report 3 cases of adult patients with
  symptomatic or asymptomatic bone sclerosing lesions for whom the clinical, radiological
  and biological explorations were atypical and did not allow a formal diagnosis.
  These unusual descriptions led to the search for genetic mutations. RESULTS: These
  3 cases of limited phenotypes were associated with unknown or poorly described variants
  of 3 rare bone genetic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic tests proved useful to establish
  the diagnosis and manage the condition of adults with rare bone sclerosing GD.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
