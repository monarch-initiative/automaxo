input_text: Unusual otological manifestations in Camurati-Engelmann's disease.Camurati-Engelmann's
  disease (CED) is a rare hereditary disorder affecting mainly the diaphysis of long
  bones but multiple cranial nerve deficits may also develop secondary to bony sclerosis
  of their foramina, including visual loss, facial palsy, deafness, vestibular disturbances
  and sensory deficits along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Deafness has
  been reported in about 18 per cent of these cases due to narrowing of the internal
  auditory canals caused by bony encroachment on nerves and vessels. We report an
  extremely rare case of a patient with CED who presented with deafness due to gross
  abnormalities affecting both middle ear and cochlea. The issues relating to the
  management of these patients with temporal bone involvement are discussed.
