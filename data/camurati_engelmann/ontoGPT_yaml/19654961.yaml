input_text: The first Korean case of Camurati-Engelmann disease (progressive diaphyseal
  dysplasia) confirmed by TGFB1 gene mutation analysis.Camurati-Engelmann disease
  (CED) is an autosomal dominant progressive diaphyseal dysplasia caused by mutations
  in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) gene. We report the first Korean
  family with an affected mother and son who were diagnosed with CED. The proband
  is a 19-yr-old male with a history of abnormal gait since the age of 2. He also
  suffered from proximal muscle weakness, pain in the extremities, and easy fatigability.
  Skeletal radiographs of the long bones revealed cortical, periosteal, and endosteal
  thickenings, predominantly affecting the diaphyses of the upper and lower extremities.
  No other bony abnormalities were noted in the skull and spine and no remarkable
  findings were seen on laboratory tests. The patient's mother had a long-standing
  history of mild limb pain. Under the impression of CED on radiographic studies,
  we performed mutation analysis. A heterozygous G to A transition at cDNA position
  +653 in exon 4 of the TGFB1 gene (R218H) was detected in the patient and his mother.
