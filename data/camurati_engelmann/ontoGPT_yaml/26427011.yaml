input_text: 'Reduced Dentin Matrix Protein Expression in Camurati-Engelmann Disease
  Transgenic Mouse Model.UNLABELLED: Overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta1
  (TGF-beta1) has been shown to lead to mineralization defects in both the enamel
  and dentin layers of teeth. A TGFB1 point mutation (H222D), derived from published
  cases of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), has been shown to constitutively activate
  TGF-beta1, leading to excess bone matrix production. Although CED has been well
  documented in clinical case reports, there are no published studies on the effect
  of CED on the dentition. The objective of this study was to determine the dental
  manifestations of hyperactivated TGF-beta1 signaling using an established mouse
  model of CED-derived TGF-beta1 mutation. Murine dental tissues were studied via
  radiography, micro-CT, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Results showed that initial
  decreased dental mineralized tissue density is resolved. Proliferation assays of
  incisor pulp and alveolar bone cell cultures revealed that cells from transgenic
  animals displayed a reduced rate of growth compared to alveolar bone cultures from
  wild-type mice. TGF-beta family gene expression analysis indicated significant fold
  changes in the expression of Alpl, Bmp2-5, Col-1, -2, -4, and -6, Fgf, Mmp, Runx2,
  Tgfb3, Tfgbr3, and Vdr genes. Assessment of SIBLINGs revealed downregulation of
  Ibsp, Dmp1, Dspp, Mepe, and Spp1, as well as reduced staining for BMP-2 and VDR
  in mesenchymal-derived pulp tissue in CED animals. Treatment of dental pulp cells
  with recombinant human TGF-beta1 resulted in increased SIBLING gene expression.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide in vivo evidence suggesting that TFG-beta1 mediates
  expression of important dentin extracellular matrix components secreted by dental
  pulp, and when unbalanced, may contribute to abnormal dentin disorders.'
