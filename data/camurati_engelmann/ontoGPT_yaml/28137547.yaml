input_text: "Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease:
  Technical Note. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a
  rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long
  bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased
  intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis.
  Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however,
  a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth.
  We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and
  parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification
  of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and
  its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach
  with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially
  offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female
  patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa
  decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and
  symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation
  demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial
  volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made
  up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal
  and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties
  with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of
  the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide
  some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED
  as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports
  documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical
  intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium
  mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly,
  lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis."
