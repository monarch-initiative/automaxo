input_text: "Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease:
  Technical Note.OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare,
  autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones
  and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial
  pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression
  may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports
  document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who
  had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced
  recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores
  the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore,
  we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh
  cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL
  PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal
  shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior
  presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of
  the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted
  in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy,
  requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones,
  was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately
  1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve
  the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression
  could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider
  managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few
  case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated
  by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with
  titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more
  importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis."
