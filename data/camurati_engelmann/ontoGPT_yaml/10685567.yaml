input_text: Cochlear implantation for auditory rehabilitation in Camurati-Engelmann
  disease. Camurati-Engelmann disease (progressive hereditary diaphyseal dysplasia)
  is a rare sclerotic bone disease involving the diaphyses of the long bones, skull
  base, and clavicles. Progressive sclerosis of cranial nerve foramina has been implicated
  in cranial nerve deficits. including facial nerve palsy, vestibular disturbances,
  and hearing loss. Two patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease and concomitant sensorineural
  hearing loss are presented. Both patients were evaluated for cochlear implantation.
  One patient was successfully implanted after preoperative imaging revealed no involvement
  of the internal auditory canals. The porous nature of the affected bone, however.
  necessitated the inactivation of 1 electrode to prevent facial nerve stimulation.
  A second patient was rejected as a potential implant recipient due, in part, to
  narrow internal auditory canals and rapidly progressive disease. The otologic manifestations
  of Camurati-Engelmann disease are reviewed, and issues related to cochlear implantation
  in this rare disease are discussed.
