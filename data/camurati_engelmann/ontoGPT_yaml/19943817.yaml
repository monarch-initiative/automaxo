input_text: 'Unusual association between enchondroma and Camurati-Engelmann disease:
  a case report. This case report describes an enchondroma of the distal phalanx of
  the right little finger in a 37-year-old woman with Camurati-Engelmann disease.
  Curettage of the tumor and artificial bone grafting were performed in May 2004.
  Surgical treatment resulted in a good clinical outcome with no evidence of recurrence
  at 5-year follow-up. The genetic relationships between Camurati-Engelmann disease
  and benign chondroid tumors are discussed.'
