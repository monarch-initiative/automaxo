input_text: 'Hypothalamic amenorrhea in a Camurati-Engelmann disease--a case report.OBJECTIVE:
  A case report of a patient diagnosed with Camurati-Engelmann Disease (CED) in association
  with the functional hypothalamic amenorrhea disturbances. CED is a very rare genetically
  determined disorder classified as a type of bone dysplasia. DESIGN: Case report.
  SETTING: Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, 3rd grade Medical University
  Hospital. PATIENT: Twenty-one years old female patient with CED admitted to the
  hospital because of primary amenorrhea. Her history revealed skeletal deformities
  and hearing impairment. METHODS: Clinical examination, ultrasound, laboratory evaluations
  (including serum gonadotropins (FSH, LH) at basal state and after stimulation with
  gonadotropin-releasing hormone, serum basal estradiol) radiological studies (X-ray
  of the head, the lumbar spine and lower extremities; a computed tomography of the
  head), G-banding karyotype, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Hormonal
  serum evaluations were made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The exon
  4 of the transforming growth factor beta 1 gene was amplified by a polymerase chain
  reaction and the product was directly sequenced. RESULTS: The hormonal analysis
  was characteristic for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Radiological and molecular
  analyses confirmed CED diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothalamic amenorrhea in a
  patient with CED may be explained as a consequence of fat hypotrophy and very low
  body mass index. Therefore, impairment within hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients
  with CED should be treated with special attention.'
