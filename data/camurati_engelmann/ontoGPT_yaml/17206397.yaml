input_text: Bone biopsy and densitometry findings in a child with Camurati-Engelmann
  disease.Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (MIM 131300), also known as Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED), is a rare autosomal dominant craniotubular dysplasia caused by mutations
  in the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) gene. Radiographs of the long
  bones of a 9-year-old boy presenting with waddling gait, muscular weakness, underweight,
  and severe skeletal pain showed symmetric diaphyseal cortical thickening pathognomonic
  for CED. The diagnosis was verified by detecting a mutation in exon 4 of the TGF-beta1
  gene. Full body bone mineral densitometry studies performed before treatment with
  prednisolone were indicative for osteoporosis (Z-scores for the lumbar spine and
  femoral neck -2.3 and -3.2, respectively). A transiliac bone biopsy showed markedly
  reduced trabecular bone volume. Oral prednisolone was initiated, and subsequently,
  pamidronate infusions were commenced in an attempt to prevent progression of osteoporosis.
  To our knowledge, this is the first time bone biopsy and bone mineral densitometry
  studies have been performed and bisphosphonate treatment evaluated in a child with
  CED.
