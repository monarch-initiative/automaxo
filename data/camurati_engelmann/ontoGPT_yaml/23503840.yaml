input_text: Transforming growth factor-beta1 gene mutations and phenotypes in pediatric
  patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease.The aim of the present study was to investigate
  the clinical characteristics and major causative gene in pediatric patients with
  Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). Biochemical and radiographic examinations, bone
  scintigraphy and genetic analyses were performed in two affected males and their
  parents. The two patients experienced waddling gait, muscular weakness and growth
  developmental delay. X-ray radiography revealed typical fusiform thickening of the
  diaphyseal portions of the long bones. The abnormal uptake of tracer Tc-99m was
  visualized in the skull and both sides of the upper humeri, ulnas, radii, femurs
  and tibias using bone scintigraphy. Serum levels of the bone formation marker procollagen
  type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) and the bone resorption marker beta-isomerized
  C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) in the 6-year-old
  patient were significantly increased compared with the normal value range, while
  only the beta-CTX levels were elevated in the 16-year-old patient. A heterozygous
  missense mutation p.Arg218Cys in exon 4 of the transforming growth factor beta1
  (TGFbeta1) gene was detected in the two patients, while their parents had normal
  wild-type genotypes. In conclusion, the p.Arg218Cys mutation was shown to contribute
  to the clinical phenotypes in two pediatric patients with CED. The results of this
  study suggest that abnormal bone turnover marker levels, typical radiological findings
  and mutations in the TGFbeta1 gene are three important factors in the diagnosis
  of sporadic CED cases.
