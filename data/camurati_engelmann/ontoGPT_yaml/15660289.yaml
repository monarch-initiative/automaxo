input_text: 'Camurati-Engelmann disease: failure of response to bisphosphonates: report
  of two cases.Camurati-Engelmann disease is a rare bone disorder characterized by
  cortical thickening of the diaphysis of tubular bones, with sparing of the epiphysis.
  It has variable degrees of penetrance and expression, but may be very disabling
  for the affected individuals who manifest the painful symptoms. The authors report
  on two women with typical presentation of severe Camurati-Engelmann disease whose
  treatment with bisphosphonates failed to add any improvement beyond that elicited
  by corticosteroids alone.'
