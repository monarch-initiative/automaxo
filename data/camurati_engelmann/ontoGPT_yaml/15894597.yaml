input_text: 'Camurati-Engelmann disease: review of the clinical, radiological, and
  molecular data of 24 families and implications for diagnosis and treatment.Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) is a rare autosomal dominant type of bone dysplasia. This review is
  based on the unpublished and detailed clinical, radiological, and molecular findings
  in 14 CED families, comprising 41 patients, combined with data from 10 other previously
  reported CED families. For all 100 cases, molecular evidence for CED was available,
  as a mutation was detected in TGFB1, the gene encoding transforming growth factor
  (TGF) beta1. Pain in the extremities was the most common clinical symptom, present
  in 68% of the patients. A waddling gait (48%), easy fatigability (44%), and muscle
  weakness (39%) were other important features. Radiological symptoms were not fully
  penetrant, with 94% of the patients showing the typical long bone involvement. A
  large percentage of the patients also showed involvement of the skull (54%) and
  pelvis (63%). The review provides an overview of possible treatments, diagnostic
  guidelines, and considerations for prenatal testing. The detailed description of
  such a large set of CED patients will be of value in establishing the correct diagnosis,
  genetic counselling, and treatment.'
