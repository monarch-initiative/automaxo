input_text: '[Camurati-Engelmann disease].Camurati-Engelmann disease (CAEND, OMIM
  131300) is a rare autosomal dominant, progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, which is
  characterized by hyperosteosis and sclerosis of the diaphyses of long bones. Estimated
  number of patients with CAEND in Japan is approximately 50-60 by our epidemiological
  survey. We have reported that domain-specific mutations in transforming growth factor-beta1
  gene(TGFB1) cause CAEND. Mutations in latency associated peptide(LAP) domain of
  TGF-beta1 destabilize the complex and may hyperactivate TGF signal pathway. We tried
  to establish CAEND model mice by gene-targeting, but could not because of spermatogenesis
  defects in chimera mice. We also failed using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Alternatively,
  we established CAEND patient-derived iPS cells, and are advancing research with
  them to develop novel therapeutic agents for CAEND.'
