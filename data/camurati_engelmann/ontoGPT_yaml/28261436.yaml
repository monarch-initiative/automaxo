input_text: "Orthopedic Manifestations of Type I Camurati-Engelmann Disease.BACKGROUND:
  Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare genetic skeletal disorder characterized
  by limb pain, muscle emaciation and weakness, and cortical thickening of the diaphysis
  of long bones. It is caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor beta
  1 (TGFB1) (type I) or other unknown gene(s) (type II). We present 8 consecutive
  patients with type I CED. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and
  radiographs of type I CED patients with special reference to the mode of presentation,
  process of diagnostic work-up, and disease course. They were 4 sporadic patients,
  and two pairs of mother and son. RESULTS: We categorized the mode of presentation
  into three groups. Group I had 4 patients who mainly presented with motor disturbances
  in young age. They drew medical attention for waddling gait, awkward ambulation
  or running, difficulty in going upstairs, or a positive Gower's sign at age 4 to
  6 years. Subsequent development of limb pain and radiographic abnormality led to
  the diagnosis of CED at age 6 to 29 years. Group II had 3 patients who mainly presented
  with limb pain at age 15, 20, and 54 years, respectively. Radiographic evaluation
  and molecular genetic test led to the diagnosis of CED. The remaining 1 patient
  (group III) was asymptomatic until age 9 years when bony lesions at the tibiae were
  found incidentally. For the last 10 years, he intermittently complained of leg pain
  in the morning or after sports activities, which did not interfere with daily life.
  All the patients in group I showed a body mass index in the underweight range (<
  18.4 kg/m2). At the latest follow-up, 4 patients in groups I and II required medication
  for the limb pain. CONCLUSIONS: CED presents with a wide range of severity. Awareness
  of this rare disease entity may be the key to timely correct diagnosis. This disease
  entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of limb pain or motor
  disturbance in children to avoid unnecessary diagnostic work-up."
