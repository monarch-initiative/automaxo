input_text: 'A family with Camurati-Engelman disease: the role of the missense p.R218C
  mutation in TGFbeta1 in bones and endocrine glands.OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann
  disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive diaphyseal dysplasia as a result of
  mutations in the transforming growth factor gene TGFbeta1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3.
  Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty,
  and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS: Genetic analysis of
  the TGFbeta1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of
  chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms
  of CED, hyperprolactinaemia, and menstrual irregularity. RESULTS: The patient responded
  well to prednisone 5 mg/kg/day, as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS:
  The role of p.R218C in TGFbeta1 on the mechanism of the disease, and the complications
  of it in bones and endocrine glands, remains unclear. Early recognition as well
  as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease are important for
  future treatment options and a better quality of life of such patients.'
