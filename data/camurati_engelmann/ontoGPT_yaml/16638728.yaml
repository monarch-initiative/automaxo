input_text: 'Camurati-Engelmann disease in conjunction with hypogonadism.OBJECTIVE:
  To report a case of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) in conjunction with hypogonadism,
  an association that has not been previously described. METHODS: We present the clinical,
  laboratory, and histopathologic features of our case. In addition, we review the
  molecular genetics of CED. RESULTS: CED is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of
  the skeleton, characterized by bilaterally symmetric, progressive dysplasia of the
  bones. The typical features of this disorder are hyperostotic and sclerotic changes
  in the bones, primarily of the extremities. Our patient, a 49-year-old male resident
  of a nursing home, presented with muscle weakness, waddling gait, bone pain, and
  increased fatigability, usual features of CED (which had been formally diagnosed
  when he was 8 years old). He also had hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and almost undetectable
  serum testosterone. The gene responsible for CED has been mapped to the same locus
  as the gene for the synthesis of transforming growth factor (TGF-b 1). Mutations
  in the TGF b 1 gene have been identified in patients with CED. TGF-b 1 also has
  an important role in reproductive function, both during embryogenesis and in adulthood.
  It has predominant effects on steroidogenesis as well as spermatogenesis. We discuss
  the hormonal and histopathologic changes in our patient and postulate that the association
  of CED with hypogonadism could be attributable to the impaired regulation of gonadal
  growth and steroidogenesis, in which TGF-b 1 has an important role. CONCLUSION:
  We propose that the association of CED with hypogonadism could be explained on the
  basis of a common underlying mutation in the TGF b 1 gene, leading to accumulation
  of excessive TGF-b 1.'
