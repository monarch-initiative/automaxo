input_text: "Acquired Chiari malformation secondary to hyperostosis of the skull:
  a case report and literature review.BACKGROUND: Most cases of generalized hyperostosis
  of the skull are associated with Camurati-Engelmann disease, craniodiaphyseal dysplasia,
  Worth-type endosteal hyperostosis, or sclerosteosis. Infrequently, a Chiari malformation
  may also be described. We present the case of a patient with acquired Chiari malformation
  secondary to hyperostotic skull formation whose findings did not fit into any of
  the 4 usual conditions. We review the literature on generalized hyperostosis of
  the skull and discuss the appropriate treatment based on our analysis of the literature
  and the patient's imaging results. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old woman presented
  with headaches, vomiting, and visual loss. Imaging revealed hyperostosis of the
  skull and an acquired Chiari I malformation. Intracranial pressure was markedly
  increased. She underwent a reduction craniotomy with subtemporal decompression and
  had good clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Chiari malformation in association with
  hyperostosis of the skull is an unusual finding. Our patient could not be classified
  into any of the 4 main hyperostotic conditions. Careful attention to imaging identified
  the hyperostosis and deflected treatment from the standard for Chiari I malformation,
  suboccipital decompression, which could have proved fatal. Instead, a reduction
  craniotomy with subtemporal decompression relieved the source of the increased ICP
  and of the downward tonsilar displacement."
