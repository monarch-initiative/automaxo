input_text: Generation of mice with a conditional allele for transforming growth factor
  beta 1 gene.Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) is a multifunctional growth
  factor involved in wound healing, tissue fibrosis, and in the pathogenesis of many
  syndromic diseases (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Camurati-Engelmann disease) and muscular,
  neurological, ophthalmic, cardiovascular and immunological disorders, and cancer.
  Since the generation of Tgfb1 knockout mice, there has been extraordinary progress
  in understanding its physiological and pathophysiological function. Here, we report
  the generation of a conditional knockout allele for Tgfb1 in which its exon 6 is
  flanked with LoxP sites. As proof of principle, we crossed these mice to LckCre
  transgenic mice and specifically disrupted Tgfb1 in T cells. The results indicate
  that T-cell-produced TGFbeta1 is required for normal in vivo regulation of peripheral
  T-cell activation, maintenance of T-cell homeostasis, and suppression of autoimmunity.
