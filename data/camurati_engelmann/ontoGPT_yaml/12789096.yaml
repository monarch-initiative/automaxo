input_text: "Camurati-Engelmann's disease: a case report.Camurati-Engelmann's disease
  is a rare condition worldwide. No cases have been documented in Uganda. A 26 year
  old female presented with a history of grinding pain in the limbs for over 20 years.
  Strong painkillers would temporally relieve the pain. She had an asthenic stature
  with generalised reduction in muscle bulk. Plain x-rays revealed the characteristic
  symmetrical thickening and sclerosis of the diaphyses of the appendicular skeleton
  and skull base, which is pathognomonic of Camurati-Engelmann's disease. Involvement
  of the metaphyses of these long bones as well as the metacarpal bones makes this
  an unusual case."
