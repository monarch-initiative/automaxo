input_text: "Sclerosing bone dysplasias--a target-site approach.Sclerosing bone dysplasias
  are a poorly understood group of developmental anomalies, much of whose etiology
  is still obscure. The list of conditions constituting this group is relatively short:
  osteopetrosis (Albers-Schonberg disease), pycnodysostosis (Maroteaux-Lamy disease),
  enostosis (bone island), osteopoikilosis, osteopathia striata (Voorhoeve disease),
  progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease), hereditary multiple
  diaphyseal sclerosis (Ribbing disease), four types of endosteal hyperostosis (van
  Buchem disease, Worth disease, Nakamura disease, and Truswell-Hansen disease), dysosteosclerosis,
  metaphyseal dysplasia (Pyle's disease), craniometaphyseal dysplasia, melorheostosis
  (Leri disease), and craniodiaphyseal dysplasia. There are instances in which two
  or more of the above disorders coexist. These are termed \"overlap syndromes\",
  most commonly involving osteopathia striata, osteopoikilosis, and melorheostosis.
  A classification of these dysplasias is elaborated based on a targetsite approach
  that views them as disturbances in development associated with the processes of
  either endochondral or intramembranous bone formation, or both. Accumulated evidence
  suggests that many of these disorders stem from common defects in bone resorption
  and/or formation during the processes of skeletal maturation and modeling. Finally,
  the subgroup of overlap syndromes is emphasized as indicating a strong interrelationship
  between the sclerosing dysplasias of bone, with perhaps a common pathogenesis for
  many."
