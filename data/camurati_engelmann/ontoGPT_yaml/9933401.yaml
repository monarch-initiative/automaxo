input_text: 'Camurati-Engelmann disease: a late and sporadic case with metaphyseal
  involvement.A 40-year-old white man with a 3-year history of mild to severe right
  thigh and knee pain was referred for radiographic investigation. Radiographs show
  a fusiform, bilaterally symmetrical enlargement of the diaphyses and metaphyses
  of the long bones (femur, tibia, fibula, radius and ulna). A narrowed medullary
  cavity is illustrated on CT scan of the femur. All bones show periosteal and endosteal
  bone formation. There is no history of familial involvement, trauma, infection or
  systemic illness. Blood chemistry could not point out any abnormality. Radiographic
  findings and clinical history suggest the diagnosis of Camurati-Engelmann disease,
  also known as progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD). This case is of interest because
  of its rare metaphyseal involvement, mild form and sporadic presentation.'
