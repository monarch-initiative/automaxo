input_text: "Aggressive cranial vault decompression for cranial hyperostosis: technical
  case report of two cases.OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann's disease,
  also known as progressive diaphysial dysplasia, is a disorder of the bone metabolism.
  Neurological manifestations of progressive diaphysial dysplasia include cranial
  nerve dysfunction, generalized weakness, cerebellar herniation, and increased intracranial
  pressure. In the past, surgical intervention has been of limited and temporary benefit.
  We present two patients with cranial hyperostosis secondary to Camurati-Engelmann's
  disease who were treated successfully with a single surgery involving a combination
  of multiple craniotomies for cranial vault decompression. CLINICAL PRESENTATION:
  Two patients presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure
  secondary to Camurati-Engelmann's syndrome. Radiological workup revealed marked
  cranial hyperostosis. INTERVENTION: The patients underwent aggressive cranial vault
  decompression. Multiple craniotomies were performed, and the inner table was then
  drilled down until the bone was 1 cm thick. CONCLUSION: Effective surgical options
  are needed for clinically significant cranial hyperostosis. In an effort to further
  define operative management in these patients, we describe a single, aggressive
  surgical procedure that may be used for successful cranial decompression."
