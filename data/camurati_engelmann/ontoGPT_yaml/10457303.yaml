input_text: Deflazacort treatment in progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann
  disease).Progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (PDD), a rare disorder of bones, in recent
  years has been accepted as a systemic disease within the spectrum of connective
  tissue disorders associated with immunological abnormalities. Steroids have been
  used in the treatment of PDD with variable success. In this report PDD is described
  in a 5-year-old boy who presented with leg pain, fatigue, headache and anorexia
  with an onset in infancy. Physical examination revealed a waddling gait, thorax
  deformity and thickening in the upper extremities. The diagnosis was made by radiologic
  demonstration of cortical thickening and a narrowed medullary cavity of the long
  bones of extremities. Bone scintigraphy showed areas of increased osteoblastic activity
  in the diaphyseal part of the long bones of extremities and the skull. Electron
  microscopic examination revealed myopathic and vascular changes. Serum immunoglobulin
  A, G and M levels were elevated and CD4 positive T cell numbers were low. Deflazacort,
  a steroid with a similar anti-inflammatory effect to prednisolone but with fewer
  adverse effects, was started in a dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. Deflazacort treatment resulted
  in clinical and radiological improvement within 12 months with no side effects.
  In conclusion, steroids may be recommended as an effective method of treatment in
  PDD and deflazacort may be a safe alternative steroid.
