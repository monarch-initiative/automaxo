23729546	A family with Camurati-Engelman disease. The role of the missense p.R218C mutation in TGFB1 in bones and endocrine glands.	OBJECTIVES: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare form of progressive bone dysplasia due to mutations in the transforming factor gene TGFB1 on chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3. Endocrine complications such as osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, delayed puberty and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism may be present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the TGFB1 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation p.R218C in exon 4 of chromosome 19q13.1-q13.3 in a 14-year-old girl who presented with typical symptoms of CED, hyperprolactinaemia and menstrual irregularity. The patient responded well to prednisone 5 mg/kg per day as well as calcium and vitamin D supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The role of p.R218C in TGFB1 on the mechanism of the disease itself and the complications of it in bones and endocrine glands remain unclear. Early recognition as well as a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is important for future treatment options and better quality of life of such patients.
10685567	Cochlear implantation for auditory rehabilitation in Camurati-Engelmann disease.	Camurati-Engelmann disease (progressive hereditary diaphyseal dysplasia) is a rare sclerotic bone disease involving the diaphyses of the long bones, skull base, and clavicles. Progressive sclerosis of cranial nerve foramina has been implicated in cranial nerve deficits. including facial nerve palsy, vestibular disturbances, and hearing loss. Two patients with Camurati-Engelmann disease and concomitant sensorineural hearing loss are presented. Both patients were evaluated for cochlear implantation. One patient was successfully implanted after preoperative imaging revealed no involvement of the internal auditory canals. The porous nature of the affected bone, however. necessitated the inactivation of 1 electrode to prevent facial nerve stimulation. A second patient was rejected as a potential implant recipient due, in part, to narrow internal auditory canals and rapidly progressive disease. The otologic manifestations of Camurati-Engelmann disease are reviewed, and issues related to cochlear implantation in this rare disease are discussed.
19943817	Unusual association between enchondroma and Camurati-Engelmann disease: a case report.	This case report describes an enchondroma of the distal phalanx of the right little finger in a 37-year-old woman with Camurati-Engelmann disease. Curettage of the tumor and artificial bone grafting were performed in May 2004. Surgical treatment resulted in a good clinical outcome with no evidence of recurrence at 5-year follow-up. The genetic relationships between Camurati-Engelmann disease and benign chondroid tumors are discussed.
28137547	Repeat Intracranial Expansion After Skull Regrowth in Hyperostotic Disease: Technical Note.	OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare, autosomal-dominant genetic disorder resulting in hyperostosis of the long bones and skull. Patients often develop cranial nerve dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure secondary to stenosis of nerve foramina and hyperostosis. Surgical decompression may provide symptomatic relief in select patients; however, a small number of reports document the recurrence of symptoms due to bony regrowth. We present a patient who had been treated previously with bilateral frontal and parietal craniotomy who experienced recurrence of symptoms due to reossification of her cranial bones. This report underscores the progressive nature of CED and its influence on surgical management. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical approach with multiple craniectomies and titanium mesh cranioplasties that could potentially offer long-term symptomatic relief. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient with CED who was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting, posterior fossa decompression, and multiple craniotomies 2 decades prior presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Studies of the skull at presentation demonstrated rethickening of cranial bones that resulted in severely decreased intracranial volume. INTERVENTION: A radical craniectomy, requiring 4 separate bone flaps made up of bilateral frontal and parietal bones, was performed. The remaining coronal and sagittal bony struts were drilled to approximately 1 cm thick. Cranioplasties with 4 separate titanium meshes were performed to preserve the natural contour of the patient's skull. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgical decompression could provide some patients with CED symptomatic relief, clinicians should consider managing CED as a chronic condition. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of few case reports documenting the recurrence of symptoms in a patient with CED treated by surgical intervention. Furthermore, we propose that multiple craniectomies with titanium mesh cranioplasties confer more permanent symptomatic control, and, more importantly, lower the risk of recurrence secondary to cranial hyperostosis.

26286906	Bilateral papilloedema in Camurati-Engelmann disease.	A 23-year-old woman presented with bilateral papilloedema in a setting of Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED). She was investigated with neuroimaging showing no optic nerve canal stenosis or jugular vein canal compromise. Her MRI venogram was normal. Her opening pressure at lumbar puncture and serum alkaline phosphatase were raised. Her papilloedema resolved with long-term use of acetazolamide. We believe that our patient suffered from raised intracranial pressure directly as a result of decreasing intracranial volume secondary to CED. 
33258798	Looking for new anabolic treatment from rare diseases of bone formation.	Bone remodelling is a complex mechanism regulated by osteoclasts and osteoblasts and perturbation of this process leads to the onset of diseases, which may be characterised by altered bone erosion or formation. In this review, we will describe some bone formation-related disorders as sclerosteosis, van Buchem disease, hypophosphatasia and Camurati-Engelmann disease. In the past decades, the research focused on these rare disorders offered the opportunity to understand important pathways regulating bone formation. Thus, the identification of the molecular defects behind the etiopathology of these diseases will open the way for new therapeutic approaches applicable also to the management of more common bone diseases including osteoporosis.
11452173	Scintigraphic evaluation of pamidronate and corticosteroid therapy in a patient with progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease).	A 27-year-old woman with progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (Camurati-Engelmann disease) received pamidronate and corticosteroid therapy for bone pain. During therapy, disease activity was assessed serially using bone scintigraphy with Tc-99m HMDP. With pamidronate administration, the bone pain became worse and diaphyseal uptake of Tc-99m HMDP increased, whereas corticosteroid administration improved the bone pain and reduced the diaphyseal uptake. In this case, pamidronate and corticosteroid produced different effects. Bone scintigraphy allowed an objective assessment of the response to these treatments, accurately reflecting clinical symptoms.

30091466	Bone-targeted delivery of TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor rescues uncoupled bone remodeling in Camurati-Engelmann disease.	Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a genetic bone-modeling disorder mainly caused by mutations in the gene that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Symptoms of CED include bone pain, fractures, and dysplasia. Currently, effective therapies for bone fracture and dysplasia in CED are urgently needed. We have demonstrated that TGF-beta1 is a coupling factor for bone remodeling and is aberrantly activated in CED. Daily injection of TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor (TbetaR1I) attenuated CED symptoms, but this systemic administration caused serious side effects. In this study, we created a conjugate linking TbetaR1I and alendronate, which delivered TbetaR1I specifically to bone. After weekly injection of the conjugate for 8 weeks, normal bone morphology and remodeling in CED mice was maintained with a minimum effective dose 700 times lower than TbetaR1I injection. Additionally, we found that the conjugate restored normal bone turnover by reducing the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, maintained a regular osteogenic microenvironment by regulating the formation of CD31 and Endomucin double-positive vessels, and preserved ordinary bone formation via inhibition of the migration of leptin-receptor-positive cells. Thus, targeting delivery of TbetaR1I to bone is a promising therapy for CED and other uncoupled bone remodeling disorders.

15660289	Camurati-Engelmann disease: failure of response to bisphosphonates: report of two cases.	Camurati-Engelmann disease is a rare bone disorder characterized by cortical thickening of the diaphysis of tubular bones, with sparing of the epiphysis. It has variable degrees of penetrance and expression, but may be very disabling for the affected individuals who manifest the painful symptoms. The authors report on two women with typical presentation of severe Camurati-Engelmann disease whose treatment with bisphosphonates failed to add any improvement beyond that elicited by corticosteroids alone.
27928112	An ENU-induced p.C225S missense mutation in the mouse Tgfb1 gene does not cause Camurati-Engelmann disease-like skeletal phenotypes.	Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) is a rare sclerosing bone disorder in humans with autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the gene (TGFB1) that encodes transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are causative for CED. TGF-beta1 signaling is enhanced by the CED-causing mutations. In this study, we performed Tgfb1 mutation screening in an ENU-mutagenized mouse genomic DNA library. We identified a missense mutation in which cysteine was substituted by serine at position 225 (p.C225S), that corresponded to the CED-causing mutation (p.C225R). TGF-beta1 mutant protein carrying p.C225S was secreted normally into the extracellular space. Reporter gene assays showed that the p.C225S mutants enhanced TGF-beta signaling at the same level as p.C225R mutants. We generated p.C225S homozygous mice and confirmed that the mature TGF-beta1 levels in the culture supernatants of the calvarial cells from the homozygotes were significantly higher than those from wild-type mice. Although the skull and femur are sclerotic in CED, these phenotypes were not observed in p.C225S homozygous mice. These results suggest that human and mouse bone tissue react differently to TGF-beta1. These findings are useful to pharmacological studies using mouse models in developing drugs that will target TGF-beta signaling.
