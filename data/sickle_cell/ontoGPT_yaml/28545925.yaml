input_text: Peritoneal B-1b and B-2 B-cells confer long-term protection from pneumococcal
  serotype 3 infection after vaccination with Prevnar-13 and are defective in sickle
  cell disease mice. Long-term immunity after inoculation with the pneumococcal conjugate
  vaccine (Prevnar-13) is impaired in sickle cell disease (SCD) mice. We sought to
  determine which B-cell subsets are defective in SCD mice after vaccination with
  Prevnar-13, yet confer long-term immunity in wild-type (WT) mice. We vaccinated
  WT and SCD mice three times at three week intervals with Prevnar-13. Fourteen weeks
  later, 5*104 cells of isolated peritoneal B-1a, B-1b, and B-2 cells were harvested
  and intraperitoneally transferred to Rag -/- recipients. A week later recipients
  were intraperitoneally challenged with 103CFU of Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype
  3). Recipient mice that received either B-1b or B-2 B-cells from WT mice survived
  challenge, whereas mice that received B-1a cells died. Recipient mice that received
  B-1a, B-1b, or B-2 cells from SCD mice died after challenge. Both B-1b and B-2 cells
  appear to confer long-term immunity after Prevnar-13 vaccination, yet neither subset
  functions properly in SCD mice.
