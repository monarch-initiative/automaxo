input_text: 'Immunological efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination including the 13-valent
  pneumococcal vaccine in adult patients with sickle-cell disease: results of the
  randomized DREVAC controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle-cell disease
  (SCD) are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal diseases. The immunological efficacy
  of 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) followed by a 23-valent polysaccharide
  vaccine (PPSV23) is poorly documented in adults with SCD. METHODS: This was a randomized
  open-labelled phase 2 study of the immunogenicity of PCV13 at week (W)0, followed
  by PPSV23 at W4, compared to PPSV23 alone at W4 in adult patients with SCD. The
  proportion of responders (four-fold increase of serotype-specific IgG antibodies)
  to at least 10-shared serotypes was assessed at W8. Secondary endpoints were: i)
  geometrical mean titers (GMTs), ii) responders to 0-1, 2-5, 6-9, and 10-12 serotypes,
  iii) pneumococcal opsonophagocytic (OPA) activity, and iv) response durability at
  W24 and W96. RESULTS: In total, 128 patients were randomized in the PCV13/PPSV23
  (n=63) or PPSV23-alone groups (n=65). At W8, 24.56% and 8.20% of patients from the
  PCV13/PPSV23 and PPSV23 groups, respectively, reached the primary endpoint (p=0.016).
  These numbers were 36.2% and 8.7% for OPA responders (p=0.002). A combined PCV13/PPSV23
  strategy improved the breadth of responses to 0-1, 2-5, 6-9, and 10-12 serotypes
  with 15.8%, 35%, 24.6%, and 24.6% versus 52.5%, 31%, 8%, and 8% in the PPSV23 group.
  At W96, GMTs were significantly higher in the PCV13/PPSV23 than in the PPSV23 alone
  group for five serotypes (4, 14, 19A, 19F, 23F). CONCLUSIONS: A PCV13/PPSV23 regimen
  improved the breadth and magnitude of antibody responses against a large range of
  pneumococcal serotypes in adults with SCD. The sustainability of the immune response
  requires recall strategies.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT02274415.'
