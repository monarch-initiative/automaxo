input_text: 'Impact of COVID-19 on vasooclusive crisis in patients with sickle cell
  anaemia.OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess COVID-19 impact on the morbidity and
  mortality of vasooclusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell anaemia (SCA) patients. METHODS:
  A prospective cohort study of 100 SCA patients; 50 with COVID-19 (COVID group) and
  50 without (non-COVID group). All patients signed written informed consent. RESULTS:
  The COVID group had a significantly higher VOC episode median per year; 3 (IQR,1-6)
  vs 2 (IQR,2-12) (P < 0.05). The need for hospitalisation was similar in both groups.
  The non-COVID group had more history of culture-proven infection (P = 0.05). The
  COVID-group had more osteonecrosis (P < 0.05), splenic sequestration, splenomegaly
  and hepatic crisis (P = 0.05, 0.006, 0.02; respectively) and significantly higher
  (P < 0.05) symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, abdominal pain and anosmia. Mean haemoglobin,
  lymphocyte subset, platelets, and reticulocytes were reduced in both groups, while
  lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels were significantly elevated. In the COVID
  group, the rise in white blood cell count, reticulocyte percentage, platelets and
  ferritin was subdued (P < 0.05). Two patients in the COVID group and 3 in the non-COVID
  group died; there was no statistically significant difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS:
  Although COVID-19 may have triggered the onset of VOC, it did not significantly
  influence VOC-related morbidity or mortality in this SCA cohort.'
