input_text: 'Trends in hospitalizations and epidemiological characteristics of adults
  Moyamoya disorder in the United States. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There has been an
  increasing prevalence of Moyamoya disorder (MMD) reported from recent US literature.
  There is a paucity of data available regarding trends of prevalence and epidemiological
  factors in the United States. To goal of this study was to test the hypotheses that
  racial-, sex-specific MMD hospitalizations and epidemiological factors have been
  increasing in the United States over the last decade. METHODS: In this retrospective
  observational study, using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2005
  to 2016, MMD-related hospitalizations in patients aged >=18 years were identified.
  Trends of epidemiological factors were analyzed over time using the linear regression
  model with the significance of differences in trend over time assessed using the
  Wald test. Sex- and race-specific burden of MMD were calculated using the annual
  US Census data. Joinpoint regression model was used to evaluate trends of hospitalizations
  over time. RESULTS: A total of 24,484 adult hospitalizations were identified from
  January 2005 to September 2015 after excluding <18 years. Among them, approximately
  ~90% were aged <=60 years, and 73.5% were females. The most common vascular and
  non-vascular presentations were ischemic stroke (17.3%) and seizures (21%), respectively.
  The trend of antithrombotic therapy has increased, while extracranial-intracranial
  bypass has remained stagnant. The actual average hospitalizations of MMD was 10.4
  cases/ million population/year (range 4.1-17.9) and varied significantly by sex
  (females 14.7 [range 6.2-23.6] and males 5.9 [range 1.8-11.9]) over the 2005 to
  2016 study period. The burden of hospitalizations also differed by race (African
  Americans 40.6 [range 32.8-63.7], Asians 24.8 [15.4-34.8], Non-Hispanic Whites 8.1
  [range 6.4-11.5], and Hispanics 8.4 [2.8-12.8]) over the 2010 to 2016 study period.
  Joinpoint regression analysis showed an increasing overall MMD trend across the
  study period (+11.7%; P < 0.001), which was higher in males (+14.5% vs. +10.7%;
  P < 0.001). The Hispanic group had significantly increased hospitalizations over
  the years (+20.2%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although overall more prevalent in females,
  MMD-related hospitalizations are increasing more rapidly in males. Among the racial
  subpopulations, African Americans had the highest MMD-related hospitalizations,
  even higher than Asian Americans. MMD-related hospitalizations have increased quicker
  in Hispanics than in any other racial group.'
