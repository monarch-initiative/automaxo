input_text: 'Outcomes of kidney donors with sickle cell trait: A preliminary analysis.
  Most transplant centers do not screen kidney donor candidates for sickle cell trait
  (SCT) and many decline candidates with SCT since it may associate with kidney disease.
  We compared 17 kidney donors with SCT to propensity score matched donor controls
  on mortality, reduced eGFR, proteinuria and kidney failure. The prevalence of SCT
  in African American (AA) donors was 11 per 1000 compared to 73 per 1000 in non-donor
  AA. Donors with SCT were younger; 33 versus 35 years in controls, nine were AA,
  six were White, and two were listed as other or unknown ethnicities. After a follow-up
  period of 18.2 +- 10.5 years, the proportions of donors with SCT and controls who
  were alive, developed hypertension or cardiovascular disease were similar. No donor
  with SCT developed an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or kidney failure. SCT was, however,
  associated with increased risk of proteinuria; RR 5.71 (95% CI 5.7 - 22.7), P =
  .01. This small and preliminary case series suggest that donors with SCT should
  perhaps be considered more often provided they were aware of the lack of evidence
  to support liberal acceptance and that these outcomes reported here likely represent
  a healthy cohort of donors with SCT.'
