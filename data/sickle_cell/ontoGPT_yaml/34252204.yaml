input_text: 'Impact of universal irradiation on chronic transfusion for sickle cell
  disease. BACKGROUND: Irradiation of blood products prevents transfusion-associated
  graft-versus-host disease, but most patients do not require this modification which
  could have an adverse impact on transfusion outcomes. We hypothesized that irradiation
  may increase transfusion requirements for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  receiving chronic transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Our pediatric hospital
  implemented a new policy of universal blood product irradiation in May 2018. We
  conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with SCD receiving chronic red
  blood cell (RBC) transfusion throughout the year before and after institution of
  this policy. The primary outcome was the change in RBC transfusion volume per patient
  weight transfused during the pre- vs. post- universal irradiation period. Secondary
  outcomes were the change in median pretransfusion laboratory values. RESULTS: Among
  17 patients, 8 (47%) received more RBCs the year before irradiation and 9 (53%)
  received more the year after irradiation. Implementation of universal irradiation
  did not significantly increase transfusion volumes needed to clinically manage this
  population (median change +1.7 ml/kg/year, p = .54). Additionally, there were no
  significant changes in absolute reticulocyte count, hemoglobin, hemoglobin S%, white
  blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, serum potassium, and ferritin
  during the two time periods. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of patients with SCD receiving
  simple chronic transfusion, irradiation did not impact transfusion requirements
  or pertinent pretransfusion laboratory values. Irradiation does not appear to have
  clinically significant consequences for SCD chronic transfusion management.'
