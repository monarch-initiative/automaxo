input_text: 'An Interrupted Time Series Analysis of the Dissemination of a Sickle
  Cell Vaso-Occlusive Episode Treatment Algorithm and a Case Management Referral Form
  for Individuals With Sickle Cell Disease in the Emergency Department. BACKGROUND:
  Sickle cell disease is associated with frequent vaso-occlusive episode and emergency
  department visits. Our group developed (1) a vaso-occlusive episode treatment algorithm
  based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommendations, and (2)
  a case management referral form to identify social behavioral health needs of patients
  with sickle cell disease in the emergency department. The aims of this project were
  to (1) disseminate the vaso-occlusive episode algorithm and case management referral
  form, and (2) to evaluate the individual provider-reported awareness, use, and preferred
  method of access to each tool among emergency department providers in North Carolina.
  METHODS: An interrupted time series analysis was used to study the impact that an
  educational effort had on the awareness of a sickle cell vaso-occlusive episode
  treatment algorithm and a case management referral form. A targeted list was developed
  to identify the providers working in emergency departments with the largest number
  of sickle cell disease patient visits. In-service education was provided to targeted
  emergency departments in North Carolina over a period of 3 years. The vaso-occlusive
  episode algorithm and case management referral form were put up on the websites
  of professional organizations. Surveys were provided to emergency department providers
  at these targeted emergency departments with a baseline and post dissemination at
  20 and 32 months for assessing the provider awareness, use, and preferred method
  of access of the tools. Additional feedback could be given by the participants through
  telephone interviews. Descriptive statistics were obtained, and content analysis
  was performed on interviews. RESULTS: We received survey responses for the following
  periods: baseline (T1, n = 190), post dissemination at 20 (T2, n = 142), and 32
  months (T3, n = 93). Awareness of the tools was between 42% (baseline) and 41% (post
  dissemination at T2, T3) for the vaso-occlusive episodes algorithm and 25% (baseline)
  and 29% (post dissemination at T2, T3) for the case management referral form. However,
  use of these tools was found to be low as only 19% of the emergency department providers
  used the vaso-occlusive episode algorithm at T1 and 13% T2, while 5% of emergency
  department providers used the case management referral form at T1 and 6% at T2.
  With further education about the tools, an increase in the usage of the tools was
  observed T3, which was 29% for the vaso-occlusive episodes algorithm and 9% for
  the case management referral form. Lack of incorporation of the decision support
  tools into emergency department processes was observed to be an overarching barrier
  to dissemination of the tools identified in interviews (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: This
  study can be used to inform future strategies on dissemination of evidence-based
  tools to emergency department providers.'
