input_text: Erythrocytapheresis in a Patient of Sickle Cell Disease Presenting in
  Crisis. As per American Society of Apheresis (ASFA) guidelines, the indication for
  Erythrocytapheresis for sickle cell patients is category III for preoperative management
  and vaso-occlusive crisis. Erythrocytapheresis, with the help of automated cell
  separators, has the benefit of reducing the Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) levels to <30.0%
  with a reduced risk of increasing blood viscosity and single procedure achieving
  target hemoglobin levels. A 17-year-oldfemale patient who was a known case of sickle
  cell disease presented to our institution with a vascular necrosis of the right
  femoral head. Due to the pain and limitations of her day-to-day activities, she
  was advised for total hip arthroplasty. This patient underwent a successful Erythrocytapheresis
  using an automated cell separator and was operated on. In a sickle cell patient
  planned for surgical intervention, the procedure of Erythrocytapheresis can help
  in decreasing the chances of the patient developing any vaso-occlusive crisis during
  surgery and in the immediate post-operative period. This technique can help in improving
  the chances of a successful surgical procedure for such patients.
