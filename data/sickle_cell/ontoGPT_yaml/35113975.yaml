input_text: 'Reduced blood pressure in sickle cell disease is associated with decreased
  angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and is not modulated by ACE inhibition.BACKGROUND:
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) incurs vaso-occlusive episodes and organ damage, including
  nephropathy. Despite displaying characteristics of vascular dysfunction, SCD patients
  tend to present relatively lower systemic blood pressure (BP), via an unknown mechanism.
  We investigated associations between BP and renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) components
  in SCD and determined whether an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE;
  often used to slow SCD glomerulopathy) further modulates BP and RAS components in
  a murine model of SCD. METHODS: BP was compared in human subjects and mice with/without
  SCD. Plasma angiotensin II, ACE and renin were measured by immunoassay. BP was reevaluated
  after treating mice with enalapril (25 mg/kg, 5x/week) for 5 weeks; plasma and organs
  were stored for angiotensin II and ACE activity measurement, and quantitative real-time
  PCR. RESULTS: Diastolic BP and systolic BP were significantly lower in patients
  and mice with SCD, respectively, compared to controls. Reduced BP was associated
  with increased plasma renin and markers of kidney damage (mice) in SCD, as well
  as significantly decreased plasma ACE concentrations and ACE enzyme activity. As
  expected, enalapril administration lowered BP, plasma angiotensin II and organ ACE
  activity in control mice. In contrast, enalapril did not further reduce BP or organ
  ACE activity in SCD mice; however, plasma angiotensin II and renin levels were found
  to be significantly higher in enalapril-treated SCD mice than those of treated control
  mice. CONCLUSION: Relative hypotension was confirmed in a murine model of SCD, in
  association with decreased ACE concentrations in both human and murine disease.
  Given that ACE inhibition has an accepted role in decreasing BP, further studies
  should investigate mechanisms by which ACE depletion, via both Ang II-dependent
  and alternative pathways, could contribute to reduce BP in SCD and understand how
  ACE inhibition confers Ang II-independent benefits on kidney function in SCD.'
