input_text: 'Extracorporeal Life Support for Severe Acute Chest Syndrome in Adult
  Sickle Cell Disease: A Preliminary Report. OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal life support
  could be helpful for severe acute chest syndrome in adults sickle cell disease,
  because of the frequent hemodynamic compromise in this setting, including acute
  pulmonary vascular dysfunction and right ventricular failure. The aim of this study
  was to report the extracorporeal life support experience for severe acute chest
  syndrome in four referral centers in France. DESIGN: The primary endpoint of this
  multicentric retrospective study was ICU survival of patients with severe acute
  chest syndrome managed with extracorporeal life support. Secondary endpoints included
  comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors. SETTING: We performed this study
  between January 2009 and July 2017 in four referral centers in France. PATIENTS:
  We included adult patients (age > 18 yr) with sickle cell disease, admitted for
  severe acute chest syndrome and who required extracorporeal life support during
  the ICU stay. INTERVENTIONS: The study was observational. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
  RESULTS: Over the 8-year period, 22 patients with sickle cell disease required extracorporeal
  life support for severe acute chest syndrome, including 10 (45%) veno-venous and
  12 (55%) veno-arterial extracorporeal life support. In-ICU mortality was high (73%).
  Nonsurvivors had a higher severity at extracorporeal life support implantation,
  as assessed by their Vasoactive-Inotrope Score and number of organ failures. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our study shows that outcome is impaired in sickle cell disease patients receiving
  extracorporeal life support while in severe multiple organ failure. Further studies
  are needed to evaluate selection criteria in this setting.'
