input_text: 'Risk score to predict event-free survival after hematopoietic cell transplant
  for sickle cell disease. We developed a risk score to predict event-free survival
  (EFS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease.
  The study population (n = 1425) was randomly split into training (n = 1070) and
  validation (n = 355) cohorts. Risk factors were identified and validated via Cox
  regression models. Two risk factors of 9 evaluated were predictive for EFS: age
  at transplantation and donor type. On the basis of the training cohort, patients
  age 12 years or younger with an HLA-matched sibling donor were at the lowest risk
  with a 3-year EFS of 92% (score, 0). Patients age 13 years or older with an HLA-matched
  sibling donor or age 12 years or younger with an HLA-matched unrelated donor were
  at intermediate risk (3-year EFS, 87%; score, 1). All other groups, including patients
  of any age with a haploidentical relative or HLA-mismatched unrelated donor and
  patients age 13 years or older with an HLA-matched unrelated donor were high risk
  (3-year EFS, 57%; score, 2 or 3). These findings were confirmed in the validation
  cohort. This simple risk score may guide patients with sickle cell disease and hematologists
  who are considering allogeneic transplantation as a curative treatment relative
  to other available contemporary treatments.'
