input_text: 'Comorbidities Associated with Hospitalization and Progression Among Adolescents
  with Symptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019. OBJECTIVE: To identify subgroups likely
  to benefit from monoclonal antibody and antiviral therapy by evaluating the relationship
  between comorbidities and hospitalization among US adolescents with symptomatic
  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the relationship
  between presence of comorbidities and need for hospitalization within 28 days of
  COVID-19 diagnosis for adolescents aged 12-17 years listed in the Pediatric COVID-19
  US registry, a multicenter retrospective cohort of US pediatric patients with COVID-19.
  Comorbidities assessed included obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes,
  immunosuppressive disease or treatment, sickle cell disease (SCD), heart disease,
  neurologic disease/neurodevelopmental disorders, and pulmonary disease (excluding
  patients with mild asthma). We used multivariable logistic regression to determine
  race/ethnicity-adjusted associations between comorbidities and hospitalization.
  RESULTS: A total of 1877 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 284 (15%)
  were hospitalized within 28 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis. In a race/ethnicity-adjusted
  model, the following comorbidities were independently associated with increased
  odds of hospitalization: SCD (aOR, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.0-15.9), immunocompromising condition
  (aOR, 6.4; 95% CI, 3.8-10.8), obesity (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.1-4.9), diabetes (aOR,
  3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.2), neurologic disease (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.8-4.3), and pulmonary
  disease (excluding mild asthma) (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.1). Heart disease and CKD
  were not independently associated with hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: SCD, immunocompromising
  conditions, obesity, diabetes, neurologic disease, and pulmonary disease (excluding
  mild asthma) were associated with hospitalization for symptomatic COVID-19. Adolescents
  with acute COVID-19 and these comorbidities should be prioritized for consideration
  of therapy to avert hospitalization.'
