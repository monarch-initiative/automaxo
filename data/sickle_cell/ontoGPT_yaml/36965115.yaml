input_text: 'Acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease: The
  relationship with the time to onset after hospital admission. Data on acute chest
  syndrome (ACS) in adult sickle cell disease patients are scarce. In this study,
  we describe 105 consecutive ACS episodes in 81 adult patients during a 32-month
  period and compare the characteristics as a function of the time to onset after
  hospital admission for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), that is early-onset episodes
  (time to onset <=24 h, 42%) versus secondary episodes (>24 h, 58%; median [interquartile
  range] time to onset: 2 [2-3] days). The median age was 27 [22-34] years, 89% of
  the patients had an S/S or S/beta0 -thalassaemia genotype; 81% of the patients had
  a history of ACS (median: 3 [2-5] per patient), only 61% were taking a disease-modifying
  treatment at the time of the ACS. Fever and chest pain were noted in respectively
  54% and 73% of the episodes. Crackles (64%) and bronchial breathing (32%) were the
  main abnormal auscultatory findings. A positive microbiological test was found for
  20% of episodes. Fifty percent of the episodes required a blood transfusion; ICU
  transfer and mortality rates were respectively 29% and 1%. Secondary and early-onset
  forms of ACS did not differ significantly. Disease-modifying treatments should be
  revaluated after each ACS episode because the recurrence rate is high.'
