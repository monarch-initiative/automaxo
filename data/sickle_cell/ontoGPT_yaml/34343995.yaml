input_text: 'Sickle Cell Disease and the Kidney: Pathophysiology and Novel Biomarkers.Clinical
  Background: Renal involvement in sickle cell disease (SCD), called sickle cell nephropathy
  (SCN), includes several renal manifestations, such as renal acidification defect,
  distal nephron dysfunction, renal papillary necrosis, and proteinuria related to
  glomerular injury, leading to end-stage renal disease. Epidemiology: Many patients
  with SCD have a defect in urinary concentration, a problem caused by the destruction
  of the renal medulla that initiates in childhood. The presence of proteinuria in
  SCD is age-related and starts as microalbuminuria in adolescence and progresses
  to macroalbuminuria. Proteinuria is responsible for the progression to chronic kidney
  disease in some patients with SCD with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased
  due to interactions between various processes involving the vascular, glomerular,
  tubular, and interstitial compartments of the kidney. Challenges: Renal complications
  are hardly identifiable in the early stages, as serum creatinine increases only
  in the final stages of SCN. Subnormal GFR and elevated serum creatinine levels develop
  only when there is significant proteinuria. Prevention and Treatment: The identification
  of biomarkers of early, non-invasive kidney injury, and their inclusion in clinical
  practice will contribute to the identification of the mechanisms involved in the
  development of renal syndromes, facilitating the development of more effective strategies
  in the prevention and treatment of SCD.'
