input_text: 'Dual diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and sickle
  cell disease in a teenage male.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) and autosomal
  dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are relatively common genetic conditions
  with considerable overlap in clinical presentation. In addition to similarities
  between the signs and symptoms in sickle cell nephropathy and ADPKD, more than half
  of SCD patients have kidney cysts. The co-occurrence of these two diseases has not
  been previously reported in the literature. CASE DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: A 16-year-old
  Black male with SCD had bilateral kidney enlargement and multiple simple cysts on
  ultrasound. Although kidney cysts are significantly more common in individuals affected
  with SCD, genetic testing with a broad kidney gene panel was performed to explore
  the possible presence of another underlying genetic cause of his cysts, in addition
  to SCD. A dual diagnosis of SCD and ADPKD was made following the identification
  of two copies of the common pathogenic sickle cell HBB variant (c.20A > T, p.Glu7Val)
  and a pathogenic missense variant in PKD1 (c.8311G > A, p.Glu2771Lys). CONCLUSIONS:
  SCD and ADPKD differ in pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment regimens. As
  such, it will be paramount for this teenager to be closely monitored for signs of
  diminished kidney function and to be co-managed as he transitions to adult care
  to ensure proper treatment and management. Early identification of individuals with
  both SCD and a co-occurring condition is crucial to ensuring proper clinical management.
  Furthermore, identifying and reporting additional patients with SCD and ADPKD dual
  diagnoses will help us to understand the co-occurring disease course and optimal
  treatments.'
