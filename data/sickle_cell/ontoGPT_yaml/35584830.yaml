input_text: "How to approach haemolysis: Haemolytic anaemia for the general physician.
  Haemolytic anaemia can seem like a complicated topic. The constellation of reticulocytosis,
  increased lactate dehydrogenase levels, increased unconjugated bilirubin levels
  and decreased haptoglobin levels should prompt general physicians to consider haemolysis
  as a differential diagnosis. When further approaching haemolytic anaemia, subdividing
  patients into those who are 'direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positive' (immune) or
  'DAT negative' (non-immune) is a simple and clinically relevant way to start to
  formulate a cause for the haemolytic anaemia. Immune causes of haemolytic anaemia
  include autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, drugs and delayed haemolytic transfusion
  reactions. Non-immune causes include the haemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell
  disease) and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemias (such as disseminated intravascular
  coagulation). Early supportive care in haemolytic anaemia is important and may involve
  blood transfusions as well as interventions to slow the rate of haemolysis, such
  as steroids in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications of haemolysis include
  pigment gallstones, high-output cardiac failure and thromboembolism. Haemolytic
  anaemia should be referred to the haematologist for further investigation, however,
  the recognition and early management by the general physician is imperative in improving
  the patient's outcome."
