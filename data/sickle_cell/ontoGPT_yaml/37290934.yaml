input_text: 'Outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalizations in patients with sickle cell disease:
  A nationwide analysis. INTRODUCTION: There is a paucity of data on the outcomes
  of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  in the United States. We examined the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and SCD.
  METHODS: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to identify the data of
  patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and SCD in 2020 using the International Classification
  of Disease, Tenth Revision codes. In-hospital outcomes (invasive mechanical ventilation
  and mortality) were compared between SCD and non-SCD groups. RESULTS: Of the 1 057
  550 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 2870 (0.3%) had SCD. The median age of the SCD group
  was 42 (IQR: 31) vs. 66 (IQR: 23) in the non-SCD group (p < .0001). Patients with
  SCD were likely to be females (62.02% vs. 37.98%, p < .0001), Blacks (87.81% vs.
  12.19%, p < .0001), and in the lowest income quartile (50.62% vs. 11.15%, p < .0001).
  There was no difference in the outcomes between the two groups. There were increased
  odds of invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 in
  Asians, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Blacks (except for in-hospital mortality)
  compared to Whites. CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation
  outcomes in SCD are comparable to that in non-SCD patients hospitalized with COVID-19.'
