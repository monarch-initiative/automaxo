input_text: 'The implementation of automated red blood cell exchange (erythrocytapheresis)
  as a treatment modality in sickle cell disease patients: Single center experience.
  BACKGROUND: Improvements of health infrastructure, preventive care and clinical
  management is important to reduce the morbidity and mortality of sickle cell disease
  (SCD). OBJECTIVE: This prospective, investigator-initiated non-randomized open-label
  intervention, single centre study describes the implementation of the automated
  erythrocytapheresis in low-middle income country as a treatment modality for SCD
  patients to improve the standard of care and highlights its benefits and challenges.
  METHODOLOGY: Eligible patients with SCD who had overt stroke, abnormal/conditional
  transcranial doppler (TCD), or other indications were subjected to regular automated
  erythrocytapheresis program. RESULTS: From 18th Dec 2017 till 17th Dec 2022, 21
  subjects were enrolled; seventeen (80.9 %) were Egyptian and four (19.1 %) were
  non-Egyptian (three Sudanese and one Nigerian). Totalling 133 sessions had been
  performed mainly in working hours with fluctuating frequency per month. All sessions
  maintained isovolumic status and were performed using central venous access. The
  target HbS concentration was set from the start; the mean final FCR % fraction was
  51, most of the session (n = 78, 58.7 %) were able to achieve target FCR. The majority
  of session pass smoothly with no adverse event (n = 81, 60.9 %), except for certain
  challenges as shortage of the required blood (n = 38), hypotension (n = 2), hypocalcaemia
  (n = 2). CONCLUSION: Automated erythrocytapheresis is safe and effective modality
  for management of patients with sickle cell disease.'
