input_text: Molecular and environmental contributors to neurological complications
  in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy
  in which affected hemoglobin polymerizes under hypoxic conditions resulting in red
  cell distortion and chronic hemolytic anemia. SCD affects millions of people worldwide,
  primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Due to vaso-occlusion
  of sickled red cells within the microvasculature, SCD affects virtually every organ
  system and causes significant morbidity and early mortality. The neurological complications
  of SCD are particularly devastating and diverse, ranging from overt stroke to covert
  cerebral injury, including silent cerebral infarctions and blood vessel tortuosity.
  However, even individuals without evidence of neuroanatomical changes in brain imaging
  have evidence of cognitive deficits compared to matched healthy controls likely
  due to chronic cerebral hypoxemia and neuroinflammation. In this review, we first
  examined the biological contributors to SCD-related neurological complications and
  then discussed the equally important socioenvironmental contributors. We then discuss
  the evidence for neuroprotection from the two primary disease-modifying therapies,
  chronic monthly blood transfusions and hydroxyurea, and end with several experimental
  therapies designed to specifically target these complications.
