input_text: Peripheral Blood Smear Detection of Asymptomatic Central Line Infection
  in a Patient With Sickle Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease is a lifelong disorder
  which may be managed by chronic red cell transfusion including exchange transfusion.
  Chronic indwelling vascular catheters including ports offer convenient and reliable
  access for red cell exchange but confer risk of complications including infection
  and thrombosis. Detection of these complications is essential for preserving vascular
  access and relies on both clinical and laboratory observation. Here we describe
  a case of asymptomatic port infection detected by manual screening of a peripheral
  blood smear.
