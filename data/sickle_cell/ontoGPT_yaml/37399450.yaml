input_text: Early Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease at Birth Hospitals and Vaccination
  Centers in Angola Using Point-of-Care Tests.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening
  blood disorder affecting >300,000 infants annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
  Most infants do not have access to an early diagnosis and die early from treatable
  complications of SCD. Universal NBS is not yet available in any African country
  for a variety of reasons, including lack of laboratory capacity, difficulty in tracking
  affected infants, and the relatively short stay of mothers and newborns at maternity
  hospitals. Several point-of-care (POC) tests for SCD have been recently developed
  and validated, but the two most well-established tests (Sickle SCAN and HemoTypeSC)
  have not been rigorously compared to one another. In this study, we aimed to evaluate
  and compare these two POC tests to screen infants <=6 months of age in Luanda, Angola.
  Challenging the traditional NBS paradigm, we performed testing not only at maternity
  centers, but also at vaccination centers across Luanda. We enrolled 2,000 babies
  and performed 1,000 tests with each POC test. Both tests demonstrated diagnostic
  accuracy, with 98.3% of Sickle SCAN results and 95.3% of HemoTypeSC results aligning
  with the gold standard isoelectric focusing hemoglobin pattern. When the result
  was provided at the POC, 92% of infants were linked to SCD care compared to 56%
  in the pilot Angolan NBS program, which used centralized laboratory testing. This
  study demonstrates the real-world feasibility and accuracy of POC tests to screen
  infants for SCD in Angola. This study also suggests that including vaccination centers
  may improve the capture rate for early infant SCD screening programs.
