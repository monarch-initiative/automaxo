input_text: 'Feasibility of Medical Student Mentors to Improve Transition in Sickle
  Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: Advances in medical care have resulted in nearly 95% of
  all children with sickle cell disease (SCD) living to adulthood. There is a lack
  of effective transition programming, contributing to high rates of mortality and
  morbidity among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) during the transition from pediatric
  to adult healthcare. This nonrandomized study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability,
  and preliminary outcomes of a novel medical student mentor intervention to improve
  transition outcomes for AYA with SCD. METHODS: Eligible participants were ages 18-25
  years, either preparing for transition or had transferred to adult care within the
  past year. Twenty-four AYA with SCD (Mage = 20.3, SD = 2.6) enrolled in the program
  and were matched with a medical student mentor. Feasibility and acceptability of
  the intervention was assessed through enrollment rates, reasons for refusal, retention
  rates, engagement with the intervention, satisfaction, and reasons for drop-out.
  Dependent t-tests were used to evaluate the preliminary effects of the intervention
  on patient transition readiness, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy,
  SCD knowledge, medication adherence, and health literacy. RESULTS: Participants
  (N = 24) demonstrated adequate retention (75.0%), adherence to the intervention
  (M = 5.3 of 6 sessions), and satisfaction with the intervention components. Participants
  demonstrated significant improvements in transition readiness (p = .001), self-efficacy
  (p = .002), medication adherence (p = .02), and health literacy (p = .05). CONCLUSIONS:
  A medical student mentor intervention to facilitate transition from pediatric to
  adult care for AYA with SCD is both feasible and acceptable to patients and medical
  students. Preliminary results suggest benefits for patients, warranting a larger
  efficacy study.'
