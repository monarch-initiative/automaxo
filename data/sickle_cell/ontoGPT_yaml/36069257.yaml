input_text: Iron Chelators, Such as Deferasirox, When Combined With Hydroxyurea, Provide
  an Additional Benefit of Iron Chelation in Patients Receiving Chronic Transfusion
  Therapy. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions have been established as one of the primary
  therapies in treating sickle cell anemia. However, they are not free of side effects,
  with overloading the body with iron being one of the most important. Iron chelation
  therapy greatly reduces the iron load of the body. In addition, hydroxyurea (HU),
  an oral chemotherapeutic drug also has a significant role in the treatment of the
  disease with beneficial effects on many of the clinical problems that arise, mainly
  in reducing painful crises. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect
  of synergistic transfusion therapy and HU on the response to deferasirox (DFX) chelation
  therapy. Eighteen patients with sickle cell disease were divided into two groups
  based on their treatment, either with simple transfusions and DFX or with a combination
  of transfusion therapy, DFX and HU, and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) for liver iron concentration (LIC) and biochemistry. All patients completed
  the study. The results of the study showed improvement in serum ferritin (FER) levels
  and LIC after 12 months of therapy in both groups, especially in the group receiving
  the combination therapy with HU. In addition, there was a noteworthy improvement
  in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
  (SGPT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels with serum creatinine (Cr) levels
  remaining stable during the study in both groups. Hydroxyurea, when combined with
  iron chelators such as DFX, provides an additional benefit of iron chelation in
  patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy.
