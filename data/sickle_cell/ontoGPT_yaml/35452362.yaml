input_text: 'The spectrum and burden of in-patient paediatric musculoskeletal diseases
  in Northern Tanzania.BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal diseases (MSD) are a major contributor
  to the global burden of disease and disability, and disproportionally affect low-
  and middle-income countries; however, there is a dearth of epidemiological data.
  Affected children often face increased morbidity, social isolation and economic
  hardship. AIM: To assess the spectrum and burden of paediatric MSD in children aged
  5-18 years admitted to a major referral hospital in Tanzania. METHODS: This was
  a retrospective cohort study of children aged 5-18 years admitted to Kilimanjaro
  Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) whose initial diagnosis was recognised as a musculoskeletal
  condition by the International Classification of Diseases-10 between 1 January and
  31 December 2017. RESULTS: During 2017, 163 cases of confirmed paediatric MSD were
  admitted to KCMC, representing 21.2% of all admissions of children aged 5-18 years
  (n = 769). Bone disease was the most common diagnosis. They comprised 106 (65.0%)
  traumatic fractures, 31 (19.0%) osteo-articular infections, 9 (5.5%) malunions and
  3 (1.8%) pathological fractures. Congenital defects and rheumatic disease were relatively
  uncommon, accounting for only 6 (3.7%) and 4 (2.5%) MSD admissions, respectively.
  CONCLUSION: The majority of cases of MSD were related to fractures, followed by
  osteo-articular infections, while recognised cases of rheumatic disease were rare.
  The study, although small, identified the sizeable burden and spectrum of paediatric
  MSD admitted to a hospital in Tanzania over a 12-month period and highlights the
  need for larger studies to inform the optimal allocation of health resources. ABBREVIATION:
