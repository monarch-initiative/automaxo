input_text: Emphysematous osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella typhi in beta thalassemia
  major. There have been various cases of salmonella osteomyelitis reported in sickle
  cell anemia. We present a case of emphysematous osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella
  typhi in a 29-year-old beta thalassemia major patient. Diagnosis of emphysematous
  osteomyelitis was confirmed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging,
  and culture of pus drained during surgical debridement confirmed the causative microorganism,
  Salmonella typhi. Antimicrobials were given according to microbiological sensitivity
  for a period of 8 weeks. Our patient also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. At
  the end of therapy, he was afebrile and laboratory parameters normalized with a
  residual joint deformity which developed within 3 months.
