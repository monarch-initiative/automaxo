input_text: Hospital and ICU Admission Risk Associated With Comorbidities Among Children
  With COVID-19 Ancestral Strains. A large proportion of children have been affected
  by COVID-19; we evaluated the association between comorbidities and hospitalization/ICU
  (intensive care unit) admission among 4097 children under age 21 years with symptomatic
  COVID-19 (not just polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive or multisystem inflammatory
  syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 [MIS-C]) from 2 large health systems
  from March 2020 to September 2021. Significant comorbidities and demographic factors
  identified by univariable analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression
  compared with children ages 6 to 11 without comorbidities. In all, 475 children
  (11.6%) were hospitalized, of whom 25.5% required ICU admission. Children under
  1 year had high hospitalization risk, but low risk of ICU admission. Presence of
  at least 1 comorbidity was associated with hospitalization and ICU admission (odds
  ratio [OR] > 4). Asthma, obesity, chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease, bone
  marrow transplantation, and neurologic disorders were associated with hospitalization
  (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] > 2). Malignancy, intellectual disability, and prematurity
  were associated with ICU admission (AOR > 4). Comorbidities are significantly associated
  with hospitalization/ICU admission among children with COVID-19.
