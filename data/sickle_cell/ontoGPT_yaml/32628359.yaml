input_text: Four phase 1 trials to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile
  of single and repeated dosing of SCO-101 in adult male and female volunteers. SCO-101
  (Endovion) was discontinued 20 years ago as a new drug under development against
  sickle cell anaemia. Data from the phase 1 studies remained unpublished. New data
  indicate that SCO-101 might be efficacious as add-on therapy in cancer. Thus, we
  report the results from the four phase 1 trials performed between 2001 and 2002.
  Adult volunteers received SCO-101 or placebo in four independent trials. Adverse
  events were recorded, and SCO-101 was determined for pharmacokinetic analysis. Ninety-two
  volunteers completed the trials. The most remarkable adverse effect was a transient
  and dose-dependent increase in unconjugated bilirubin. Plasma SCO-101 elimination
  was approximately log linear, with apparent oral clearances of between 315 and 2103
  mL/h for single doses, and between 121 and 2433 mL/h at steady state following oral
  administration. There was a marked decrease in clearance with increasing dose, and
  for repeated dose versus single dose. Tmax was greater, and Cmax and AUC  were lower
  in the fed state compared to the fasted state. Exposure was equivalent in males
  and females and for African Americans and Caucasians. In conclusion, SCO-101 appears
  to be a safe drug with a predictable PK profile. Its efficacy as add-on to standard
  anticancer drugs has yet to be defined.
