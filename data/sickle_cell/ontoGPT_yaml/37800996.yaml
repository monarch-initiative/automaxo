input_text: "Outcomes and long-term effects of hematopoietic stem cell transplant
  in sickle cell disease.INTRODUCTION: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is
  the only readily available curative option for sickle cell disease (SCD). Cure rates
  following human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor HSCT with myeloablative
  or non-myeloablative conditioning are > 90%. Alternative donor sources, including
  haploidentical donor and autologous with gene therapy, expand donor options but
  are limited by inferior outcomes, limited data, and/or shorter follow-up and therefore
  remain experimental. AREAS COVERED: Outcomes are improving with time, with donor
  type and conditioning regimens having the greatest impact on long-term complications.
  Patients with stable donor engraftment do not experience SCD-related symptoms and
  have stabilization or improvement of end-organ pathology; however, the long-term
  effects of curative strategies remain to be fully established and have significant
  implications in a patient's decision to seek therapy. This review covers currently
  published literature on HSCT outcomes, including organ-specific outcomes implicated
  in SCD, as well as long-term effects. EXPERT OPINION: HSCT, both allogeneic and
  autologous gene therapy, in the SCD population reverses the sickle phenotype, prevents
  further organ damage, can resolve prior organ dysfunction in both pediatric and
  adult patients. Data support greater success with HSCT at a younger age, thus, curative
  therapies should be discussed early in the patient's life."
