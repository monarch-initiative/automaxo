  for the management of reproductive genetic risk in IVF and general population. STUDY
  QUESTION: What is the clinical validity and utility of preconception Expanded Carrier
  Screening (ECS) application on the management of prospective parents? SUMMARY ANSWER:
  The high detection rate of at-risk couples (ARCs) and the high proportion opting
  for IVF/preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) treatment demonstrate the clinical
  utility of ECS in the preconception space in IVF and general population. WHAT IS
  KNOWN ALREADY: About 2-4% of couples are at risk of conceiving a child with an autosomal
  recessive or X-linked genetic disorder. In recent years, the increasing cost-effectiveness
  of genetic diagnostic techniques has allowed the creation of ECS panels for the
  simultaneous detection of multiple recessive disorders. Comprehensive preconception
  genetic screening holds the potential to significantly improve couple's genetic
  risk assessment and reproductive planning to avoid detectable inheritable genetic
  offspring. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A total of 3877 individuals without a family
  history of genetic conditions were analyzed between January 2017 and January 2020.
  Of the enrolled individuals, 1212 were gamete donors and 2665 were patients planning
  on conceiving from both the IVF and the natural conception group. From the non-donor
  cohort, 1133 were analyzed as individual patients, while the remaining ones were
  analyzed as couples, for a total of 766 couples. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING,
  METHODS: A focused ECS panel was developed following American College of Obstetrics
  and Gynecology ACOG-recommended criteria (prevalence, carrier rate, severity), including
  highly penetrant severe childhood conditions. Couples were defined at-risk when
  both partners carried an autosomal recessive pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant
  (PLP) on the same gene or when the woman was a carrier of an X-linked PLP variant.
  ARC detection rate defined the clinical validity of the ECS approach. Clinical utility
  was evaluated by monitoring ARCs reproductive decision making. MAIN RESULTS AND
  THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 402 individuals (10.4%) showed PLP for at least one
  of the genes tested. Among the 766 couples tested, 173 showed one carrier partner
  (22.6%), whereas 20 couples (2.6%) were found to be at increased risk. Interestingly,
  one ARC was identified as a result of cascade testing in the extended family of
  an individual carrying a pathogenic variant on the Survival Of Motor Neuron 1SMN1
  gene. Of the identified ARCs, 5 (0.7%) were at risk for cystic fibrosis, 5 (0.7%)
  for fragile X syndrome, 4 (0.5%) for spinal muscular atrophy, 4 (0.5%) for Beta-Thalassemia/Sickle
  Cell Anemia, 1 (0.1%) for Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome and 1 (0.1%) for Duchenne/Becker
  Dystrophy. Fifteen ARCs were successfully followed up from both the IVF and the
  natural conception groups. All of these (15/15) modified their reproductive planning
  by undergoing ART with Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Monogenic disease and
  Aneuploidies (PGT-M and PGT-A). To date, 6/15 (40%) couples completed their PGT
  cycle with euploid/unaffected embryos achieving a pregnancy after embryo transfer
  and three of them have already had an unaffected baby. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR
  CAUTION: The use of a limited panel of core gene-disease pairs represents a limitation
  on the research perspective as it can underestimate the rate of detectable carriers
  and ARCs in this cohort of prospective parents. Expanding the scope of ECS to a
  larger panel of conditions is becoming increasingly feasible, thanks to a persistent
  technological evolution and progressive cataloging of gene-disease associations.
  WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These results highlight the potential clinical
  validity and utility of ECS in reducing the risk of a pregnancy affected by a detectable
  inheritable genetic condition. The steady reduction in the costs of genetic analyses
  enables the expansion of monogenic testing/screening applications at the preimplantation
  stage, thus, providing valid decisional support and reproductive autonomy to patients,
  particularly in the context of IVF. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No external
