input_text: 'A pilot study of the acceptability, feasibility and safety of yoga for
  chronic pain in sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVES: To determine the acceptability,
  feasibility and safety of yoga for chronic pain in sickle cell disease. DESIGN AND
  SETTING: In Part A of this two-part study, adolescents with SCD and chronic pain
  (Group 1) and their parent (Group 2) completed a survey designed to capture pain
  characteristics, attitudes and practices related to yoga, and potential acceptability
  of a yoga program. In Part B, the study assessed the feasibility and safety of an
  instructor-led group yoga program. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov
  (NCT03694548). INTERVENTION: Eight instructor-led group yoga sessions. MAIN OUTCOME
  MEASURES: Feasibility and safety outcomes were chosen a priori, as follows: 1) Proportion
  of adolescent patients with SCD and chronic pain approached that consent to participate
  in Part A, 2) Proportion of adolescent participants enrolled in Part A that consent
  to participate in Part B, 3) Proportion of participants enrolled in Part B that
  attend at least 6 of 8 yoga sessions, 4) Proportion of participants enrolled in
  Part B with an ED visit or a hospitalization for pain within 24 h of completion
  of each yoga session, 5) Proportion of participants in Part B who complete all study
  assessments before, and at the end of the yoga program, 6) Adherence to submission
  of pain diary. RESULTS: The median age of 15 patient participants in Part A was
  16 (IQR 14-17), and 14 parents was 43.5 (IQR 42-51). Most participants were female.
  Most participant responses indicated a positive opinion of yoga. Nine adolescents
  (60 %) from Part A participated in Part B of the study. The median age of 9 participants
  in Part B was 17 (IQR 15-18), and 5 of the 9 participants were female (53.3 %).
  Only one participant was able to attend 3 of the 8 yoga sessions offered, and did
  not experience any ED visits or hospitalizations following the yoga sessions. None
  of the other feasibility endpoints were met in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
  with SCD and chronic pain overall have a positive opinion of yoga, but there are
  challenges with recruitment and retention of participants in a clinical trial of
  yoga, and barriers to feasibility of an in-person group yoga intervention.'
