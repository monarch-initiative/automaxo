input_text: "Patient Perspectives on Gene Transfer Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease.
  INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic genetic disease with high morbidity
  and early mortality; it affects nearly 100,000 individuals in the USA. Bone marrow
  transplantation, the only curative treatment, is available to less than 20% of patients
  because of a number of access barriers. Gene transfer therapy (GTT) has been shown
  to be curative in animal models and is approved for use in humans for early-phase
  studies at a few centers. GTT would offer a more accessible treatment option available
  to all patients. It is important to understand patient perspectives on GTT to help
  ensure human clinical trial success. METHODS: Two focus groups were conducted with
  younger (18-30 years) and older (31 years and older) adults with SCD to obtain data
  on patient knowledge and beliefs about GTT. Data from these two focus groups was
  used to develop a GTT educational brochure. A third focus group was conducted to
  obtain participant feedback on acceptability and feasibility of education and the
  brochure. RESULTS: Most adults, especially young adults, had little knowledge about
  GTT and expressed fear and uncertainty about the side effects of chemotherapy (e.g.,
  hair loss, infertility), use of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived viral
  vector, and potential for cancer risk. Participants wanted full transparency in
  educational materials, but advised researchers not to share the vector's relation
  to HIV because of cultural stigma and no HIV virus is used for the GTT vector. CONCLUSION:
  Older adults had more desire to participate in human clinical GTT trials than younger
  participants. When recruiting for trials, researchers should develop GTT educational
  materials that address participant lack of trust in the healthcare system, cultural
  beliefs, fears related to side effects, and include visual illustrations. Use of
  such materials will provide adults with SCD the information they need to fully evaluate
  GTT."
