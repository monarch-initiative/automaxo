input_text: 'Role of Nitric Oxide Carried by Hemoglobin in Cardiovascular Physiology:
  Developments on a Three-Gas Respiratory Cycle. A continuous supply of oxygen is
  essential for the survival of multicellular organisms. The understanding of how
  this supply is regulated in the microvasculature has evolved from viewing erythrocytes
  (red blood cells [RBCs]) as passive carriers of oxygen to recognizing the complex
  interplay between Hb (hemoglobin) and oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitric oxide-the
  three-gas respiratory cycle-that insures adequate oxygen and nutrient delivery to
  meet local metabolic demand. In this context, it is blood flow and not blood oxygen
  content that is the main driver of tissue oxygenation by RBCs. Herein, we review
  the lines of experimentation that led to this understanding of RBC function; from
  the foundational understanding of allosteric regulation of oxygen binding in Hb
  in the stereochemical model of Perutz, to blood flow autoregulation (hypoxic vasodilation
  governing oxygen delivery) observed by Guyton, to current understanding that centers
  on S-nitrosylation of Hb (ie, S-nitrosohemoglobin; SNO-Hb) as a purveyor of oxygen-dependent
  vasodilatory activity. Notably, hypoxic vasodilation is recapitulated by native
  S-nitrosothiol (SNO)-replete RBCs and by SNO-Hb itself, whereby SNO is released
  from Hb and RBCs during deoxygenation, in proportion to the degree of Hb deoxygenation,
  to regulate vessels directly. In addition, we discuss how dysregulation of this
  system through genetic mutation in Hb or through disease is a common factor in oxygenation
  pathologies resulting from microcirculatory impairment, including sickle cell disease,
  ischemic heart disease, and heart failure. We then conclude by identifying potential
  therapeutic interventions to correct deficits in RBC-mediated vasodilation to improve
  oxygen delivery-steps toward effective microvasculature-targeted therapies. To the
  extent that diseases of the heart, lungs, and blood are associated with impaired
  tissue oxygenation, the development of new therapies based on the three-gas respiratory
  system have the potential to improve the well-being of millions of patients.'
