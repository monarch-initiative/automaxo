input_text: 'Interval decline in hemoglobin A is associated with annual clinical event
  rate in sickle cell anemia patients receiving maintenance apheresis RBC exchange.
  BACKGROUND: Apheresis red blood cell (RBC) exchange (RCE) is a standard intervention
  for patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) who have had previous thromboembolic
  stroke or intractable chronic pain. Replacing sickling cells with those containing
  hemoglobin A (HbA) minimizes microvascular pathophysiology that produces clinical
  crises. Limited data exist regarding the interval changes in HbA between transfusions.
  We sought to describe the HbA decrement between RCE procedures and its relationship
  to clinical status. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SCA patients (all hemoglobin SS disease)
  treated with maintenance RCE (n = 21) over a 15-month period at two neighboring
  institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Time-normalized daily HbA decrement
  was calculated to reflect loss of transfused RBCs, and annual events of either emergency
  department or hospital admissions for SCA complications were noted. Associations
  between HbA decrement and laboratory measures were calculated using mixed linear
  regression models and unpaired t test was used to compare HbA decrement between
  high and low event rate groups. RESULTS: A total of 31 events were recorded, and
  mean HbA decrement per day was 0.77 +- 0.16%. The mean interval between RCEs was
  36 +- 12 days. Patients with more annual events exhibited a significantly greater
  daily HbA decrement (p = 0.007). No significant association between RBC unit age
  and HbA decrement or annual event rate was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients exhibiting
  greater daily HbA decrement were more likely to have multiple emergency department
  visits or admissions for sickling crises. Modulating HbA decrement may merit study
  as an intermediate metric for interventions to improve outcomes in hemoglobin SS
  disease.'
