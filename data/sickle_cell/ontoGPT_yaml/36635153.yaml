input_text: 'CRISPR-Cas9 base editors and their current role in human therapeutics.BACKGROUND:
  Consistent progress has been made to create more efficient and useful CRISPR-Cas9-based
  molecular toolsfor genomic modification. METHODS: This review focuses on recent
  articles that have employed base editors (BEs) for both clinical and research purposes.
  RESULTS: CRISPR-Cas9 BEs are a useful system because of their highefficiency and
  broad applicability to gene correction and disruption. In addition, base editing
  has beensuggested as a safer approach than other CRISPR-Cas9-based systems, as it
  limits double-strand breaksduring multiplex gene knockout and does not require a
  toxic DNA donor molecule for genetic correction. CONCLUSION: As such, numerous industry
  and academic groups are currently developing base editing strategies withclinical
  applications in cancer immunotherapy and gene therapy, which this review will discuss,
  with a focuson current and future applications of in vivo BE delivery.'
