input_text: Chronic anemia and thyroid function. Anaemia is a global public health
  problem affecting both developing and developed countries with major consequences
  for human health as well as social and economic development. It occurs at all stages
  of the life cycle, but is more prevalent in pregnant women and young children. Iron
  deficiency anaemia (IDA) impairs thyroid metabolism in animals and human and may
  negatively affect growth and develpment of children. On the other hand both overt
  and subclinical hypothyroidism are associated with anemia and adding iron to thyroxine
  therapy improves both conditions compared to thyroxine therapy alone. In addition
  patients with chronic hemolytic anemia requiring repeated blood transfusion have
  high prevalence of hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid axis. Both primary hypothyroidism
  and central hypothyroidism occur in these patients with increasing prevalence with
  age, severity of the anemia and higher ferritin concentration denoting poor chelation.  Proper
  blood transfusion and intensive chelation appears to prevent deterioration of thyroid
  function and in many cases can reverse thyroid pathology. Physicians treating these
  forms of anemia should be aware of thyroid disorders in these patients for early
  screening, prevention and proper management of any thyroid dysfunction.
