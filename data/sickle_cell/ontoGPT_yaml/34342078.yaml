input_text: 'Nasopharyngeal neuroendocrine neoplasms: Systematic review of the literature
  and case presentation.Most of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are located in the
  gastrointestinal tract and lung, and they are rarely found on the upper aero-digestive
  tract, which limit the current literature about nasopharyngeal NENs. This systemic
  review will summarize the clinical, pathological features and optimal diagnosis
  and management of different types of nasopharyngeal NENs (NP NENs). In-addition,
  we herein report an EBV negative TP53-mutated/ Rb-wild type nasopharyngeal neuroendocrine
  carcinoma (NEC) in a young man in which touch preparation cytology studies were
  integral to establishing a definitive diagnosis. To our knowledge, only very few
  cases of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the nasopharynx have been reported
  in the literature and the reports of these cases have not included detailed description
  of different types and how to optimally diagnose and manage them. In this abstract,
  we also highlighted the evidence about the safety of using growth factors in patients
  with sickle cell anemia who are receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.'
