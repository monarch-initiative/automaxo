input_text: Murine bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells have reduced hematopoietic
  maintenance ability in sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized
  by hemolytic anemia, which can trigger oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue
  injury that contribute to disease complications. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal
  cells (MSCs) tightly regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis in health
  and disease, but their functionality in SCD remains unclear. We identified for the
  first time that murine SCD MSCs have altered gene signatures, reduced stem cell
  properties, and increased oxidative stress, due in part to hemolysis. Murine SCD
  MSCs had lower HSC maintenance ability in vitro and in vivo, as manifested by increased
  HSC mobilization and decreased HSC engraftment after transplant. Activation of Toll-like
  receptor-4 through p65 in MSCs further contributed to MSC dysfunction. Transfusions
  led to an improved MSC and HSC oxidative state in SCD mice. Improving the regulation
  between MSCs and HSCs has vital implications for enhancing clinical HSC transplantation
  and gene therapy outcomes and for identification of new molecular targets for alleviating
  SCD complications.
