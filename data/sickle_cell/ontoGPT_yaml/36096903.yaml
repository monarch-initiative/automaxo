input_text: 'Evaluating Associations between Average Pain Intensity and Genetic Variation
  in People with Sickle Cell Disease: An Exploratory Study.BACKGROUND: Pain is one
  of the most common and deleterious symptoms experienced by individuals with sickle
  cell disease (SCD). There is a paucity of studies identifying potential genetic
  mechanisms of pain in this population. AIM: Examine associations between 11 functional
  single nucleotide polymorphisms in 9 candidate genes with reports of average pain
  intensity in individuals with sickle cell disease. METHOD: Cross-sectional analyses
  were performed on data and blood samples collected through the Duke SCD Implementation
  Consortium Registry. Participants were asked to rate their pain "on the average"
  using an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = no pain; 10 = pain as bad as you can
  imagine). We genotyped 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 9 pain-related genes
  using TaqMan  Genotyping Assays. Associations between each polymorphism and reports
  of average pain were evaluated. RESULTS: The 86 participants (mean age: 28.7 years;
  64% female) included in this study reported moderate pain on average (Mean = 4,
  Standard Deviation = 2.4). ICAM1 rs1799969 was the only genetic polymorphism that
  was significantly associated with pain (p = .01). Individuals with one or more minor
  alleles had lower average pain (Mean = 1.25, Standard Deviation = 1.50) than individuals
  without a minor allele (Mean = 4.13, Standard Deviation = 2.25). The effect size
  for ICAM1 rs1799969 was 1.30, which is considered large. The effect sizes for all
  other single nucleotide polymorphisms ranged from small to medium (range: 0-0.3).
  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the minor allele in
  ICAM1 rs1799969 had protective effects against experiencing more severe pain in
  sickle cell disease.'
