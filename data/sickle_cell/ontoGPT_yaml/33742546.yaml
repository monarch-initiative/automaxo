input_text: 'The comfort ability program for adolescents with sickle cell pain: Evaluating
  feasibility and acceptability of an inpatient group-based clinical implementation.BACKGROUND:
  Integration of nonpharmacological therapies, such as cognitive and behavioral pain
  management strategies, is recommended to support comprehensive disease and pain
  management among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). The Comfort
  Ability Program for Sickle Cell Pain (CAP for SCP) introduces psychological and
  biobehavioral pain management strategies to children and adolescents with SCD. This
  study aimed to pilot the implementation of the CAP for SCP in a group setting to
  children and adolescents hospitalized for SCD pain examining feasibility, acceptability,
  and preliminary effectiveness on improving pain knowledge and coping efficacy. METHOD:
  Adaptation of CAP for SCP into a three-session group format was guided by four phases
  of the Dynamic Adaptation Process model: Exploration, Preparation, Implementation,
  and Sustainment. Youth with SCD (n = 57) hospitalized for pain participated in at
  least one session and completed self-report of knowledge of pain management skills,
  pain coping efficacy, and treatment acceptance. Completion rates of sessions and
  qualitative feedback were gathered to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. RESULTS:
  Feasibility of conducting inpatient group sessions was suboptimal; however, patients
  and medical providers reported moderate to high levels of treatment acceptance.
  Patients also reported significant improvements in knowledge of pain management
  skills following session 1. CONCLUSIONS: CAP for SCP is a patient-centered first-line
  psychoeducational intervention that can be integrated into clinical practice settings
  to introduce youth to cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies to support
  SCD pain management.'
