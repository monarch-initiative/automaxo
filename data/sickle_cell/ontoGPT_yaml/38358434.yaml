input_text: "Ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation before hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease: safety, ovarian
  function follow-up, and results of ovarian tissue transplantation. PURPOSE: To describe
  the experience of performing ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) before hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT), among girls/women with severe sickle cell disease
  (SCD)(SS or S/beta0-thalassemia) who are, besides the usual surgical risk, at risk
  of SCD-related complications during the fertility preservation procedure for improving
  their counseling and management. METHODS: This retrospective study included 75 patients
  (girls/women) with SCD who have had OTC before myeloablative conditioning regimen
  (MAC) for HSCT. Characteristics of patients and data on OTC, ovarian status follow-up,
  and results of ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) were collected in medical records.
  RESULTS: At OTC, the median (IQR 25-75; range) age of the patients was 9.6 (6.9-14.1;
  3.6-28.3) years, 56/75 were prepubertal, and no SCD or surgery-related complications
  occurred. The median follow-up post-HSCT was > 9 years. At the last follow-up, among
  prepubertal patients at HSCT, 26/56 were >= 15 years old and presented with a premature
  ovarian insufficiency (POI), except 2, including the patient who had received an
  OTT to induce puberty. Eight were 13-15 years old and presented for POI. The remaining
  22 patients were under 13. Among the 19 patients who were menarche at HSCT, 2 died
  6 months post-HSCT and we do not have ovarian function follow-up for the other 2
  patients. All the remaining patients (n = 15) had POI. Five patients had OTT. All
  had a return of ovarian function. One patient gave birth to a healthy baby. CONCLUSION:
  OTC is a safe fertility preservation technique and could be offered before MAC independent
  of the patient's age."
