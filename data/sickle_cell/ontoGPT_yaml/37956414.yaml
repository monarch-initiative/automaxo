input_text: "Digital PCR to Measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Variants, and Outcomes in Youth.BACKGROUND:
  The role of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in predicting contagiousness, disease severity,
  transmissibility, and clinical decision-making continues to be an area of great
  interest. However, most studies have been in adults and have evaluated SARS-CoV-2
  loads using cycle thresholds (Ct) values, which are not standardized preventing
  consistent interpretation critical to understanding clinical impact and utility.
  Here, a quantitative SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) assay
  normalized to WHO International Units was applied to children at risk of severe
  disease diagnosed with COVID-19 at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between
  March 28, 2020, and January 31, 2022. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information
  from children, adolescents and young adults treated at St Jude Children's Research
  Hospital were abstracted from medical records. Respiratory samples underwent SARS-CoV-2
  RNA quantitation by RT-dPCR targeting N1 and N2 genes, with sequencing to determine
  the genetic lineage of infecting virus. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-two patients
  aged 0-24 years (median 11 years old) were included during the study period. Most
  patients were infected by the omicron variant (43.72%), followed by ancestral strain
  (22.29%), delta (13.20%) and alpha (2.16%). Viral load at presentation ranged from
  2.49 to 9.14 log10 IU/ml, and higher viral RNA loads were associated with symptoms
  (OR 1.32: CI95% 1.16-1.49) and respiratory disease (OR 1.23: CI95% 1.07-1.41). Viral
  load did not differ by SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccination status, age, or baseline
  diagnosis. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads predict the presence of symptomatic
  and respiratory diseases. The use of standardized, quantitative methods is feasible,
  allows for replication, comparisons across institutions, and has the potential to
  facilitate consensus quantitative thresholds for risk stratification and treatment."
