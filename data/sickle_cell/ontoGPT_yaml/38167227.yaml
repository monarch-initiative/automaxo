input_text: 'Successful Conservative Therapy for Infected Penile Implants: A Case
  Series. BACKGROUND Traditionally, penile implant infections have been treated by
  removal followed by immediate or delayed replacement. The use of antibiotics in
  conservative therapy has recently attracted attention. CASE REPORT We report our
  experience with 4 cases of infected penile implants managed conservatively. Case
  1 was a 41-year-old with sickle cell anemia who presented with low-grade fever and
  purulent discharge that started 1 month postoperatively and lasted for 3 weeks.
  He had left graft after fibrotic tissue excision with 14-mm collection in the left
  corpus cavernosum. He was managed with IV pipracillin/tazobactam and vancomycin
  for 13 days. Follow-up after 23 weeks showed complete wound healing. Case 2 was
  a 62-year-old with diabetes who had purulent discharge that started 41 days postoperatively
  and lasted for 1 week. He received 5 days of IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up
  after 4 weeks showed marked improvement of the wound. Case 3 was a 61-year-old with
  diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 30 days postoperatively with fever,
  purulent discharge for 5 days. He received a total of 10 days of IV vancomycin and
  gentamycin. Follow-up 3 weeks after discharge showed complete wound healing. Case
  4 was a 61-year-old with diabetes and ischemic heart disease. He presented 1 month
  postoperatively with fever and pus discharge for 1 week. He completed 10 days of
  IV vancomycin and gentamycin. Follow-up after 1 week showed marked wound healing.
  CONCLUSIONS Choosing patients with early superficial infected penile prosthesis
  for conservative management should be tailored to selected patients who does not
  have leukocytosis, signs of sepsis, high-grade fever, or an exposed device.'
