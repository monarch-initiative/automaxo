input_text: 'Daily use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors as prevention for recurrent
  priapism. OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of recurrent priapism is currently being investigated
  based on the regulation of the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) enzyme. We explored the
  daily use of PDE5 inhibitors to treat and prevent priapism recurrences. METHOD:
  We administered PDE5 inhibitors using a long-term therapeutic regimen in seven men
  with recurrent priapism, with a mean age of 29.2 years (range 21 to 35 years). Six
  men (85.7%) had idiopathic priapism recurrences and one man (24.3%) had sickle cell
  disease-associated priapism recurrences. Tadalafil 5 mg was administered daily.
  The mean follow-up was 6.6 months (range 3 to 12 months). RESULTS: Daily long-term
  oral PDE5 inhibitor therapy alleviated priapism recurrences in all patients. Five
  (71.4%) had no episodes of priapism and two (28.6%) referred decrease in their episodes
  of priapism. All patients referred improvement in erectile function. CONCLUSION:
  These findings suggest the hypothesis that PDE5 dysregulation exerts a pathogenic
  role for both sickle cell disease-associated priapism and for idiopathic priapism,
  and that it offers a molecular target for the therapeutic management of priapism.
  These preliminary observations suggest that continuous long-term oral PDE5 inhibitor
  therapy may treat and prevent recurrent priapism.'
