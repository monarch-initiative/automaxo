input_text: Increased Rates of Rhabdomyolysis in Male Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
  Recipients Taking Sirolimus and Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole. Hematopoietic cell
  transplantation (HCT) offers long-term cure against early morbidity and mortality
  of hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. Following
  HCT, sirolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent graft-versus-host disease
  (GVHD) while receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis
  jirovecii prophylaxis and other antimicrobial agents (including acyclovir). One
  rare adverse event associated with both drugs is rhabdomyolysis, defined as creatine
  kinase (CK) elevation at least 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal. This study
  was conducted to evaluate the rate of and risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis
  in the post-HCT setting. Across 4 haploidentical and matched related donor (MRD)
  nonmyeloablative protocols, CK levels were prospectively monitored and patients
  were retrospectively identified for rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis was graded
  based on the severity of CK elevation and other organ injury. At diagnosis, patients
  were queried for concurrent medication use (ie, sirolimus, TMP-SMX, acyclovir, or
  statins), sex, age, donor genotype, and time from transplantation. Among 127 patients
  with mostly SCD, rhabdomyolysis occurred in 22 (17%), including 2 recipients of
  haploidentical donor HCT and 20 recipients of MRD HCT. The time to the development
  of rhabdomyolysis was 61 and 73 days for the 2 recipients of haploidentical HCT
  and a median of 73 days for the MRD HCT recipients. Among the 22 patients who developed
  rhabdomyolysis, 20 (91%) were receiving sirolimus (2 haploidentical HCT recipients
  and 18 MRD HCT recipients), and 14 (64%) were also receiving TMP-SMX (all in the
  MRD HCT group). Seventy-five percent of the haploidentical donors and 69% of the
  MRDs had sickle cell trait. All but 2 patients with rhabdomyolysis were male. No
  patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were receiving statins at any point. Higher-than-expected
  rates of rhabdomyolysis were found post-transplantation for patients with SCD and
  beta-thalassemia. Contributing risk factors included immunosuppression with sirolimus,
  TMP-SMX, male sex, and sickle trait donor. These factors differ from the excessive
  muscle strain or injury, seizures, infections, or HMG-CoA inhibitors typically identified
  in non-HCT recipients.
