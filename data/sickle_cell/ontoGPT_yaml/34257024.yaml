input_text: "Six-point DIXON and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Techniques in Quantifying
  Bone Marrow Fat in Sickle Cell Disease.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To compare bone
  marrow fat quantification using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and six-point
  DIXON (6PD) techniques in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and healthy subjects.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective study, with 43 SCD patients (24 homozygous [SS],
  19 double heterozygous [SC), and 41 healthy subjects paired by age, weight and sex
  with SCD patients. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging with 6PD
  and single voxel MRS in the L3 vertebral body. Pearson's correlation, ROC curve,
  and bland-altman analysis were performed, p-values <=0.05 were considered statistically
  significant for all tests. RESULTS: Significant linear correlation was found between
  fat fraction (FF) by 6PD and Total Lipids (TL) (r = 0.932; p < 0.001) and Saturated
  Lipids (SL) (r = 0.934; p < 0.001), in all subjects. Strong correlations were also
  identified considering subjects of the SS/SC subgroups. Despite high correlations,
  no significant difference was observed only between FF and SL in the SS subgroup
  (Bland-Altman analysis), indicating excellent agreement between the fat estimations
  in this specific situation. Significant differences were observed in all variables
  (FF, TL, SL) comparing the SCD and healthy subjects. The ROC curve between SCD and
  healthy subjects showed the following areas under the curve: FF(0.924) > TL(0.883)
  > SL(0.892). CONCLUSIONS: The comparison between fat quantification by the 6PD with
  MRS demonstrated an excellent correlation in SCD patients, especially in the SS
  subgroup, which usually has a higher degree of hemolysis. The diagnostic performance
  of 6PD and MRS is similar, with advantages of shorter imaging processing time and
  larger studied area with the 6PD."
