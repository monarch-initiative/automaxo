input_text: Natural history of blood pressure in sickle cell disease pregnancy.In
  this retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in people with sickle cell
  disease (SCD) delivered at two academic centres between 1990 and 2021, we collected
  demographic and SCD-related data, pregnancy outcomes, and the highest systolic and
  diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) at seven time periods. We compared blood
  pressure values and trajectories in the composite cohort and in each genotype group
  to control values in a non-SCD pregnancy dataset. There were 290 pregnancies among
  197 patients with SCD. Sixteen per cent (n = 47) of pregnancies had a hypertensive
  disorder of pregnancy (HDP); the rates did not differ by genotype. The mean SBP
  and DBP were lower in the HbSS/HbSbeta0 group than in the non-SCD control group
  at all timepoints. Mean SBP and DBP trajectories were similar between the HbSS/HbSbeta0
  group and non-SCD controls, whereas the mean SBP and DBP in the HbSC/HbSbeta+ group
  decreased between the first and second trimesters and plateaued between the second
  and third trimesters. There were no differences in blood pressure trajectory by
  haemoglobin >/< 10 gm/dL or by chronic transfusion status. Overall, pregnant people
  with SCD have lower blood pressure than unaffected pregnant people, raising the
  possibility that HDP are underdiagnosed, particularly in people with HbSS/HbSbeta0
