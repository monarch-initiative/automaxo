input_text: 'Assessment of donor cell engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  for sickle cell disease: A review of current and future methods.Hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only established curative treatment for sickle
  cell disease (SCD), a debilitating red blood cell (RBC) disorder with significant
  prevalence worldwide. Accurate assessment of RBC engraftment following HSCT is essential
  to evaluate the status of the graft and can enable early intervention to treat or
  prevent graft rejection. Currently, chimerism measurement is performed on whole
  blood samples, which mainly reflect white blood cell (WBC) chimerism. This approach
  has limitations in assessing engraftment in patients with SCD because RBCs engraft
  non-linearly with WBCs. Direct measures of RBC chimerism exist but are not routinely
  used. In this review, we critically examine the current methodologies for assessing
  donor engraftment; highlight the limitations of these different methods, and present
  emerging and novel technologies with the potential to improve clinical monitoring
  of RBC engraftment post-HSCT for SCD. Promising alternative methodologies include
  RBC-specific flow cytometry, RBC-specific RNA analysis, and quantification of plasma
  cell-free DNA derived specifically from nucleated RBCs.'
