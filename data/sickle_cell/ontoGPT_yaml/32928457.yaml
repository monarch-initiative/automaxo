input_text: 'Outcomes of an Emergency Department Observation Unit-Based Pathway for
  the Treatment of Uncomplicated Vaso-occlusive Events in Sickle Cell Disease. STUDY
  OBJECTIVE: This was a prospective, pre-post, 13-year observational study documenting
  the multiyear implementation of an observation unit sickle cell pathway for patients
  with uncomplicated vaso-occlusive events. METHODS: The sickle cell pathway begins
  with rapid triage to identify patients with uncomplicated vaso-occlusive events
  for immediate transfer to the observation unit and initiation of patient-controlled
  analgesia followed by repeated evaluations of pain and identification of other complications.
  Data were abstracted from the electronic medical record or observation unit database.
  The sickle cell pathway was initiated in April 2006. Major revisions of it were
  carried out in June 2009 (physician evaluation occurs in sickle cell pathway and
  only patient-controlled analgesia administration of medications) and October 2010
  (multidisciplinary management and individual dosing). RESULTS: Annual ED visits
  ranged between 287 and 528. The preimplementation hospital admission rate was 33%
  (123/368), 3-day return rate 16% (60/368), and 30-day return rate 67% (248/368).
  Refinements to the sickle cell pathway have resulted in a decrease in admission
  rate to 20% (258/1276); 3-day return rate, to 3.6% (46/1,276); and 30-day return
  rate, to 41% (525/1,276) for the past 3 years. CONCLUSION: The use of a sickle cell
  pathway for the treatment of uncomplicated vaso-occlusive events has been effective
  in providing rapid treatment and reducing hospital admissions. However, it was not
  only the intervention and its refinement that made the sickle cell pathway successful.
  With the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, it was discerned that
  outer setting factors of organizational commitment to the care of patients with
  SCD, inner setting factors of learning climate and leadership engagement, individuals,
  and process contributed to the success of the sickle cell pathway.'
