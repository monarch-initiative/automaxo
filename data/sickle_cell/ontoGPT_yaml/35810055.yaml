input_text: '[Acute chest syndrome in adult sickle cell patients]. Sickle cell disease
  is a frequent genetic condition, due to a mutation of the beta-globin gene, leading
  to the production of an abnormal S hemoglobin and characterized by multiple vaso-occlusive
  events. The acute chest syndrome is a severe complication associated with a significant
  disability and mortality. It is defined by the association of one or more clinical
  respiratory manifestations and a new infiltrate on lung imaging. Its pathophysiology
  is complex and implies vaso-occlusive phenomena (pulmonary vascular thrombosis,
  fat embolism), infection, and alveolar hypoventilation. S/S or S/beta0-thalassemia
  genotype, a history of vaso-occlusive crisis or acute chest syndrome, a low F hemoglobin
  level (<5%), a high steady-state hemoglobin level (> 10 g/dL), or a high steady-state
  leukocytosis (>10 G/L) are the main risk factors. Febrile chest pain, dyspnea, sometimes
  cough with expectorations are its main clinical manifestations, and bi-basal crackles
  are found at auscultation. Inferior alveolar opacities with or without pleural effusions
  are identified on chest X-ray or CT-scan. Management of the acute chest syndrome
  should be prompt and implies, besides the recognition of severity signs, a multimodal
  analgesia, oxygen supplementation, sometimes a parenteral antibiotic treatment and
  the frequent use of blood transfusions especially in the most severe cases. Prevention
  is important and includes a regular monitoring of hospitalized patients and the
  use of incentive spirometry.'
