input_text: 'Combining malaria vaccination with chemoprevention: a promising new approach
  to malaria control. Malaria control has stalled in a number of African countries
  and novel approaches to malaria control are needed for these areas. The encouraging
  results of a recent trial conducted in young children in Burkina Faso and Mali in
  which a combination of the RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine and seasonal malaria chemoprevention
  led to a substantial reduction in clinical cases of malaria, severe malaria, and
  malaria deaths compared with the administration of either intervention given alone
  suggests that there may be other epidemiological/clinical situations in which a
  combination of malaria vaccination and chemoprevention could be beneficial. Some
  of these potential opportunities are considered in this paper. These include combining
  vaccination with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants, with intermittent
  preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (through vaccination of women of child-bearing
  age before or during pregnancy), or with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention
  in the management of children recently admitted to hospital with severe anaemia.
  Other potential uses of the combination are prevention of malaria in children at
  particular risk from the adverse effects of clinical malaria, such as those with
  sickle cell disease, and during the final stages of a malaria elimination programme
  when vaccination could be combined with repeated rounds of mass drug administration.
  The combination of a pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccine with an effective chemopreventive
  regimen could make a valuable contribution to malaria control and elimination in
  a variety of clinical or epidemiological situations, and the potential of this approach
  to malaria control needs to be explored.'
