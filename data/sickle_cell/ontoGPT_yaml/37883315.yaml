input_text: 'Longer length peripheral catheters in sickle cell treatment: a more efficient
  and cost-effective care pathway. Patients with sickle cell disease require frequent
  venous access for red blood cell exchange transfusions to manage their condition.
  Such frequent access can lead to scar tissue formation, increased pain on insertion,
  and difficult vascular access for the patients. Previous attempts at achieving successful
  venous access for patients with difficult venous access has been made with central
  venous lines, usually femoral lines, which required a large amount of nursing input
  and resulted in anxiety and pain on insertion for patients. In this article, the
  author reports on a new pathway with a longer-length peripheral intravenous catheter
  that reduces the nursing time burden during line insertion, requires less equipment
  and, crucially, results in a less painful procedure for patients. The increased
  efficiency of the pathway resulted in a cost saving of $149 per insertion, and patient
  feedback revealed that the longer-length catheter was preferred over femoral lines.'
