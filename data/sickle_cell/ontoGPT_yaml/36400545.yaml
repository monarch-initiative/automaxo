input_text: 'Allogeneic Transplant and Gene Therapy: Evolving Toward a Cure. Curative
  therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD) include allogeneic human leukocyte antigen
  (HLA)- matched sibling and haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), gene
  therapy, and gene editing. However, comparative trial data that might facilitate
  selecting one curative therapy over another are unavailable. New strategies to decrease
  graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risks are needed to expand
  haploidentical HCT. Myeloablative gene therapy and gene editing also has limitations.
  Herein, we review recent studies on curative therapies for SCD in the past 5 years.'

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
