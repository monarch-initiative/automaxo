input_text: 'Health insurance and the financial implications of sickle cell disease
  among parents of affected children attending a tertiary facility in Lagos, south-west
  Nigeria.INTRODUCTION: there is a paucity of data on the financial implications of
  sickle cell disease on households of affected children and their use of health insurance
  in Nigeria. This study assessed the awareness of health insurance, patterns of health
  service utilization and financial implications of sickle cell disease among children
  seeking care at a tertiary facility in Nigeria. METHODS: a structured questionnaire
  was administered to parents of 314 children with sickle cell disease attending the
  pediatric hematology unit of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital between May
  and December 2019. RESULTS: mean age of the children was 91.5 +- 43.1 months. M:
  F was 1.17: 1. 45.5% of households earned above NGN 150,000 (USD 417) monthly. 71.3%
  of the parents had heard of health insurance but only 20.7% were enrolled in a health
  insurance scheme. Awareness of health insurance was significantly associated with
  social class (p=0.000) and monthly household income (p=0.000). 60.8% of the parents
  preferred pre-facility treatment. Social class (p=0.01) and monthly household income
  (p=0.001) were significantly associated with home treatment. Time on admission ranged
  from 2-18 days with an average of 4.31 days. Average cost of hospitalization was
  USD 148 +- USD 14.2 and total cost of care incurred was USD 20,787. Neither age
  of child (p=0.857), estimated household income (p=0.863) nor social class (p=0.397)
  was associated with cost of care. CONCLUSION: a high cost of care was observed in
  our study population underscoring the need for increased awareness and access to
  health insurance for households of children with sickle cell disease.'
