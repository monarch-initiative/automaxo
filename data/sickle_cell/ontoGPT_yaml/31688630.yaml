input_text: 'The Adolescent and Caregiver Sickle Cell Disease Self-management Skills
  Checklist: Preliminary Reliability and Validity. Adolescents with sickle cell disease
  (SCD) need assistance in developing the knowledge and skills that contribute to
  increased disease self-management and successful transition to adult-based health
  care. This study evaluated the preliminary psychometric properties of the Self-Management
  Skills Checklist (SMSC and SMSC-C; Adolescent and Caregiver versions), a measure
  of perceived SCD-specific knowledge and skills. A retrospective cohort study included
  114 adolescents (mean=15.6 y) and their caregivers. We examined internal structure
  and reliability, score changes over time, and group differences. Cronbach coefficient
  alphas were 0.79 and 0.74 for caregiver-reported Skills and caregiver-reported knowledge,
  respectively, and 0.77 and 0.44 for adolescent-reported skills and adolescent-reported
  knowledge, respectively, indicating good internal consistency for 3 of the subscales.
  Poor reliability in the adolescent-reported knowledge summary score and factor analysis
  suggest an interpretation item-by-item, independent of one another. Participant
  group differences in age and chronic transfusion treatment existed in both summary
  and subscale scores of the SMSC and SMSC-C. Follow-up administrations of the scales
  indicated an increase in caregiver-reported skills for their adolescents from time
  1 scores (M=3.72+-0.83) to time 2 scores (M=3.99+-0.63) (t16=2.178, P=0.045). Findings
  provide preliminary support for the usage of the SMSC and continued development
  to improve its psychometrics.'
