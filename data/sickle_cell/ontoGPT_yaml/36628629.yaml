input_text: 'How do we operate a large monthly red blood cell exchange program. BACKGROUND:
  Red blood cell (RBC) exchange for sickle cell disease presents unique difficulties
  due to RBC phenotyping, complex antibody work-ups, large number of RBC units required,
  and vascular access considerations, any of which can delay the procedure. Multidisciplinary
  coordination and systemic processes ensure that monthly appointments remain on schedule.
  STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A high-volume chronic RBC exchange program is described,
  highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary coordination and process improvement
  strategies involving initial referral, vascular access, order sets, and allocation
  of antigen-negative or phenotypically matched RBCs. RESULTS: Approximately 50 outpatient
  RBC exchanges are performed each month with an 82% kept-appointment rate. Specific
  factors for program success include open communication across services and improvements
  to referrals and standardized order sets. CONCLUSION: A combination of multidisciplinary
  coordination and process improvement can ensure the success of a high volume RBC
  exchange program. Frequent communication of upcoming appointments between the referring
  hematologists, the hemapheresis clinic, transfusion service, and interventional
  radiology is critical. Advance notice to the immunohematology reference lab of upcoming
  appointments is needed to allow enough time for allocating antigen-negative RBCs.
  Order sets can be leveraged to standardize and streamline RBC exchanges. Lastly,
  numerous mechanisms help patients compensate for the cognitive sequelae of stroke.'
