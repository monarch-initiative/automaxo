input_text: 'Prospective evaluation of chronic organ damage in adult sickle cell patients:
  A seven-year follow-up study. Organ damage in sickle cell disease (SCD) is a crucial
  determinant for disease severity and prognosis. In a previous study, we analyzed
  the prevalence of SCD-related organ damage and complications in adult sickle cell
  patients. We now describe a seven-year follow-up of this cohort.All patients from
  the primary analysis in 2006 (n = 104), were included for follow-up. Patients were
  screened for SCD-related organ damage and complications (microalbuminuria, renal
  failure, elevated tricuspid regurgitation flow velocity (TRV) (>=2.5 m/seconds),
  retinopathy, iron overload, cholelithiasis, avascular osteonecrosis, leg ulcers,
  acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, priapism and admissions for vaso-occlusive crises
  (VOC) biannually. Upon 7 years of follow-up, progression in the prevalence of avascular
  osteonecrosis (from 12.5% to 20.4%), renal failure (from 6.7% to 23.4%), retinopathy
  (from 39.7% to 53.8%) was observed in the whole group. In HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thal patients
  also progression in microalbuminuria (from 34% to 45%) and elevated TRV (from 40%
  to 48%) was observed while hardly any progression in the prevalence of cholelithiasis,
  priapism, stroke or chronic ulcers was seen. The proportion of patients with at
  least one episode of ACS increased in the group of HbSS/HbSbeta0 -thal patients
  from 32% to 49.1%. In conclusion, 62% of the sickle cell patients in this prospective
  cohort study developed a new SCD-related complication in a comprehensive care setting
  within 7 years of follow-up. Although the hospital admission rate for VOC remained
  stable, multiple forms of organ damage increased substantially. These observations
  underline the need for continued screening for organ damage in all adult patients
  with SCD.'
