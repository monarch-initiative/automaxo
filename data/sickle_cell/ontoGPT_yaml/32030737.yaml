input_text: Regulation of iron homeostasis through the erythroferrone-hepcidin axis
  in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) has a distinct pattern of transfusional
  iron overload (IO) when compared to transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia major
  (TDT). We conducted a single institution prospective study to evaluate plasma biomarkers
  of iron regulation and inflammation in patients with SCD with IO (SCD IO cases,
  n = 22) and without IO (SCD non-IO cases, n = 11), and non-SCD controls (n = 13).
  Hepcidin was found to be inappropriately low, as evidenced by a significantly higher
  median hepcidin/ferritin ratio in non-SCD controls compared to SCD IO cases (0 3
  vs. 0 02, P < 0 0001) and SCD non-IO cases (0 3 vs. 0 02, P < 0 0001), suggesting
  that certain inhibitory mechanism (s) work to suppress hepcidin in SCD. As opposed
  to the SCD non-IO state, where hepcidin shows a strong significant positive correlation
  with ferritin (Spearman rho = 0 7, P = 0 02), this correlation was lost when IO
  occurs (Spearman rho = -0 2, P = 0 4). Although a direct non-linear correlation
  between erythroferrone (ERFE) and hepcidin did not reach statistical significance
  both in the IO (Spearman rho = -0 4, P = 0 08) and non-IO state (Spearman rho =
  -0 6, P = 0 07), patients with highest ERFE had low hepcidin levels, suggesting
  that ERFE contributes to hepcidin regulation in some patients. Our results suggest
  a multifactorial mechanism of hepcidin regulation in SCD.
