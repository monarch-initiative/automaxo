input_text: 'Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction in Sickle Cell Disease: A Case
  Series.BACKGROUND Transfusion therapy has a well-established role in the management
  of several sickle cell disease (SCD)-related complications. Nevertheless, the benefits
  of transfusion must outweigh the possible risks, including iron overload, infections,
  and transfusion reactions. Alloimmunization is the underlying etiology of most delayed
  hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTR). DHTR is often underestimated and underdiagnosed
  in sickle cell disease patients as it mimics a vaso-occlusive crisis in presentation.
  Alloimmunization to RBC antigens can be a serious complication of transfusion, which
  is of particular interest in individuals with SCD, as the occurrence rate is higher
  in this population. This complication represents a secondary immunological phenomenon
  that typically arises after the emergence of an alloantibody to which the patient
  had been previously sensitized to. CASE REPORT Here, we report 2 cases of delayed
  hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) in which the patients showed evidence of alloimmunization
  from previous blood transfusions. The patients were managed with a variety of medications,
  including supportive treatments, utilization of immunosuppressive agents, and enhancement
  of erythropoiesis. Both patients had evidence of clinical and laboratory improvement
  following the management. CONCLUSIONS DHTR is considered one of the most deleterious
  complications of transfusion in SCD patients. The diagnosis and management of DHTR
  is very challenging, especially because it can present differently in this population.
  A high index of clinical suspicion is needed in addition to the laboratory criteria.'
