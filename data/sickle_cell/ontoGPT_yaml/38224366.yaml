input_text: 'Enhancing diagnostic precision for acute chest syndrome in sickle cell
  disease: insights from dual-energy CT lung perfusion mapping.PURPOSE: Acute chest
  syndrome (ACS) is secondary to occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature and a potentially
  life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Dual-energy CT (DECT)
  iodine perfusion map reconstructions can provide a method to visualize and quantify
  the extent of pulmonary microthrombi. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with sickle
  cell disease who underwent DECT CTPA with perfusion were retrospectively identified.
  The presence or absence of airspace opacities, segmental perfusion defects, and
  acute or chronic pulmonary emboli was noted. The number of segmental perfusion defects
  between patients with and without acute chest syndrome was compared. Sub-analyses
  were performed to investigate robustness. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 68 were
  clinically determined to not have ACS and 34 were determined to have ACS by clinical
  criteria. Of the patients with ACS, 82.4% were found to have perfusion defects with
  a median of 2 perfusion defects per patient. The presence of any or new perfusion
  defects was significantly associated with the diagnosis of ACS (P = 0.005 and <
  0.001, respectively). Excluding patients with pulmonary embolism, 79% of patients
  with ACS had old or new perfusion defects, and the specificity for new perfusion
  defects was 87%, higher than consolidation/ground glass opacities (80%). CONCLUSION:
  DECT iodine map has the capability to depict microthrombi as perfusion defects.
  The presence of segmental perfusion defects on dual-energy CT maps was found to
  be associated with ACS with potential for improved specificity and reclassification.'
