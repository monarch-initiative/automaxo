input_text: 'Movement Is Life-Optimizing Patient Access to Total Joint Arthroplasty:
  Anemia and Sickle Cell Disease Disparities. Anemia and sickle cell anemia before
  surgery are often unrecognized medical comorbidities that can and should be addressed.
  Nearly 6% of the American population meets the criteria for anemia. The elderly,
  along with patients with renal disease, cancer, heart failure, or diabetes mellitus
  are more likely to be anemic. The most common form of anemia is due to iron deficiency,
  which can be easily treated before surgery. Sickle cell anemia occurs in 1 in 365
  Black births and 1 in 16,300 Hispanic births, with 100,000 Americans currently living
  with sickle cell anemia. Patients who have anemia or sickle cell anemia are at increased
  risk for postoperative complications, including the need for blood transfusions
  and delayed healing. For those with sickle cell disease, surgeries can precipitate
  a sickle cell crisis. Patients with sickle cell anemia face barriers in accessing
  appropriate care; however, these patients can be optimized using preoperative red
  blood cell transfusions to dilute sickle cells and elevate the hemoglobin level.
  There should also be careful consideration and monitoring of the pain level of patients
  with sickle cell anemia in the perioperative period.'
