input_text: 'Comparative study of alloimmunization against red cell antigens in sickle
  cell disease & thalassaemia major patients on regular red cell transfusion. BACKGROUND
  & OBJECTIVES: : Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients require red cell transfusion
  during different clinical complications of the disease. Such patients are at a high
  risk for developing alloantibody against red cell antigens. From India, there are
  limited data available on alloantibody formation in multiply transfused SCD patients.
  The present study was thus undertaken to fill up this lacunae by looking at the
  development of red cell alloantibodies in SCD and beta-thalassaemia patients on
  regular transfusion. METHODS: : All sickle cell disease patients undergoing red
  cell transfusion between 2008 and 2016, were included. During this period, a large
  number of beta-thalassaemia major patients also underwent regular red cell transfusion.
  These thalassaemia patients were also included to compare the tendency of antibody
  formation between SCD and beta-thalassaemia major patients. All patients before
  regular transfusion were regularly assessed for the development of red cell antibody.
  Red cell antigen, antibody screen crossmatch and antibody identification were done
  using the standard technique. RESULTS: : A total of 138 patients with SCD aged between
  4 and 53 yr (mean 17.6 yr) consisting of 83 males and 55 females (male:female, 1.5:1)
  along with 333 transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia patients were studied. Over
  the last eight years, 15 patients with SCD and four patients with thalassaemia developed
  alloantibody (P <0.001). Antibody specificity of their alloantibodies was against
  Rhc, RhE, Kell, Fya and Fyb only. Sickle cell disease patients with and without
  alloantibody required on the average 11.8 and 8.6 units of red cell concentrate,
  respectively (P <0.05). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: : About 11 per cent of the
  transfused sickle cells patients developed alloantibodies. The antibody specificity
  was restricted to Rh, Kell and Duffy blood group systems. Extended antigen matching
  involving Rh, Kell and Duffy antigens may prevent alloantibody in such patients.'
