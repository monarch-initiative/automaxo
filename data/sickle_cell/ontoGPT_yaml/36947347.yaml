input_text: 'Positive rate and quality assessment of CT pulmonary angiography in sickle
  cell disease: a case-control study.BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications are common
  in sickle cell disease (SCD) and can mimic pulmonary embolisms (PEs), leading to
  potential overuse of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Maximizing
  the quality of CTPA is essential for its diagnostic accuracy. However, little is
  known about the positive rate and quality of CTPA in SCD. METHODS: This retrospective
  case-control study aimed to determine the positive rate and quality of CTPA studies
  performed to rule out PE in SCD (HbSS genotype) patients compared to a control group.
  Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated
  with suboptimal CTPA studies, defined as a mean enhancement of < 210 HU in the pulmonary
  artery. RESULTS: The study included 480 patients, consisting of 240 SCD patients
  and 240 controls. The positive rate of PE was 4.0%, with a similar rate in both
  SCD patients and the control group (4.2% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.08). However, SCD patients
  had significantly lower contrast enhancement of the pulmonary artery than the control
  group (266.1 +- 90.5 HU vs. 342.2 +- 116.1 HU, p < 0.01). Notably, 25.4% of SCD
  patients had suboptimal scans. The logistic regression model demonstrated that SCD
  was significantly associated with suboptimal pulmonary arterial contrast enhancement
  compared to the control group (OR = 4.4; 95% CI: 2.4-8.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study
  revealed a relatively low positive rate of CTPA in both SCD patients and the control
  group. However, SCD was significantly associated with suboptimal image quality due
  to inadequate contrast enhancement of the pulmonary artery. Further research is
  needed to identify measures that can enhance the quality of CTPA studies in SCD
  patients and to establish a specific imaging protocol for this patient population.'
