input_text: 'The effect of intensity of conditioning regimen on the outcome of HSCT
  in children with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation (HSCT) provides a cure for patients with sickle cell disease
  (SCD). This study describes the effect of conditioning regimen intensity on HSCT
  outcomes among children younger than 14 years with SCD. METHODS: Transplants from
  HLA-matched related donors (MRD) and unrelated donors (MUD) using either myeloablative
  conditioning (MAC) regimens or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens were
  considered. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints
  included overall survival (OS) and occurrence of GVHD. RESULTS: 48 SCD patients
  underwent HSCT, 45 (93.8%) patients had MRD, 1 (2.1%) had 9/10 related donor, and
  2 (4.1%) had MUD. The median age at transplant was 8.6 years (range, 3.1-13.8).
  Conditioning regimens were myeloablative (MAC) in 41 (85.4%) patients and of reduced
  intensity in 7 (14.6%) patients. EFS at 2 years was 100% among MAC group compared
  to 29% in the RIC group (p < .001). The median follow-up was 43.4 months (range
  26.8-134). All events in the RIC group were secondary graft failure. However, OS
  was 100% in both groups at 2 years. Acute GVHD II-IV was diagnosed in 2 (4.1%) patients.
  Chronic GVHD occurred in 2 (4.1%) patients. GVHD did not occur in patients who underwent
  MUD HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: MAC in children with SCD is well tolerated and associated
  with an excellent outcome for HLA-matched HSCT in SCD. There was a high rate of
  secondary graft failure with the use of RIC. Future studies are needed to optimize
  RIC regimens in HSCT of children with SCD.'
