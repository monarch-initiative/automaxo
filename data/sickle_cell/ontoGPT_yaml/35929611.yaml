input_text: 'The effect of intensity of conditioning regimen on the outcome of HSCT
  in children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
  transplantation (HSCT) provides a cure for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).
  This study describes the effect of conditioning regimen intensity on HSCT outcomes
  among children younger than 14 years with SCD. METHODS: Transplants from HLA-matched
  related donors (MRD) and unrelated donors (MUD) using either myeloablative conditioning
  (MAC) regimens or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens were considered.
  Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included
  overall survival (OS) and occurrence of GVHD. RESULTS: 48 SCD patients underwent
  HSCT, 45 (93.8%) patients had MRD, 1 (2.1%) had 9/10 related donor, and 2 (4.1%)
  had MUD. The median age at transplant was 8.6 years (range, 3.1-13.8). Conditioning
  regimens were myeloablative (MAC) in 41 (85.4%) patients and of reduced intensity
  in 7 (14.6%) patients. EFS at 2 years was 100% among MAC group compared to 29% in
  the RIC group (p < .001). The median follow-up was 43.4 months (range 26.8-134).
  All events in the RIC group were secondary graft failure. However, OS was 100% in
  both groups at 2 years. Acute GVHD II-IV was diagnosed in 2 (4.1%) patients. Chronic
  GVHD occurred in 2 (4.1%) patients. GVHD did not occur in patients who underwent
  MUD HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: MAC in children with SCD is well tolerated and associated
  with an excellent outcome for HLA-matched HSCT in SCD. There was a high rate of
  secondary graft failure with the use of RIC. Future studies are needed to optimize
  RIC regimens in HSCT of children with SCD.'
