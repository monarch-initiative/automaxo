input_text: 'Occult ischemic bone lesions in children with sickle cell disease: A
  study of prevalence.INTRODUCTION: Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a severe complication
  of sickle cell disease (SCD) and involves principally the femoral head. Few data
  exist about the prevalence of lesions in other segments. METHODS: In this cross-sectional
  study, 42 children (20 males and 22 females) underwent a magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) of the spine, upper arms, and femurs. The primary outcome was to define the
  prevalence and locations of bone infarcts. RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed
  the study; the total median age was 11.9 years (interquartile range = 9.5-13.9).
  Eleven patients (26.2%) were positive for altered bone findings for a total of 32
  lesions. Most of the lesions were in the humerus 17 (53.1%), 11 (34.4%) in the femurs,
  and 4 (12.5%) in the vertebrae. The median number of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs)
  was two and four for patients without and with bone lesions, respectively (p = .01).
  The annual rate of VOC is the best marker for the positive MRI (odds ratio = 82.6;
  p = .03), and it is correlated with the number of sites involved (p = .02). CONCLUSIONS:
  Our study highlights that the prevalence of skeletal lesions could be underestimated,
  and it provides the basis for clinical reasoning and tailored therapy in SCD children.'
