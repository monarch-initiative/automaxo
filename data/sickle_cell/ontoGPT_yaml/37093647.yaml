input_text: Simultaneous adjunctive treatment of malaria and its coevolved genetic
  disorder sickle cell anemia. Effective treatments for genetic disorders that co-evolved
  with pathogens require simultaneous betterment of both conditions. Hydroxyurea (HU)
  offers safe and efficacious treatment for sickle cell anaemia (SCA) by reducing
  clinical complications, transfusions, and death. Despite concerns that HU-treatment
  for SCA would increase infection risk by the human malaria Plasmodium falciparum,
  (the genetic driver of the sickle mutation), HU instead reduced clinical malaria.
  We utilized physiologically relevant drug exposures that mimic in vivo pharmacokinetics
  in humans. Under these conditions, we showed that HU and other ribonucleotide reductase
  (rnr) inhibitors, have significant, intrinsic killing activity in vitro against
  schizont stages of P. falciparum in both normal and sickle red blood cells. Long-term
  in vitro selection with HU increased expression of Pfrnr genes but showed low risk
  of eliciting stably resistant parasites or compromising potency of current antimalarial
  drugs. Additive activity devoid of antagonism by HU was observed with a wide spectrum
  of commonly used antimalarial treatments. These data endorse broad, safe, long-term
  use of HU for SCA in malaria endemic countries and provide a novel biological model
  for treatment of a genetic disorder with simultaneous, adjunct therapy of a life-threatening
  infection needed in a global health setting.
