input_text: 'Impact of Medicaid expansion on access and healthcare among individuals
  with sickle cell disease. PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with
  high acute healthcare utilization. The purpose of this study was to examine whether
  Medicaid expansion in California increased Medicaid enrollment, increased hydroxyurea
  prescriptions filled, and decreased acute healthcare utilization in SCD. METHODS:
  Individuals with SCD (<=65 years and enrolled in Medicaid for >=6 total calendar
  months any year between 2011 and 2016) were identified in a multisource database
  maintained by the California Sickle Cell Data Collection Program. We describe trends
  and changes in Medicaid enrollment, hydroxyurea prescriptions filled, and emergency
  department (ED) visits and hospital admissions before (2011-2013) and after (2014-2016)
  Medicaid expansion in California. RESULTS: The cohort included 3635 individuals.
  Enrollment was highest in 2014 and lowest in 2016 with a 2.8% annual decease postexpansion.
  Although <20% of the cohort had a hydroxyurea prescription filled, the percentage
  increased by 5.2% annually after 2014. The ED visit rate was highest in 2014 and
  decreased slightly in 2016, decreasing by 1.1% annually postexpansion. Hospital
  admission rates were similar during the pre- and postexpansion periods. Young adults
  and adults had higher ED and hospital admission rates than children and adolescents.
  CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid expansion does not appear to have improved enrollment or acute
  healthcare utilization among individuals with SCD in California. Future studies
  should explore whether individuals with SCD transitioned to other insurance plans
  or became uninsured postexpansion, the underlying reasons for low hydroxyurea utilization,
  and the lack of effect on hospital admissions despite a modest effect on ED visits.'
