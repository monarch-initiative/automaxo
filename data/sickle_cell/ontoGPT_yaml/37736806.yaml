input_text: 'CRISPR-Cas9 system: a novel and promising era of genotherapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies,
  hematological malignancy, and hemophilia. Gene therapy represents a significant
  potential to revolutionize the field of hematology with applications in correcting
  genetic mutations, generating cell lines and animal models, and improving the feasibility
  and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Compared to different genetic engineering
  tools, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) CRISPR-associated
  protein 9 (Cas9) emerged as an effective and versatile genetic editor with the ability
  to precisely modify the genome. The applications of genetic engineering in various
  hematological disorders have shown encouraging results. Monogenic hematological
  disorders can conceivably be corrected with single gene modification. Through the
  use of CRISPR-CAS9, restoration of functional red blood cells and hemostasis factors
  were successfully attained in sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, and hemophilia
  disorders. Our understanding of hemato-oncology has been advanced via CRIPSR-CAS9
  technology. CRISPR-CAS9 aided to build a platform of mutated genes responsible for
  cell survival and proliferation in leukemia. Therapeutic application of CRISPR-CAS9
  when combined with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in multiple myeloma
  and acute lymphoblastic leukemia was feasible with attenuation of CAR T cell therapy
  pitfalls. Our review outlines the latest literature on the utilization of CRISPR-Cas9
  in the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies and hemophilia disorders. We present
  the strategies that were employed and the findings of preclinical and clinical trials.
  Also, the review will discuss gene engineering in the field of hemato-oncology as
  a proper tool to facilitate and overcome the drawbacks of chimeric antigen receptor
  T cell therapy (CAR-T).'
