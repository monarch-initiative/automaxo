input_text: 'A multimodal pain protocol for treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in
  patients with sickle cell disease: Implementation and evaluation. OBJECTIVES: Pain
  management during a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) for patients with sickle cell disease
  (SCD) remains a major challenge and strongly depends on opioids. We developed a
  multimodality pain protocol for rapid, opioid-sparing pain treatment of VOC and
  evaluated its feasibility. METHODS: Patients were included for evaluation if they
  were >=18 years, diagnosed with SCD and visited the emergency department (ED) because
  of VOC between July 2018 and December 2020. Primary evaluation outcome was the feasibility
  of multimodal pain analgesia (i.e., the use of at least two analgesics with different
  underlying mechanisms of action). RESULTS: A total of 131 SCD patients visited the
  ED because of VOC with a total of 550 ED presentations, of which 377 were eventually
  hospitalised. A total of 508 (92.4%) ED presentations and 374 (99.2%) hospital admissions
  received multimodal pain treatment. Time to first administration of an opioid was
  median [IQR] 34.0 [21.0-62.0] minutes. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a pain
  protocol using multimodal analgesia for VOC in patients with SCD appeared to be
  feasible and facilitated rapid administration of opioids. Controlled trials are
  needed to investigate the effectiveness of multimodal analgesia on pain and should
  focus on patient reported outcome measures.'
