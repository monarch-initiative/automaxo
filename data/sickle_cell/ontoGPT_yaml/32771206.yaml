input_text: '[Effects of a standardized musical intervention on the management of
  pain and anxiety-state of sickle-cell adolescents]. The effect of a standardized
  musical intervention for adolescents with sickle cell disease was studied. Two groups
  were evaluated using the visual analog scale of pain and the anxiety-state inventory
  before and after a standardized musical intervention or breathing intervention.
  A significant decrease in scores was observed, most notably for the group benefiting
  from the standardized musical intervention. This intervention could be integrated
  into the overall management of adolescents with sickle cell disease.'
