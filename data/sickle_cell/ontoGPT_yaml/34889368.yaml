input_text: 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation for sickle cell disease: updates and
  future directions.Excellent outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
  from HLA-identical siblings, improvements in conditioning regimens, novel graft-versus-host
  disease prophylaxis, and the availability of alternative donors have all contributed
  to the increased applicability and acceptability of HCT for sickle cell disease
  (SCD). In young children with symptomatic SCD with an available HLA-identical related
  donor, HCT should be carefully considered. HCT from alternative donors is typically
  undertaken only in patients with severe symptoms, causing or likely to cause organ
  damage, and in the context of clinical trials. Patients undergoing HCT for SCD require
  careful counseling and preparation. They require careful monitoring of unique organ
  toxicities and complications during HCT. Patients must be prospectively followed
  for a prolonged time to determine the long-term outcomes and late effects of HCT
  for SCD. Thus, there is a need for a universal, longitudinal clinical registry to
  follow patients after HCT for SCD in conjunction with individuals who do not receive
  HCT to compare outcomes. Antibody-based conditioning and ex-vivo umbilical cord
  blood expansion are likely to improve the availability and acceptability of HCT.
  In addition, new disease-modifying drugs and the emerging option of the autologous
  transplantation of gene-modified hematopoietic progenitor cells are likely to expand
  the available therapeutic options and make decision-making by patients, physicians,
  and caregivers even more complicated. Future efforts must also focus on determining
  the impact of socioeconomic status on access to and outcomes of HCT and the long-term
  impact of HCT on patients, families, and society.'
