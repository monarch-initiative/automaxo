input_text: 'Genetic Variants and Effect Modifiers of QT Interval Prolongation in
  Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common
  inherited blood disorder among African Americans (AA), with premature mortality
  which has been associated with prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval
  (QTc), a known risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Although numerous genetic variants
  have been identified as contributors to QT interval prolongation in the general
  population, their impact on SCD patients remains unclear. This study used an unweighted
  polygenic risk score (PRS) to validate the previously identified associations between
  SNPs and QTc interval in SCD patients, and to explore possible interactions with
  other factors that prolong QTc interval in AA individuals with SCD. METHODS: In
  SCD patients, candidate genetic variants associated with the QTc interval were genotyped.
  To identify any risk SNPs that may be correlated with QTc interval prolongation,
  linear regression was employed, and an unweighted PRS was subsequently constructed.
  The effect of PRS on the QTc interval was evaluated using linear regression, while
  stratification analysis was used to assess the influence of serum alanine transaminase
  (ALT), a biomarker for liver disease, on the PRS effect. We also evaluated the PRS
  with the two subcomponents of QTc, the QRS and JTc intervals. RESULTS: Out of 26
  candidate SNPs, five risk SNPs were identified for QTc duration under the recessive
  model. For every unit increase in PRS, the QTc interval prolonged by 4.0ms (95%
  CI: [2.0, 6.1]; p-value: <0.001) in the additive model and 9.4ms in the recessive
  model (95% CI: [4.6, 14.1]; p-value: <0.001). Serum ALT showed a modification effect
  on PRS-QTc prolongation under the recessive model. In the normal ALT group, each
  PRS unit increased QTc interval by 11.7ms (95% CI: [6.3, 17.1]; p-value: 2.60E-5),
  whereas this effect was not observed in the elevated ALT group (0.9ms; 95% CI: [-7.0,
  8.8]; p-value: 0.823). CONCLUSION: Several candidate genetic variants are associated
  with QTc interval prolongation in SCD patients, and serum ALT acts as a modifying
  factor. The association of a CPS1 gene variant in both QTc and JTc duration adds
  to NOS1AP as evidence of involvement of the urea cycle and nitric oxide metabolism
  in cardiac repolarization in SCD. Larger replication studies are needed to confirm
  these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.'
