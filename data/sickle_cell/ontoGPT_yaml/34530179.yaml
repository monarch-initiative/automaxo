input_text: 'Low Rates of Cerebral Infarction after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
  in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease at High Risk for Stroke. Hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation (HSCT) can be curative for sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD patients
  with cerebrovascular disease are often referred for HSCT. The objective of this
  study was to describe neurologic outcomes after HSCT in patients with pre-existing
  SCD and cerebrovascular comorbidity. Patients with SCD treated with HSCT at a single
  center between 1996 and 2019 were identified. Patients with cerebral ischemia and/or
  vasculopathy before undergoing HSCT were included. Patients with graft failure were
  excluded. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: symptomatic stroke, vasculopathy
  without symptomatic stroke, and isolated silent cerebral infarction (SCI). Magnetic
  resonance imaging/angiography and neurologic assessments pre- and post-HSCT were
  analyzed to assess outcomes. In a cohort of 44 patients, there were 25 with symptomatic
  infarction, 10 with vasculopathy, and 9 with isolated SCI. Post-HSCT ischemic injury
  (2 symptomatic strokes, 2 SCIs) was identified in 4 patients, all with previous
  symptomatic infarction. Within this group (n = 25), the post-HSCT incidence of subsequent
  symptomatic infarction was 1.6 events/100 patient-years, and SCIs occurred at a
  rate of 2.2 events/100 patient-years. No patient had progression of vasculopathy
  post-HSCT. Our data show a low incidence of new ischemic injury after successful
  HSCT for SCD. Patients with a history of both symptomatic stroke and vasculopathy
  are at greatest risk for post-HSCT ischemic injury.'
