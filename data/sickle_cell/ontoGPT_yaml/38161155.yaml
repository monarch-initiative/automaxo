input_text: Management of Acute Sickle Cell Disease Pain.Pain is a common complication
  of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell pain can often be effectively managed by pediatricians
  in outpatient and hospital settings. Acute pain management should be initiated quickly.
  Patients need to be evaluated for sickle cell complications and other causes of
  pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are the mainstay of pain
  treatment, but additional therapies include hydration, local pain control, muscle
  relaxants, and nonpharmacologic approaches. Healthy lifestyle habits and good behavioral
  and mental health are important for preventing and coping with sickle cell disease
  pain. Disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, can help prevent sickle
  hemoglobin polymerization and acute pain episodes. Because sickle cell disease largely
  affects people who are racialized minorities in the United States, health-care providers
  need to be aware of how their own personal biases may affect care of these patients.
