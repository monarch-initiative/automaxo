input_text: 'A pilot study of a non-invasive oral nitrate stable isotopic method suggests
  that arginine and citrulline supplementation increases whole-body NO production
  in Tanzanian children with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Low bioavailability
  of nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease
  (SCD). We designed a nested pilot study to be conducted within a clinical trial
  testing the effects of a daily ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) fortified
  with arginine (Arg) and citrulline (Citr) vs. non-fortified RUSF in children with
  SCD. The pilot study evaluated 1) the feasibility of a non-invasive stable isotope
  method to measure whole-body NO production and 2) whether Arg+Citr supplementation
  was associated with increased whole-body NO production. SUBJECTS: Twenty-nine children
  (70% male, 9-11years, weight 16.3-31.3 kg) with SCD. METHODS: Sixteen children received
  RUSF+Arg/Citr (Arg, 0.2  g/kg/day; Citr, 0.1  g/kg/day) in combination with daily
  chloroquine (50 mg) and thirteen received the base RUSF in combination with weekly
  chloroquine (150 mg). Plasma amino acids were assessed using ion-exchange elution
  (Biochrom-30, Biochrom, UK) and whole-body NO production was measured using a non-invasive
  stable isotopic method. RESULTS: The RUSF+Arg/Citr intervention increased plasma
  arginine (P = .02) and ornithine (P = .003) and decreased the ratio of asymmetric
  dimethylarginine to arginine (P = .01), compared to the base RUSF. A significant
  increase in whole-body NO production was observed in the RUSF-Arg/Citr group compared
  to baseline (weight-adjusted systemic NO synthesis 3.38 +- 2.29 mumol/kg/hr vs 2.35
  +- 1.13 mumol/kg/hr, P = .04). No significant changes were detected in the base
  RUSF group (weight-adjusted systemic NO synthesis 2.64 +- 1.14 mumol/kg/hr vs 2.53
  +- 1.12 mumol/kg/hr, P = .80). CONCLUSIONS: The non-invasive stable isotopic method
  was acceptable and the results provided supporting evidence that Arg/Citr supplementation
  may increase systemic NO synthesis in children with SCD.'
