input_text: 'Transfusion of packed red blood cells in adults with sickle cell anemia
  treated at an emergency hospital. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze
  the prescription of packed red blood cells performed by emergency physicians for
  adults with sickle cell anemia. METHODS: Transfusions performed in adults with sickle
  cell anemia treated at an emergency service in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo
  Brazil, between January 2018 and January 2022 were evaluated. For data comparison,
  the chi-square2 test was used. The significance level adopted was 5%. RESULTS: A
  total of 114 transfusions were performed. The mean age was 41.8+-16.4 years, and
  pretransfusion hemoglobin was 6.1+-1.23 g/dL. Regarding the indication, the adequacy
  of transfusions performed in symptomatic individuals was significantly higher compared
  to asymptomatic individuals (100% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001). Symptomatic individuals received
  excessive volumes of packed red blood cells less frequently than asymptomatic individuals
  (17.5% vs. 56.9%, p<0.001). The filtered subtype, indicated for sickle cell anemia,
  was prescribed in only a quarter of the patients. However, non-indicated subtypes
  were frequently prescribed. CONCLUSION: This study found low adequacy in the indication
  and calculation of the transfusion volume of packed red blood cells in asymptomatic
  individuals. Few patients received filtered red blood cells, resulting in increased
  risks of transfusion reactions. On the contrary, non-indicated subtypes were prescribed
  in a quarter of transfusions, which resulted in higher costs and delay in receiving
  packed red blood cells.'
