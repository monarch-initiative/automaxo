input_text: "Efficacy and Safety of N-Acetylcysteine for the Management of Chronic
  Pain in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
  efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of chronic pain. METHODS:
  A systematic search was carried out until April 2020 for clinical studies of N-acetylcysteine
  in the management of any persistent or recurrent chronic pain condition for adults
  >= 18 years old. Risk of bias was assessed using the validated risk of bias tools.
  When appropriate, a meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed, with
  a fixed-effect model for sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Nine studies (n = 863) were
  included (five randomized controlled trials [RCTs], two open-label non-comparative
  studies and two comparative studies), that evaluated patients with sickle cell disease
  (3), complex regional pain syndrome (1), pelvic pain/endometriosis (2), rheumatoid
  arthritis (1), diabetic neuropathy (1), and chronic neuropathic pain (1). In the
  pooled analysis of three RCTs, N-acetylcysteine did not reduce pain intensities
  (SMD -0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.33 to 0.75, random-effects), improve
  functional outcomes (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.75) or quality of life (SMD 0.60,
  95% CI: -4.44 to 5.64); however, sensitivity analysis with a fixed effect model
  demonstrated an effect for pain intensities and function. Due to adverse events
  being inconsistently reported, no conclusion could be made regarding safety of N-acetylcysteine
  in chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: While there is some evidence to indicate N-acetylcysteine
  may provide analgesic efficacy for certain pain conditions, there is insufficient
  evidence to provide definitive evidence on NAC in chronic pain management. Larger-size
  RCTs spanning a variety of chronic pain conditions are needed to determine N-acetylcysteine's
  role, if any, in pain medicine."
