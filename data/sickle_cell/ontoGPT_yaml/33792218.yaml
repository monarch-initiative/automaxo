input_text: Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease.Red cell
  transfusion remains a critical component of care for acute and chronic complications
  of sickle cell disease. Randomized clinical trials demonstrated the benefits of
  transfusion therapy for prevention of primary and secondary strokes and postoperative
  acute chest syndrome. Transfusion for splenic sequestration, acute chest syndrome,
  and acute stroke are guided by expert consensus recommendations. Despite overall
  improvements in blood inventory safety, adverse effects of transfusion are prevalent
  among patients with sickle cell disease and include alloimmunization, acute and
  delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and iron overload. Judicious use of red
  cell transfusions, optimization of red cell antigen matching, and the use of erythrocytapheresis
  and iron chelation can minimize adverse effects. Early recognition and management
  of hemolytic transfusion reactions can avert poor clinical outcomes. In this review,
  we discuss transfusion methods, indications, and complications in sickle cell disease
  with an emphasis on alloimmunization.
