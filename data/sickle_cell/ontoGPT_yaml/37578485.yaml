input_text: 'Vaso-occlusive crisis pain intensity, frequency, and duration: which
  best correlates with health-related quality of life in adolescents and adults with
  sickle cell disease?ABSTRACT: In a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from
  a randomized clinical trial, we studied 198 adolescents and adults aged 15+ with
  sickle cell disease. Interest was in assessing the relative strengths of the relationship
  of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) pain domains of intensity, frequency, and duration,
  with health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Variation in psychosocial, physical
  function, and pain expression domains of HRQOL was partially explained by frequency,
  intensity, and duration of VOC pain, separately and together, over and above differences
  in age, sex, genotype, and organ system damage. However, no single domain measure
  accounted for more than an additional partial R2 of 12.5% alone. Vaso-occlusive
  crisis pain frequency explained the most variation, when simultaneously considering
  VOC intensity and duration, except for stiffness, where duration was most predictive.
  Yet VOC pain intensity, and even VOC duration, also contributed to variability in
  HRQOL. We recommend that for most purposes, because all 3 VOC pain domains contribute
  to variability in HRQOL, all 3 domains should be assessed and interventions should
  be targeted to improve all 3 domains to maximize HRQOL outcomes (Clinical Trial
