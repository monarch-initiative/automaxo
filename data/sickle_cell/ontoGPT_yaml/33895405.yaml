input_text: Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Outcomes among Medicaid and Privately
  Insured Patients with Sickle Cell Disease. Compared with privately insured patients,
  recipients of Medicaid have been reported to have worse outcomes in several clinical
  conditions and following various surgical and medical procedures. However, the relationship
  between health insurance status and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
  (alloHCT) outcomes among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not well described.
  We sought to compare alloHCT outcomes between patients with SCD who underwent alloHCT
  while enrolled on Medicaid versus those who underwent alloHCT while covered by private
  health insurance. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study using data reported
  to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. US patients
  enrolled on Medicaid or private insurance who underwent a first alloHCT for SCD
  between 2008 and 2018 were eligible for this study. The primary outcome was event-free
  survival (EFS), defined as time to death or graft failure. Secondary outcomes included
  overall survival (OS), graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and
  chronic GVHD. Univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method for
  EFS and OS. The proportion of patients with graft failure, acute GVHD, and/or chronic
  GVHD was calculated using the cumulative incidence estimator to accommodate competing
  risks (ie, death). Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with EFS,
  OS, graft failure, and acute and chronic GVHD. A total of 399 patients (Medicaid,
  n = 225; private insurance, n = 174) were included in this study. The median duration
  of follow-up was 34 months (range, 1.0 to 134.7 months) for the Medicaid group and
  38.7 months (range, 0.3 to 139.3 months) for the private insurance group. Compared
  with the patients with private insurance, those on Medicaid had a significantly
  lower 3-year EFS (75.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 69.4% to 81%] versus 82.2%
  [95% CI, 76.9% to 87.8%]; P = .0279) and a significantly higher 3-year cumulative
  incidence of graft failure (17.2% [95% CI, 12.5% to 22.5%] versus 10.5% [95% CI,
  6.4% to 15.4%]; P = .0372). There were no significant between-group differences
  in 3-year OS (P = .6337) or in the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (P = .4556)
  or chronic GVHD (P = .6878). Cox regression analysis after adjusting for other significant
  variables showed that the patients enrolled on Medicaid had a lower EFS (hazard
  ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.85; P = .0006) and a higher cumulative incidence
  of graft failure (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.43 to 4.60; P = .0015), with no significant
  between-group differences in OS (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.47 to 2.07; P = .9765), acute
  GVHD (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.49; P = .7905), or cGVHD (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65
  to 1.48; P = .9331). That EFS is worse in patients on Medicaid compared with privately
  insured individuals following alloHCT for SCD provides the rationale for research
  to better understand the mechanisms by which insurance status impacts alloHCT outcomes
  among patients with SCD.
