input_text: Correction of murine sickle cell disease by allogeneic haematopoietic
  cell transplantation with anti-3rd party veto cells.Despite advances in gene therapy
  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) remains the most effective
  way to cure sickle cell disease (SCD). However, there are substantial challenges
  including lack of suitable donors, therapy-related toxicity (TRM) and risk of graft-versus-host
  disease (GvHD). Perhaps the most critical question is when to do a transplant for
  SCD. Safer transplant protocols for HLA-disparate HSCT is needed before transplants
  are widely accepted for SCD. Although risk of GvHD and TRM are less with T-cell-deplete
  HSCT and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), transplant rejection is a challenge.
  We have reported graft rejection of T cell-depleted non-myeloablative HSCT can be
  overcome in wild type fully mis-matched recipient mice, using donor-derived anti-3rd
  party central memory CD8-positive veto cells combined with short-term low-dose rapamycin.
  Here, we report safety and efficacy of this approach in a murine model for SCD.
  Durable donor-derived chimerism was achieved using this strategy with reversal of
  pathological parameters of SCD, including complete conversion to normal donor-derived
  red cells, and correction of splenomegaly and the levels of circulating reticulocytes,
  hematocrit, and hemoglobin.
