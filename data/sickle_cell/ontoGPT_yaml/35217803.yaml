input_text: 'Hemoglobinopathy prevention in primary care: a reflection of underdetection
  and difficulties with accessibility of medical care, a quantitative study.As in
  most Northern European countries, the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in The Netherlands
  is increasing due to migration. Although hemoglobinopathies are severe chronic diseases
  with few treatment options, timely detection of carriers allows at-risk couples
  to make informed reproductive choices such as pre-implantation diagnosis, prenatal
  diagnosis or termination of affected pregnancies. Using a quantitative design, we
  evaluated the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in The Hague region, The Netherlands.
  Patient and carrier registries from hospital, laboratory and general practitioners
  allowed this quantitative analysis. The highest prevalence of hemoglobinopathies
  was seen in immigrant neighborhoods, and a large gap was noted between estimated
  carrier prevalence and the actual registration of carriers in electronic patient
  records. Carrier prevalence was estimated to be 13,704; however, the ELAN database
  contains only 1542 cases with ICPC codes for sickle cell disease or thalassemia.
  Although more research is needed to define the requirements of the healthcare system
  to address this challenge, this study clearly shows the gap between estimated carrier
  prevalence and registration and thereby the pressing need for action.'
