input_text: Quantification of Cellular Densities and Antigenic Properties using Magnetic
  Levitation.The described method was developed based on the principles of magnetic
  levitation, which separates cells and particles based on their density and magnetic
  properties. Density is a cell type identifying property, directly related to its
  metabolic rate, differentiation, and activation status. Magnetic levitation allows
  a one-step approach to successfully separate, image and characterize circulating
  blood cells, and to detect anemia, sickle cell disease, and circulating tumor cells
  based on density and magnetic properties. This approach is also amenable to detecting
  soluble antigens present in a solution by using sets of low- and high-density beads
  coated with capture and detection antibodies, respectively. If the antigen is present
  in solution, it will bridge the two sets of beads, generating a new bead-bead complex,
  which will levitate in between the rows of antibody-coated beads. Increased concentration
  of the target antigen in solution will generate a larger number of bead-bead complexes
  when compared to lower concentrations of antigen, thus allowing for quantitative
  measurements of the target antigen. Magnetic levitation is advantageous to other
  methods due to its decreased sample preparation time and lack of dependance on classical
  readout methods. The image generated is easily captured and analyzed using a standard
  microscope or mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet.
