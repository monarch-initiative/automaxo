input_text: 'Sickle cell disease and COVID-19 in pregnant women.INTRODUCTION: The
  effect of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on pregnancy outcome in women with sickle
  cell disease (SCD) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the severity of the SARS-CoV-2
  infection in pregnant women with SCD and its impact on pregnancy. METHODS: This
  retrospective cohort study included SCD pregnant women tested positive for COVID-19
  between March 2020 - February 2021. The primary endpoint was the severity of the
  COVID-19 infection. Secondary endpoints were pregnancy complications and fetal outcomes.
  RESULTS: During the study period among 82 pregnant women with SCD, 8 have presented
  symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and were tested positive. A common mild clinical
  presentation was observed in 6 women (75%), one woman was asymptomatic and one required
  oxygen. The latter was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and a cesarean section
  was performed in the context of an ongoing vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest
  syndrome together with incidental preeclampsia. Labor was induced in another patient
  who developed a vaso-occlusive crisis after COVID-19 remission. Fetal outcomes were
  good with an average Apgar score of 10 and normal umbilical blood pH at birth. Two
  newborns were small-for-gestational-age as expected on the ultrasound follow-up
  before occurrence of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in our population
  of pregnant women with SCD had typical presentation and rarely triggered a sickle
  cell crisis or other complications. Fetal outcomes were good and did not seem to
  be directly influenced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further studies are required to
  confirm these observations as compared to the population of women with SCD without
  COVID-19 infection.'
