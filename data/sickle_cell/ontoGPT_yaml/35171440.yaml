input_text: The distinct longitudinal impact of pain catastrophizing on pain interference
  among youth living with sickle cell disease and chronic pain.Youth living with chronic
  sickle cell disease (SCD) pain are at risk for psychosocial distress and high levels
  of pain catastrophizing that contribute to functional impairment. This study aimed
  to identify the unique long-term impact of pain catastrophizing on pain impairment
  among youth with SCD. Youth with chronic SCD pain (N = 63, 10-18 years old, 58.3%
  female, 95.1% Black or African American) were recruited within comprehensive SCD
  clinics and completed a battery of measures at baseline and 4-months follow-up.
  A linear hierarchical regression examined baseline demographic and clinical characteristics
  (child SCD genotype, age, and average pain intensity), psychosocial functioning
  (anxiety, depression), and pain catastrophizing as predictors of pain interference
  at 4-months follow-up. Pain catastrophizing was the only unique predictor of pain
  interference at 4-months follow-up. Among youth with chronic SCD pain, pain catastrophizing
  warrants greater consideration as an important predictor that influences pain management
  and overall functioning.
