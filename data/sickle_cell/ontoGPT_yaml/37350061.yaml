input_text: 'Vaccination in sickle cell disease: Immunocompromised or immunocompetent?
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an immunocompromised condition and patients with SCD
  may have a reduced immune response to certain vaccinations. The report by Nakahara
  et al. demonstrated that SCD patients exhibited elevated and more sustained IgG
  production following COVID-19 vaccination, when compared to healthy controls. This
  suggests that the immune response to vaccinations may vary among different types
  of vaccines in individuals with SCD. Commentary on: Nakahara et al. Enhanced IgG
  immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with sickle cell disease. Br
  J Haematol 2023 (Online ahead of print). doi: 10.1111/bjh.18899.'
