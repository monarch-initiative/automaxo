input_text: "Clinical Delivery and Effectiveness of Music Therapy in Hematology and
  Oncology: An EMMPIRE Retrospective Study. BACKGROUND: Music therapy (MT) has been
  shown to improve outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and patients
  with hematologic and/or oncologic conditions excluding SCD (HemOnc) in prior randomized
  trials. While few studies have described the clinical delivery (ie, volume, clinical
  settings, patient characteristics, referrals, and session characteristics) of MT
  and examined its real-world effectiveness, no studies have compared responses between
  hematology/oncology populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical
  delivery and effectiveness of MT at a freestanding academic cancer center and compare
  the effectiveness of MT on pain, anxiety, and fatigue between adult patients in
  the HemOnc and SCD groups. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all
  MT sessions provided at a freestanding academic cancer center between January 2017
  and July 2020. The unadjusted single-session effects of MT on pain, anxiety, and
  fatigue were assessed among patients reporting symptoms >=1 out of 10 on a 0 to
  10 scale. Adjustments were made for multiple sessions on the same patient using
  a mixed model to compare pre-session and change scores between the HemOnc and SCD
  groups. Patients' comments were analyzed using conventional qualitative content
  analysis. RESULTS: Music therapists provided 4002 sessions to 1152 patients including
  1012 in the HemOnc group and 140 in the SCD group. In the combined sample, statistically
  significant reductions in pain (1.48 units), anxiety (2.58 units), and fatigue (0.84
  units) were observed, with changes in pain and anxiety exceeding clinically significant
  thresholds. After adjustment, the SCD group reported significantly greater pre-session
  pain (7.22 vs 5.81) and anxiety (6.11 vs 5.17) as well as greater anxiety reduction
  (2.89 vs 2.23) than the HemOnc group. Patients' comments contained themes including
  enjoyment, gratitude, and improvements in mood, pain, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS:
  This study supports the delivery and clinical effectiveness of MT for addressing
  the needs of patients throughout their course of treatment at an academic cancer
  center and justifies the inclusion of individuals with SCD within integrative oncology
  services."
