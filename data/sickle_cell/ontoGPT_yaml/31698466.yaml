input_text: Genome editing of HBG1 and HBG2 to induce fetal hemoglobin. Induction
  of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
  repeats/Cas9-mediated disruption of DNA regulatory elements that repress gamma-globin
  gene (HBG1 and HBG2) expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for sickle cell
  disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia, although the optimal technical approaches and
  limiting toxicities are not yet fully defined. We disrupted an HBG1/HBG2 gene promoter
  motif that is bound by the transcriptional repressor BCL11A. Electroporation of
  Cas9 single guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex into normal and SCD donor CD34+
  hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells resulted in high frequencies of on-target
  mutations and the induction of HbF to potentially therapeutic levels in erythroid
  progeny generated in vitro and in vivo after transplantation of hematopoietic stem
  and progenitor cells into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency/Il2rgamma-/-/KitW41/W41
  immunodeficient mice. On-target editing did not impair CD34+ cell regeneration or
  differentiation into erythroid, T, B, or myeloid cell lineages at 16 to 17 weeks
  after xenotransplantation. No off-target mutations were detected by targeted sequencing
  of candidate sites identified by circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage
  effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq), an in vitro genome-scale method for detecting
  Cas9 activity. Engineered Cas9 containing 3 nuclear localization sequences edited
  human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells more efficiently and consistently
  than conventional Cas9 with 2 nuclear localization sequences. Our studies provide
  novel and essential preclinical evidence supporting the safety, feasibility, and
  efficacy of a mechanism-based approach to induce HbF for treating hemoglobinopathies.
