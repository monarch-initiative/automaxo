input_text: 'The health literacy disparity in adolescents with sickle cell disease.
  PURPOSE: There are over 100,000 individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the
  United States, most of whom are Black, poor, and publically insured. In combination
  with a chronic illness, these demographics lead to significant barriers to healthcare
  for patients with SCD, leaving them exceptionally vulnerable within the healthcare
  system. This unique vulnerability is especially notable when transitioning adolescents
  with SCD from pediatric to adult care, as this is a significant time of morbidity
  and mortality for these patients. It is postulated that health literacy influences
  transition from pediatric to adult care in adolescents with SCD. To better understand
  this relationship, more adolescent health literacy research must be conducted with
  both adolescents with and without SCD. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
  systematically compare health literacy in adolescents with and without SCD. DESIGN
  AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, exploratory study. One hundred
  and thirty-four adolescents with SCD and 105 adolescents without SCD were recruited
  for this study. The Newest Vital Sign (NVS) health literacy instrument was used
  to evaluate health literacy. Pearson correlations were conducted to evaluate relationships
  among health literacy and the influencing factors of age, grade level, income, and
  parental education level. Differences in NVS scores between groups were assessed
  using independent samples t tests. RESULTS: There was a significant relationship
  between health literacy, age (r = .286, p < .01) and grade level (r = .317, p =
  .00) in adolescents with SCD. In adolescents without SCD, there was a significant
  relationship between health literacy, income (r = .235; p < .05) and parental education
  (r = .263; p < .01). The mean NVS score was 2.66 for adolescents with SCD and 3.77
  for adolescents without SCD. A statistically significant difference in NVS scores
  was found between groups (t = 4.772; p < .001). Adolescents with SCD demonstrated
  significantly lower NVS scores than adolescents without SCD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS:
  There are significant differences in health literacy scores and influencing factors
  in adolescents with and without SCD. Thus, this article provides unique insight
  for nurses as they design, implement and evaluate health promotion, patient education,
  and future research initiatives for adolescents and families, both with and without
  SCD. Further research is needed to gain more insight into this phenomenon.'
