input_text: Decreased parasite burden and altered host response in children with sickle
  cell anemia and severe anemia with malaria. Plasmodium falciparum malaria causes
  morbidity and mortality in African children with sickle cell anemia (SCA), but comparisons
  of host responses to P falciparum between children with SCA (homozygous sickle cell
  disease/hemoglobin SS [HbSS]) and normal hemoglobin genotype/hemoglobin AA (HbAA)
  are limited. We assessed parasite biomass and plasma markers of inflammation and
  endothelial activation in children with HbAA (n = 208) or HbSS (n = 22) who presented
  with severe anemia and P falciparum parasitemia to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda.
  Genotyping was performed at study completion. No child had known SCA at enrollment.
  Children with HbSS did not differ from children with HbAA in peripheral parasite
  density, but had significantly lower sequestered parasite biomass. Children with
  HbSS had greater leukocytosis but significantly lower concentrations of several
  plasma inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).
  In contrast, children with HbSS had threefold greater concentrations of angiopoietin-2
  (Angpt-2), a marker of endothelial dysregulation associated with mortality in severe
  malaria. Lower TNF-alpha concentrations were associated with increased risk of postdischarge
  mortality or readmission, whereas higher Angpt-2 concentrations were associated
  with increased risk of recurrent clinical malaria. Children with SCA have decreased
  parasite sequestration and inflammation but increased endothelial dysregulation
  during severe anemia with P falciparum parasitemia, which may ameliorate acute infectious
  complications but predispose to harmful long-term sequelae.
