input_text: 'Nosocomial infections in sickle cell anemia patients: Prevention through
  multi-disciplinary approach: A review. Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a hereditary blood
  disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, poses a unique set
  of challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. One of the most pressing
  issues in the care of these individuals is the persistent threat of nosocomial infections,
  which are infections acquired during hospitalization. This abstract provides a concise
  overview of the ongoing challenge of nosocomial infections in SCA patients, highlighting
  the factors contributing to their vulnerability and the preventive measures in place.
  SCA patients face increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections due to their
  compromised immune systems, frequent hospitalizations, prolonged stays, and the
  need for invasive medical interventions. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens
  further complicates the management of these infections. To address this challenge,
  healthcare facilities have implemented infection control protocols, vaccination
  strategies, and antimicrobial stewardship, emphasizing the importance of patient
  education. Recognizing the gravity of this issue and adopting comprehensive preventive
  measures is crucial to improving the quality of care and patient outcomes in this
  vulnerable population. Further research and ongoing efforts are essential to reducing
  the burden of nosocomial infections in SCA patients and enhancing their overall
  healthcare experience.'
