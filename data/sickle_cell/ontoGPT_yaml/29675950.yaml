input_text: Risk factors for red blood cell alloimmunization in the Recipient Epidemiology
  and Donor Evaluation Study (REDS-III) database. Despite the significance of red
  blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization, the lack of standardized registries in the US
  has prevented the completion of large studies. Data from 3 5 years of the Recipient
  Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III (REDS-III) recipient database, containing
  information from 12 hospitals, were studied. A RBC alloantibody responder had an
  antibody identified at any point during the study, and a non-responder had a negative
  antibody screen at least 15 days post-RBC transfusion. Demographics, blood type,
  ICD9/10 codes, and other potential correlates were evaluated. Of 319 177 (2 07%)
  screened patients, 6597 had a total of 8892 clinically significant RBC alloantibodies
  identified, with 75% being in the Rh or Kell families. Alloimmunization was more
  common in females (2 38%) than males (1 68%), and in RhD negative (2 82%) than RhD
  positive (1 94%) patients. Age, sex, RhD status and race were associated with being
  a responder, and certain diagnoses (including sickle cell disease or trait, systemic
  lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and myelodysplastic syndrome) were more
  common among responders than non-responders. Data collected in this multi-centre
  recipient database provide the largest RBC alloimmunized patient cohort studied
  in the US, with previously known demographic and disease associations of responder
  status confirmed, and new associations identified.
