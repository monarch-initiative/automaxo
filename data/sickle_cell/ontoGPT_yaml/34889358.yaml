input_text: 'Gene therapy for sickle cell disease: where we are now? The landscape
  of sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment continues to evolve rapidly, with new disease-modifying
  therapies in development and potentially curative options on the horizon. Until
  recently, allogeneic stem cell transplant has been the only proven cure for SCD.
  Gene therapy is rising to the forefront of the discussion as a potentially curative
  or highly disease- modifying option for abating the complications of the disease.
  Understanding the different types of gene therapy in use, the differences in their
  end points, and their potential risks and benefits will be key to optimizing the
  long-term use of this therapy.'
