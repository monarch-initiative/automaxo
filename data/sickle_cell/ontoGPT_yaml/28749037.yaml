input_text: 'Transfusion for sickle cell disease in pregnancy: a single-centre survey.
  INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease in pregnancy carries a high risk of maternal and
  fetal adverse outcomes. The use of prophylactic transfusions to reduce the risk
  of sickle complications is controversial. Current UK standards do not recommend
  the routine use of transfusion for sickle pregnancy. We examined transfusion episodes
  during sickle pregnancies in a single centre over an 11-year period. METHODS: We
  conducted a retrospective observational study of all pregnancies in patients with
  sickle cell disease who attended the joint obstetric/haematology clinic over an
  11-year period. All pregnancies were managed according to a local protocol, which
  did not recommend routine transfusion. RESULTS: A total of 38 pregnancies (HbSS
  22, HbSC 13, Hb S/beta thalassaemia 3) were included, with a mean age at booking
  of 29 years. A total of 61% of pregnancies required on-demand or emergency transfusion
  during the course of pregnancy or post-partum. Women requiring a transfusion during
  pregnancy had a higher mean number of hospital admissions in the previous year (1
  11 vs 0 15, P = 0 057), a significantly lower mean steady-state haemoglobin (85
  0 vs 99 6 g L-1 , P = 0 003) and a significantly lower mean haemoglobin at the pregnancy
  booking visit. (86 1 vs 99 5 g L-1 , P = 0 02). CONCLUSION: In sickle pregnancies
  assigned to standard management in a single centre, a high proportion of women required
  on-demand transfusion. Possible pre-pregnancy factors predictive of a need for transfusion
  include lower baseline haemoglobin and number of hospital admissions in the previous
  12 months.'
