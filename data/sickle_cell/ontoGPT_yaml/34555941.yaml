input_text: Health-Related Stigma, Social Support, Self-Efficacy, and Self-Care Actions
  Among Adults With Sickle Cell Disease in Oman.Stigma contributes to the burden of
  individuals and families affected by Sickle cell disease (SCD) and causes delay
  in appropriate care seeking. The aim of this study is to examine the levels and
  associations between stigma, social support, self-efficacy, and self-care actions
  among adult patients with SCD in Oman using a cross-sectional, correlational design.
  Of the 264 participants, 56.1% (n = 148) were males, with mean age of 30.1 years
  (SD 7.7). Half of the participants were married, and 88.3% had no other associated
  diseases. The results demonstrate that patients in Oman suffer from health-related
  stigma. However, social support, self-efficacy, and self-care actions were reported
  to be high and correlated with several clinical and demographic variables. Based
  on the results, effective, low-cost interventions such as psycho-educational groups,
  individual counseling, or group therapies might be developed. They can promote belief
  in enhanced efficacy and improved SCD adaptation, thereby increasing patient, and
  provider satisfaction.
