input_text: "[What's new in diagnostics and treatment of hemoglobinopathies?] Improvement
  of care for thalassemia during previous decades focussed on the development of new
  diagnostic and treatment modalities concerning secondary hemochromatosis resulting
  from symptomatic treatment with regular transfusion. In addition, hematopoetic stem
  transplantation as the so far only curative approach had been developed and constantly
  improved. New approaches for the treatment of thalassemias already entering clinical
  practice include e. g. additive gene therapy and medical treatment with new drugs
  like luspatercept. For sickle cell disease, a variety of treatment approaches either
  to correct the genetic change by gene therapy, to affect the underlying mechanism
  of sickling e. g. by R-state- stabilising agents, or later the pathophysiology of
  vaso-occlusive complications e. g. by inhibiting selectins are currently thoroughly
  investigated and some of them will probably get approval very soon."
