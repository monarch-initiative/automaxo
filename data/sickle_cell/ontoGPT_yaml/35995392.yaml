input_text: Comparison of Anti-Mullerian Hormone Levels Pre- and Post-Hematopoietic
  Cell Transplantation in Pediatric and Adolescent Females with Sickle Cell Disease.
  Allogeneic hematopoietic cell therapy (HCT) is an established cure for sickle cell
  disease (SCD); however, HCT conditioning regimens are known to be gonadotoxic. Anti-mullerian
  hormone (AMH) measures ovarian reserve, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) defines
  premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) at values >40 mIU/mL in pubertal females.
  The present study was conducted to assess ovarian reserve and function before and
  after transplantation in pediatric and adolescent females with SCD treated with
  allogeneic HCT between January 2015 and June 2020 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.
  In this retrospective review of 17 females age <21 years with SCD who had AMH levels
  measured at baseline and at 2 years post-HCT, AMH levels were categorized as normal,
  low, or undetectable, and FSH levels were measured and used to identify pubertal
  females who had developed POI. Demographic and treatment data were abstracted from
  the institutional database and medical records, and a descriptive statistical analysis
  was conducted. Of the 17 patients in the study cohort, 14 had been treated with
  hydroxyurea and 3 had chronic transfusions but with no significant iron overload.
  AMH levels were normal in 15 patients (88%) and low in 2 patients (12%) at baseline.
  The median age at HCT was 7.5 years (range, 3.7 to 20.3 years), and 14 patients
  (82%) underwent matched related donor HCT. After HCT, 15 patients (88%) had undetectable
  AMH and 2 (12%) had low AMH, with no apparent differences by HCT conditioning regimen.
  No pubertal patients had POI at baseline, whereas 55% of pubertal patients had progressed
  to POI by 2 years post-HCT. In this cohort, the majority of females had normal AMH
  levels at baseline but undetectable levels after HCT. Females with SCD considering
  HCT should be counseled about the treatment-related risk of gonadal dysfunction.   2022
