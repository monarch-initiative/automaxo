input_text: 'New and emerging treatments for vaso-occlusive pain in sickle cell disease.
  Introduction: Acute pain from episodic vaso-occlusion (VOC) spans the lifespan of
  almost everyone with sickle cell disease (SCD), while additional chronic pain develops
  in susceptible individuals in early adolescences. Frequent acute pain with chronic
  pain causes significant physical and psychological morbidity, and frequent health-care
  utilization. Available pharmacologic therapies reduce acute pain frequency but few
  evidence-based therapies are available for chronic pain. Areas covered: An extensive
  PubMed literature search was performed with appropriate search criteria. The pathophysiology
  of acute pain from VOC in SCD is very complex with many events subsequent to sickle
  polymer formation. Sensitization of pain pathways and alterations of brain networks
  contributes to the experience of chronic pain. Numerous therapies targeting putative
  VOC mechanisms are in clinical trials, and show considerable promise. Alternative
  analgesic treatments for acute and chronic pain have been examined in small patient
  cohorts, but formal clinical trials are lacking. Expert opinion: Childhood is likely
  a critical window for prevention of acute and later chronic pain. New multimodal
  analgesic therapies are needed, particularly for chronic pain, and should be examined
  in clinical trials. Given the multifactorial nature of both pain and VOC, simultaneously
  targeting multiple mechanisms may be the optimal approach for effective preventive
  therapies.'
