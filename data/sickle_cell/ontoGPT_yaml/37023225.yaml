input_text: Managing Sickle Cell Disease in Patients for Whom Blood Transfusion Is
  Not an Option. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary blood disorder affecting
  beta hemoglobin. This disorder causes sickle-shaped red blood cells with decreased
  oxygen-carrying capacity resulting in vaso-occlusive crises. These crises are often
  treated with analgesics, antibiotics, IV fluids, supplementary oxygen, and allogeneic
  blood transfusion. This treatment regimen becomes complicated when caring for SCD
  patients for whom blood transfusion is not an option. Blood transfusion may not
  be an option due to the patient's religious, personal, or medical concerns and in
  scenarios where blood is not available for transfusion. Some examples include the
  patient being a Jehovah's Witness, blood-borne pathogens concerns, or prior history
  of multiple alloantibodies and severe transfusion reactions. The number of patients
  in these categories is growing. The patients and their autonomy should be respected
  during treatment. This review focuses on the currently available modalities to best
  manage this subgroup of SCD patients without blood transfusion, including new professional
  guidelines and new therapies to reduce the severity of SCD as approved by the Food
  and Drug Administration since 2017.
