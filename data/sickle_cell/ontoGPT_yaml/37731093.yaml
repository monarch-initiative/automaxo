input_text: 'A Comparison of the effect of patient-specific vs. weight-based protocols
  to treat vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) in the emergency department. BACKGROUND:
  Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) cause debilitating pain and are a common cause of
  emergency department (ED) visits, for people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Strategies
  for achieving optimal pain control vary widely despite evidence-based guidelines.
  We tested existing guidelines and hypothesized a patient-specific protocol (PSP)
  written by their SCD provider, may be more effective than weight-based (WB) dosing
  of parenteral opiate medication, in relieving pain. METHODS: Prospective, randomized
  controlled trial comparing a PSP versus WB protocol for patients presenting with
  VOC to six EDs. Patients were randomized to a PSP or WB protocol prior to an ED
  visit. SCD provider wrote their protocol and placed in the electronic health record
  for future ED visits with a VOC Exclusion criteria included: pre-existing PSP excluding
  parenteral opioid analgesia or out-patient use of buprenorphine or methadone, or
  highly suspected for COVID-19. Pain intensity scores, side effects and safety were
  obtained every 30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-ED bed placement. The primary outcome
  was change in pain intensity score from placement in an ED space to disposition
  or six hours. RESULTS: 328 subjects were randomized, 104 participants enrolled (ED
  visit, target n=230) with complete data for 96 visits. The study was unable to reach
  the target sample size and stopped early due to the impact of COVID-19. We found
  no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome; patients randomized
  to a PSP had a shorter ED length of stay (p=.008); the prevalence of side effects
  was low in both groups. Subjects in both groups experienced both a clinically meaningful
  and statistically significant decrease in pain (27 mm on a 0-100 mm scale) CONCLUSIONS:
  We found a shorter ED length of stay for patients assigned to a PSP. Patients in
  both groups experienced good pain relief without significant side effects.'
