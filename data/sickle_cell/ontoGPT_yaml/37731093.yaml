input_text: 'A Comparison of the effect of patient-specific vs. weight-based protocols
  to treat vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) in the emergency department.BACKGROUND: Vaso-occlusive
  episodes (VOC) cause debilitating pain and are a common cause of emergency department
  (ED) visits, for people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Strategies for achieving
  optimal pain control vary widely despite evidence-based guidelines. We tested existing
  guidelines and hypothesized a patient-specific protocol (PSP) written by their SCD
  provider, may be more effective than weight-based (WB) dosing of parenteral opiate
  medication, in relieving pain. METHODS: Prospective, randomized controlled trial
  comparing a PSP versus WB protocol for patients presenting with VOC to six EDs.
  Patients were randomized to a PSP or WB protocol prior to an ED visit. SCD provider
  wrote their protocol and placed in the electronic health record for future ED visits
  with a VOC Exclusion criteria included: pre-existing PSP excluding parenteral opioid
  analgesia or out-patient use of buprenorphine or methadone, or highly suspected
  for COVID-19. Pain intensity scores, side effects and safety were obtained every
  30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-ED bed placement. The primary outcome was change
  in pain intensity score from placement in an ED space to disposition or six hours.
  RESULTS: 328 subjects were randomized, 104 participants enrolled (ED visit, target
  n=230) with complete data for 96 visits. The study was unable to reach the target
  sample size and stopped early due to the impact of COVID-19. We found no significant
  differences between groups in the primary outcome; patients randomized to a PSP
  had a shorter ED length of stay (p=.008); the prevalence of side effects was low
  in both groups. Subjects in both groups experienced both a clinically meaningful
  and statistically significant decrease in pain (27 mm on a 0-100 mm scale) CONCLUSIONS:
  We found a shorter ED length of stay for patients assigned to a PSP. Patients in
  both groups experienced good pain relief without significant side effects.'
