input_text: 'Curative vs targeted therapy for SCD: does it make more sense to address
  the root cause than target downstream events? Sickle cell disease (SCD) places a
  heavy burden on a global and increasing population predominantly resident in resource-poor
  and developing countries. Progress continues to be made in preventing childhood
  mortality, and increasing numbers of chronically ill adults with disease are requiring
  care for disease sequelae. Curative therapies for SCD are therefore attractive to
  physicians and investigators focused on SCD. Gene therapies are being developed,
  and several are now in various stages of early-phase human clinical trials. However,
  we must also pursue avenues through which we can do the most good for the most people
  alive today. Such efforts include improving our understanding of disease mechanisms
  and which disease sequelae most strongly affect survival and interfere with quality
  of life. The pathways leading to disease sequelae are multiple, complex, and highly
  interactive. Four drugs have now been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
  for SCD; however, each has a distinct mechanism and a measurable but limited effect
  on the many clinical sequelae of SCD. We therefore need to learn how to approach
  multi-agent therapy for SCD. The order of addition of each agent to treat a specific
  patient will need to be guided by response to previous therapy, risk factors identified
  for specific disease outcomes, and clinical studies to determine more comprehensively
  how the 4 currently approved drugs might interact and produce (or not) additive
  effects. Moreover, this will have to be accomplished with defined end points in
  mind, according to which pose the greatest threats to quality of life as well as
  survival.'
