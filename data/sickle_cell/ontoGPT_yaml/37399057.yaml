input_text: 'Sickle cell disease and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection:
  a single-center experience. PURPOSE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) has been found to
  be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death from coronavirus
  disease-2019 (COVID-19). We sought to study clinical outcomes in patients with SCD
  and a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis
  of adult patients (>18 years) with SCD who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection
  between 1 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. Data on baseline characteristics and overall
  outcomes were collected and analyzed using SAS 9.4 for Windows. RESULTS: A total
  of 51 patients with SCD were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the study period,
  out of which 39.3% were diagnosed and managed in the outpatient setting/emergency
  room (ER) and 60.3% in the inpatient setting. Disease-modifying therapy such as
  hydroxyurea did not impact inpatient vs outpatient/ER management (P > 0.05). Only
  5.71% (n = 2) required intensive care unit admission and were mechanically ventilated
  and 3.9% (2 patients) died of complications of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: We
  identified a lower mortality (3.9%) rate among patients in our cohort in comparison
  to previous studies and a higher burden of inpatient hospitalizations as compared
  to outpatient/ER management. Further prospective data are needed to validate these
  findings. Key messages What is already known on this topic COVID-19 has been shown
  to have a disproportionately unfavorable impact on African Americans, including
  longer hospital stays, higher rates of ventilator dependence, and a higher overall
  mortality rate. Limited data also suggest that sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated
  with an increased risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. What this study
  adds Our analysis did not show a higher mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with
  SCD. However, we identified a high burden of inpatient hospitalizations in this
  population. COVID-19-related outcomes did not improve with the use of disease-modifying
  therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy These results
  will aid in decision making for triage of patients with COVID-19 and SCD and ensure
  the most appropriate use of healthcare resources. Our analysis underscores the need
  for more robust data to identify patients at higher risk of severe disease and/or
  mortality, necessitating inpatient hospitalization and aggressive management.'
