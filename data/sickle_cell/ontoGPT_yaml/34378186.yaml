input_text: Alpha haemoglobin-stabilising protein concentration in the red blood cells
  of patients with sickle cell anaemia with and without hydroxycarbamide treatment.Alpha
  haemoglobin-stabilising protein (AHSP) is a key chaperone synthesised in red blood
  cell (RBC) precursors. Many studies have reported AHSP as a potential biomarker
  of various diseases. AHSP gene expression has been studied in detail, but little
  is known about AHSP protein levels in RBCs. We investigated the AHSP concentration
  of RBC lysates from control subjects (n = 10) and patients with sickle cell anaemia
  (SCA) with (n = 10) and without (n = 12) hydroxycarbamide (HC) treatment, to evaluate
  the clinical relevance of AHSP in SCA. We developed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay method, with which we were able, for the first time, to determine the mean
  AHSP concentration in control RBC lysates (0 82 microg/ml). The AHSP concentration
  (2 23 microg/ml) was significantly higher in untreated patients with the SS genotype
  than in controls. The AHSP concentration decreased significantly on HC treatment
  (1 50 microg/ml) but remained significantly higher than that in controls. A strong
  positive correlation was observed between the AHSP concentration and the alpha-haemoglobin
  pool with the three groups of subjects pooled into a single group. Our present findings
  indicate that AHSP concentration can be considered a candidate biomarker for monitoring
  HC responses in patients with SCA and suggest a role for AHSP in various RBC diseases.
