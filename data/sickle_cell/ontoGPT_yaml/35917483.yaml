input_text: 'Meteorological parameters and hospitalizations of patients with sickle
  cell anemia: a 20-year retrospective study in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. To investigate
  the influence of climate on hospitalizations of sickle cell anemia (SCA) adults
  and children, we analyzed the health and meteorological parameters from a metropolis
  (1999-2018). 1462 hospitalizations were coded for SCA patients in crisis (M:F =
  715:747) and 1354 hospitalizations for SCA patients without crisis (M:F = 698:656)
  [age = 22.9 vs 15.2 years and duration of hospitalization (DoH) = 5.7 vs 4.4 days,
  respectively,]. More hospitalizations were for adults than children in crisis, and
  for children than adults without crisis. More children and adults were hospitalized
  in winter andspring than in summer and autumn     Hospitalizations correlated positively
  with humidity (lag -5), maximum pressure (lag -2), mean pressure (lag -2), and thermal
  amplitude (lag -2), and negatively with maximum temperature (lag -3). DoH positively
  correlated with minimum temperature (lag -4). Understanding these complex associations
  would induce attitudinal/behavioral modifications among patients and their caregivers.'

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
