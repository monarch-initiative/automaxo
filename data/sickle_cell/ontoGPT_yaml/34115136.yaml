input_text: "Leukemia after gene therapy for sickle cell disease: insertional mutagenesis,
  busulfan, both, or neither.Recently, encouraging data provided long-awaited hope
  for gene therapy as a cure for sickle cell disease (SCD). Nevertheless, the transient
  suspension of the bluebird bio gene therapy trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02140554)
  after participants developed acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS)
  raised concerns. Potential possibilities for these cases include busulfan, insertional
  mutagenesis, both, or neither. Busulfan was considered the cause in the first reported
  case because the transgene was not present in the AML/MDS. However, busulfan is
  unlikely to have contributed to the most recent case. The transgene was present
  in the patient's malignant cells, indicating they were infused after busulfan treatment.
  Several lines of evidence suggest an alternative explanation for events in the bluebird
  bio trial, including that SCD population studies show an increased relative, but
  a low absolute, risk of AML/MDS. We propose a new hypothesis: after gene therapy
  for SCD, the stress of switching from homeostatic to regenerative hematopoiesis
  by transplanted cells drives clonal expansion and leukemogenic transformation of
  preexisting premalignant clones, eventually resulting in AML/MDS. Evidence validating
  our hypothesis will support prescreening individuals with SCD for preleukemic progenitors
  before gene therapy. While presumed viable, safe strategy has been implemented to
  resume gene therapy in adults with severe SCD, reasonable alternative curative therapy
  should be considered for children and adults with severe SCD. Currently, open multicenter
  clinical trials are incorporating nonmyeloablative conditioning, related haploidentical
  donors, and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide. Preliminary results from these
  trials appear promising, and National Institutes of Health-sponsored trials are
  ongoing in individuals with SCD using this platform."
