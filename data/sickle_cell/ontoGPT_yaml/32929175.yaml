input_text: 'Pre-transplant myeloid and immune suppression, upfront plerixafor mobilization
  and post-transplant cyclophosphamide: novel strategy for haploidentical transplant
  in sickle cell disease. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only
  curative option for symptomatic sickle cell disease (SCD). HLA haploidentical related
  donor transplants are associated with high graft failure rates. We conceptualized
  a novel protocol (APOLLO protocol) using pre-transplant immune and myelosuppression
  (PTIS) using fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone followed by augmented
  John Hopkins protocol by adding thiotepa to conditioning. Twenty-five consecutive
  patients suffering from symptomatic SCD were enrolled into the study. We added upfront
  plerixafor to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) for mobilization of healthy
  donors. Graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was done using post-transplant
  cyclophosphamide, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Graft failure was not seen
  in any of our patients. Five patients developed acute grade II/IV GvHD (4 classical
  acute, 1 late onset), 3 had limited chronic GvHD. Out of 25 evaluable patients,
  22 are alive and disease free, making an overall survival (OS) and disease-free
  survival (DFS) of 88% with a median follow up of 485 days (range 198-802). T-cell-replete
  haploidentical transplant with PTIS, augmented John Hopkins conditioning and plerixafor
  based mobilization is a safe and effective way of treating patients suffering from
  SCD with minimal or no risk of graft failure and acceptable GvHD rates.'
