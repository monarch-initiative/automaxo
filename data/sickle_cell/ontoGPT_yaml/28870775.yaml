input_text: Ethical Challenges in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Sickle Cell
  Disease. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using an HLA-identical sibling
  donor offers a very high likelihood of cure with good outcomes for patients with
  sickle cell disease (SCD), and alternative donor HCT for SCD is an area of active
  clinical research. Thus, HCT is a potential option for a growing number of patients
  with SCD. This expanded use of HCT has raised several ethical questions. Who is
  eligible for HCT, in terms of both disease severity and psychosocial factors? Should
  affected children with matched sibling donors undergo HCT only when they have declared
  themselves as having significant symptomatology? Regarding donors, special ethical
  challenges include the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to conceive an HLA-identical
  sibling. In this review, we critically analyze various ethical challenges related
  to HCT for SCD, and offer recommendations to guide clinical care.
