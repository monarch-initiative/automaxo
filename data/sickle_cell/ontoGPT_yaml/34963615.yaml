input_text: 'Combined preoperative plasma exchange and red blood cell exchange transfusion
  in a renal transplant patient with protein S deficiency and hemoglobin SC disease.BACKGROUND:
  Protein S deficiency is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism,
  complicating the perioperative management of such patients. We present a patient
  with sickle cell disease (Hb SC genotype) and inherited protein S deficiency who
  underwent a living-donor renal transplant. To minimize thrombotic risk and sickle
  cell complications, both plasma exchange and red blood cell (RBC) exchange transfusion
  were performed pre-operatively. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plasma exchange was utilized
  to increase protein S levels and to reduce the risk of post-operative venous thromboembolism,
  including allograft thrombosis, while RBC exchange was performed to reduce the risk
  of acute post-operative sickle cell disease complications. RESULTS: With the use
  of combined pre-operative plasma exchange and RBC exchange transfusion, this patient
  with protein S deficiency and Hb SC underwent a successful renal transplant without
  acute sickle cell complications or thrombotic complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case
  demonstrates the potential use of pre-operative plasma exchange in patients with
  protein S deficiency undergoing high thrombotic risk procedures.'
