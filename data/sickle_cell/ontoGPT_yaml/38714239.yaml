input_text: "Evaluation of Anti-Sickling Effects of Two Varieties of Cajanus cajan
  (L.) Huth on Sickle Cell Beta Thalassemia. ETHNO-PHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Globally,
  the prevalence of sickle cell disease is on the rise, with developing countries
  experiencing particularly alarming mortality rate compared to developed nations.
  The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) have acknowledged sickle
  cell disease as a significant global public health concern. Unfortunately, a cure
  for this condition is yet to be discovered, and existing allopathic treatments,
  while offering relief, come with serious side effects. In recent times, there has
  been a growing interest in exploring the potential of medicinal plants for treating
  sickle cell disease due to their content of secondary metabolites that may impact
  the disease's mechanisms. Cajanus cajan, a crucial grain legume in rain-fed agriculture
  in semi-arid tropics, has been traditionally used in folk medicine to manage various
  illnesses and is suggested to possess anti-sickling properties. AIM OF THE STUDY:
  The present study investigated two varieties of C. cajan for their effectiveness
  in treating sickle cell beta thalassemia, a variant of sickle cell disease. MATERIALS
  AND METHODS: The study was divided into four groups consisting of the untreated
  group (group 1), group treated with standard drug (group 2), group treated with
  white C. cajan (group 3) and group treated with brown C. cajan (group 4). The effects
  of the two variety of C. cajan were measured by polymerization test, reversibility
  test, osmotic fragility test, deoxygenation and beta globin synthesis test. RESULT:
  The results revealed that both varieties of C. cajan demonstrated a reduction in
  polymerization rates, reversed sickled red blood cells, increased the oxygen affinity
  of Hb-S/beta, elevated the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio, and maintained the membrane stability
  of red blood cells. Notably, the white variety exhibited superior anti-sickling
  properties compared to the brown variety. CONCLUSION: This suggests that this significant
  leguminous crop could be utilized for the treatment and management of sickling disorders,
  particularly in low-income countries where conventional treatments may be financially
  inaccessible to patients."
