input_text: A novel deep learning approach for sickle cell anemia detection in human
  RBCs using an improved wrapper-based feature selection technique in microscopic
  blood smear images.Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a disorder in Red Blood Cells (RBCs)
  of human blood. Children under five years and pregnant women are mostly affected
  by SCA. Early diagnosis of this ailment can save lives. In recent years, the computer
  aided diagnosis of SCA is preferred to resolve this issue. A novel and effective
  deep learning approach for identification of sickle cell anemia is proposed in this
  work. Around nine hundred microscopic images of human red blood cells are obtained
  from the public database 'erythrocytes IDB'. All the images are resized uniformly.
  About 2048 deep features are extracted from the fully connected layer of pre-trained
  model InceptionV3. These features are further subjected to classification using
  optimization-based methods. An improved wrapper-based feature selection technique
  is implemented using Multi- Objective Binary Grey Wolf Optimization (MO-BGWO) approach
  with KNN and SVM for classification. The detection of sickle cell is also performed
  using typical InceptionV3 model by using SoftMax layer. It is observed that the
  performance of the proposed system seems to be high when compared to the classification
  using the original InceptionV3 model. The results are validated by various evaluation
  metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score. The
  SVM classifier yields high accuracy of about 96%. The optimal subset of deep features
  along with SVM enhances the system performance in the proposed work. Thus, the proposed
  approach is appropriate for pathologists to take early clinical decisions on detection
  of sickle cells.
