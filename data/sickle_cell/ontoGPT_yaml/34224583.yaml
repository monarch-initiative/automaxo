input_text: 'Real-Life experience with hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell disease:
  Results from the prospective ESCORT-HU cohort study.Several controlled studies have
  evidenced good efficacy and short-term and mid-term safety profiles for hydroxyurea
  (HU), which has become the cornerstone for prevention of sickle-cell disease (SCD)-related
  vaso-occlusive crises. However, there are few large-scale reports on its long-term
  use and certain caregivers and patients have concerns about its safety. Following
  the licensing of HU in Europe for children and adults with severe forms of SCD,
  ESCORT-HU was designed as a Phase IV observational cohort study. It included 1906
  participants, of whom 55% were adults. The most common hemoglobin (Hb) genotypes
  were HbSS (84.7%) and HbSbeta+ (7.0%). The median duration of follow-up was 45 months,
  for a total of 7309 patient-years of observation. The dose of HU after 1 year was
  20.6 mg/kg/d for children and 16.3 mg/kg/d for adults. There was a statistically
  significant decrease in the number of vaso-occlusive episodes lasting >48 h, acute
  chest syndrome episodes, hospitalizations, and the percentage of patients requiring
  blood transfusions within the first 12 months relative to the year before enrolment.
  Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the most commonly reported adverse effects.
  No new HU toxicity was identified. Overall, 125 pregnancies were reported in 101
  women and no malformations were observed in the neonates. There were 12 pregnancies
  for partners of male patients treated with HU. One case of fatal myelodysplastic
  syndrome was reported, for which a causal association with HU could not be excluded.
  This cohort study of patients with SCD highlights the positive benefit-to-risk ratio
  of HU in children and adults.'
