input_text: "A rapid evidence assessment of sickle cell disease educational interventions.
  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of educational interventions on the knowledge
  and attitude of healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding sickle cell disease (SCD)
  pain management in the UK. BACKGROUND: Variations and inadequate pain management
  due toHCPs' lack of knowledge and negative attitude is still an ongoing global concern
  for SCD patients despite availability of effective treatment and evidence-based
  guidelines. Several international studies have implemented interventions aimed at
  improving knowledge, attitude, and pain management. No review on the effectiveness
  of these interventions was found. Also, no previous intervention done in the UK
  was found from the thorough search of research databases. However, there are estimated
  240,000 genetic carriers with about 12,500-15,000 estimated people living with SCD
  in the UK. DESIGN: Rapid Evidence Assessment of existing evidence. METHODS: A rapid
  evidence assessment was conducted between March 2021-January 2022 following the
  PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Included papers must have an educational intervention about
  SCD or related symptom management where the learners were HCPs. Excluded papers
  were those not published in English or before 2010. The following databases were
  searched: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed America and Europe, Scopus, PsycINFO and Web of
  Science. Data quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT)
  and analysed using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the
  final review. Overall, they reported improved outcomes in six main themes: knowledge,
  attitude, perception, adoption, satisfaction and efficiency. Five studies reported
  statistically significant improvement in at least one outcome, four studies reported
  positive improvement, and two studies reported no significant improvement in knowledge
  and attitude. These heterogeneous studies were implemented once, and all designs
  were prone to bias; this makes it difficult to state how effective interventions
  are for SCD. CONCLUSION: Current evidence of positive improvement in HCPs' knowledge
  and attitude is insufficient for generalisation and recommendation for adoption.
  However, we believe that implementing validated educational interventions remains
  essential for effective acute SCD pain management and patient-centred care. Further
  research is needed to find a suitable educational intervention that can be replicated.
  RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Quality SCD education, timely crisis management
  and reduced patient stigma are crucial in reducing the risk of rapid clinical decompensation
  to avoid developing life-threatening complications. Understanding SCD can also support
  the building of therapeutic relationships between the patient and practitioner.
