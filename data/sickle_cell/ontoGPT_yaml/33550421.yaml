input_text: 'Tolerance and humoral immune response to the yellow fever vaccine in
  sickle cell disease children treated with hydroxyurea: a multicentre prospective
  study. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) children are frequent travellers to
  countries where yellow fever (YF) is endemic, but there are no data regarding the
  safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in such children treated with hydroxyurea
  (HU). The main objective of this study was to compare the tolerance and immune response
  to YF vaccination in SCD children treated or not with HU. METHOD: SCD children <
  18 years attending the international travel clinics of three large paediatric centres
  and requiring a first YF vaccination were included in a prospective study. Adverse
  events were collected 2 weeks after vaccination. YF vaccine antibody titres were
  measured ~6 months after vaccination. RESULTS: Among the 52 SCD children vaccinated
  against YF, 17 (33%) were treated with HU. Only mild adverse events, mainly fever
  and local reaction, were observed in the HU group with a similar frequency in the
  non-HU group (57 and 35%, respectively, P = 0.30). YF antibody titres were measured
  in 15/17 patients in the HU group and 23/35 patients in the non-HU group after a
  median of 6.0 months (3.5-8.5) following vaccination. The geometric mean of YF antibody
  titre was similar in both groups. A protective antibody level was observed in 85%
  of the children in the HU group vs 100% in the non-HU group (P = 0.14), suggesting
  a lower effectiveness of the vaccine in patients on HU similarly to what has been
  described in patients on immune suppressive therapy for other vaccines. CONCLUSION:
  YF vaccination seems to be safe and efficient in SCD children treated with HU. Considering
  the potential risk of severe complications in cases of YF while travelling in Africa
  for those patients, the benefit-to-risk ratio argues for YF vaccination in all SCD
  children. Control of a protective antibody titre may also be useful to ascertain
  an adequate response in those treated with HU.'
