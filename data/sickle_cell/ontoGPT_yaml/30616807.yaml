input_text: Targeting HbS Polymerization. The mutation of beta6 from glu to val in
  hemoglobin is responsible for the polymer formation that leads to vaso-occlusion,
  and a range of severe consequences in sickle cell disease. The treatment of the
  disease can be addressed in many ways, but the prevention of polymer formation is
  one of the most fundamental approaches one can take. Such prevention includes affecting
  the polymer structure, or dilution of the fraction of polymerizable hemoglobin.
  The latter approach includes (1) induction of HbF, which does not itself, nor in
  hybrid form, join sickle polymers, or (2) restricting the allosteric change in hemoglobin
  that occurs in oxygen delivery, and which is required for polymer formation. These
  approaches will be critically reviewed, as well as the most recent developments
  that show the benefits of simply swelling the volume of the red cell.
