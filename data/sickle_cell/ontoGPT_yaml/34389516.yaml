input_text: 'Transition Navigator Intervention Improves Transition Readiness to Adult
  Care for Youth With Sickle Cell Disease. OBJECTIVE: Adolescents and young adults
  (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience high rates of acute care utilization
  and increased morbidity. At this high-risk time, they also face the need to transition
  from pediatric to adult services, which, if poorly coordinated, adds to heightened
  morbidity and acute care utilization. The study objective was to characterize the
  feasibility, acceptability, and short-term efficacy of a protocolized transition
  navigator (TN) intervention in AYA with SCD. METHODS: We developed a protocolized
  TN intervention that used ecological assessment and motivational interviewing to
  assess transition readiness, identify goals, and remove barriers to transition,
  and to provide disease and pain management education and skills to AYAs with SCD.
  RESULTS: Ninety-three percent (56/60) of enrolled individuals completed the intervention.
  Participation in the TN program was associated with significant improvement in mean
  transition readiness scores (3.58-4.15, P < .0001), disease knowledge scale (8.91-10.13,
  P < .0001), Adolescent Medication Barriers Scale (40.05-35.39, P = .003) and confidence
  in both disease (22.5-23.96, P = .048) and pain management (25.07-26.61, P = .003)
  for youth with SCD. CONCLUSION: The TN intervention was acceptable to youth with
  SCD, feasible to implement at an urban academic medical center, and addressed barriers
  to transition identified by the youth. Longer-term assessment is needed to determine
  if the TN intervention improved successful transfer to and retention in adult care.'
