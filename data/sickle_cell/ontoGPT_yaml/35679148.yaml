input_text: "Safety and Acceptance of Acupuncture and Acupressure in Children, Adolescents,
  and Young Adults Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant. BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic
  stem cell transplant (HSCT) is associated with significant morbidity and high symptom
  burden including mucositis pain, nausea, and vomiting. There is little documentation
  in the literature regarding acupuncture or acupressure for children undergoing HSCT.
  OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and acceptance
  of acupuncture and acupressure in children undergoing HSCT in a large tertiary care
  children's hospital. METHODS: This is a descriptive retrospective study that evaluated
  80 admissions to the HSCT unit over a 24-month period. Every child admitted for
  HSCT was offered acupuncture or acupressure as part of their care. RESULTS: Of 80
  patients, 46 were male patients (ages range, 0-32 years; mean, 8 years). Diagnoses
  include leukemia/lymphoma, sickle cell disease, aplastic anemia, neuroblastoma,
  and other metabolic, other solid tumor, or other hematologic disorders. Both allogenic
  and autologous were represented. Sixty-six patients (82.5%) agreed to treatment
  with acupuncture, acupressure, or both. There were no adverse effects or safety
  concerns noted. Symptoms addressed by acupuncture or acupressure included pain from
  mucositis, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, anxiety, insomnia, and general wellness
  or healing. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that acupuncture and acupressure
  are well accepted by children and their families admitted for HSCT and are safe
  even when performed in the first 4 weeks following transplant when the patient is
  likely to have thrombocytopenia. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings suggest
  that there may be more therapies for patients undergoing HSCT to help with symptom
  control."
