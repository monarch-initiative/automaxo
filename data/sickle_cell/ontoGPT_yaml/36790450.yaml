input_text: "A Qualitative Systematic Review of Pediatric Patient and Caregiver Perspectives
  on Pain Management for Vaso-Occlusive Episodes in the Emergency Department. OBJECTIVES:
  The primary objective of this study is to describe the experiences of pediatric
  patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers who have presented
  to the emergency department (ED) for management of vaso-occlusive pain events. METHODS:
  We conducted a qualitative systematic review. The search protocol was developed
  to identify both published and unpublished literature that met inclusion/exclusion
  criteria. Included articles were primary hospital-based research with study populations
  that included (but were not limited to) pediatric patients aged 21 years or younger
  and qualitative or mixed-method analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified:
  (1) patients and caregivers perceive the ED as the last resort; (2) health care
  professionals in the ED lacked knowledge about SCD but rejected patients' and caregiver's
  attempts to share experience or advocate for their needs; (3) patients' accounts
  of pain are doubted because they do not always have \"typical\" signs of pain; and
  (4) caregivers identify racism as a reason for suboptimal care in the ED. CONCLUSIONS:
  There are multiple opportunities to improve management for vaso-occlusive pain events
  in the ED, including education of health care providers about SCD and complications,
  partnership between patients/caregivers and providers, and efforts to reduce the
  impact of systemic racism on health care delivery."
