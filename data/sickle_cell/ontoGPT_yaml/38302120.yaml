input_text: Comprehensive Care in Sickle Cell Disease.Despite advancements in sickle
  cell disease (SCD) management, individuals with SCD continue to face greater degrees
  of mortality, disability, and health care barriers compared with their healthy peers.
  Comprehensive care includes essential elements such as newborn screening, key immunizations,
  penicillin prophylaxis, and consistent health screening for common complications.
  Pediatricians should be familiar with treatment options for SCD to offer informed
  education to both patients and their families. By providing guided and comprehensive
  care, pediatricians have the potential to enhance both the quantity and quality
  of life for individuals living with SCD. [Pediatr Ann. 2024;53(2):e43-e46.].
