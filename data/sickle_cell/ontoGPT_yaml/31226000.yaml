input_text: "Inhaled corticosteroids prescriptions increased in the ED for recurrent
  asthma exacerbations by automated electronic reminders in the ED. Objective: The
  objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an electronic alert on the
  prescription rate of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) by ED providers for poorly controlled
  persistent asthmatic children.Methods: Study subjects included asthmatic patients
  age 4-18 presenting to the ED at Phenix Children's Hospital between February 9,
  2018 and December 4, 2018, with a history of at least two previous ED visits for
  acute exacerbation of asthma within 365 days, no active ICS prescription within
  90 days, and free from developmental delay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to prematurity,
  cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and/or interstitial ling disease. Patients
  meeting these criteria triggered an electronic alert prompting the medical provider
  to prescribe ICS or indicate reason for not prescribing. Instruction on the alert
  was provided to ED attending physicians and residents by email and through several
  educational sessions held prior to the implementation.Results: Among 62 patients
  without prior ICS who were discharged home from the ED, ICS was prescribed for 48
  (77%). No statistically significant differences were detected in baseline characteristics
  between patients discharged home from the ED with and without ICS prescription.
  While ICS was prescribed by a larger proportion of physicians (56%) compared to
  residents (42%), statistical significance was not reached. For the 14 (33%) patients
  who were discharged home without ICS, no reason was provided to indicate why ICS
  were not prescribed.Conclusion: An electronic alert incorporated into the ED workflow
  to populate a discharge order set is effective to initiate asthma controller medication
  for poorly controlled pediatric patients. Additional data describing reasons for
  not prescribing ICS can further refine recommendations for ICS prescriptions, and
  provide a comprehensive strategy to support clinical decision for pediatric asthma
  control in acute care settings."
