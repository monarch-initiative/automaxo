input_text: 'The pharmacokinetic and safety profile of single-dose deferiprone in
  subjects with sickle cell disease. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who undergo
  repeated blood transfusions often develop iron overload. Deferiprone (Ferriprox
  ) is an oral iron chelator indicated for the treatment of transfusional iron overload
  due to thalassemia syndromes and has been recently approved as a treatment for iron
  overload in adult and pediatric patients with SCD and other anemias. The present
  study aims to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of deferiprone (DFP)
  in adult subjects with SCD. In this phase I, open-label study, subjects with SCD
  were administered a single 1500 mg dose of DFP. Blood and urine samples were collected
  for PK assessments of DFP and its main metabolite, deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide (DFP-G).
  Eight subjects were enrolled and completed the study. Following drug administration,
  serum levels of DFP and DFP-G rose to maximum concentrations at 1.0 and 2.8 h post-dose,
  respectively. The half-lives of DFP and DFP-G were 1.5 and 1.6 h, respectively.
  The majority of administered drug was metabolized and excreted as DFP-G, with less
  than 4% excreted unchanged in urine up to 10 h post-dose. Subjects received a safety
  assessment 7 (+- 3) days post-dose. Two subjects reported mild adverse events unrelated
  to the study drug, and no other safety concerns were reported. The PK profile of
  DFP in SCD subjects is consistent with previous reports in healthy adult volunteers,
  suggesting no special dosing adjustments are indicated for this population. These
  findings provide valuable insight for treating iron overload in patients with SCD,
  who have limited chelation therapy treatment options (trial registration number:
  NCT01835496, date of registration: April 19, 2013).'
