input_text: 'Haploidentical stem cell transplantation for patients with sickle cell
  disease: current status.For patients with high-risk sickle cell disease (SCD) without
  any available matched sibling or unrelated donor, haploidentical stem cell transplantation
  (haploHCT) expands the availability of this life-saving intervention to nearly all
  patients who may benefit from HCT. The greatest challenge in haploHCT has been the
  significant risk of graft failure. Developing a treatment modality which sustains
  engraftment without increasing the incidence of debilitating graft-versus-host disease
  (GvHD) remains the ultimate goal. A number of modifications have been explored to
  overcome the high incidence of graft rejection and severe GvHD including: (1) ex-vivo
  T-cell depletion (via CD34+ selection, CD3+/CD19+, or TCRalphabeta+/CD19+ depletion),
  and (2) in vivo T-cell depletion using unmanipulated grafts followed by post-transplant
  cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for GvHD prophylaxis. Furthermore, the presence of donor-specific
  anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) has been associated with an increased risk of both graft
  failure and poor graft function. Several approaches for desensitization ameliorate
  this risk when a suitable donor without DSA is not available. In addition to advances
  in supportive care, the recent demonstration that stable mixed chimerism post-HCT
  sufficiently sustains symptom-free status has opened the door for less toxic treatment
  approaches yielding excellent survival outcomes. Though late effects remain uncertain,
  the goal of finding the least toxic conditioning regimen while providing the highest
  rate of donor engraftment draws closer within reach. In this review, the authors
  aim to present the latest findings, challenges, and treatment modalities of this
  life-saving modality.'
