input_text: "Optimal predelivery hemoglobin to reduce transfusion and adverse perinatal
  outcomes.BACKGROUND: Maternal anemia has been associated with poor obstetrical outcomes;
  however, the optimal hemoglobin level for reducing blood transfusion at delivery
  has not been well-defined. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the association
  of maternal anemia immediately before delivery with peripartum transfusion and other
  adverse perinatal outcomes. We also sought to identify the optimal hemoglobin level
  for predicting transfusion. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study
  of patients who had hemoglobin or hematocrit collected before delivery of live,
  nonanomalous neonates at >=23 weeks' gestation at a single center (2013-2018). Patients
  were excluded if they had sickle cell disease or were receiving anticoagulation.
  Patients were categorized as having anemia or no anemia on the basis of predelivery
  hemoglobin or hematocrit levels using criteria set by the American College of Obstetricians
  and Gynecologists. The primary outcome was transfusion of >=1 unit of packed red
  blood cells during the delivery admission. Secondary outcomes included select adverse
  perinatal outcomes. Bivariable analyses compared baseline characteristics and outcomes
  between the anemia and no-anemia groups. Multivariable logistic regression estimated
  the association between anemia and outcomes. The hemoglobin cutoff optimizing sensitivity
  and specificity for transfusion was identified by the Liu method. RESULTS: Of the
  18,357 patients included in the analysis, 5444 (30%) had predelivery anemia (mean
  hemoglobin, 10.0+-0.8 g/dL) vs 12,913 (70%) who did not (mean hemoglobin, 12.3+-1.1
  g/dL). Patients with anemia were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black and publicly
  insured and less likely to be nulliparous. Anemia was associated with 5-fold higher
  odds of packed red blood cell transfusion (6.0% vs 1.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 5.23
  [95% confidence interval, 4.09-6.69]) compared with no anemia. For each 1 g/dL increase
  in predelivery hemoglobin, the odds of transfusion were 56% lower (adjusted odds
  ratio, 0.44 [confidence interval, 0.40-0.48]). The optimal hemoglobin for prediction
  of transfusion was 10.6 g/dL (sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 86%). There was no
  association between anemia and composite maternal or neonatal morbidity after adjustment
  for covariates, but anemia was associated with higher odds of postpartum readmission
  (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35 [1.11-1.64]). CONCLUSION: Maternal anemia before delivery
  was associated with 5-fold higher odds of packed red blood cell transfusion and
  postpartum readmission, but not other perinatal morbidity. Optimizing predelivery
  hemoglobin, particularly >=10.6 g/dL, may reduce peripartum transfusion."
