input_text: "Of mice and men: From hematopoiesis in mouse models to curative gene
  therapy for sickle cell disease. Through studies in mice and in humans, Stuart Orkin
  showed that GATA-1 is a master transcriptional regulator of hematopoiesis. He has
  highlighted the role of BCL11A in the fetal-adult hemoglobin switch. The Gairdner
  Foundation Award recognizes Orkin's contribution to the development of gene therapy
  of sickle cell disease."

  Split the following piece of text into fields in the following format:

  subject_extension: <A chemical or drug mentioned in the relationship between the medical action and the symptom, for example, "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  object_extension: <An optional term describing some specific aspect of the object, e.g. "analgesic agent therapy" has the aspect "analgesic">
  subject: <The medical action. For example: blood transfusion, radiation therapy, cardiac catheterization, pulse oximetry, otoscopy>
  predicate: <The relationship type between the medical action and the symptom, usually TREATS or PREVENTS.>
  object: <A sign or symptom associated with the disease and targeted by the medical action. For example, Low serum calcitriol, hypoplasia of the thymus, chronic cough, aortic stiffness, low pulse pressure>
  qualifier: <The primary disease the relationship is about, or specifically the disease the symptom is related to. For example, Beck-Fahrner syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, progeria, diabetes mellitus, infectious otitis media>
  subject_qualifier: <An optional qualifier or modifier for the subject of the statement, e.g. "high dose" or "intravenously administered">
