input_text: The Optimized gamma-Globin Lentiviral Vector GGHI-mB-3D Leads to Nearly
  Therapeutic HbF Levels In Vitro in CD34+ Cells from Sickle Cell Disease Patients.We
  have previously demonstrated that both the original gamma-globin lentiviral vector
  (LV) GGHI and the optimized GGHI-mB-3D LV, carrying the novel regulatory elements
  of the 3D HPFH-1 enhancer and the 3' beta-globin UTR, can significantly increase
  HbF production in thalassemic CD34+ cells and ameliorate the disease phenotype in
  vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether the GGHI-mB-3D vector can also
  exhibit an equally therapeutic effect, following the transduction of sickle cell
  disease (SCD) CD34+ cells at MOI 100, leading to HbF increase coupled with HbS decrease,
  and thus, to phenotype improvement in vitro. We show that GGHI-mB-3D LV can lead
  to high and potentially therapeutic HbF levels, reaching a mean 2-fold increase
  to a mean value of VCN/cell of 1.0 and a mean transduction efficiency of 55%. Furthermore,
  this increase was accompanied by a significant 1.6-fold HbS decrease, a beneficial
  therapeutic feature for SCD. In summary, our data demonstrate the efficacy of the
  optimized gamma-globin lentiviral vector to improve the SCD phenotype in vitro,
  and highlights its potential use in future clinical SCD trials.
