input_text: 'Metabolomics evaluation of early-storage red blood cell rejuvenation
  at 4 C and 37 C. BACKGROUND: Refrigerated red blood cell (RBC) storage results in
  the progressive accumulation of biochemical and morphological alterations collectively
  referred to as the storage lesion. Storage-induced metabolic alterations can be
  in part reversed by rejuvenation practices. However, rejuvenation requires an incubation
  step of RBCs for 1 hour at 37 C, limiting the practicality of providing "on-demand,"
  rejuvenated RBCs. We tested the hypothesis that the addition of rejuvenation solution
  early in storage as an adjunct additive solution would prevent-in a time window
  consistent with the average age of units transfused to sickle cell recipients at
  Duke (15 days)-many of the adverse biochemical changes that can be reversed via
  standard rejuvenation, while obviating the incubation step. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:
  Metabolomics analyses were performed on cells and supernatants from AS-1 RBC units
  (n = 4), stored for 15 days. Units were split into pediatric bag aliquots and stored
  at 4 C. These were untreated controls, washed with or without rejuvenation, performed
  under either standard (37 C) or cold (4 C) conditions. RESULTS: All three treatments
  removed most metabolic storage by-products from RBC supernatants. However, only
  standard and cold rejuvenation provided significant metabolic benefits as judged
  by the reactivation of glycolysis and regeneration of adenosine triphosphate and
  2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Improvements in energy metabolism also translated into increased
  capacity to restore the total glutathione pool and regenerate oxidized vitamin C
  in its reduced (ascorbate) form. CONCLUSION: Cold and standard rejuvenation of 15-day-old
  RBCs primes energy and redox metabolism of stored RBCs, while providing a logistic
  advantage for routine blood bank processing workflows.'
