input_text: Don't add fuel to the fire- Hyperhemolysis Syndrome in a pregnant woman
  with compound Sickle cell disease/ss0-thalassemia - Case report and review of the
  literature. Hyperhemolysis Syndrome (HHS) is a rare and severe post-transfusion
  complication characterized by the destruction of both recipient and donor red blood
  cells (RBC). The underlying mechanism of HHS is not fully understood and proper
  management can be difficult. Furthermore, there are few reports regarding HHS in
  pregnancy. We report on the development and management of HHS in a pregnant woman
  with known compound Sickle cell disease/ss-0-thalassemia after transfusion of not
  fully compatible packed red blood cells (PRBC). We aim to raise awareness on this
  diagnostically challenging and life-threatening type of hemolysis with this report,
  and to stress the need to consider the diagnosis of HHS in SCD patients with progressive
  anemia despite PRBC administration.
