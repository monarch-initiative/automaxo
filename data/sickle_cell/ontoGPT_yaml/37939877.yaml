input_text: 'Sickle cell disease and pregnancy.Pregnancy is a particularly risky period
  in the life of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Physiological changes during
  pregnancy increase the risk of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), acute chest syndrome,
  venous thromboembolic events, and infections. This concerns haemoglobin (Hb) S/C
  and S/beta+-thalassaemia patients as much than S/S or S/beta0-thalassaemia patients.
  SCD also increases the risk of obstetrical complications, such as preeclampsia,
  in utero foetal death, preterm delivery mostly induced, and intrauterine growth
  restriction. Thus, pregnancy should be planned and closely monitored by a multidisciplinary
  team involving obstetricians and sickle cell disease specialists. Before pregnancy,
  the parents should also be informed about the risk of transmission of this autosomal
  recessive disease, and the father should therefore be prescribed haemoglobin electrophoresis.
  Treatments have to be revised when planning pregnancy: hydroxyurea (HU) should be
  stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected or confirmed. Preventive blood transfusion
  is not systematic, but is recommended in the case of a pre-existing transfusion
  program prior to pregnancy, severe pre-existing organ damage, severe obstetric history,
  and severe or repeated crises during follow-up, especially in patients taking HU
  before. Despite the risks of prematurity, systematic administration of corticosteroids
  for foetal lung maturation is not recommended due to the risk of maternal vaso-occlusive
  event. Although more frequent, due to obstetrical and maternal complications, caesarean
  section is not systematic, in the absence of maternal contraindications. It is advisable
  not to exceed the term of 39 weeks of amenorrhoea. Post-partum follow-up is recommended,
  particularly because of the risk of thromboembolism.'
