input_text: Brain network hypersensitivity underlies pain crises in sickle cell disease.
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder causing painful and unpredictable
  Vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) through blood vessel blockages. In this study, we propose
  explosive synchronization (ES) as a novel approach to comprehend the hypersensitivity
  and occurrence of VOCs in the SCD brain network. We hypothesized that the accumulated
  disruptions in the brain network induced by SCD might lead to strengthened ES and
  hypersensitivity. We explored ES's relationship with patient reported outcome measures
  (PROMs) as well as VOCs by analyzing EEG data from 25 SCD patients and 18 matched
  controls. SCD patients exhibited lower alpha frequency than controls. SCD patients
  showed correlation between frequency disassortativity (FDA), an ES condition, and
  three important PROMs. Furthermore, stronger FDA was observed in SCD patients with
  a higher frequency of VOCs and EEG recording near VOC. We also conducted computational
  modeling on SCD brain network to study FDA's role in network sensitivity. Our model
  demonstrated that a stronger FDA could be linked to increased sensitivity and frequency
  of VOCs. This study establishes connections between SCD pain and the universal network
  mechanism, ES, offering a strong theoretical foundation. This understanding will
  aid predicting VOCs and refining pain management for SCD patients.
