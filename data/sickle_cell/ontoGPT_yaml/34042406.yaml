input_text: Towards manufactured red blood cells for the treatment of inherited anemia.
  Patients with inherited anemia and hemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell disease
  and beta-thalassemia) are treated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to alleviate
  their symptoms. Some of these patients may have rare blood group types or go on
  to develop alloimmune reactions, which can make it difficult to source compatible
  blood in the donor population. Laboratory-grown RBC represent a particularly attractive
  alternative which could satisfy an unmet clinical need. The challenge, however,
  is to produce - from a limited number of stem cells - the 2x1012 RBC required for
  a standard adult therapeutic dose. Encouraging progress has been made in RBC production
  from adult stem cells under good manufacturing practice. In 2011, the Douay group
  conducted a successful proof-of-principle mini-transfusion of autologous manufactured
  RBC in a single volunteer. In the UK, a trial is planned to assess whether manufactured
  RBC are equivalent to RBC produced naturally in donors, by testing an allogeneic
  mini-dose of laboratory-grown manufactured RBC in multiple volunteers. This review
  discusses recent progress in the erythroid culture field as well as opportunities
  for further scaling up of manufactured RBC production for transfusion practice.
