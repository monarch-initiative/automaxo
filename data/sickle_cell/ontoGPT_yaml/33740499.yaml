input_text: Classification of red blood cell aggregation using empirical wavelet transform
  analysis of ultrasonic radiofrequency echo signals.Grading red blood cell (RBC)
  aggregation is important for the early diagnosis and prevention of related diseases
  such as ischemic cardio-cerebrovascular disease, type II diabetes, deep vein thrombosis,
  and sickle cell disease. In this study, a machine learning technique based on an
  adaptive analysis of ultrasonic radiofrequency (RF) echo signals in blood is proposed,
  and its feasibility for classifying RBC aggregation is explored. Using an adaptive
  empirical wavelet transform (EWT) analysis, the ultrasonic RF signals are decomposed
  into a series of empirical mode functions (EMFs); then, dominant empirical mode
  functions (DEMFs) are selected from the series. Six statistical characteristics,
  including the mean, variance, median, kurtosis, root mean square (RMS), and skewness
  are calculated for the locally normalized DEMFs, aiming to form primary feature
  vectors. Random forest (RDF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are trained
  with the given feature vectors to obtain prediction models for RBC classification.
  Ultrasonic RF echo signals are acquired from five groups of six types of porcine
  blood samples with average numbers of aggregated RBCs of 1.04, 1.20, 1.83, 2.31,
  2.72, and 4.28, respectively, to test the classification performance of the proposed
  method. The best subset with regard to the variance, kurtosis, and RMS is determined
  according to the maximum accuracy based on the RDF and SVM classifiers. The classification
  accuracies are 84.03 +- 3.13% for the RDF classifier, and 85.88 +- 2.99% for the
  SVM classifier. The mean classification accuracy of the SVM classifier is 1.85%
  better than that of the RDF classifier. In conclusion, the machine learning method
  is useful for the discrimination of varying degrees of RBC aggregation, and has
  potential for use in characterizing and monitoring the RBC aggregation in vessels.
