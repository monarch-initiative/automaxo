input_text: 'Biomarkers of clinical severity in treated and untreated sickle cell
  disease: a comparison by genotypes of a single center cohort and African Americans
  in the NHANES study. Haemolysis and vaso-occlusion underlie multi-organ system complications
  in sickle cell disease (SCD). We assessed real-world biomarkers in University of
  Illinois adult SCD patients, categorised as severe (HbSS/Sbeta0 -thalassaemia; n
  = 342) or mild (HbSC/Sbeta+ -thalassaemia; n = 100) genotypes and stratified according
  to treatment. African-American controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
  Survey (NHANES) were matched with each genotype category. Most measures of haemolysis,
  anaemia, inflammation and function of kidneys, liver and lungs differed markedly
  in untreated severe genotype patients compared to NHANES controls. These same biomarkers
  were significantly closer to the NHANES control range in untreated mild versus severe
  genotype patients, but they were not improved in severe genotype patients receiving
  treatment with hydroxycarbamide or blood transfusions, except that haemoglobin and
  HbF were higher with hydroxycarbamide. Systolic blood pressures did not differ among
  the SCD and NHANES groups, but diastolic pressures were higher in mild genotype
  patients. Ferritin in severe genotype patients on chronic transfusions was 50-fold
  higher than NHANES controls. The cross-sectional real-world biomarkers of patients
  on hydroxycarbamide or transfusions were not markedly improved compared to untreated
  patients. This may be due partly to poor compliance or more severe disease. Our
  findings highlight the need for more effective treatments.'
