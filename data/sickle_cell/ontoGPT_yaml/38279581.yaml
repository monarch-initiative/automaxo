input_text: 'Decreasing alloimmunization-specific mortality in sickle cell disease
  in the United States: Cost-effectiveness of a shared transfusion resource.Red blood
  cell alloimmunization and consequent delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR)
  incidence and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are high. A shared
  transfusion resource has decreased both in other countries, while in the United
  States cost concerns persist. We conducted a Markov cohort simulation of a birth
  cohort of alloimmunized patients with SCD to estimate lifetime DHTR incidence, DHTR-specific
  mortality, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and costs with the implementation
  of a shared transfusion resource to identify antibody history versus without (i.e.,
  status quo). We conducted our analysis using a lifetime analytic time horizon and
  from a United States health system perspective. Implementation of shared transfusion
  resource projects to decrease cumulative DHTR-specific mortality by 26% for alloimmunized
  patients with SCD in the United States, relative to the status quo. For an average
  patient population of 32 000, this intervention would generate a discounted increment
  of 4000 QALYs at an incremental discounted cost of $0.3 billion, resulting in an
  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $75 600/QALY [95% credible interval $70
  200-81 400/QALY]. The results are most sensitive to the baseline lifetime medical
  expenditure of patients with SCD. Alloantibody data exchange is cost-effective in
  100% of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations. The resource would theoretically need a
  minimum patient population of 1819 patients or cost no more than $5.29 million annually
  to be cost-effective. By reducing DHTR-specific mortality, a shared transfusion
  resource in the United States projects to be a life-saving and cost-effective intervention
  for patients with SCD in the United States.'
