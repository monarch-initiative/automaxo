input_text: 'Pediatric Moyamoya Revascularization Perioperative Care: A Modified Delphi
  Study. BACKGROUND: Surgical revascularization decreases the long-term risk of stroke
  in children with moyamoya arteriopathy but can be associated with an increased risk
  of stroke during the perioperative period. Evidence-based approaches to optimize
  perioperative management are limited and practice varies widely. Using a modified
  Delphi process, we sought to establish expert consensus on key components of the
  perioperative care of children with moyamoya undergoing indirect revascularization
  surgery and identify areas of equipoise to define future research priorities. METHODS:
  Thirty neurologists, neurosurgeons, and intensivists practicing in North America
  with expertise in the management of pediatric moyamoya were invited to participate
  in a three-round, modified Delphi process consisting of a 138-item practice patterns
  survey, anonymous electronic evaluation of 88 consensus statements on a 5-point
  Likert scale, and a virtual group meeting during which statements were discussed,
  revised, and reassessed. Consensus was defined as >= 80% agreement or disagreement.
  RESULTS: Thirty-nine statements regarding perioperative pediatric moyamoya care
  for indirect revascularization surgery reached consensus. Salient areas of consensus
  included the following: (1) children at a high risk for stroke and those with sickle
  cell disease should be preadmitted prior to indirect revascularization; (2) intravenous
  isotonic fluids should be administered in all patients for at least 4 h before and
  24 h after surgery; (3) aspirin should not be discontinued in the immediate preoperative
  and postoperative periods; (4) arterial lines for blood pressure monitoring should
  be continued for at least 24 h after surgery and until active interventions to achieve
  blood pressure goals are not needed; (5) postoperative care should include hourly
  vital signs for at least 24 h, hourly neurologic assessments for at least 12 h,
  adequate pain control, maintaining normoxia and normothermia, and avoiding hypotension;
  and (6) intravenous fluid bolus administration should be considered the first-line
  intervention for new focal neurologic deficits following indirect revascularization
  surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of data supporting specific care practices
  before and after indirect revascularization surgery in children with moyamoya, this
  Delphi process defined areas of consensus among neurosurgeons, neurologists, and
  intensivists with moyamoya expertise. Research priorities identified include determining
  the role of continuous electroencephalography in postoperative moyamoya care, optimal
  perioperative blood pressure and hemoglobin targets, and the role of supplemental
  oxygen for treatment of suspected postoperative ischemia.'
