input_text: Reversal of Cerebral Arteriopathy Post-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant
  for Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hematologic disorder
  which causes progressive cerebral arteriopathy beginning in childhood. As a result,
  arterial ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD, and
  SCD is a leading cause of childhood stroke worldwide. Allogenic hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant (HSCT) may be curative for individuals with SCD. Long-term outcomes
  and effects are currently being studied. In this report, we describe a child with
  SCD who presented with arterial ischemic stroke at 6 years of age and was found
  to have a severe form of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy by catheter-directed
  angiography. The patient initially underwent revascularization surgery by indirect
  superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, and 1 year later,
  he underwent curative HSCT. Approximately 3 years after HSCT, repeat catheter-directed
  angiography revealed a striking reversal of cerebral large vessel arteriopathy.
  This article reveals a previously unrecognized and potentially beneficial effect
  of HSCT that may ameliorate cerebral large vessel arteriopathy and improve cerebrovascular
  health for children with SCD.
