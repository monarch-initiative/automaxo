input_text: New ASH initiatives to improve patient care of the long-overlooked Sickle
  Cell Disease.Due to the unique biology of sickle cell disease, as well as the societal
  disadvantages and racial inequities suffered by these patients, individuals with
  sickle cell disease have not benefited from the same remarkable advances in care
  and therapeutics as other hematologic disorders. Life expectancy of individuals
  with sickle cell disease is shortened by approximately 20 years even with optimal
  clinical care, and infant mortality continues to be a major concern in low-income
  countries. As hematologists, we must do more. ASH and the ASH Research Collaborative
  have instituted a multi-pronged initiative to improve the lives of individuals living
  with this disease. Here we describe two components of this ASH initiative, the Consortium
  on Newborn Screening in Africa (CONSA) to improve early diagnosis of infants in
  low-resource countries, and the Sickle Cell Disease Clinical Trial Network to accelerate
  the development of more effective therapeutics and care for those with this disorder.
  The combination of sickle cell disease-focused initiatives, the ASH Research Collaborative,
  CONSA, and the Sickle Cell Clinical Trials Network, have enormous potential to dramatically
  alter the course of sickle cell disease worldwide. We believe that the timing is
  ripe to embark on these critical and worthwhile initiatives and improve the lives
  of individuals with this disease.
