input_text: 'Efficacy and safety of iron chelators in thalassemia and sickle cell
  disease: a multiple treatment comparison network meta-analysis and trial sequential
  analysis. BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy and safety of desferrioxamine (DFO),
  deferiprone (DFP), deferasirox (DFX) and silymarin in patients with either thalassemia
  or sickle cell disorder through network meta-analysis. METHODS: Electronic databases
  were searched for appropriate randomized clinical trials comparing iron chelators
  in patients with iron overload. Random effects model was used to generate direct,
  indirect and mixed treatment comparison pooled estimates for the following outcomes:
  serum ferritin, liver iron concentration (LIC), changes in serum ferritin, mortality,
  urine iron excretion, adverse events, neutropenia, agranulocytosis and number of
  patients withdrawing the chelating therapy. RESULTS: Thirty-two clinical trials
  were included in the meta-analysis. DFX/DFO was associated with better serum ferritin
  levels compared to DFO, DFX, DFO/Silymarin and DFP/DFO. DFX/DFO also lower LIC significantly
  compared to DFO. DFP/DFO was associated with higher LVEF, low risk of adverse events
  and reduced end of serum ferritin compared to DFO. Combination of silymarin with
  either DFP or DFX was observed with reduced end of treatment serum ferritin compared
  to using either of the drugs alone. DFP was observed with better effects in sickle
  cell disease. The strength of evidence was very low for most of the comparisons.
  CONCLUSION: Relative estimates between the individual iron chelators have been established.
  However, this evidence should be considered preliminary and may change with the
  results of future head-to-head clinical trials.'
