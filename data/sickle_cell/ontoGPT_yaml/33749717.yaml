input_text: 'A Budget Impact Analysis of Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease: The
  Medicaid Perspective.Importance: Hundreds of gene therapies are undergoing clinical
  testing and are likely to be priced more than $1 million per course of treatment.
  The association that high prices will have with insurance coverage of gene therapy
  remains unclear. Gene therapy for sickle cell disease has shown early success and
  would be one of the first gene therapies available for a relatively large population.
  Objectives: To estimate the budget impact and affordability of a gene therapy for
  severe sickle cell disease from the perspective of US Medicaid programs with the
  highest prevalence of sickle cell disease while exploring the impact of an annuity
  payment model. Design, Setting, and Participants: A budget impact analysis was performed
  from January 1 to May 31, 2020, for a sickle cell disease gene therapy from the
  perspective of 10 state Medicaid plans with a 5-year time horizon, using state-level
  disease prevalence data from 2012. Disease prevalence, Medicaid enrollment, and
  expenditures were derived from the available literature. The eligible population
  was based on modified clinical trial inclusion criteria including individuals aged
  13 to 45 years with severe disease. Exposures: The gene therapy was assumed to be
  administered to 7% of the eligible population annually and was curative (no subsequent
  disease-related expenditures). The gene therapy price was $1.85 million in the base
  case, and baseline disease-related expenditures were $42 200 per year. Main Outcomes
  and Measures: The main outcomes were total budget impact and budget impact per member
  per month in years 1 through 5. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate
  uncertainty of market diffusion, size of eligible population, price of therapy,
  and cost of routine care. Results: An estimated 5464 Medicaid enrollees would be
  eligible for the gene therapy nationally, with 2315 individuals in the 10 Medicaid
  programs of interest (16 per 100 000 enrollees). The model projected a mean 1-year
  budget impact of $29.96 million per state Medicaid program in the sample ($1.91
  per member per month). A 5-year annuity payment reduced the short-term budget impact.
  Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that a gene therapy for severe sickle
  cell disease is likely to produce a considerable budget impact for many Medicaid
  plans while potentially offering substantial benefit to patients. Payers may need
  to take steps to ensure affordability and access. Gene therapy for sickle cell disease
  is likely to provide an early demonstration of the unique financial challenges associated
  with this emerging drug class.'
