input_text: "Childhood cancer and hematological disorders negatively affect spermatogonial
  quantity at diagnosis: a retrospective study of a male fertility preservation cohort.
  STUDY QUESTION: What is the impact of cancer or hematological disorders on germ
  cells in pediatric male patients? SUMMARY ANSWER: Spermatogonial quantity is reduced
  in testes of prepubertal boys diagnosed with cancer or severe hematological disorder
  compared to healthy controls and this reduction is disease and age dependent: patients
  with central nervous system cancer (CNS tumors) and hematological disorders, as
  well as boys <7 years are the most affected. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fertility preservation
  in pediatric male patients is considered based on the gonadotoxicity of selected
  treatments. Although treatment effects on germ cells have been extensively investigated,
  limited data are available on the effect of the disease on the prepubertal male
  gonad. Of the few studies investigating the effects of cancer or hematologic disorders
  on testicular function and germ cell quantity in prepuberty, the results are inconsistent.
  However, recent studies suggested impairments before the initiation of known gonadotoxic
  therapy. Understanding which diseases and at what age affect the germ cell pool
  in pediatric patients before treatment is critical to optimize strategies and counseling
  for fertility preservation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This multicenter retrospective
  cohort study included 101 boys aged <14 years with extra-cerebral cancer (solid
  tumors), CNS tumors, leukemia/lymphoma (blood cancer), or non-malignant hematological
  disorders, who were admitted for a fertility preservation programme between 2002
  and 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In addition to clinical data,
  we analyzed measurements of testicular volume and performed histological staining
  on testicular biopsies obtained before treatment, at cryopreservation, to evaluate
  number of spermatogonia per tubular cross-section, tubular fertility index, and
  the most advanced germ cell type prior to chemo-/radiotherapy. The controls were
  data simulations with summary statistics from original studies reporting healthy
  prepubertal boys' testes characteristics. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Prepubertal
  patients with childhood cancer or hematological disorders were more likely to have
  significantly reduced spermatogonial quantity compared to healthy controls (48.5%
  versus 31.0% prevalence, respectively). The prevalence of patients with reduced
  spermatogonial quantity was highest in the CNS tumor (56.7%) and the hematological
  disorder (55.6%) groups, including patients with hydroxyurea pre-treated sickle
  cell disease (58.3%) and patients not exposed to hydroxyurea (50%). Disease also
  adversely impacted spermatogonial distribution and differentiation. Irrespective
  of disease, we observed the highest spermatogonial quantity reduction in patients
  <7 years of age. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: For ethical reasons, we could
  not collect spermatogonial quantity data in healthy prepubertal boys as controls
  and thus deployed statistical simulation on data from literature. Also, our results
  should be interpreted considering low patient numbers per (sub)group. WIDER IMPLICATIONS
  OF THE FINDINGS: Cancers, especially CNS tumors, and severe hematological disorders
  can affect spermatogonial quantity in prepubertal boys before treatment. Consequently,
  these patients may have a higher risk of depleted spermatogonia following therapies,
  resulting in persistent infertility. Therefore, patient counseling prior to disease
  treatment and timing of fertility preservation should not only be based on treatment
  regimes, but also on diagnoses and age. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This
