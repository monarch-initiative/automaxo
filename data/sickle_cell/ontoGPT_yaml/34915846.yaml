input_text: 'Using DNA testing for the precise, definite, and low-cost diagnosis of
  sickle cell disease and other Haemoglobinopathies: findings from Tanzania.BACKGROUND:
  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an important cause of under-five mortality. Tanzania
  is the 5th country in the world with the highest births prevalence of SCD individuals.
  Significant advances in the neonatal diagnosis of SCD using rapid point-of-care
  testing have been made. However genetic confirmation is still required for positive
  cases, in uncertain cases, in multiply transfused patients, to resolve compound
  heterozygosity (Hb S/ beta0 Thal or Hb S/ beta+ thal) not uncommon in the coastal
  regions of East Africa and increasingly also for pre-marital counselling and potentially
  for future curative approaches such as gene therapy. The currently available DNA
  tests are prohibitively expensive. Here, we describe an easy-to-use, affordable
  and accurate beta-globin sequencing approach that can be easily integrated within
  existing NBS for SCD and other haemoglobinopathies especially in Low- and Middle-income
  Countries. AIM: To evaluate an affordable DNA technology for the diagnosis of Sickle
  cell disease and other haemoglobinopathies in a resource-limited setting. METHODS:
  Laboratory-based validation study was conducted by Muhimbili University of Health
  and Allied Sciences and the University of Oxford involving sequencing of the entire
  beta -haemoglobin locus using the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform. A total number
  of 36 Dried blood spots and whole blood samples were subjected to conventional protein-based
  methods (isoelectric focusing, HPLC), and/or sequenced by the Sanger method as comparators.
  RESULTS: Sequencing results for SCD using the MinION were 100% concordant with those
  from the Sanger method. In addition, the long-read DNA sequencing method enabled
  the resolution of cases with unusual phenotypes which make up 1% of all children
  in Tanzania. The cost is $11/ sample for consumables, which is cheaper compared
  to other sequencing platforms. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a comprehensive
  single DNA assay as a definitive diagnostic test for SCD and other haemoglobinopathies.
  The test is fast, precise, accurate and affordable.'
