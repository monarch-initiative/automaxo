input_text: 'Reversibility of Cognitive Deficits and Functional Connectivity With
  Transfusion in Children With Sickle Cell Disease. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: People
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of cognitive dysfunction independent
  of stroke. Diminished functional connectivity in select large-scale networks and
  white matter integrity reflect the neurologic consequences of SCD. Because chronic
  transfusion therapy is neuroprotective in preventing stroke and strengthening executive
  function abilities in people with SCD, we hypothesized that red blood cell (RBC)
  transfusion facilitates the acute reversal of disruptions in functional connectivity
  while white matter integrity remains unaffected. METHODS: Children with SCD receiving
  chronic transfusion therapy underwent a brain MRI measuring white matter integrity
  with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional connectivity within 3
  days before and after transfusion of RBCs. Cognitive assessments with the NIH Toolbox
  were acquired after transfusion and then immediately before the following transfusion
  cycle. RESULTS: Sixteen children with a median age of 12.5 years were included.
  Global assessments of functional connectivity using homotopy (p = 0.234) or modularity
  (p = 0.796) did not differ with transfusion. Functional connectivity within the
  frontoparietal network significantly strengthened after transfusion (median intranetwork
  Z-score 0.21 [0.17-0.30] before transfusion, 0.29 [0.20-0.36] after transfusion,
  p < 0.001), while there was not a significant change seen within the sensory motor,
  visual, auditory, default mode, dorsal attention, or cingulo-opercular networks.
  Corresponding to the change within the frontoparietal network, there was a significant
  improvement in executive function abilities after transfusion (median executive
  function composite score 87.7 [81.3-90.7] before transfusion, 90.3 [84.3-93.7] after
  transfusion, p = 0.021). Participants with stronger connectivity in the frontoparietal
  network before transfusion had a significantly greater improvement in the executive
  function composite score with transfusion (r = 0.565, 95% CI 0.020-0.851, p = 0.044).
  While functional connectivity and executive abilities strengthened with transfusion,
  there was not a significant change in white matter integrity as assessed by fractional
  anisotropy and mean diffusivity within 16 white matter tracts or globally with tract-based
  spatial statistics. DISCUSSION: Strengthening of functional connectivity with concomitant
  improvement in executive function abilities with transfusion suggests that functional
  connectivity MRI could be used as a biomarker for acutely reversible neurocognitive
  injury as novel therapeutics are developed for people with SCD.'
