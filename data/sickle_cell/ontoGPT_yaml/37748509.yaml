input_text: 'High Throughput Newborn Screening for Sickle Cell Disease - Application
  of Two-Tiered Testing with a qPCR-Based Primary screen.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease
  (SCD) is a group of hemoglobinopathies with a common point mutation causing the
  production of sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS). In high-throughput newborn screening
  (NBS) for SCD, a two-step procedure is suitable, in which qPCR first pre-selects
  relevant samples that are differentiated by a second method. METHODS: Three NBS
  centers using qPCR-based primary screening for SCD performed a laboratory comparison.
  Methods using tandem MS or HPLC were used for differentiation. RESULTS: In a benchmarking
  test, 450 dried blood samples were analyzed. Samples containing HbS were detected
  as reliably by qPCR as by methods established for hemoglobinopathy testing. In a
  two-step screening approach, the 2nd-tier-analyses have to distinguish the carrier
  status from pathological variants. In nine months of regular screening, a total
  of 353,219 samples were analyzed using two-stage NBS procedures. The 1st-tier screening
  by qPCR reduced the number of samples for subsequent differentiation by>99.5%. Cases
  with carrier status or other variants were identified as inconspicuous while 78
  cases with SCD were revealed. The derived incidence of 1:4,773, is in good agreement
  with previously published incidences. CONCLUSION: In high-throughput NBS for SCD,
  qPCR is suitable to focus 2nd-tier analyses on samples containing HbS, while being
  unaffected by factors such as prematurity or transfusions. The substantial reduction
  of samples numbers positively impacts resource conservation, sustainability, and
  cost-effectiveness. No false negative cases came to attention.'
