input_text: "Laparoscopic Splenectomy in Children: Safety of Ligasure Usage. INTRODUCTION:
  Laparoscopic splenectomy started to be more popular and nowadays it is the first
  choice for splenectomy in children. The main advantages of laparoscopic splenectomy
  over open approach are the shorter hospital stay, low complications and the cosmetic
  results despite the main concern of long operative time and the intra operative
  bleeding. AIM: The aim of this study was to report our experience with laparoscopic
  splenectomy in children's with hematological diseases using ligasure regarding vascular
  control safety, efficacy and complications rate. METHODS: A retrospective study
  was carried out at Queen Rania Al-Abdullah Hospital for Children over the period
  from January 2017 to February 2019. Total number of 18 patients with hematological
  diseases underwent laparoscopic splenectomy using ligasure. Demographic data, complications
  and outcomes were collected to assess the advantages of ligasure usage for vascular
  control safety. RESULTS: Out of 18 patients underwent laparoscopic splenectomy using
  ligasure (10 with spherocytosis, 4 with immune thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP], 3
  with sickle cell anemia, 1 with hemangioma), from which number, 8 patients were
  males and 10 were females. Mean age was 6.7 years (ranges from 4.3 to13.7 years).
  Mean operative time was 107 minutes (ranges from 70-180 minutes). There was no conversion
  to open splenectomy and no mortality. Intra operative blood loss was insignificant.
  CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic splenectomy using ligature is safe with excellent results
  in decreasing operative time, less complications and decrease incidence of intraoperative
  bleeding."
