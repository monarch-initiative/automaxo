input_text: 'Outcomes in Patients with Moyamoya Syndrome and Sickle Cell Disease:
  A Systematic Review. BACKGROUND: Moyamoya syndrome, a progressive, idiopathic stenosis
  of the internal carotid arteries, results in increased risk for both ischemic and
  hemorrhagic strokes. Revascularization procedures have been shown in small studies
  to be both safe and efficacious for these patients; however, randomized controlled
  trials are lacking. The goal of this systematic review is to organize the literature
  evaluating surgical intervention versus conservative medical management. METHODS:
  A systematic review was performed including studies with 3 or more participants
  with moyamoya syndrome in the setting of sickle cell disease and a measured outcome
  after either medical or surgical intervention. Relevant studies were identified
  using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria
  and a set of predetermined key words. RESULTS: Sixty-one articles were identified
  with 6 articles ultimately included in this review (N = 122). Of the patients, 73
  (59.8%) were revascularized surgically (all indirect procedures), whereas 49 (40.2%)
  remained on chronic transfusion therapy. Of the patients that underwent indirect
  revascularization surgery, a total of 1 perioperative (1.4%) and 4 postoperative
  strokes (5.5%) were reported over 44 months (1 stroke per 53.3 patient-years). In
  comparison, an average of 46.5% of patients who were receiving chronic transfusions
  had major events (stroke or transient ischemic attack) while undergoing therapy
  (1 stroke per 13.65 patient-years, P = 0.00215). CONCLUSIONS: We present a large
  systematic review of the literature regarding outcomes of surgical and medical management
  for patients with moyamoya syndrome and sickle cell disease. The findings redemonstrate
  the efficacy and safety of surgical revascularization, and advocate for earlier
  discussion around surgical intervention.'
