input_text: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Impact Acute Care Utilization in Sickle
  Cell Disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited red blood cell disorder, is
  characterized by anemia, end-organ damage, unpredictable episodes of pain, and early
  mortality. Emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations are frequent, leading
  to increased burden on patients and increased health care costs. This study assessed
  the effects of a multidisciplinary care team intervention on acute care utilization
  among adults with SCD. The multidisciplinary care team intervention included monthly
  team meetings and development of individualized care plans. Individualized care
  plans included targeted pain management plans for management of uncomplicated pain
  crisis. Following implementation of the multidisciplinary care team intervention,
  a significant decrease in ED utilization was identified among those individuals
  with a history of high ED utilization. Findings highlight the potential strength
  of multidisciplinary interventions and suggest that targeting interventions toward
  high-utilizing subpopulations may offer the greatest impact.
