input_text: "Evidence-based interventions implemented in low-and middle-income countries
  for sickle cell disease management: A systematic review of randomized controlled
  trials. BACKGROUND: Despite ~90% of sickle cell disease (SCD) occurring in low-and
  middle-income countries (LMICs), the vast majority of people are not receiving evidence-based
  interventions (EBIs) to reduce SCD-related adverse outcomes and mortality, and data
  on implementation research outcomes (IROs) and SCD is limited. This study aims to
  synthesize available data on EBIs for SCD and assess IROs. METHODS: We conducted
  a systematic review of RCTs reporting on EBIs for SCD management implemented in
  LMICs. We identified articles from PubMed/Medline, Global Health, PubMed Central,
  Embase, Web of Science medical subject heading (MeSH and Emtree) and keywords, published
  from inception through February 23, 2020, and conducted an updated search through
  December 24, 2020. We provide intervention characteristics for each study, EBI impact
  on SCD, and evidence of reporting on IROs. MAIN RESULTS: 29 RCTs were analyzed.
  EBIs identified included disease modifying agents, supportive care agents/analgesics,
  anti-malarials, systemic treatments, patient/ provider education, and nutritional
  supplements. Studies using disease modifying agents, nutritional supplements, and
  anti-malarials reported improvements in pain crisis, hospitalization, children's
  growth and reduction in severity and prevalence of malaria. Two studies reported
  on the sustainability of supplementary arginine, citrulline, and daily chloroquine
  and hydroxyurea for SCD patients. Only 13 studies (44.8%) provided descriptions
  that captured at least three of the eight IROs. There was limited reporting of acceptability,
  feasibility, fidelity, cost and sustainability. CONCLUSION: EBIs are effective for
  SCD management in LMICs; however, measurement of IROs is scarce. Future research
  should focus on penetration of EBIs to inform evidence-based practice and sustainability
  in the context of LMICs. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This review is registered
  in PROSPERO #CRD42020167289."
