input_text: 'Viral Vectors in Gene Therapy: Where Do We Stand in 2023? Viral vectors
  have been used for a broad spectrum of gene therapy for both acute and chronic diseases.
  In the context of cancer gene therapy, viral vectors expressing anti-tumor, toxic,
  suicide and immunostimulatory genes, such as cytokines and chemokines, have been
  applied. Oncolytic viruses, which specifically replicate in and kill tumor cells,
  have provided tumor eradication, and even cure of cancers in animal models. In a
  broader meaning, vaccine development against infectious diseases and various cancers
  has been considered as a type of gene therapy. Especially in the case of COVID-19
  vaccines, adenovirus-based vaccines such as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S have
  demonstrated excellent safety and vaccine efficacy in clinical trials, leading to
  Emergency Use Authorization in many countries. Viral vectors have shown great promise
  in the treatment of chronic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID),
  muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, beta-thalassemia, and sickle cell disease (SCD).
  Proof-of-concept has been established in preclinical studies in various animal models.
  Clinical gene therapy trials have confirmed good safety, tolerability, and therapeutic
  efficacy. Viral-based drugs have been approved for cancer, hematological, metabolic,
  neurological, and ophthalmological diseases as well as for vaccines. For example,
  the adenovirus-based drug Gendicine  for non-small-cell lung cancer, the reovirus-based
  drug Reolysin  for ovarian cancer, the oncolytic HSV T-VEC for melanoma, lentivirus-based
  treatment of ADA-SCID disease, and the rhabdovirus-based vaccine Ervebo against
  Ebola virus disease have been approved for human use.'
