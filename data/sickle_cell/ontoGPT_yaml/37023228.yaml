input_text: "Proinflammatory state promotes red blood cell alloimmunization in pediatric
  patients with sickle cell disease. We examined risk factors for RBC alloimmunization
  in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), focusing on recipients' inflammatory
  state at the time of transfusion and anti-inflammatory role of hydroxyurea (HU).
  Among 471 participants, 55 (11.70%) participants were alloimmunized and formed 59
  alloantibodies and 17 autoantibodies with an alloimmunization rate of 0.36 alloantibodies
  per 100 units. Analysis of 27 participants who formed alloantibodies with specificities
  showed 23.8% (30/126) of units transfused during a proinflammatory event resulted
  in alloantibody formation compared to 2.8% (27/952) of units transfused at steady
  state. Therefore, transfusion during proinflammatory events increased the risk for
  alloimmunization (odds ratio [OR]: 4.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64-10.85;
  p = 0.003). Further analysis of all the 471 participants showed alloimmunization
  of episodically transfused patients who received transfusion mostly during proinflammatory
  events was not reduced by HU therapy (OR: 6.52; 95% CI: 0.85-49.77; p = 0.071),
  HU therapy duration (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.997-1.28; p = 0.056) or HU dose (OR: 1.06;
  95% CI: 0.96-1.16; p = 0.242). The analysis also identified high transfusion burden
  (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.003-1.04; p = 0.020) and HbSS and HbSbeta0-thalassemia genotypes
  (OR: 11.22, 95% CI: 1.51-83.38, p = 0.018) as additional risk factors for alloimmunization.
  In conclusion, the inflammatory state of transfusion recipients affects the risk
  of RBC alloimmunization, which is not modified by HU therapy. Judicious use of transfusion
  during proinflammatory events is critical for preventing alloimmunization."
