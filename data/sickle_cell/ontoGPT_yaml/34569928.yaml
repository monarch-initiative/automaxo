input_text: "Artemisinin derivative-containing therapies and abnormal hemoglobin:
  Do we need to adapt the treatment?BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based treatment in malaria
  patients with abnormal hemoglobin may be ineffective because of their genetic particularity,
  which could lead to resistance. The main purpose of this study was to assess the
  effect of artemisinin derivatives on in vivo parasite clearance according to erythrocyte
  variants. In vivo response was investigated through retrospective data obtained
  over a 42-day artemether-lumefantrine/artesunate amodiaquine efficacy protocol conducted
  from 2012 to 2016. RESULTS: A total of 770 patients in Cote d'Ivoire attending the
  hospitals of Anonkoua-koute (Abidjan), Petit Paris (Korhogo), Libreville (Man),
  Dar es salam (Bouake), Ayame and Yamoussoukro with acute uncomplicated falciparum
  malaria were selected for successful hemoglobin typing. HbAS, HbSS, HbAC, and HbSC
  genotypes were found. Parasite clearance time was obtained for 414 patients. In
  the population with abnormal hemoglobin, parasite densities on admission and parasite
  clearance rates were significantly lower in the HbSC group compared to HbAA (p =
  0.02 and p = 0.007, respectively). After PCR correction on day 42, the acute treatment
  rate was 100% for each group. Parasite half-life and time for initial parasitaemia
  to decline by 50 and 99% were longer for the HbSC group (p < 0.05). The study also
  investigated the prevalence of K13-propeller polymorphisms across different hemoglobin
  genotype groups. A total of 185 and 63 samples were sequenced in the HbAA group
  and patients with abnormal Hb, respectively. Only two nonsynonymous mutations D559N
  and V510M were found in the HbAA group. CONCLUSION: Although this study proved good
  efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate amodiaquine in the treatment
  of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in patients with abnormal hemoglobin,
  the increased delay of parasite clearance may represent a threat to health in these
  patients in relation with sickle cell crisis, which could support selection of parasites
  resistant to artemisinin."
