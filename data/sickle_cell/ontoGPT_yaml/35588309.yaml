input_text: "Hyperhemolysis in a patient with sickle cell disease and recent SARS-CoV-2
  infection, with complex auto- and alloantibody work-up, successfully treated with
  tocilizumab. BACKGROUND: Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a severe delayed hemolytic
  transfusion reaction seen in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, characterized by
  destruction of donor and recipient RBCs. It results in a drop in hemoglobin to below
  pretransfusion levels and frequently reticulocytopenia. CASE REPORT: We report a
  case of a man in his thirties with SCD with a recent hospitalization 2 weeks prior
  for COVID-19. His red cell antibody history included anti-Fy(a) and warm autoantibody.
  At that time, he was given 2 units of RBC and discharged with a hemoglobin of 10.2
  g/dl. He returned to the hospital approximately 1.5 weeks later with hemoglobin
  6.0 g/dl and symptoms concerning for acute chest syndrome. Pretransfusion testing
  now showed 4+ pan-agglutinin in both gel-based and tube-based testing. Alloadsorption
  identified an anti-N and a strong cold agglutinin. Three least incompatible units
  were transfused to this patient over several days, with evidence of hemolysis. Further
  reference lab work revealed anti-Fya , anti-Fyb , anti-Lea , anti-Leb , and an anti-KN
  system antibody. The patient's hemoglobin nadired at 4.4 g/dl. The patient was treated
  with a single dose of tocilizumab, his hemoglobin stabilized, and he was discharged.
  DISCUSSION: We present a case of HHS proximate to recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with
  multiple allo and autoantibodies identified. Information on the relationship between
  SARS-CoV-2 infection and HHS is limited; however, it is possible that inflammation
  related to COVID-19 could predispose to HHS. Tocilizumab is an approved treatment
  for COVID-19. Additionally, tocilizumab appears to be a promising treatment option
  for patients with HHS."
