input_text: 'A telephonic mindfulness-based intervention for persons with sickle cell
  disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: One of the
  most difficult symptoms for persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) to manage is
  chronic pain. Chronic pain impacts approximately one-third of persons with SCD and
  is associated with increased pain intensity, pain behavior, and frequency and duration
  of hospital visits. A promising category of nonpharmacological interventions for
  managing both physical and affective components of pain are mindfulness-based interventions
  (MBIs). METHODS/DESIGN: The primary aim of this study is to conduct a randomized
  controlled study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility, as well as to determine
  the preliminary efficacy, of a telephonic MBI for adults with SCD who have chronic
  pain. We will enroll 60 adult patients with SCD and chronic pain at an outpatient
  comprehensive SCD center in the southeastern United States. Patients will be randomized
  to either an MBI or a wait-listed control group. The MBI group will complete a six-session
  (60 minutes), telephonically delivered, group-based MBI program. The feasibility,
  acceptability, and efficacy of the MBI regarding pain catastrophizing will be assessed
  by administering questionnaires at baseline and weeks 1, 3, and 6. In addition,
  ten randomly selected MBI participants will complete semistructured interviews to
  help determine intervention acceptability. DISCUSSION: In this study protocol, we
  report detailed methods of the randomized controlled trial. Findings of this study
  will be useful to determine the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of an MBI
  for persons with SCD and chronic pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
  NCT02394587 . Registered on 9 February 2015.'
