input_text: 'Urinary Kringle Domain-Containing Protein HGFL: A Validated Biomarker
  of Early Sickle Cell Anemia-Associated Kidney Disease.INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney
  disease (CKD) is a prevalent complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA). Hyperfiltration
  that delayed detection of CKD is common in SCA patients. Identification of novel
  urinary biomarkers correlating with glomerular filtration rates may help to detect
  and predict progression of renal disease. METHODS: Reanalysis of mass spectra of
  urinary samples obtained from University of Illinois at Chicago identified kringle
  domain-containing protein HGFL. RESULTS: HGFL levels correlated with hyperfiltration,
  were significantly reduced at CKD stage 1 compared to stage 0, negatively correlated
  with progression of CKD and were suitable for differentiation of stage 1. Better
  prediction of CKD progression to stage 2 was observed for HGFL-based risk prediction
  compared to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-based prediction. Results
  from a Howard University patient cohort supported the utility of HGFL-based test
  for the differentiation of stage 1 of CKD. CONCLUSION: Urinary HGFL may contribute
  additional information beyond eGFR and improve diagnosis of early-stage CKD in SCA
  patients.'
