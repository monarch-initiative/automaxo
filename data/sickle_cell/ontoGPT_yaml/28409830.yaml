input_text: "Magnesium for treating sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease
  is an autosomal recessive inherited haemoglobinopathy which causes painful vaso-occlusive
  crises due to sickle red blood cell dehydration. Vaso-occlusive crises are common
  painful events responsible for a variety of clinical complications; overall mortality
  is increased and life expectancy decreased compared to the general population. Experimental
  studies suggest that intravenous magnesium has proven to be well-tolerated in individuals
  hospitalised for the immediate relief of acute (sudden onset) painful crisis and
  has the potential to decrease the length of hospital stay. Some in vitro studies
  and open studies of long-term oral magnesium showed promising effect on pain relief
  but failed to show its efficacy. The studies show that oral magnesium therapy may
  prevent sickle red blood cell dehydration and prevent recurrent painful episodes.
  There is a need to access evidence for the impact of oral and intravenous magnesium
  effect on frequency of pain, length of hospital stay and quality of life. OBJECTIVES:
  To evaluate the effects of short-term intravenous magnesium on the length of hospital
  stay and quality of life in children and adults with sickle cell disease. To determine
  the effects of long-term oral magnesium therapy on the frequency of painful crises
  and the quality of life in children and adults with sickle cell disease. SEARCH
  METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled
  from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract
  books.Date of last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders
  Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 01 December 2016.Date of last search
  of other resources (clinical trials registries): 29 March 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA:
  We searched for published and unpublished randomized controlled studies of oral
  or intravenous magnesium compared to placebo or no magnesium. DATA COLLECTION AND
  ANALYSIS: Authors independently assessed the study quality and extracted the data
  using standard Cochrane methodologies. MAIN RESULTS: We included five randomized
  placebo-controlled studies with a total of 386 participants (aged three to 53 years).
  Two shorter parallel studies (n = 306) compared intravenous magnesium sulphate to
  placebo (normal saline) for admission to hospital due to a vaso-occlusive crisis,
  for which we were able to analyse data. The quality of evidence was moderate for
  studies presenting this comparison mainly due to limitations due to risk of bias
  and imprecision. Two of the three longer-term studies comparing oral magnesium pidolate
  to placebo had a cross-over design. The third was a parallel factorial study which
  compared hydroxyurea and oral magnesium to each other and to placebo over a longer
  period of time; we only present the comparison of oral magnesium to placebo from
  this study. The quality of evidence was very low with uncertainty of the estimation.The
  eight-hourly dose levels in the two studies of intravenous magnesium were different;
  one used 100 mg/kg while the second used 40 mg/kg. Only one of these studies (n
  = 104) reported the mean daily pain score while hospitalised (a non-significant
  difference between groups, moderate quality evidence). The second study (n = 202)
  reported a number of child- and parent-reported quality of life scores. None of
  the scores showed any difference between treatment groups (low quality evidence).
  Data from one study (n = 106) showed no difference in length of stay in hospital
  between groups (low quality evidence). Both studies reported on adverse events,
  but not defined by severity as we had planned. One study showed significantly more
  participants receiving intravenous magnesium experienced warmth at infusion site
  compared to placebo; there were no differences between groups for other adverse
  events (low quality evidence).Three studies (n = 80) compared oral magnesium pidolate
  to placebo. None of them reported data which we were able to analyse. One study
  (n = 24) reported on the number of painful days and stated there was no difference
  between two groups (low quality evidence). None of the studies reported on quality
  of life or length of hospital stay. Two studies (n = 68) reported there were no
  differences in levels of magnesium in either plasma or red blood cells (moderate
  quality evidence). Two studies (n = 56) reported adverse events. One reported episodes
  of mild diarrhoea and headache, all of which resolved without stopping treatment.
  The second study reported adverse events as gastrointestinal disorders, headache
  or migraine, upper respiratory infections and rash; which were all evenly distributed
  across treatment groups (moderate quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate
  to low quality evidence showed neither intravenous magnesium and oral magnesium
  therapy has an effect on reducing painful crisis, length of hospital stay and changing
  quality of life in treating sickle cell disease. Therefore, no definitive conclusions
  can be made regarding its clinical benefit. Further randomized controlled studies,
  perhaps multicentre, are necessary to establish whether intravenous and oral magnesium
  therapies have any effect on improving the health of people with sickle cell disease."
