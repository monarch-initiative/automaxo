input_text: 'SNAP: Supportive noninvasive ventilation for acute chest syndrome prevention
  in children with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is
  a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children with sickle cell disease
  (SCD). Preventing hypoxemia by optimizing lung aeration during sleep remains a challenge.
  OBJECTIVES: To explore safety, feasibility, and tolerability of noninvasive, bi-level
  positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) as preventative, supportive care for
  hospitalized, medically stable children with SCD on a general pediatric inpatient
  unit. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients <=22 years of age with SCD
  admitted to the general pediatric inpatient unit from February 1, 2017 to March
  1, 2020 for whom BiPAP was recommended as supportive care. Hospitalizations were
  excluded if patients were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU),
  required BiPAP for respiratory failure, or used BiPAP at home for obstructive sleep
  apnea. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had 53 hospitalizations in which BiPAP was
  recommended. Fifty-two (98%) hospitalizations included acute SCD pain. Indications
  for BiPAP included prior ACS (94%), chest or back pain (79%), and/or oxygen desaturation
  (66%). On 17 occasions, patients already had mild to moderate ACS but were stable
  when BiPAP was recommended. BiPAP was used successfully during 75% of hospitalizations
  for a median of two nights. There were no adverse effects associated with BiPAP.
  PICU transfer for respiratory support occurred during three hospitalizations. In
  26 hospitalizations of children at risk for ACS who tolerated BiPAP, 23 (88%) did
  not develop ACS. CONCLUSIONS: BiPAP is safe, feasible, and well tolerated as supportive
  care for hospitalized children with SCD. Next steps include an intervention trial
  to further assess the efficacy of BiPAP on ACS prevention.'
