input_text: "Pegylated Bovine Carboxyhemoglobin (SANGUINATE) in a Jehovah's Witness
  Undergoing Liver Transplant: A Case Report. Liver transplantation in practicing
  Jehovah's Witnesses is challenging because of their religious beliefs preventing
  them from accepting allogenic blood products. Pegylated bovine carboxyhemoglobin
  (SANGUINATE) is an oxygen transfer agent, currently under investigation for the
  treatment of sickle cell disease, which may play a role in these patients by maximizing
  perioperative oxygen delivery. We report a case involving the use of SANGUINATE
  in a Jehovah's Witness undergoing liver transplant."
