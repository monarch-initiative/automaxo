input_text: "Multi-component Strategy Improves HPV Vaccination Rates among Adolescents
  with Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine strategy
  bundle to increase HPV vaccine initiation and completion in a specialty clinic setting.
  STUDY DESIGN: Our Hematology clinic utilized an implementation framework from October
  1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, involving nurses, nursing coordinators, and clinicians
  in administering the HPV vaccination series to our adolescent sickle cell sample
  of nearly 500 patients. The bundle included education for staff on the need for
  HPV vaccine administration, provider incentives, vaccines offered to patients in
  SCD clinics, and verification of patients' charts of vaccine completion. RESULTS:
  Following the implementation of the bundle, the cumulative incidence of HPV vaccination
  initiation and completion improved from 28% to 46% and 7% to 49%, respectively.
  Both rates remained higher post-implementation as well. HPV vaccination series completion
  was associated with a decreased distance to the healthcare facility, lower state
  deprivation rank, and increased hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Our clinic's implementation
  strategy successfully improved vaccine completion rates among adolescents with SCD
  while continuing to educate staff, patients, and families on the importance of cancer
  prevention among people living with SCD."
