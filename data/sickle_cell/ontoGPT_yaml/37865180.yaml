input_text: "Multi-component Strategy Improves HPV Vaccination Rates among Adolescents
  with Sickle Cell Disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine
  strategy bundle to increase HPV vaccine initiation and completion in a specialty
  clinic setting. STUDY DESIGN: Our Hematology clinic utilized an implementation framework
  from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, involving nurses, nursing coordinators,
  and clinicians in administering the HPV vaccination series to our adolescent sickle
  cell sample of nearly 500 patients. The bundle included education for staff on the
  need for HPV vaccine administration, provider incentives, vaccines offered to patients
  in SCD clinics, and verification of patients' charts of vaccine completion. RESULTS:
  Following the implementation of the bundle, the cumulative incidence of HPV vaccination
  initiation and completion improved from 28% to 46% and 7% to 49%, respectively.
  Both rates remained higher post-implementation as well. HPV vaccination series completion
  was associated with a decreased distance to the healthcare facility, lower state
  deprivation rank, and increased hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Our clinic's implementation
  strategy successfully improved vaccine completion rates among adolescents with SCD
  while continuing to educate staff, patients, and families on the importance of cancer
  prevention among people living with SCD."
