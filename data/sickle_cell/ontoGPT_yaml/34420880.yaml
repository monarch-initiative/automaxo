input_text: 'Alloimmunization in transfused patients with constitutional anemias in
  Norway. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The status of red blood cell alloimmunization
  in patients with constitutional anemias including hemoglobinopathies is not known
  in Norway. The study objective was to investigate the impact of a strategy based
  on phenotype-matching for C, c, E, e, K, Jka, Jkb, Fya, Fyb, S and s on alloimmunization.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed transfusions of 40 patients retrospectively using
  the computerized blood bank management system and medical records; including diagnosis,
  age at start of transfusion therapy, gender, number and age of packed red blood
  cell units transfused, follow-up time, phenotypes of the donors and patients, antigen-negative
  patients exposed to antigen-positive packed red blood cell units, transfusion reactions
  and alloantibody specificities. RESULTS: Forty patients received 5402 packed red
  blood cell units. Alloimmunization frequency was 20 % for the whole group, being
  7%, 25 % and 30 % in patients with sickle cell disease (n = 14), thalassemia (n
  = 16) and other conditions (n = 10), respectively. The alloantibodies detected were
  anti-E, -c, -C, -Cw, -K, -Jka and -Lua. CONCLUSION: Good communication between the
  clinicians and the transfusion services is essential for successful management of
  patients with constitutional anemias. Providing full phenotype-matched units was
  not always possible. Extended pheno-/genotyping before the first transfusion and
  providing antigen-negative units for antigen-negative patients for at least C, c,
  E and K in every red cell transfusion would probably have reduced the alloimmunization
  rate. Non-phenotype-matched transfusions seem to be the main reason for alloimmunization.
  Finding markers for identifying responders prone to alloimmunization will ensure
  targeted transfusion strategies.'
