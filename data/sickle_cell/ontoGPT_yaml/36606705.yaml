input_text: 'Intranasal fentanyl and discharge from the emergency department among
  children with sickle cell disease and vaso-occlusive pain: A multicenter pediatric
  emergency medicine perspective. Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) commonly
  experience vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE) due to sickling of erythrocytes, which
  often requires care in the emergency department. Our objective was to assess the
  use and impact of intranasal fentanyl for the treatment of children with SCD-VOE
  on discharge from the emergency department in a multicenter study. We conducted
  a cross-sectional study at 20 academic pediatric emergency departments in the United
  States and Canada. We used logistic regression to test bivariable and multivariable
  associations between the outcome of discharge from the emergency department and
  candidate variables theoretically associated with discharge. The study included
  400 patients; 215 (54%) were female. The median age was 14.6 (interquartile range
  9.8, 17.6) years. Nineteen percent (n = 75) received intranasal fentanyl in the
  emergency department. Children who received intranasal fentanyl had nearly nine-fold
  greater adjusted odds of discharge from the emergency department compared to those
  who did not (adjusted odds ratio 8.99, 95% CI 2.81-30.56, p < .001). The rapid onset
  of action and ease of delivery without intravenous access offered by intranasal
  fentanyl make it a feasible initial parenteral analgesic in the treatment of children
  with SCD presenting with VOE in the acute-care setting. Further study is needed
  to determine potential causality of the association between intranasal fentanyl
  and discharge from the emergency department observed in this multicenter study.'
