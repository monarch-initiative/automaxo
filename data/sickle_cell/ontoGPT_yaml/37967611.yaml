input_text: Pulmonary Hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD)
  is a complex genetic disorder that has long challenged both patients and healthcare
  professionals. One of its chronic and debilitating complications is pulmonary hypertension
  (PH). SCD-associated PH is often post-capillary, secondary to left heart disease.
  It can also sometimes be pre-capillary with multiple and often interrelated mechanisms
  including obstructive remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed secondary to hemolysis,
  endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, hypoxia, or associated risk factors like portal
  hypertension. Screening symptomatic patients with echocardiographic signs of PH
  is crucial to determine those who should undergo right heart catheterization, the
  cornerstone exam to diagnose and categorize patients with PH. The workup following
  the diagnosis relies on identifying the cause of PH to personalize treatment. Ongoing
  efforts are made to treat this complex condition, starting with treating the underlying
  disease with hydroxyurea or chronic blood exchange transfusion. Robust data on the
  efficacy of PAH-specific therapies are lacking in this specific population. Initiation
  of such therapies must be made by an expert center after a case-by-case assessment
  of the benefit-risk ratio according to the phenotype and the mechanisms involved
  in the development of PH. Efforts are also poured into studying the interventional
  and medical therapies used on chronic thromboembolic PH for patients presenting
  with a thrombotic form. The management of those patients requires a multidisciplinary
  approach, with conjoint efforts from PH and SCD specialists.
