input_text: 'Heme Causes Pain in Sickle Mice via Toll-Like Receptor 4-Mediated Reactive
  Oxygen Species- and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Glial Activation. Aims:
  Lifelong pain is a hallmark feature of sickle cell disease (SCD). How sickle pathobiology
  evokes pain remains unknown. We hypothesize that increased cell-free heme due to
  ongoing hemolysis activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to the formation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Together,
  these processes lead to spinal microglial activation and neuroinflammation, culminating
  in acute and chronic pain. Results: Spinal heme levels, TLR4 transcripts, oxidative
  stress, and ER stress were significantly higher in sickle mice than controls. In
  vitro, TLR4 inhibition in spinal cord microglial cells attenuated heme-induced ROS
  and ER stress. Heme treatment led to a time-dependent increase in the characteristic
  features of sickle pain (mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia) in both sickle and
  control mice; this effect was absent in TLR4-knockout sickle and control mice. TLR4
  deletion in sickle mice attenuated chronic and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-evoked
  acute hyperalgesia. Sickle mice treated with the TLR4 inhibitor resatorvid; selective
  small-molecule inhibitor of TLR4 (TAK242) had significantly reduced chronic hyperalgesia
  and had less severe H/R-evoked acute pain with quicker recovery. Notably, reducing
  ER stress with salubrinal ameliorated chronic hyperalgesia in sickle mice. Innovation:
  Our findings demonstrate the causal role of free heme in the genesis of acute and
  chronic sickle pain and suggest that TLR4 and/or ER stress are novel therapeutic
  targets for treating pain in SCD. Conclusion: Heme-induced microglial activation
  via TLR4 in the central nervous system contributes to the initiation and maintenance
  of sickle pain via ER stress in SCD. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 34, 279-293.'
