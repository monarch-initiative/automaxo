input_text: "For which diseases do broader value elements matter most? An evaluation
  across 20 ICER evidence reports. BACKGROUND: U.S. value framework developers such
  as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) use cost-effectiveness
  analysis to value new health care technologies. Often, these value assessment frameworks
  use a health system perspective without fully accounting for societal and broader
  benefits and costs of an intervention. Although there is ongoing debate about the
  most appropriate methods for including broader value elements in value assessment,
  it remains unclear whether the inclusion of these value elements is likely to affect
  the quantitative estimates of treatment value. OBJECTIVE: To assess variations in
  the relevance of broader value elements to cost-effectiveness analysis across diseases.
  METHODS: Thirty-two broader value elements (e.g., caregiver burden, health equity,
  real option value, productivity) not traditionally included in health technology
  assessments were identified through a targeted literature review. Evidence reports
  published by ICER between July 2017 and January 2020 were evaluated to identify
  which broader value elements were discussed as relevant to each disease in the report
  text. The study examined whether there were associations among ICER's discussion
  of broader value elements, rare disease status, treatment cost, estimated treatment
  cost-effectiveness, and ICER committee voting results for contextual considerations
  and additional benefits/disadvantages. RESULTS: The most commonly cited broader
  value element category in the ICER evidence reports was household and leisure (e.g.,
  absenteeism from normal activities and caregiver burden). More value elements were
  cited for inherited retinal disease (19 elements) and sickle cell disease (18 elements)
  than for other diseases. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes had the fewest number
  of value elements cited (7 elements). Rare diseases were more likely to have broader
  value elements cited compared with nonrare diseases (15.9 vs. 11.5, P < 0.001).
  Treatments with higher (i.e., less favorable) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
  were more likely to have a greater number of broader value elements cited (rho =
  0.625, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of broader value elements varied across
  diseases, with less cost-effective treatments more likely to have a higher number
  of relevant broader value elements. Inclusion of all relevant value elements in
  value assessments will more appropriately incentivize innovation and improve allocation
  of research funding. DISCLOSURES: This study was sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceutical
  Corporation. At the time of this study, Shafrin was employed by PRECISIONheor, a
  consultancy to the life sciences industry that received financial support from Novartis
  to conduct this study. Dennen, Pednekar, and Birch are employed by PRECISIONheor.
  Bhor was an employee of Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation at the time this research
  was conducted and manuscript was developed and reports grants from Novartis, unrelated
  to this work. Kanter has served on scientific advisory boards and steering committees
  for and reports receiving consulting fees from Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation
  and is a site principal investigator on studies funded by Novartis Pharmaceutical
  Corporation. Kantar also reports support from Sickle Cell Disease Association of
  America Inc. and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, unrelated to this work.
  Neumann reports advisory boards or consulting fees from Novartis Pharmaceutical
  Corporation and PRECISIONheor, as well as advisory boards or consulting fees unrelated
  to this study from AbbVie, Amgen, Avexis, Bayer, Congressional Budget Office, Janssen,
  Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Precision Health Economics, Veritech, Vertex; funding
