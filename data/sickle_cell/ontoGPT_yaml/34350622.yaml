input_text: Patient-reported neurocognitive symptoms influence instrumental activities
  of daily living in sickle cell disease. Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  experience neurocognitive decline, low medication adherence, increased unemployment,
  and difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). The relationship
  between self-perceived cognitive difficulties and IADLs, including employment, school
  enrollment, independence, engagement in leisure activities, and medication adherence
  is unknown. We hypothesized that self-reported difficulties across neurocognitive
  areas would predict lower IADL skills. Adolescent and adult participants of the
  multi-site Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) (n = 2436) completed
  patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of attention, executive functioning, processing
  speed, learning, and comprehension. Cognitive symptoms were analyzed as predictors
  in multivariable modeling. Outcome variables included 1) an IADL composite that
  consisted of employment, participation in school, reliance on others, and leisure
  pursuits, and 2) hydroxyurea adherence. Participants reported cognitive difficulty
  across areas of attention (55%), executive functioning (51%), processing speed (57%),
  and reading comprehension (65%). Executive dysfunction (p < 0.001) and sometimes
  or often experiencing learning difficulties (p < 0.001 and p = 0.04) and poor comprehension
  (p = 0.000 and p = 0.001), controlled for age (p < 0.001), pain (p < 0.001), and
  hydroxyurea use (p = 0.001), were associated with poor IADL skills. Executive functioning
  difficulties (p = 0.021), controlled for age (p = 0.013 for ages 25-34), genotype
  (p = 0.001), and hemoglobin (p = 0.004), predicted hydroxyurea non-adherence. Analysis
  of PRO measures indicated that cognitive dysfunction is prevalent in adolescents
  and adults with SCD. Cognitive dysfunction translated into clinically meaningful
  outcomes. PRO of cognitive symptoms can be used as an important adjunct clinical
  tool to monitor symptoms that impact functional skills, including engagement in
  societal activities and medication adherence.
