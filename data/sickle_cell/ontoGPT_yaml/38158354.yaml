input_text: 'Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Assessment of Long-Term Intra-Abdominal Organ
  Changes in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia during Steady State: A Comparative Study.BACKGROUND:
  Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disorder with global prevalence,
  including in Nigeria. Despite advancements in SCA care management, understanding
  the long-term impact on organs during steady state has remained inconclusive. AIM:
  This study aimed to investigate the long-term changes in intra-abdominal organs
  of SCA children compared with non-SCA children during steady state using two-dimensional
  ultrasound assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 116 children (58 SCA and
  58 controls) were enrolled between June 2021 and July 2022. Clinico-demographic
  data were collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Two-dimensional
  ultrasound was used to measure the liver, spleen, kidneys, and inferior vena cava
  in all subjects. Age-matched controls had AA or AS genotypes. RESULTS: Of the 58
  patients with SCA, 65.5% were males with an overall mean age of 8.1   3.4 years,
  while among the non-SCA cohort (n = 58), 48.3% were males with an overall mean age
  of 8.7   3.9 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the age
  and gender distribution between the SCA and non-SCA cohorts (P = 0.390 and P = 0.091,
  respectively). SCA subjects had a larger mean hepatic size than non-SCA subjects
  (12.09 cm   2.23 vs. 11.67 cm   1.96; P = 0.276) but smaller mean splenic size (8.01
  cm   1.89 vs. 8.19 cm   1.61; P = 0.577) and inferior vena cava diameter (1.16 cm   0.29
  vs. 1.25 cm   0.33; P = 0.100). Left kidney length and breadth were significantly
  greater in SCA patients (8.91   1.16 vs. 8.27   1.30; P = 0.006 and 4.15   0.92
  vs. 3.79   0.48; P = 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the
  utility of two-dimensional ultrasound assessment in monitoring intra-abdominal organ
  changes in SCA children, suggesting its cost-effective benefits in monitoring health
  outcomes in SCA patients.'
