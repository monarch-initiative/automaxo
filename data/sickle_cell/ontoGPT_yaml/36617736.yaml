input_text: Assessing barriers and facilitators to transition in sickle cell disease
  care prior to implementation of a formalized program. Over 95% of children with
  sickle cell disease (SCD) survive into adulthood in the United States. However,
  early mortality remains a problem, especially in persons between the ages of 18
  and 35. One possible explanation for the increased mortality rate in young adults
  is difficulties in engaging in care during the transition from a heavily contiguous
  pediatric healthcare model to a more self-reliant adult healthcare model. The goal
  of this study was to identify potential facilitators and barriers to a successful
  transfer in care from the pediatric to adult SCD program before the formation of
  a formal transition program. This is a retrospective cohort study of transition
  outcomes for 472 individuals with SCD (all genotypes) treated at the University
  of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) sickle cell clinic (aged 18-24). The primary outcome
  was whether the patient continued care in (any) adult SCD program (defined as being
  seen at least once in an adult hematology/SCD clinic). One hundred eighty-eight
  (45%) transition age patients successfully transferred to adult care. Facilitators
  to successful transfer in care included being treated at the same hospital for both
  pediatric and adult programs, having the genotype HbSS, and/or receiving an SCD-modifying
  therapy at the time of transition (hydroxyurea and/or red cell transfusion therapy).
  Of primary interest, many of the patients who failed to transition to an adult clinic
  were lost to follow-up prior to 15 years of age. Importantly, these patients who
  had previously been labeled as "transition failures," were lost to follow-up long
  before the transition age. Early engagement is needed for this population.
