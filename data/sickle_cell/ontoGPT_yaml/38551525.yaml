input_text: 'Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction-based quantitation of therapeutic
  lentiviral vector copies in transduced hematopoietic stem cells. BACKGROUND AIMS:
  Gene therapy using lentiviral vectors (LVs) that harbor a functional beta-globin
  gene provides a curative treatment for hemoglobinopathies including beta-thalassemia
  and sickle cell disease. Accurate quantification of the vector copy number (VCN)
  and/or the proportion of transduced cells is critical to evaluate the efficacy of
  transduction and stability of the transgene during treatment. Moreover, commonly
  used techniques for LV quantification, including real-time quantitative polymerase
  chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence-activated cell sorting, require either a standard
  curve or expression of a reporter protein for the detection of transduced cells.
  In the present study, we describe a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) technique to measure
  the lentiviral VCN in transduced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).
  METHODS: After HSPCs were transduced with an LV encoding the therapeutic beta-globin
  (betaA-T87Q) gene, the integrated lentiviral sequence in the host genome was amplified
  with primers that targeted a sequence within the vector and the human RPP30 gene.
  The dynamic range of ddPCR was between 5 x 10-3 ng and 5 x 10-6 ng of target copy
  per reaction. RESULTS: We found that the ddPCR-based approach was able to estimate
  VCN with high sensitivity and a low standard deviation. Furthermore, ddPCR-mediated
  quantitation of lentiviral copy numbers in differentiated erythroblasts correlated
  with the level of betaA-T87Q protein detected by reverse-phase high-performance
  liquid chromatography. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the ddPCR technique has the
  potential to precisely detect LV copy numbers in the host genome, which can be used
  for VCN estimation, calculation of infectious titer and multiplicity of infection
  for HSPC transduction in a clinical setting.'
