input_text: "Distribution of Emergency Department Encounters and Subsequent Hospital
  Admissions for Children by Child Opportunity Index.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences
  in emergency department (ED) utilization and subsequent admission among children
  by Child Opportunity Index (COI). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study
  of pediatric (<18 years) encounters to 194 EDs in Illinois from 2016 to 2020. Each
  encounter was assigned to quntiles of COI 2.0 by postal code. We described the difference
  in the percent of encounters between lower (Very Low and Low) and higher (Very High
  and High) COI overall and among diagnoses with overrepresentation from lower COI
  groups. We evaluated the association of diagnosis with COI in ordinal models adjusted
  for demographics. RESULTS: There were 4,653,026 eligible ED encounters classified
  by COI as Very Low (28.6%), Low (24.8%), Moderate (20.3%), High (15.6%), and Very
  High (10.8%) (difference between low and high COI encounters 27.0%). Diagnoses with
  the greatest difference between low and high COI were eye infection, upper respiratory
  tract infections, and cough. The COI distribution for children admitted from the
  ED (n = 140,298) was 29.1% Very Low, 19.3% Low, 18.2% Moderate, 17.7% High, and
  15.7% Very High (percent difference 15.1%). Diagnoses with the greatest differences
  between low and high COI among admitted patients were sickle cell crisis, asthma,
  and influenza. All ED diagnoses and 7/12 admission diagnoses were associated with
  lower COI in multivariable ordinal models. CONCLUSIONS: Children from lower COI
  areas are overrepresented in ED and inpatient encounters overall and within certain
  diagnosis groups. Further research is required to examine how health outcomes may
  be influenced by the structural and contextual characteristics of a child's neighborhood."
