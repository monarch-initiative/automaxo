input_text: 'Mortality and Access to Kidney Transplantation in Patients with Sickle
  Cell Disease-Associated Kidney Failure. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with
  sickle cell disease-associated kidney failure have high mortality, which might be
  lowered by kidney transplantation. However, because they show higher post-transplant
  mortality compared with patients with other kidney failure etiologies, kidney transplantation
  remains controversial in this population, potentially limiting their chance of receiving
  transplantation. We aimed to quantify the decrease in mortality associated with
  transplantation in this population and determine the chance of receiving transplantation
  with sickle cell disease as the cause of kidney failure as compared with other etiologies
  of kidney failure. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using a national
  registry, we studied all adults with kidney failure who began maintenance dialysis
  or were added to the kidney transplant waiting list in 1998-2017. To quantify the
  decrease in mortality associated with transplantation, we measured the absolute
  risk difference and hazard ratio for mortality in matched pairs of transplant recipients
  versus waitlisted candidates in the sickle cell and control groups. To compare the
  chance of receiving transplantation, we estimated hazard ratios for receiving transplantation
  in the sickle cell and control groups, treating death as a competing risk. RESULTS:
  Compared with their matched waitlisted candidates, 189 transplant recipients with
  sickle cell disease and 220,251 control recipients showed significantly lower mortality.
  The absolute risk difference at 10 years post-transplant was 20.3 (98.75% confidence
  interval, 0.9 to 39.8) and 19.8 (98.75% confidence interval, 19.2 to 20.4) percentage
  points in the sickle cell and control groups, respectively. The hazard ratio was
  also similar in the sickle cell (0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.91) and
  control (0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.55) groups (interaction P=0.8).
  Nonetheless, the sickle cell group was less likely to receive transplantation than
  the controls (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.61
  to 0.87). Similar disparities were found among waitlisted candidates (subdistribution
  hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: Patients
  with sickle cell disease-associated kidney failure exhibited similar decreases in
  mortality associated with kidney transplantation as compared with those with other
  kidney failure etiologies. Nonetheless, the sickle cell population was less likely
  to receive transplantation, even after waitlist registration.'
