input_text: 'Progression of central nervous system disease from pediatric to young
  adulthood in sickle cell anemia.Silent cerebral infarcts and arteriopathy are common
  and progressive in individuals with sickle cell anemia. However, most data describing
  brain lesions in sickle cell anemia are cross-sectional or derive from pediatric
  cohorts with short follow-up. We investigated the progression of silent cerebral
  infarct and cerebral vessel stenosis on brain MRI and MRA, respectively, by describing
  the incidence of new or worsening lesions over a period of up to 25 years among
  young adults with sickle cell anemia and explored risk factors for progression.
  Forty-four adults with sickle cell anemia (HbSS or HbSbeta0thalassemia), exposed
  to chronic transfusions (n = 12) or hydroxyurea (n = 32), median age 19.2 years
  (range 18.0-31.5), received a screening brain MRI/MRA and their results were compared
  with a clinical exam performed during childhood and adolescence. We used exact log-rank
  test to compare MRI and MRA progression among any two groups. The hazard ratio (HR)
  and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated from Cox regression analyses. Progression
  of MRI and MRA occurred in 12 (27%) and 4 (9%) young adults, respectively, relative
  to their pediatric exams. MRI progression risk was high among participants with
  abnormal pediatric exams (HR: 11.6, 95% CI: 2.5-54.7) and conditional or abnormal
  transcranial Doppler ultrasound velocities (HR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0-15.1). Among individuals
  treated with hydroxyurea, high fetal hemoglobin measured in childhood was associated
  with lower hazard of MRI progression (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98). MRA progression
  occurred more frequently among those with prior stroke (HR: 8.6, 95% CI: 1.2-64),
  abnormal pediatric exam (P = 0.00084), and elevated transcranial Doppler ultrasound
  velocities (P = 0.004). Brain MRI/MRA imaging in pediatrics can identify high-risk
  patients for CNS disease progression in young adulthood, prompting consideration
  for early aggressive treatments.'
