input_text: '[Acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease]. The acute chest syndrome
  is a frequent complication in patients with sickle cell disease. It results from
  the occlusion of pulmonary capillaries and complex pathophysiological mechanisms.
  The diagnosis of an acute chest syndrome includes bilateral infiltrates on x-ray,
  along with fever or respiratory symptoms. The appropriate medical treatment includes
  hydration, analgesics, oxygen, broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover atypical bacteria
  and transfusions or exchange transfusion.'
