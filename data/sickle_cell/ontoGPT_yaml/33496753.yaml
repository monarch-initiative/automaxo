input_text: A systematic review of quality of life in sickle cell disease and thalassemia
  after stem cell transplant or gene therapy. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
  and thalassemia experience several complications across their lifespan that lead
  to impairment in different health-related quality of life (HRQOL) domains. There
  is increasing interest in curative therapies for patients with SCD and thalassemia,
  including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and gene therapy; however, the
  effect of these therapies on various HRQOL domains remains unclear. Our objective
  was to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence for the effect of HSCT and
  gene therapy on HRQOL in patients with SCD and thalassemia. A systematic search
  of medical literature databases was conducted. A total of 16 studies (thalassemia,
  n = 9; SCD, n = 6; both, n = 1) involving 517 participants met inclusion criteria
  (thalassemia, n = 416; SCD, n = 101). HSCT was associated with a small to large
  positive effects in most HRQOL domains (Cohen's d; mean = 0.47; median = 0.37; range,
  0.27-2.05). In thalassemia, HSCT was frequently associated with large positive effects
  in physical and emotional HRQOL domains (median d = 0.79 and d = 0.57, respectively).
  In SCD, HSCT was associated with large positive effects in all HRQOL domains. Emerging
  data suggest improvement in HRQOL outcomes across different domains following gene
  therapy in thalassemia and SCD. The quality of evidence was moderate in 13 studies
  (81%). HSCT has a positive impact on several HRQOL domains in patients with SCD
  and thalassemia; however, more longitudinal studies are warranted to assess the
  sustainability of these effects. Reporting HRQOL outcomes from ongoing gene therapy
  or gene-editing trials in SCD and thalassemia is key to better understand the benefits
  of such therapies.
