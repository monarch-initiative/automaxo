input_text: 'Improved Quality of Life of Patients With Sickle Cell Disease after Allogeneic
  Stem Cell Transplant: Another Indication for Transplant. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell
  disease (SCD) is frequently inherited worldwide. The severity of SCD ranges from
  mild to severe, and the disease involves multiple complications, including pulmonary
  hypertension, stroke, recurrent vaso-occlusive crises, end-organ damage, and an
  increased mortality risk. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is
  a potentially curative option for patients with SCD. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The
  objective was to assess the quality of life of adolescent and adult patients with
  SCD receiving HCT pre-and post-transplant. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional
  study was conducted. Patients with SCD with at least one year of follow-up after
  HCT were interviewed to assess their quality of life pre-and post-transplant. This
  study was conducted at the Transplant Center of King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh.
  The participants were identified through non-probability consecutive sampling. The
  FACT-G questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life domains. RESULTS: Thirty-one
  patients were included. The median age of the respondents was 32 +- 6.3 years, and
  16 were male (51.6%). The most frequent indication for stem cell transplantation
  (58%) was a vaso-occlusive crisis. The mean FACT-G scores pre- and post-transplantation
  were 55.2 +- 18.17 and 91 +- 14.58, respectively. The mean number of annual ER visits
  was significantly reduced from 27.3 pre-transplant to 6.6 post-transplant (P-value
  = 0.006). Of the respondents, 51.6% experienced no severe complications post-transplantation,
  and most (93.5%) reported improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: HCT significantly
  improved the quality of life of adult patients with SCD, with improvements in most
  FACT-G score domains. Although it was not measured by the FACT-G, the frequency
  of ER visits and hospital admissions were reduced significantly post-transplant,
  reflecting an improvement in the quality of life and a reduction in the cost of
  therapy for patients with SCD.'
