input_text: How We Treat Sickle Cell Disease in Pregnancy. 50 years ago, people with
  sickle cell disease (SCD) were discouraged from becoming pregnant, but now most
  should be supported if they choose to pursue a pregnancy. They and their providers,
  however, should be aware of the physiological changes of pregnancy that aggravate
  SCD and pregnancy's unique maternal and fetal challenges. Any maternal endothelial
  damage from a poorly perfused placenta has the potential for being superimposed
  on the endothelial damage of SCD. The immunological and mechanical changes of pregnancy
  contribute to an increased susceptibility to certain infections. Activation of the
  complement system and increased neutrophils may contribute to the increase in vaso-occlusive
  crises during pregnancy. There is an increased demand for red cell mass that is
  often not achievable without transfusion. Cardiac output increases by 45%. The anatomic
  and physiologic changes of pregnancy increase the risk of kidney injury. Pregnancy
  is a hypercoagulable state which confers an increased risk of thrombosis. Maternal
  problems can arise from chronic underlying organ dysfunction such as renal disease
  or pulmonary hypertension, from acute complications of SCD such as acute anemia,
  vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome, and/or from pregnancy-related complications
  such as preeclampsia, sepsis, severe anemia, thromboembolism and need for cesarean
  delivery. Fetal problems include alloimmunization, opioid exposure, fetal growth
  restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. Prior to and during pregnancy, in
  addition to the assessment and care that every pregnant patient should receive,
  patients with SCD should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team with
  respect to their unique maternal and fetal issues.
