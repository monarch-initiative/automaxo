input_text: 'Creating an Automated Contemporaneous Cohort in Sickle Cell Anemia to
  Predict Survival After Disease-Modifying Therapy. For participants receiving experimental
  gene therapy or gene editing clinical trials, the FDA requires contemporaneous controls
  to compare clinical outcomes. However, developing a contemporaneous cohort of rare
  diseases is costly and requires multiple person-hours. In a single referral center
  for sickle cell disease, we tested the hypothesis that we could create an automated
  contemporaneous cohort of children and adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA) to predict
  mortality. Data were obtained between 1/1/2004 and 4/30/2021. We identified 419
  individuals with SCA with consistent medical care (i.e., followed continuously for
  >0.5 years with no visit gaps >=3.0 years). The median age was 10.2 years (IQR 1.0
  - 24.0 years), with a median follow-up of 7.4 years (IQR 3.6-13.5 years) and 47
  deaths. A total of 98% (274 of 277) of the children remained alive at 18 years of
  age, and 34.3% (94 of 274) of those children were followed into adulthood. For adults,
  the median age of survival was 49.3 years of age. Treatment groups were mutually
  exclusive and in a hierarchical order: hematopoietic stem cell transplant (n=22)>regular
  blood transfusion for at least two years (n=56)>hydroxyurea for at least one year
  (n=243)>no disease-modifying therapy (n=98). Compared to those receiving no disease-modifying
  treatment, those treated with hydroxyurea therapy had significantly lower hazard
  of mortality (hazard ratio=0.38, p=0.016), but no statistical difference for those
  receiving regular blood transfusions compared to no disease-modifying therapy (hazard
  ratio=0.71, p=0.440). An automated contemporaneous SCA cohort can be generated to
  estimate mortality in children and adults with SCA.'
