input_text: 'Non-pharmacological pain interventions for sickle cell crisis in pediatrics:
  A scoping review. PROBLEM: Sickle cell crises (SCC) are recurrent, severe pain episodes
  experienced by people living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Non-pharmacological
  interventions have been recommended for SCC pain management however, little is known
  about the impact of these interventions on SCC pain. This scoping review aims to
  systematically identify evidence on the use and effectiveness of non-pharmacological
  interventions for pain management during SCC in the pediatric population. ELIGIBILITY
  CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they are published in English and focusing on
  the use of any non-pharmacological interventions on pain during SCC in pediatric
  patients. Nine databases were searched including Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo.
  Also, the reference lists of relevant studies were searched. SAMPLE: The database
  searching yielded 1517 studies. After the title and abstract screening, 1348 studies
  were excluded, and 169 full texts were retrieved and screened. One study was identified
  through handsearching. Finally, 27 articles were included in this scoping review.
  RESULTS: Across all studies, 27 different non-pharmacological interventions were
  identified. There were inconsistent results regarding the effectiveness of virtual
  reality, guided imagery, and cognitive-behavioral interventions in experimental
  studies. The most common interventions used at home were prayer, massage, and distraction.
  The main interventions used in hospitals were prayer and fluid intake, but this
  was explored by a few studies. CONCLUSION: Pediatric SCD patients use numerous non-pharmacological
  interventions to manage pain during SCC. However, the impact of many interventions
  on SCC pain has not been empirically investigated. IMPLICATIONS: Further research
  is necessary to establish the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions
  on SCC pain.'
