input_text: Microfluidic electrical impedance assessment of red blood cell-mediated
  microvascular occlusion.Alterations in the deformability of red blood cells (RBCs),
  occurring in hemolytic blood disorders such as sickle cell disease (SCD), contribute
  to vaso-occlusion and disease pathophysiology. There are few functional in vitro
  assays for standardized assessment of RBC-mediated microvascular occlusion. Here,
  we present the design, fabrication, and clinical testing of the Microfluidic Impedance
  Red Cell Assay (MIRCA) with embedded capillary network-based micropillar arrays
  and integrated electrical impedance measurement electrodes to address this need.
  The micropillar arrays consist of microcapillaries ranging from 12 mum to 3 mum,
  with each array paired with two sputtered gold electrodes to measure the impedance
  change of the array before and after sample perfusion through the microfluidic device.
  We define RBC occlusion index (ROI) and RBC electrical impedance index (REI), which
  represent the cumulative percentage occlusion and cumulative percentage impedance
  change, respectively. We demonstrate the promise of MIRCA in two common red cell
  disorders, SCD and hereditary spherocytosis. We show that the electrical impedance
  measurement reflects the microvascular occlusion, where REI significantly correlates
  with ROI that is obtained via high-resolution microscopy imaging of the microcapillary
  arrays. Further, we show that RBC-mediated microvascular occlusion, represented
  by ROI and REI, associates with clinical treatment outcomes and correlates with
  in vivo hemolytic biomarkers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and absolute reticulocyte
  count (ARC) in SCD. Impedance measurement obviates the need for high-resolution
  imaging, enabling future translation of this technology for widespread access, portable
  and point-of-care use. Our findings suggest that the presented microfluidic design
  and the integrated electrical impedance measurement provide a reproducible functional
  test for standardized assessment of RBC-mediated microvascular occlusion. MIRCA
  and the newly defined REI may serve as an in vitro therapeutic efficacy benchmark
  for assessing the clinical outcome of emerging RBC-modifying targeted and curative
  therapies.
