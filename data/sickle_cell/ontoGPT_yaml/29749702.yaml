input_text: Management of severe chronic pain with methadone in pediatric patients
  with sickle cell disease. Vasocclusive pain crises are common among pediatric patients
  with sickle cell disease (SCD). Some patients with repeated pain crises develop
  chronic pain. We performed a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients with
  SCD with chronic pain treated with methadone. We identified a significant reduction
  in pain hospitalizations following methadone treatment (0.35 +- 0.19 vs. 0.19 +-
  0.17 hospitalizations/month, P = 0.016). In addition, we did not observe overt organ
  toxicity nor symptoms of opioid withdrawal during methadone wean. We suggest that
  methadone is safe and has some clinical benefit, which should be proven in prospective
  randomized trials for pediatric patients with SCD and chronic pain.
