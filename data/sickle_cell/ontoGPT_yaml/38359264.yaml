input_text: 'Hematopoietic stem cell collection for sickle cell disease gene therapy.
  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gene therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD) is advancing rapidly,
  with two transformative products recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
  and numerous others under study. All current gene therapy protocols require ex vivo
  modification of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, several SCD-related
  problems impair HSC collection, including a stressed and damaged bone marrow, potential
  cytotoxicity by the major therapeutic drug hydroxyurea, and inability to use granulocyte
  colony stimulating factor, which can precipitate severe vaso-occlusive events. RECENT
  FINDINGS: Peripheral blood mobilization of HSCs using the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor
  followed by apheresis collection was recently shown to be safe and effective for
  most SCD patients and is the current strategy for mobilizing HSCs. However, exceptionally
  large numbers of HSCs are required to manufacture an adequate cellular product,
  responses to plerixafor are variable, and most patients require multiple mobilization
  cycles, increasing the risk for adverse events. For some, gene therapy is prohibited
  by the failure to obtain adequate numbers of HSCs. SUMMARY: Here we review the current
  knowledge on HSC collection from individuals with SCD and potential improvements
  that may enhance the safety, efficacy, and availability of gene therapy for this
  disorder.'
