input_text: "Preliminary evaluation of the clinical implementation of cognitive-behavioral
  therapy for chronic pain management in pediatric sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVES:
  Evaluate the implementation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for chronic pain
  in a clinical setting by comparing youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) who initiated
  or did not initiate CBT. DESIGN: Youth with SCD (ages 6-18; n = 101) referred for
  CBT for chronic pain were compared based on therapy attendance: Established Care;
  Early Termination; or Comparison (i.e., did not initiate CBT). SETTING: Outpatient
  pediatric psychology and comprehensive SCD clinics in 3 locations at a southeastern
  children's hospital. INTERVENTIONS: CBT delivery was standardized. Treatment plans
  were tailored to meet individualized needs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare utilization
  included pain-related inpatient admissions, total inpatient days, and emergency
  department reliance (EDR) at 12-months pre-post CBT. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
  included typical pain intensity, functional disability, and coping efficacy pre-post
  treatment. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, genotype, and hydroxyurea, early terminators
  of CBT had increased rates of admissions and hospital days over time relative to
  comparisons; those who established care had faster reduction in admissions and hospital
  days over time relative to comparisons. EDR decreased by 0.08 over time for Established
  Care and reduced by 0.01 for every 1 completed session. Patients who completed pre-
  and post-treatment PROs reported decreases in typical pain intensity, functional
  disability, and improved coping efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Establishing CBT care may
  support reductions in admissions for pain, length of stay, and EDR for youth with
  chronic SCD pain, which may be partially supported by patient-reported improvements
  in functioning, coping, and lower pain intensity following CBT. Enhancing clinical
  implementation of multidisciplinary treatments may optimize the health of these
  youth."
