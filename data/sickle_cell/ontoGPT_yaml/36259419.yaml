input_text: 'Spleen size in homozygous sickle cell disease: trends in a birth cohort
  using ultrasound.OBJECTIVES: To provide ultrasound baselines for spleen length in
  homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) and in normal controls with a HbAA genotype.
  METHODS: The Jamaican cohort study identified 311 babies with HbSS and 246 matched
  HbAA controls during the screening of 100,000 consecutive deliveries in Kingston,
  Jamaica from 1973 to 1981. Ultrasonography commenced in 1988 when the youngest patients
  were aged 6 years at which time deaths, emigrations and default had reduced the
  numbers to 206 HbSS and 89 controls. It continued annually until 2000. RESULTS:
  The spleen was visualized in all HbAA controls but in only 1103/2138 (52%) scans
  in HbSS. Where available, mean splenic lengths were significantly lower in HbSS
  (77-103 mm in males, 70-83 mm in females) compared to normal controls (89-101 mm
  in males, 86-95 mm in females). Assessed by statistical modelling after adjusting
  for body height, the splenic ratio (splenic length/body height) declined over the
  age range 12-20 years in HbSS, consistent with progressive splenic fibrosis. Genetic
  factors known to inhibit sickling, alpha thalassemia and fetal hemoglobin level
  (HbF) significantly reduced the decline in splenic ratio. Clinical splenomegaly
  was an insensitive measure of splenic enlargement as only 50% of patients aged 18
  years and above with spleens measuring >=150 mm on ultrasonography had palpable
  spleens. CONCLUSIONS: An age-related decline in splenic length occurred in HbSS
  and occurred more slowly with genetic factors known to inhibit sickling. The standards
  provided may be of value in assessing minor degrees of subclinical acute splenic
  sequestration. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: These are the first standards available for
  splenic length in HbSS. They may be useful in detecting red cell sequestration,
  not apparent from clinical splenomegaly and also provide a model for identifying
  factors inhibiting vaso-occlusion.'
