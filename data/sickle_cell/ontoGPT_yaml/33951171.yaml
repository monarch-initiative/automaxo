input_text: "Occlusal Disorders in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease: Critical Literature
  Review.OBJECTIVE: To identify the association of occlusal disorders in patients
  with sickle cell disease (SCD). STUDY DESIGN: A literature review was conducted,
  and articles published between 2010 and 2019 were searched on Bireme and PubMed
  websites and in MEDLINE and LILACS databases, in English, Portuguese, and Spanish,
  using the keywords \"malocclusion,\" \"sickle cell disease,\" and \"cephalometry,\"\
  \ combined by Boolean operators AND and OR. One of the criteria for the selection
  of articles was the presence of adolescents in the sample. This methodology followed
  the PRISMA recommendations. Seventy-nine articles were found, seven of which were
  included in the review as they met the inclusion criteria and the study goals. RESULTS:
  The prevalence of malocclusion in SCD patients ranged from 62.9% to 100%, which
  was considered very severe in 30.1% to 80.6%. The most common occlusal changes were
  Angle's class II malocclusion, increased maxillary overjet, and anterior open bite.
  In addition, class II skeletal pattern was the most prevalent due to mandibular
  retrusion. CONCLUSION: Malocclusion prevalence in SCD patients is high and considered
  to be a risk factor, with a significant rate of very severe malocclusion when compared
  to healthy patients."

  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
