  cell disease. BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an inherited autosomal recessive
  blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide.
  Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well
  as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children
  with sickle cell disease. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration,
  oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood
  transfusions may be given. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published
  in 2010 and updated in 2016. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions,
  simple and exchange, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement
  in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched
  The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials
  Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database
  searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference
  proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 30 May 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised
  controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple
  or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle
  cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
  Both authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias, no data
  could be extracted. MAIN RESULTS: One trial was eligible for inclusion in the review.
  While in the multicentre trial 237 people were enrolled (169 SCC, 42 SC, 15 Sbeta0-thalassaemia,
  11Sbeta+-thalassaemia); the majority were recruited to an observational arm and
  only ten participants met the inclusion criteria for randomisation. Of these, four
  were randomised to the transfusion arm and received a single transfusion of 7 to
  13 mL/kg packed red blood cells, and six were randomised to standard care. None
  of the four participants who received packed red blood cells developed acute chest
  syndrome, while 33% (two participants) developed acute chest syndrome in standard
  care arm. No data for any pre-defined outcomes were available. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
  We found only one very small randomised controlled trial; this is not enough to
  make any reliable conclusion to support the use of blood transfusion. Whilst there
  appears to be some indication that chronic blood transfusion may play a roll in
  reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease
  and albeit offering transfusions may be a widely accepted clinical practice, there
  is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the perceived benefits of
  these as treatment options; very limited information about any of the potential
  harms associated with these interventions or indeed guidance that can be used to
  aid clinical decision making. Clinicians should therefore base any treatment decisions
  on a combination of; their clinical experience, individual circumstances and the
  unique characteristics and preferences of adequately informed people with sickle
  cell disease who are suffering with acute chest syndrome. This review highlights
  the need of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness
  of these interventions for the relief of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome in
  people with sickle cell disease."
