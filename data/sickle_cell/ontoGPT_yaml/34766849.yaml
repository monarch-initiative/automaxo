input_text: 'Prevalence of Dark without Pressure and Angioid Streaks in Sickle Cell
  Disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of areas of dark
  without pressure (DWOP) and angioid streaks (AS) in patients with sickle cell disease
  (SCD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a consecutive series of 77 adults with SCD.
  RESULTS: DWOP appeared as multiple patches in 35 of the affected eyes and as a single
  lesion in 3 eyes. OCT finding demonstrated the ellipsoid layer was hyporeflective
  in DWOP. AS were identified in six cases (3.9%) and were bilateral in five cases.
  The prevalence of AS was higher with increasing age, being 67% in the patients older
  than age 45 years. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DWOP in adults with SCD is 25%
  in this study, which is higher than previously reported, and the prevalence of AS
  is around 4%, which is midway between prior estimates. Recognition of the clinical
  examination and imaging features of DWOP reduce the need for additional investigation.
