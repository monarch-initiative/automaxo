input_text: BCL11A enhancer-edited hematopoietic stem cells persist in rhesus monkeys
  without toxicity. Gene editing of the erythroid-specific BCL11A enhancer in hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) induces
  fetal hemoglobin (HbF) without detectable toxicity, as assessed by mouse xenotransplant.
  Here, we evaluated autologous engraftment and HbF induction potential of erythroid-specific
  BCL11A enhancer-edited HSPCs in 4 nonhuman primates. We used a single guide RNA
  (sgRNA) with identical human and rhesus target sequences to disrupt a GATA1 binding
  site at the BCL11A +58 erythroid enhancer. Cas9 protein and sgRNA ribonucleoprotein
  complex (RNP) was electroporated into rhesus HSPCs, followed by autologous infusion
  after myeloablation. We found that gene edits persisted in peripheral blood (PB)
  and bone marrow (BM) for up to 101 weeks similarly for BCL11A enhancer- or control
  locus-targeted (AAVS1-targeted) cells. Biallelic BCL11A enhancer editing resulted
  in robust gamma-globin induction, with the highest levels observed during stress
  erythropoiesis. Indels were evenly distributed across PB and BM lineages. Off-target
  edits were not observed. Nonhomologous end-joining repair alleles were enriched
  in engrafting HSCs. In summary, we found that edited HSCs can persist for at least
  101 weeks after transplant and biallelic-edited HSCs provide substantial HbF levels
  in PB red blood cells, together supporting further clinical translation of this
  approach.
