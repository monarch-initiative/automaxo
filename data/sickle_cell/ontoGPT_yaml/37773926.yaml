input_text: VWF-ADAMTS13 axis dysfunction in children with sickle cell disease treated
  with hydroxyurea versus blood transfusion.Previous studies have reported elevated
  von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and
  demonstrated a key role for the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis in the pathobiology of SCD vaso-occlusion.
  Although blood transfusion is the gold standard for stroke prevention in SCD, the
  biological mechanisms underpinning its improved efficacy compared to hydroxycarbamide
  are not fully understood. We hypothesized that the improved clinical efficacy of
  blood transfusion might relate to differences in endothelial cell activation and
  VWF-ADAMTS13 axis dysfunction. One-hundred-eighty children with a confirmed diagnosis
  of SCD (HbSS) on hydroxycarbamide (n=96) or blood transfusion (n=84) were included.
  Despite disease-modifying treatment, plasma VWF and VWF propeptide were elevated
  in a significant proportion of SCD children (33% and 47% respectively). Crucially,
  all VWF parameters were significantly higher in the hydroxycarbamide compared to
  the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.05). Additionally, increased levels of other Weibel-Palade-body-stored
  proteins, including factor VIII (FVIII), angiopoietin-2, and osteoprotegerin were
  observed, indicated ongoing endothelial cell activation. Children treated with hydroxycarbamide
  also had higher FVIII activity and enhanced thrombin generation compared to the
  blood transfusion cohort (p<0.001), contributing to their thrombotic risk. Finally,
  hemolysis markers strongly correlated with VWF levels (p<0.001) and significantly
  reduced in the blood transfusion cohort (p<0.001). Cumulatively, our findings demonstrate
  for the first time that despite treatment, ongoing dysfunction of the VWF-ADAMTS13
  axis is present in a significant sub-group of pediatric SCD patients, especially
  those treated with hydroxycarbamide. Since VWF plays an important role in vaso-occlusion
  pathogenesis, these data are of direct translational relevance.
