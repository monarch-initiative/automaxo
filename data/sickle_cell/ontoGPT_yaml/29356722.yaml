input_text: 'Early Noninvasive Ventilation and Nonroutine Transfusion for Acute Chest
  Syndrome in Sickle Cell Disease in Children: A Descriptive Study. OBJECTIVES: To
  describe the need for transfusion and short- and long-term evolutions of pediatric
  sickle cell disease patients with acute chest syndrome for whom early continuous
  noninvasive ventilation represented first-line treatment. DESIGN: Single-center
  retrospective chart study in PICU. SETTING: A tertiary and quaternary referral PICU.
  PATIENTS: All sickle cell disease patients 5-20 years old admitted with confirmed
  acute chest syndrome and not transfused in the previous month were included. INTERVENTIONS:
  None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, laboratory and radiologic
  findings, transfusions, invasive ventilation, oxygen and noninvasive ventilation
  settings, duration of opioid treatment, length of hospital stay, and severe sickle
  cell disease complications in the ensuing 2 years were extracted from medical charts.
  Sixty-six acute chest syndrome in 48 patients were included. Continuous early noninvasive
  ventilation was well tolerated in 65 episodes, with positive expiratory pressure
  4 cm H2O and pressure support 10 cm H2O (median) administered continuously, then
  discontinued during 7 days (median). No patient necessitated invasive ventilation
  or died. Twenty-three acute chest syndrome (35%) received transfusions; none received
  blood exchange. Transfused patients had more frequent upper lobe radiologic involvement,
  more severe anemia, higher reticulocyte counts, and higher C-reactive protein than
  nontransfused patients. Their evolution was more severe in terms of length of opioid
  requirement, length of noninvasive ventilation treatment, overall time on noninvasive
  ventilation, and length of stay. At 2-year follow-up after the acute chest syndrome
  episode, no difference was observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Early noninvasive
  ventilation combined with nonroutine transfusion is well tolerated in acute chest
  syndrome in children and may spare transfusion in some patients. Early recognition
  of patients still requiring transfusion is essential and warrants further studies.'
