input_text: 'What are the outcomes of core decompression in patients with avascular
  necrosis? Protocol for a systematic review. Background: Core decompression is a
  hip preserving surgical procedure that is used to treat avascular necrosis (AVN)
  of the femoral head. The eventual clinical and radiological outcome following this
  procedure is varied in literature. Also, the time to a total hip replacement (THR)
  from the index procedure and the percentage of patients subsequently undergoing
  a THR is controversial. Furthermore, there are multiple surgical methods along with
  multiple augmentation techniques and various classification and staging systems
  described. The purpose of this systematic review, therefore, is to analyse the outcomes
  following decompression only, excluding any augmentation techniques for non-traumatic
  AVN of the femoral head. Methods: This protocol is being developed in line with
  the PRISMA-P guidelines. The search strategy includes articles from Medline, Embase,
  Google Scholar, CINHAL and Cochrane library. The review and screening will be done
  by two independent reviewers. Review articles, editorials and correspondences will
  be excluded. Articles including patients with sickle cell disease and with core
  decompression where augmentation is used will be excluded. The risk of bias and
  quality of articles will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical
  Appraisal Checklist for the different study designs included. Discussion: This study
  will be a comprehensive review on all published articles having patients with AVN
  of the femoral head and undergoing core decompression surgery only. The systematic
  review will then define the outcomes of the core decompression surgery based on
  clinical and radiological outcomes. Each outcome will include the different stages
  within it and finally, the total mean time to THR will be calculated. This will
  then be followed by assessing the cumulative confidence in evidence from all the
  data collected using the GRADE tool.   Registration: This systematic review is registered
  in the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis
  (PROSPERO) under the registration number:  CRD42018100596.'
