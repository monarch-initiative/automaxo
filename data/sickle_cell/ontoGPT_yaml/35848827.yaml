input_text: Urgent use of voxelotor in sickle cell disease when immediate transfusion
  is not safe. The use of blood transfusions to improve anemia resulting from sickle
  cell disease (SCD) is often limited by alloimmunization, which occurs due to exposure
  to incompatible antigen present on donor red blood cells (RBCs). This complication
  occasionally manifests as delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) that cause
  hemolysis of the recipient's own RBCs and can lead to fatal anemia. In this case
  study, we report a patient with SCD who experienced a DHTR following chronic transfusion
  and was successfully treated with voxelotor, an orally administered sickle hemoglobin
  (HbS) polymerization inhibitor for the treatment of SCD. Laboratory tests following
  admission indicated pan-reactivity in antigens, and a rare donor registry was used
  to locate acceptable units. The patient experienced the DHTR 3 days after admission,
  which limited laboratory tests due to profound hemolysis. Alternative treatments
  were limited, and phenotypically matched units were incompatible, so voxelotor was
  selected as a last-resort treatment. Following initiation of voxelotor 1500 mg,
  the patient's hemoglobin levels returned to baseline (6 g/dl) within 10 days, with
  clinical improvements. This report provides evidence regarding the use of voxelotor
  in the treatment of profound anemia where other treatments could be unsafe or unavailable.
