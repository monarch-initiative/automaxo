  allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling donors in paediatric patients with sickle cell
  disease: A study on behalf of the EBMT Paediatric Diseases and Inborn Errors Working
  Parties.How important is choice of conditioning regimen in allogeneic haematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for sickle cell disease (SCD)? We compared HSCT
  outcomes by conditioning regimen in paediatric patients with SCD from the EBMT registry.
  In 2010-2020, 251 patients aged <18 years underwent a first matched sibling donor
  (MSD) HSCT with conditioning based on busulfan-fludarabine (bu-flu; n = 89) or treosulfan-fludarabine
  (treo-flu; n = 162). In the bu-flu and treo-flu groups, 51.7% and 99.4% of patients,
  respectively, received thiotepa. Median follow-up was 2.7 years. Two-year overall
  survival (OS) was 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-99.8) with bu-flu and
  99.3% (95% CI: 95.2-99.9) with treo-flu (p = 0.63). Grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host
  disease (GVHD) at 100 days was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4-7.5) and 0.6% (0.1%-3.2%) for bu-flu
  and treo-flu respectively (p = 0.25). The 2-year incidence of extensive chronic
  GVHD was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1-7.3) with bu-flu and 8.0% (95% CI: 4.1-13.3) with treo-flu
  (p = 0.057). These multinational data confirm the excellent curative capacity of
  MSD HSCT with myeloablative conditioning. Both conditioning regimens yielded excellent
  OS, low rates of acute and chronic GVHD, and low rates of graft failure.'
