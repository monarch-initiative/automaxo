input_text: 'Evaluation of a prophylactic transfusion program on obstetric outcomes
  in pregnant women with sickle cell disease: A single centre retrospective cohort
  study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a prophylactic transfusion program (TP)
  on obstetric and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (SCD).
  METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all singleton pregnancies among
  women with SCD in a French university tertiary care center between 1 January 2004
  and 31 December 2017. The TP group included patients selected according to the French
  guidelines who received regular red blood cell transfusions during pregnancy until
  delivery. The factors associated with TP indication [year of birth, SCD genotype,
  history of acute chest syndrome and delayed hemolysis transfusion reaction (DHTR)
  risk score] were taken into account in a propensity score. A composite obstetric
  adverse outcome was defined associating birth before 34 gestational weeks and/or
  pre-eclampsia and/or small for gestational age and/or abruption and/or stillbirth
  and/or maternal death and/or neonatal death. RESULTS: In total, 246 pregnancies
  in 173 patients were analyzed. Twenty-two pregnancies with a history of DHTR were
  excluded. A higher frequency of TP was found before 2013 [119/148 (80.4%) vs 38/76
  (50%); p < 0.001]. Rates of preterm birth before 34 gestational weeks (5.6% vs 19.7%;
  p = 0.001), vaso-occlusive crisis (36.5% vs. 61.8%; p < 0.001), and acute chest
  syndrome (6.1% vs. 14.5%; p = 0.04) during pregnancy were decreased significantly
  in the TP group. Among the groups with and without composite obstetric adverse outcomes,
  the frequency of TP was 52.6% and 74.7%, respectively [odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95%
  confidence interval (CI) 0.09-1.02]. The multivariate analysis shows that the TP
  was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of composite obstetric adverse
  outcomes (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.97; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: A red blood cell TP
  may have an independent protective effect on maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes
  during pregnancy in women with SCD.'
