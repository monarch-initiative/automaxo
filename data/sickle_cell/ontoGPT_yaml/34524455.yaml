input_text: 'Executive Functioning Predicts Adaptive Functioning and Self-Care Independence
  in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of executive
  functioning (EF) on adaptive functioning and self-care independence in pre-transition
  youth with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Thirty-four youth with SCD (ages
  12-18 years) completed a brief neuropsychological battery and their caregivers completed
  questionnaires assessing adaptive functioning, EF behaviors, and independence in
  completing self-care tasks, including disease management. Hierarchical linear regression
  analyses were utilized to investigate if EF predicted significantly more variability
  in adaptive functioning and self-care independence than what is accounted for by
  socioeconomic status (SES), disease knowledge, and estimated intellectual functioning.
  RESULTS: Mean performance on standardized measures assessing working memory, processing
  speed, and EF skills fell in the low average range. Performance-based EF and caregiver-reported
  EF behaviors predicted variance in adaptive functioning and self-care independence
  above and beyond that accounted for by SES, disease knowledge, and intelligence,
  with moderate to large effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: EF skills may support the ability
  of youth with SCD to adequately achieve independence in self-care, including medical
  self-care, and other adaptive skills, which may increase the likelihood of successful
  transition to young adulthood. These findings provide support for the role of neuropsychological
  screening and individualized intervention in interdisciplinary transition programs.'
