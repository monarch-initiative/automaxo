input_text: '[Transition in sickle cell disease - recommendations of the transition
  initiative sickle cell disease]. Sickle cell disease is a rare, but complex multi-systemic
  disorder with high need of interdisciplinary and specialized care and new structural
  requirements. Besides care of those chronically sick patients, transition process
  is a vulnerable phase which highly influences further treatment. To make matters
  worse, patients often have migration background with subsequent communication problems.
  A national guidance for a standardized transition process is lacking in Germany.
  In context of a structured consensus process, the "transition initiative sickle
  cell disease" developed specific recommendations for a structured transition of
  sickle cell patients on the basis of the S3 transition guideline of the DGfTM. These
  recommendations should improve this vulnerable process in this complex disease to
  ensure adequate further treatment and to avoid acute and chronic complications but
  also mental, social or job-related issues. Besides improvement of quality of life,
  medical treatment and survival, health economic aspects arise. Documents were developed
  to support and facilitate the transition process and are available under www.sichelzellkrankheit.info/transition/.'
