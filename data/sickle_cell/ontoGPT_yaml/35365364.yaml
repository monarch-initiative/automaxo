input_text: 'Frequency of Opioid Prescription Filling After Discharge from the Pediatric
  Emergency Department.BACKGROUND: Little is known about prescription filling of pain
  medicine for children. In adult populations, race and insurance type are associated
  with differences in opioid prescription fill rate. We hypothesize that known disparities
  in pain management for children are exacerbated by the differential rates of opioid
  prescription filling between patients based on age and race. OBJECTIVE: To determine
  if there are demographic or clinical factors associated with differences in opioid
  prescription fill rates after discharge from the pediatric emergency department
  (ED). METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all patients younger
  than 19 years discharged with an opioid prescription from either of two pediatric
  EDs in 2018. We performed multivariable logistic regression to measure associations
  between prescription filling and demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: There
  were 287 patient visits in which opioids were prescribed. Forty percent of prescriptions
  were filled. The majority of patients were male (53%), black (69%), and had public
  insurance (55%). There were no significant associations between prescription filling
  and age, insurance status, or race/ethnicity. Patients with sickle cell disease
  were more likely to fill prescriptions (odds ratio 3.87, 95% confidence interval
  2.33-6.43) and patients without an identified primary care provider were less likely
  to fill prescriptions (odds ratio 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.84). CONCLUSION:
  Less than half of opioid prescriptions prescribed at discharge from a pediatric
  emergency department are filled. Patient age, insurance status, and race/ethnicity
  are not associated with opioid prescription filling. Patients with sickle cell disease
  and those with a primary care provider are more likely to fill their opioid prescriptions.'
