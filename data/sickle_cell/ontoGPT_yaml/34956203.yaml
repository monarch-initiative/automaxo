input_text: Long-Term Effects of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
  on Systemic Inflammation in Sickle Cell Disease Patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only currently available curative treatment
  for sickle cell disease (SCD). However, the effects of HSCT on SCD pathophysiology
  are poorly elucidated. Here, we assessed red blood cell (RBC) adhesiveness, intensity
  of hemolysis, vascular tone markers and systemic inflammation, in SCD patients treated
  with allogeneic HSCT. Thirty-two SCD patients were evaluated before and on long-term
  follow-up after HSCT. Overall survival was 94% with no severe (grade III-IV) graft-vs-host
  disease and a 22% rejection rate (graft failure). Hematological parameters, reticulocyte
  counts, and levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), endothelin-1 and VCAM-1 normalized
  in SCD patients post-HSCT. Expression of adhesion molecules on reticulocytes and
  RBC was lower in patients with sustained engraftment. Levels of IL-18, IL-15 and
  LDH were higher in patients that developed graft failure. Increased levels of plasma
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly TNF-alpha, were found in SCD patients long-term
  after transplantation. SCD patients with sustained engraftment after allo-HSCT showed
  decreased reticulocyte counts and adhesiveness, diminished hemolysis, and lower
  levels of vascular tonus markers. Nevertheless, systemic inflammation persists for
  at least five years after transplantation, indicating that allo-HSCT does not equally
  affect all aspects of SCD pathophysiology.
