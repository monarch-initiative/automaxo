input_text: "Simultaneous visible light optical coherence tomography and near infrared
  OCT angiography in retinal pathologies: A case study.A dual-channel optical coherence
  tomography system with wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared light ranges
  can provide both structural and functional information for retinal microvasculature
  simultaneously. We applied this integrated system in an ongoing clinical study of
  patients with various retinal pathologies. Here, we present case study results of
  patients with diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion, and sickle cell
  retinopathy compared to a healthy subject. For the first time, this comparison validates
  the system's ability to detect structural anomalies in both en face and B-scan images
  with simultaneous retinal optical coherence tomography angiography and measurement
  of sO2 in parafoveal vessels that are around 20-30 microm in diameter. This integrated
  system represents a powerful instrument with potentially far-reaching clinical implications
  for the early detection and diagnosis of retinal vascular diseases."
