input_text: 'Genome Editing for the beta-Hemoglobinopathies. The beta-hemoglobinopathies
  are diverse set of disorders caused by mutations in the beta-globin (HBB) gene.
  Because HBB protein is a critical component (along with alpha-globin, heme, and
  iron) of hemoglobin, the molecule essential for oxygen delivery to tissues, mutations
  in HBB can result in lethal diseases or diseases with multi-organ dysfunction. HBB
  mutations can be roughly divided into two categories: those that cause a dysfunctional
  protein (such as sickle cell disease but also including varied diseases caused by
  high-affinity hemoglobins, low-affinity hemoglobins, and methemoglobinemia) and
  those that cause the insufficient production of HBB protein (beta-thalassemia).
  Sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia are both the most prevalent and the most
  devastating of the beta-hemoglobinopathies.'

  primary_disease: <The main disease the text is about, or its central disease topic. This is often the disease mentioned in an article's title or in its first few sentences.>
  medical_actions: <Semicolon-separated list of medical actions, where each is a clinically prescribed procedure, therapy, intervention, or recommendation.>
  symptoms: <Semicolon-separated list of signs or symptoms.>
  chemicals: <Semicolon-separated list of chemicals or drugs>
  action_annotation_relationships: <Semicolon-separated list of relationships between a disease, the mentioned signs and symptoms associated with that disease, the medical actions relating to each symptom, and the type of relationship between each action and symptom (usually TREATS or PREVENTS). The disease name must be included in the relationship, for example, "treatment TREATS symptom IN disease". If the medical action includes a specific chemical or drug, include the chemical or drug name in the relationship, for example, "treatment (with chemical) TREATS symptom IN disease".>
