input_text: "Utility of measuring serum creatinine to detect renal compromise in ED
  patients receiving IV contrast-enhanced CT scan.OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this
  study are to determine the efficacy of a roster of clinical factors in identifying
  risk for renal insufficiency in emergency department (ED) patients requiring intravenous
  contrast-enhanced CT scan (IVCE-CT) and to help mitigate potential for developing
  contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). METHODS: A review was conducted of consecutive
  ED patients who received IVCE-CT during a 4-month period in our urban ED. The values
  of ED serum creatinine (SCr) performed were tabulated. The medical records of all
  patients with an elevated SCr (> 1.4 mg/dL) were reviewed to determine and correlate
  the presence of clinical risk factors for underlying renal insufficiency. RESULTS:
  During the 4-month study period, there were 2260 consecutive cases who received
  IVCE-CT; of these, 2250 (99.6%) had concomitant measurement of SCr. Elevated SCr
  occurred in 141 patients (6.2%); of these, 75 had a SCr > 2 mg/dL. In all, 139/141
  (98.6%) with an elevated SCr had an underlying chronic or acute medical condition
  identified by medical record review which potentially compromised renal function,
  including chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, cancer, hypertension,
  congestive heart failure, sepsis/septic shock, chronic alcoholism, and sickle cell
  disease. Two patients with no identified risk factor each had (mildly) elevated
  SCr; both had a normal SCr measured post-CT scan. The total cost of performing serum
  basic metabolic panel to measure SCr in all patients during the 4-month study period
  was $94,500. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SCr is rarely present in ED patients without
  recognized risk factors who receive IVCE-CT scan. The vast majority with underlying
  renal insufficiency are readily identified by a review of the patient's medical
  history and/or clinical findings. Routine SCr measurement on all ED patients regardless
  of risk stratification prior to IVCE imaging is neither time nor cost-effective."
