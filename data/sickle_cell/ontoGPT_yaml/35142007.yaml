input_text: Pregnancy outcomes with hydroxyurea use in women with sickle cell disease.Hydroxyurea
  reduces pain crises, acute chest syndrome, and blood transfusions in sickle cell
  disease (SCD), but potential detrimental effects on fertility and birth outcomes
  impede its use. Data on the effects of hydroxyurea taken for SCD during conception
  and pregnancy are scarce. The Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium collected
  self-reported pregnancy history, corresponding hydroxyurea use, and pregnancy outcomes
  in women with SCD in the clinical setting. Among 1285 women 18-45 years of age,
  737 (57.4%) reported 1788 pregnancies (1079 live births, 394 miscarriages, 40 stillbirths,
  207 abortions, 48 current pregnancies, and 20 missing outcomes) of which 241 (15.9%)
  live births, miscarriages or stillbirths were conceived while on hydroxyurea. In
  univariate analyses, pregnancy number more than three, severe sickle genotype, history
  of stillbirth or miscarriage, and chronic kidney disease at enrollment were covariates
  significantly associated with a pregnancy ending in miscarriage or stillbirth. After
  adjustment for covariates and additional SCD severity markers in multivariate analyses,
  hydroxyurea use during conception and pregnancy, but not during conception only,
  was associated with an increase in the odds ratio (OR) of miscarriage or stillbirth
  (OR 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-3.47). In analyses of live birth outcomes,
  hydroxyurea use during conception and pregnancy was associated with birth weight
  < 5.5 pounds in full-term infants (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.09-7.38) but not with prematurity
  or serious medical problems at birth. These findings suggest that hydroxyurea use
  may be safe up to the time of conception, but that clinicians should continue to
  advise caution regarding use during pregnancy.
