input_text: "Sickle Cell Disease is Associated with Increased Morbidity, Resource
  Utilization, and Readmissions after Common Abdominal Surgeries: A Multistate Analysis,
  2007-2014. INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most commonly inherited
  hemoglobinopathy in the United States, increases the likelihood of postoperative
  complications, resulting in higher costs and readmissions. We used a retrospective
  cohort study to explore SCD's influence on postoperative complications and readmissions
  after cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy. METHODS: We used an administrative
  database's 2007-2014 data from California, Florida, New York, Maryland, and Kentucky.
  RESULTS: 1,934,562 patients aged >=18 years were included. Compared to non-SCD patients,
  SCD patients experienced worse outcomes: increased odds of blood transfusion and
  major and minor complications, higher adjusted odds of 30- and 90-day readmissions,
  longer length of stay, and higher total hospital charges. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell
  disease patients are at high risk for poor outcomes based on their demographic characteristics.
  Therefore, perioperative physicians including hematologists, anesthesiologists,
  and surgeons need to take this knowledge into consideration for management and counselling
  of SCD patients on the risks of surgery and recovery."
