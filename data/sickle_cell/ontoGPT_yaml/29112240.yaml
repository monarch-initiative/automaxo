input_text: "Splenectomy versus conservative management for acute sequestration crises
  in people with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Acute splenic sequestration crises
  are a complication of sickle cell disease, with high mortality rates and frequent
  recurrence in survivors of first attacks. Splenectomy and blood transfusion, with
  their consequences, are the mainstay of long-term management used in different parts
  of the world. This is a 2017 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002,
  and previously updated, most recently in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether splenectomy
  (total or partial), to prevent acute splenic sequestration crises in people with
  sickle cell disease, improved survival and decreased morbidity in people with sickle
  cell disease, as compared with regular blood transfusions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched
  the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials
  Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic
  database searches and handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference
  proceedings. We also searched clinical trial registries. Additional trials were
  sought from the reference lists of the trials and reviews identified by the search
  strategy.Date of the most recent search: 14 August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: All
  randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing splenectomy (total or
  partial) to prevent recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises with no treatment
  or blood transfusions in people with sickle cell disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:
  No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. MAIN RESULTS:
  No trials of splenectomy for acute splenic sequestration were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
  Splenectomy, if full, will prevent further sequestration and if partial, may reduce
  the recurrence of acute splenic sequestration crises. However, there is a lack of
  evidence from trials showing that splenectomy improves survival and decreases morbidity
  in people with sickle cell disease. There is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered,
  randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared
  to transfusion programmes, as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality
  from acute splenic sequestration in people with sickle cell disease.There are no
  trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up
  to August 2017. We will continue to run searches to identify any potentially relevant
  trials; however, we do not plan to update other sections of the review until new
  trials are published."
