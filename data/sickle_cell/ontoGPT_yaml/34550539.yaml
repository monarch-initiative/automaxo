input_text: Red blood cell exchange in children with sickle cell disease.The aim of
  our study was to assess the efficacy of red blood cell exchange (RBCx) using a Spectra
  Optia  automated apheresis system in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). We
  used automated RBCx to treat acute and chronic complications in 75 children with
  SCD who had a median age of 10 years [7-13]. We analyzed 649 RBCx sessions. Peripheral
  venous access was limited in a number of the children, and thus a femoral double-lumen
  central venous catheter was required. We recommend heparin locking with 500 units
  in each lumen of the catheter. To prevent complications, we ensured that all patients
  had achieved a post-RCE HbS level of < 30%. For chronic transfusion, with a post-RCE
  Hb level of approximately 10-11 g/dL, a blood exchange volume of >= 32 mL/kg, and
  an interval between each RBCx procedure of <= 30 days, the residual HbS level was
  maintained below 30%. For acute transfusion, a post-exchange Hb level >= 10 g/dL
  (p < 0.001) and a total exchange volume >= 35 mL/kg (p = 0.001) were the best way
  to reduce HbS to < 30%. AUC was 0.84. Our results show that erythrocytapheresis
  was useful and safe for children with SCD.
