input_text: 'Cerebral hemodynamics in children with sickle cell disease in India:
  An observational cohort study.India has the second highest number of cases of sickle
  cell disease (SCD) and affects the most socioeconomically disadvantaged communities
  living in a horizontal belt from Gujarat to Odisha state. Despite high prevalence,
  information about cerebral hemodynamics among children with SCD in India remains
  scarcely described. We performed transcranial Doppler (TCD) to assess cerebral hemodynamics
  among Indian children with SCD and evaluated their association with clinical and
  hematological parameters. Children aged 3-18years, diagnosed with SCD living in
  Raipur in Chhattisgarh and Ahmedabad in Gujarat state were recruited. TCD was performed
  to obtain flow velocities from middle cerebral (MCA), intracranial internal carotid
  (ICA) and basilar artery. Associations were evaluated between timed-average-mean-maximum
  velocities (TAMMV) and various clinical and hematological parameters. Our prospective
  study included 62 consecutive children with known SCD. Mean +- SD age of the study
  population was 9.8 +- 3.9 years and 31 (50%) were male. Mean +- SD hemoglobin was
  8.64 +- 1.34 Gm/dL while the mean HbSS +- SD was 70.25 +- 15.27%. While 6 (9.6%)
  children had suffered from stroke during previous 2 years, 7 (11%) demonstrated
  abnormal TAMMV. Higher HbSS level along with history of iron chelation therapy,
  blood transfusion and/or stroke showed a trend towards having higher TAMMV. Stroke
  and cerebral hemodynamic alterations are common among Indian children with SCD.
  Larger studies with detailed neuroimaging and genetic evaluations are needed for
  better understanding, characterization, risk stratification as well as optimization
  of the timing of blood transfusion to reduce physical disabilities among Indian
  children with SCD.'
