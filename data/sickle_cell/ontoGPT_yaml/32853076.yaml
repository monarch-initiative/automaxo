input_text: 'Sickle Cell-Related Complications in Patients Undergoing Cardiopulmonary
  Bypass. BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe our experience with patients with sickle
  cell trait (SCT) and undergoing surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS:
  Data on all patients with SCT or sickle-alpha thalassemia who underwent surgery
  on CPB were collected (1996-2017). RESULTS: Overall, 46 patients were included,
  37 (80%) had SCT and 9 (20%) had sickle-alpha thalassemia. A total of 4 (9%) developed
  a potential sickle cell-related complication. Patients with sickle cell-related
  complications were significantly older (median 14 years vs 14 months, P = .037)
  and heavier (median 54 kg vs 9 kg, P = .041). Complications occurred, although without
  statistical significance, in patients who underwent longer median CPB times (249
  minutes vs 137 minutes, P = .069), lower median temperature (31.7  C vs 33.3  C,
  P = .094), and a higher percentage underwent deep hypothermic circulatory arrest
  (50% vs 7%, P = .053). A total of 30 (65%) patients underwent exchange transfusion
  (ET) pre-bypass. Patients who underwent ET were significantly older (median 4 years
  vs 7 months, P = .003) and heavier (median 16 kg vs 6 kg, P = .015) than patients
  who did not undergo ET. The incidence of complications was comparable between patients
  who underwent ET (10%) and those who did not (6%). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective,
  single-center study, it has been shown that cardiac surgery requiring CPB in patients
  with SCT and sickle-alpha thalassemia had a low risk for sickle cell-associated
  complications. In this cohort of patients, older age, longer CPB times, lower median
  temperature, and the utilization of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest appear to
  play an important role in the development of complications.'
