input_text: "Contraceptive use and preferences among females with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVES:
  Females with sickle cell disease now have a life expectancy that extends well into
  and beyond their reproductive years. Pregnancy and childbirth are accompanied by
  high morbidity and mortality in this population, rendering contraception a critical
  part of their health care. STUDY DESIGN: We approached adult female patients of
  the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania hematology clinic who were of reproductive
  age (ages 18-45) and carried a diagnosis of sickle cell disease. We evaluated contraceptive
  method uptake and method characteristic preferences, as well as other reproductive
  history, and compared contraceptive uptake rates to that from female respondent
  data from the National Survey of Family Growth (2017-2019). RESULTS: Of 95 eligible
  patients, we completed surveys with 48 participants (response rate of 51%). Over
  half (n = 27, 56%) of participants were not currently using any form of contraception-double
  the rate of the general United States population (25%). The most common contraceptives
  currently used were the depot medroxyprogesterone (DMPA) injection (n = 6, 13%)
  and the progestin intrauterine device (IUD) (n = 6, 13%). DMPA uptake was significantly
  higher, and permanent contraceptive and oral contraceptive pill uptake significantly
  lower, among these participants with sickle cell disease compared to the general
  United States population. Participants' preferred contraceptive characteristics
  included effectiveness (n = 39, 81%), control over when to use the contraceptive
  (n = 39, 81%), and lack of side effects (n = 38, 79%). CONCLUSIONS: Contraceptive
  uptake was significantly lower and method mix different among females with sickle
  cell disease compared to the general United States population. Further research
  is needed on contraceptive safety, non-contraceptive benefits, and contraceptive
  decision-making for females with sickle cell disease. IMPLICATIONS: This study sheds
  light on the contraceptive choices and preferences of females with sickle cell disease,
  who are at disproportionate risk for pregnancy complications. In order to maximize
  the reproductive health of females with sickle cell disease, we must consider how
  their disease interacts with contraception and better understand how they approach
  contraceptive decision-making."
