input_text: 'Treatment of aseptic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: Historical aspects.The
  treatment of aseptic osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head has been the subject
  of numerous therapeutic and surgical proposals due to the absence of medical treatment
  with proven efficacy. For many years, the goal of surgical treatment was to avoid
  total hip replacement (THR) with uncertain survival in patients considered too young
  (30-50 years) for this procedure. Numerous conservative treatments were thus proposed:
  core decompression with numerous variants, non-vascularized and vascularized bone
  grafts, intertrochanteric and rotational transtrochanteric osteotomies, cementing.
  The lack of a common classification and a lack of knowledge of natural history complicated
  the interpretation of the results for a long time. Nevertheless, it appeared that
  these treatments were effective only in the very early stages and among these in
  the limited ONs, medial rather than central and especially lateral, with discrepancies
  according to etiologies apart from sickle cell disease recognized by all as being
  pejorative. For the same reason, partial arthroplasties have been attempted and
  abandoned in turn: femoral head total and partial resurfacing and femoral prosthesis.
  The most recent advances are stem-cell-enhanced core decompression and progress
  in total arthroplasty, whose reliability has made it possible to extend the indications
  to increasingly younger patients seeking treatment with guaranteed or near-guaranteed
  efficacy. Most of the other interventions have disappeared or almost disappeared
  because of their lack of effectiveness especially in extensive and post-fracture
  ONs, sometimes because of their complexity and the length of their post-operative
  management, and also because they complicate and penalize a future total arthroplasty.
  This argues for early detection of ON at an early stage where the "head can be saved"
  by stem cell augmented core decompression, a minimally invasive treatment that leaves
  the chances of success of a THR intact.'
