input_text: Clonal selection of hematopoietic stem cells after gene therapy for sickle
  cell disease.Gene therapy (GT) provides a potentially curative treatment option
  for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD); however, the occurrence of myeloid
  malignancies in GT clinical trials has prompted concern, with several postulated
  mechanisms. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing to track hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs) from six patients with SCD at pre- and post-GT time points to map the somatic
  mutation and clonal landscape of gene-modified and unmodified HSCs. Pre-GT, phylogenetic
  trees were highly polyclonal and mutation burdens per cell were elevated in some,
  but not all, patients. Post-GT, no clonal expansions were identified among gene-modified
  or unmodified cells; however, an increased frequency of potential driver mutations
  associated with myeloid neoplasms or clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A- and EZH2-mutated
  clones in particular) was observed in both genetically modified and unmodified cells,
  suggesting positive selection of mutant clones during GT. This work sheds light
  on HSC clonal dynamics and the mutational landscape after GT in SCD, highlighting
  the enhanced fitness of some HSCs harboring pre-existing driver mutations. Future
  studies should define the long-term fate of mutant clones, including any contribution
  to expansions associated with myeloid neoplasms.
