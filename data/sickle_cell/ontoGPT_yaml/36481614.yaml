input_text: 'IF IM in a crisis: Intranasal fentanyl versus intravenous morphine in
  adult vaso-occlusive crisis.IMPORTANCE: Studies have demonstrated the benefits of
  INF in reducing pain scores in pediatric patients with VOC due to sickle cell disease
  (SCD) and in adult patients with chronic pain conditions other than VOC, such as
  cancer. However, there is limited literature that exists describing the role of
  INF in adult patients with VOC due to SCD. Current literature demonstrates that
  the use of IV morphine for VOC patients leads to reduced pain. Therefore, comparing
  the use of INF with IV morphine will establish the degree of effectiveness of INF
  for VOC patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if intranasal fentanyl is equally as effective
  as IV morphine for treating VOC-associated pain in adult SCD patients. DESIGN: This
  study was a retrospective non-inferiority cohort study. Electronic health records
  were utilized to identify eligible patients between January 1, 2021 to February
  28, 2022. Patients who received INF as an initial opioid upon presentation to the
  ED where allocated to the intervention group. On the other hand, individuals who
  received IV morphine as an initial opioid upon presentation to the ED were allocated
  to the control group. SETTING: A multi-site healthcare system containing five hospitals.
  PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 years of age or older, admitted to the ED with VOC due
  to SCD, and received INF or IV morphine as an initial opioid upon presentation to
  the ED. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was to evaluate the percent
  change in pain reduction after the initial dose of opiate between groups. Secondary
  outcomes include time to first rescue medication, total morphine milligram equivalent
  (MME) of IV opiates, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory distress requiring opiate
  reversal within 6 h post- study drug administration, readmission within 48 h, and
  ED disposition. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients were reviewed within the study
  period, 95 subjects met inclusion criteria, 31 subjects were included in the INF
  arm and 64 subjects in the IV morphine arm. The primary outcome showed an average
  percent pain reduction of 17.25% in the INF arm and 17.15% in the IV morphine arm.
  The point estimate difference was 0.1% (95% CI -9.3%-9.5%; non-inferiority (p <
  0.0001). The median dose of IV opiates was 8 MME in the INF group, and 6 MME in
  the IV morphine group (p = 0.0268). The time from study drug to first rescue medication
  administration was 22.4 min and 27.3 min in the INF and IV morphine groups, respectively
  (p = 0.2231). There was no incidence of hypotension or respiratory distress requiring
  opiate reversal in either arm. Bradycardia occurred in 12.9% and 7.7% (p = 0.2042),
  readmission rates within 48 h due to VOC was 6.5% and 20.9% (p = 0.0553), and discharge
  from the ED to home was 16% and 66% (p = 0.0196) in INF and IV morphine arms, respectively.
  CONCLUSION: INF provided similar pain reduction compared to IV morphine in the treatment
  of adults with VOC presenting to the ED. IV morphine arm showed a statistically
  significant difference in discharge to home from the ED, however there was a trend
  in readmission within 48 h. The study showed no significant difference in hypotension,
  respiratory distress, or bradycardia between the groups. The INF group had no significant
  impact on time to drug administration compared to IV morphine, however it was within
  1 h of patient presentation which complies with American Society of Hematology (ASH)
  guidelines. In conclusion, our study showed that INF was non-inferior when compared
  to IV morphine in reducing pain scores after drug administration. Therefore, INF
  is an effective alternative to IV morphine for pain management in adults presenting
  to the ED for VOC particularly in those with limited IV access.'
