input_text: 'The acute pain crisis in sickle cell disease: What can be done to improve
  outcomes? The acute pain crisis (APC) is the commonest complication of sickle cell
  disease (SCD). Severe episodes may require treatment in hospital with strong opioid
  analgesic drugs, combined with additional supportive care measures. Guidelines for
  APC management have been produced over the past two decades gathering evidence from
  published studies, expert opinion, and patient perspective. Unfortunately, reports
  from multiple sources indicate that guidelines are often not followed, and that
  acute care in emergency departments and on acute medical wards is suboptimal. It
  is important to understand what leads to this breakdown in health care, and to identify
  evidence-based interventions which could be implemented to improve care. This review
  focuses on recently published articles as well as information about on-going clinical
  trials. Aspects of care which could potentially make a difference to patient experience
  include availability and accessibility of individual care plans agreed between patient
  and treating specialist, innovative means of delivering initial opioids to reduce
  time to first analgesia, and availability of a specialist unit away from the ED,
  where expert care can be delivered in a more compassionate environment. The current
  evidence of improved outcomes and health economic advantage with these interventions
  is inadequate, and this is hampering their implementation into health care systems.'
