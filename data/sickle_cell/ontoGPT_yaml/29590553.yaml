input_text: Targeting pain at its source in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease
  (SCD) is a genetic disorder associated with hemolytic anemia, end-organ damage,
  reduced survival, and pain. One of the unique features of SCD is recurrent and unpredictable
  episodes of acute pain due to vasoocclusive crisis requiring hospitalization. Additionally,
  patients with SCD often develop chronic persistent pain. Currently, sickle cell
  pain is treated with opioids, an approach limited by adverse effects. Because pain
  can start at infancy and continue throughout life, preventing the genesis of pain
  may be relatively better than treating the pain once it has been evoked. Therefore,
  we provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sickle cell pain
  that contribute to the activation of the somatosensory system in the peripheral
  and central nervous systems. These mechanisms include mast cell activation and neurogenic
  inflammation, peripheral nociceptor sensitization, maladaptation of spinal signals,
  central sensitization, and modulation of neural circuits in the brain. In this review,
  we describe potential preventive/therapeutic targets and their targeting with novel
  pharmacologic and/or integrative approaches to ameliorate sickle cell pain.
