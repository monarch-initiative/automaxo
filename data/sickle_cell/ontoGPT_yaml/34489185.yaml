input_text: Complete neurological recovery from fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell
  disease after sequential red cell exchange transfusion and therapeutic plasma exchange.
  Fat embolism syndrome in sickle cell disease is associated with great mortality,
  while more than half of survivors suffer severe neurological sequelae. Release of
  fat droplets leads to obstruction of the microcirculation as well as generation
  of proinflammatory cytokines that can cause direct tissue injury. Red cell exchange
  transfusion can be life-saving but the addition of therapeutic plasma exchange may
  further improve outcomes by removing such inflammatory mediators. Here, we describe
  the case of a 27-year-old male patient with sickle cell anaemia presenting with
  typical features of fat embolism syndrome including neurological involvement with
  greatly reduced level of consciousness. MRI of his brain showed multiple widespread
  microhemorrhages giving the characteristic "star field" pattern but also a cytotoxic
  lesion of the corpus callosum, known to be the result of direct neurotoxicity by
  proinflammatory cytokines. The patient underwent emergency red cell exchange transfusion
  leading only to modest clinical improvement but fully regained consciousness after
  three cycles of therapeutic plasma exchange. This case highlights the deleterious
  effect of the hyperinflammatory state characteristic of many sickle cell complications
  and supports further exploring the potential benefit from plasma exchange as an
  adjunct to red cell exchange in order to remove proinflammatory cytokines during
  acute complications of sickle cell disease.
