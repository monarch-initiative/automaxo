input_text: "A systematic review of clinical trials for gene therapies for beta-hemoglobinopathy
  around the world. BACKGROUND AIMS: Amidst the success of cell therapy for the treatment
  of onco-hematological diseases, the first recently Food and Drug Administration-approved
  gene therapy product for patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT)
  indicates the feasibility of gene therapy as curative for genetic hematologic disorders.
  This work analyzed the current-world scenario of clinical trials involving gene
  therapy for beta-hemoglobinopathies. METHODS: Eighteen trials for patients with
  sickle cell disease (SCD) and 24 for patients with TDT were analyzed. RESULTS: Most
  are phase 1 and 2 trials, funded by the industry and are currently recruiting volunteers.
  Treatment strategies for both diseases are fetal hemoglobin induction (52.4%); addition
  of wild-type or therapeutic beta-globin gene (38.1%) and correction of mutations
  (9,5%). Gene editing (52.4%) and gene addition (40.5%) are the two most used techniques.
  The United States and France are the countries with the greatest number of clinical
  trials centers for SCD, with 83.1% and 4.2%, respectively. The United States (41.1%),
  China (26%) and Italy (6.8%) lead TDT trials centers. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic trial
  concentration indicates the high costs of this technology, logistical issues and
  social challenges that need to be overcome for gene therapy to reach low- and middle-income
  countries where SCD and TDT are prevalent and where they most impact the patient's
  health."
