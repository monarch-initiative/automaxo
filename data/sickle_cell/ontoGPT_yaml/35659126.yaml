input_text: 'Liver Transplantation After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for the
  Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease: A Case Report. Sickle cell anemia is the most
  common of the hemoglobinopathies, in which the abnormal hemoglobin formed in deoxygenation
  states undergoes a polymerization process with consequent erythrocyte deformation
  and vaso-occlusive events. The need for multiple blood transfusions, prolonged ineffective
  erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and increased iron absorption can cause iron overload
  in the liver, leading to liver fibrosis. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) is currently the only treatment with a curative potential for this disease
  and can establish normal complete or partial donor-derived erythropoiesis and stabilize
  or restore function in affected organs, preventing further deterioration of function.
  However, it does not reverse preexisting liver fibrosis and siderosis. One of the
  possible complications of patients who undergo HSCT is chronic liver disease, which
  has a multifactorial cause, with iron overload being an important factor. In the
  long term, the prevalence of chronic liver disease in HSCT patients, including cirrhosis
  and its complications, can be significant. Solid organ transplantation after allogeneic
  hematopoietic cell transplantation for end-organ failure remains a very rare event.
  It may offer a valuable treatment strategy in selected recipients, although it is
  associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report the case of a patient
  with sickle cell anemia who underwent HSCT and developed severe liver dysfunction
  requiring liver transplantation 13 years after the procedure. We found no previous
  report in the literature of orthotopic liver transplant after HCT for the treatment
  of sickle cell disease.'
