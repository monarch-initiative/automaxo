  and gestational maturity.BACKGROUND: It is well documented that sickle cell anemia
  (SCA) in pregnancy increases the risk of problems that can influence the growth
  and maturation of the newborn. OBJECTIVES: To assess the gestational maturity and
  birth weight of babies born to Saudi mothers with sickle cell anemia in the Jazan
  region. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in three hospitals in the Jazan
  region. An interview with a semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data
  from the participants' women, and then the birth weight was taken. RESULTS: Of 187
  delivered women, 20.3% had SCA (13% had sickle cell disease, and the remaining had
  sickle cell trait). Among the 38 affected mothers, 15.7% were considered to have
  an additional risk (7.9% had diabetes mellitus, 5.3% had hypertension, and 2.6%
  were smokers). The mean birth weight was 2.95+- 0.40 kilograms and 2.99+- 0.55 kilograms
  in the case and control groups, respectively. However, the low birth weight babies
  constitute 31% of the delivered babies in the SCA group with a weight of 2.33+-
  0.16 kg and 15% of the control group with a mean weight of 2.16+- 0.30 kilograms.
  The gestational age was 39.36+- 1.02 weeks in the SCA group compared to 39.5 +-1.17
  weeks in the control group. Maternal age and hypertension significantly influence
  the birth weight in the SCA group compared to the influence of diabetes mellitus
  on the birth weight in the control group. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that
  SCA in pregnant mothers influences birth weight, which is more impacted by maternal
  age and co-morbidities. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach must monitor these
  risky pregnancies well to avoid undesirable neonatal outcomes."
