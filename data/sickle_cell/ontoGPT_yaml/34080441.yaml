input_text: 'Acupuncture for chronic pain in adults with sickle cell disease: a mixed-methods
  pilot study. OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a common symptom experienced among patients
  with sickle cell disease (SCD). Our aims were to assess the feasibility and acceptability
  of performing acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain in adults with SCD.
  METHODS: This was a single-arm, prospective pilot study of six adults with SCD.
  Participants reported >= 3 months of chronic pain and were > 18 years of age. Per
  protocol, acupuncture was to be administered twice per week for 5 weeks, for 30
  min per session. All treatments were performed in the acupuncture treatment laboratory
  at the University of Illinois Chicago College of Nursing. Pain intensity, pain interference,
  and other symptoms were measured at baseline and after the intervention. Participants
  completed a semi-structured interview and a protocol acceptability questionnaire
  after the acupuncture intervention. RESULTS: Six participants (mean age 52.5 years,
  six Black) were enrolled. Although the study was suspended due to COVID-19 and not
  all participants completed the 10-session protocol, completion rates were high with
  no missed appointments. One participant did not complete the study due to hospitalization
  unrelated to acupuncture. No adverse events were reported. At completion of the
  intervention at 4-5 weeks post-baseline, all participants had reduced pain intensity
  and pain interference. The mean acceptability score on the protocol acceptability
  questionnaire was 82%. CONCLUSION: It was feasible and acceptable to implement acupuncture
  in adults with SCD. This study can be used to guide a larger randomized controlled
  trial to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on reducing chronic pain in adults with
  SCD.Trial registration number: NCT04156399 (ClinicalTrials.gov).'
