input_text: 'Sevuparin for the treatment of acute pain crisis in patients with sickle
  cell disease: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase
  2 trial.BACKGROUND: There are no approved treatments for vaso-occlusive crises in
  sickle cell disease. Sevuparin is a novel non-anticoagulant low molecular weight
  heparinoid, with anti-adhesive properties. In this study, we tested whether sevuparin
  could shorten vaso-occlusive crisis duration in hospitalised patients with sickle
  cell disease. METHODS: We did a multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
  phase 2 study in 16 public access clinical hospitals in the Netherlands, Lebanon,
  Turkey, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Jamaica. Patients aged 12-50 years with
  a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (types HbSS, HbSC, HbSbeta0-thalassaemia, or
  HbSbeta+-thalassaemia) on a stable dose of hydroxyurea, hospitalised with vaso-occlusive
  crisis for parenteral opioid analgesia with a projected stay of more than 48 h were
  included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated
  randomisation scheme to receive sevuparin (18 mg/kg per day) or placebo (NaCl, 0
  9% solution) intravenously for 2-7 days until vaso-occlusive crisis resolution.
  All individuals involved in the trial were masked to treatment allocation. The analysis
  was done in the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was time to
  vaso-occlusive crisis resolution defined as freedom from parenteral opioid use (in
  preceding 6-10 h); and readiness for discharge as judged by the patient or physician.
  The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02515838. FINDINGS: Between
  Oct 7, 2015, and Feb 10, 2019, 144 patients were randomly assigned and administered
  sevuparin (n=69) or placebo (n=75). The median age was 22 2 years (range 12 2-33
  6), 104 (72%) 144 were adults (18 years or older), and 90 (63%) were male and 54
  (37%) were female. The intention-to-treat analysis for the primary endpoint showed
  no significant difference in median time to vaso-occlusive crisis resolution between
  the sevuparin and placebo groups (100 4 h [95% CI 85 5-116 8]) vs 86 4 h [70 6-95
  1]; hazard ratio 0 89 [0 6-1 3]; p=0 55). Serious adverse events occurred in 16
  (22%) of 68 patients in the sevuparin group and in 21 (22%) of patients in the placebo
  group. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were pyrexia (17 [25%]
  in the sevuparin group vs 17 [22%] in the placebo group), constipation (12 [18%]
  vs 17 [22%]), and decreased haemoglobin (18 [26%] vs 9 [12%]). There were no deaths
  in the sevuparin group and there was one (1%) death in the placebo group after a
  hyper-haemolytic episode due to alloimmunisation. INTERPRETATION: This result, as
  well as the results seen in other clinical studies of inhibitors of adhesion in
  sickle cell disease, suggest that selectin-mediated adhesion might be important
  in the initiation, but not maintenance of vaso-occlusion, indicating that strategies
  to treat vaso-occlusive crises differ from strategies to prevent this complication.
