  after covid-19 vaccination: national prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To derive
  and validate risk prediction algorithms to estimate the risk of covid-19 related
  mortality and hospital admission in UK adults after one or two doses of covid-19
  vaccination. DESIGN: Prospective, population based cohort study using the QResearch
  database linked to data on covid-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 results, hospital admissions,
  systemic anticancer treatment, radiotherapy, and the national death and cancer registries.
  SETTINGS: Adults aged 19-100 years with one or two doses of covid-19 vaccination
  between 8 December 2020 and 15 June 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome
  was covid-19 related death. Secondary outcome was covid-19 related hospital admission.
  Outcomes were assessed from 14 days after each vaccination dose. Models were fitted
  in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables.
  Performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort of general practices.
  RESULTS: Of 6 952 440 vaccinated patients in the derivation cohort, 5 150 310 (74.1%)
  had two vaccine doses. Of 2031 covid-19 deaths and 1929 covid-19 hospital admissions,
  81 deaths (4.0%) and 71 admissions (3.7%) occurred 14 days or more after the second
  vaccine dose. The risk algorithms included age, sex, ethnic origin, deprivation,
  body mass index, a range of comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Incidence
  of covid-19 mortality increased with age and deprivation, male sex, and Indian and
  Pakistani ethnic origin. Cause specific hazard ratios were highest for patients
  with Down's syndrome (12.7-fold increase), kidney transplantation (8.1-fold), sickle
  cell disease (7.7-fold), care home residency (4.1-fold), chemotherapy (4.3-fold),
  HIV/AIDS (3.3-fold), liver cirrhosis (3.0-fold), neurological conditions (2.6-fold),
  recent bone marrow transplantation or a solid organ transplantation ever (2.5-fold),
  dementia (2.2-fold), and Parkinson's disease (2.2-fold). Other conditions with increased
  risk (ranging from 1.2-fold to 2.0-fold increases) included chronic kidney disease,
  blood cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease,
  stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, thromboembolism, peripheral vascular
  disease, and type 2 diabetes. A similar pattern of associations was seen for covid-19
  related hospital admissions. No evidence indicated that associations differed after
  the second dose, although absolute risks were reduced. The risk algorithm explained
  74.1% (95% confidence interval 71.1% to 77.0%) of the variation in time to covid-19
  death in the validation cohort. Discrimination was high, with a D statistic of 3.46
  (95% confidence interval 3.19 to 3.73) and C statistic of 92.5. Performance was
  similar after each vaccine dose. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted
  covid-19 mortality risk, sensitivity for identifying covid-19 deaths within 70 days
  was 78.7%. CONCLUSION: This population based risk algorithm performed well showing
  high levels of discrimination for identifying those patients at highest risk of
  covid-19 related death and hospital admission after vaccination."
