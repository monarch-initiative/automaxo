input_text: 'Prevention of neurovascular complications in children with Sickle Cell
  Disease in the real-world setting: What adult medicine physicians should know.Neurovascular
  complications represent one of the most detrimental manifestations of Sickle Cell
  Disease (SCD), affecting many patients since infancy. They include overt stroke,
  silent cerebral infarcts and neurocognitive disorders. In fact, neurodevelopment
  can be impaired in children resulting in cognitive dysfunction in adults with SCD.
  This review is meant to resume the most recent guidelines about the prevention of
  SCD neurovascular complications and to highlight the open challenges in their implementation.
  Transcranial Doppler, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography and neurocognitive
  test are useful screening tools. Chronic transfusion regimen, hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation and neurocognitive rehabilitation find indications in the context
  of primary and secondary prevention of neurovascular complications of SCD. However,
  international guidelines are often difficult to bring into the real world due to
  the lack of appropriate instruments and trained personnel. Many challenges have
  still to be faced to guarantee the best possible neurocognitive function to each
  child affected by SCD.'
