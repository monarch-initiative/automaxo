input_text: 'Therapeutic plasma exchange in the management of acute complications
  of sickle cell disease: A single centre experience.Sickle cell disease results in
  systemic inflammation even at steady state and this is accentuated during acute
  crises. The plasma of affected patients contains several proinflammatory cytokines
  as well as adhesion molecules and prothrombotic factors. This environment promotes
  further red cell sickling while many of these substances can cause direct tissue
  toxicity and end-organ damage. Even though red cell transfusion, whether simple
  or exchange, is the mainstay of treatment of severe acute complications, addition
  of therapeutic plasma exchange could potentially provide additional benefit by removing
  such harmful substances. Here, we describe two cases where therapeutic plasma exchange
  was used. The first involved a patient with the acute chest syndrome who despite
  adequate red cell exchange remained significantly hypoxic and in severe pain. We
  therefore proceeded to perform plasma exchange; this led to rapid clinical improvement
  and resolution of his symptoms. The second case involved a patient with intractable
  chest wall pain and impending acute chest syndrome; this patient also had a past
  history of hyperhaemolysis. The patient underwent therapeutic plasma exchange with
  very rapid resolution of the pain, avoidance of any respiratory deterioration and
  full recovery. We also give a brief summary of our previous experience using plasma
  exchange in patients with sickle cell disease. Plasma exchange was well tolerated
  with no adverse events in all cases we have treated, led to rapid resolution of
  pain irrespective of primary indication and in the majority of cases to a favourable
  clinical outcome.'
