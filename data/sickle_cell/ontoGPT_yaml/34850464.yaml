input_text: 'Sickle cell disease patients in two London trusts: Genotyping including
  RH variants.BACKGROUND: All SCD patients need extended RBC antigen typing (by serology
  or genotyping) for provision of extended RH, K matched blood and to guide RBC selection
  in those with complex transfusion requirements. Genotyping can also identify RH
  variants which can cause sensitisation even when extended RH phenotypically matched
  blood is provided and alloantibodies associated with RH variants can cause HTRs.
  OBJECTIVES: To review the use of RBC genotyping in SCD patients at two London trusts
  (ICHNT, LNWH) with a focus on RH variants. METHODS: Retrospective review with data
  collected from clinical notes, local and national pathology reporting systems. RESULTS:
  A 311/482 (64%) ICHNT patients and 181/346 (52%) LNWH patients had extended genotyping.
  Of genotyped patients, 68 (22%) ICHNT and 31 (17%) LNWH patients had RH variants.
  Eight ICHNT patients had RH variants and corresponding antibodies associated with
  RH variants; 4/8 received multiple transfusions with antigen positive RBCs but had
  no evidence of haemolysis. One LNWH patient had a RH variant with corresponding
  alloantibody but could not be investigated further for possible HTR. CONCLUSIONS:
  Most patients (59%) had genotyping and a significant number had RH variants (99,
  20%). A small proportion (9, 9%) had antibodies associated with RH variants, but
  with no evidence of clinically significant HTRs despite transfusions in four of
  them with antigen positive RBCs. All SCD patients should have RBC genotyping including
  RH variants (preferentially over extended phenotyping) to guide better selection
  of RBC units. However, where antigen negative blood cannot be provided, the risk
  of alloimmunisation is not inevitable and subsequent HTRs from antibodies associated
  with RH variants might not always occur.'
