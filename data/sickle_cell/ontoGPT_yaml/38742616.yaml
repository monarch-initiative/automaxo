input_text: "Pain: The Silent Public Health Epidemic. More than 50 million Americans
  suffer from chronic pain, costing our society an estimated 565 to 635 billion dollars
  annually. Its complexity and training deficits in healthcare providers result in
  many patients receiving ineffective care. Large health inequities also exist in
  access to effective pain care for vulnerable populations. The traumatic history
  of indigenous people and people of color in regards to the experience of pain care
  perpetuates a lack of trust in the healthcare system, causing many to hesitate to
  seek medical treatment for painful events and conditions. Other vulnerable populations
  include those with sickle cell disease or fibromyalgia, whose experience of pain
  has not been well-understood. There are both barriers to care and stigma for patients
  with pain, including those taking prescribed doses of long-term opioids, those with
  known substance use disorder, and those with mental health diagnoses. The suffering
  of patients with pain can be \"invisible\" to the clinician, and to one's community
  at large. Pain can affect all people; but those most vulnerable to not getting effective
  care may continue to suffer in silence because their voices are not heard. Since
  1973, pain societies around the globe have worked tirelessly to bring clinicians
  together to advance pain and opioid education, research, and patient care. These
  improvements consist of pain education, integrative treatment, and the understanding
  that a therapeutic alliance is critical to effective pain management. Pain education
  for both pre and post-licensure health professionals has increased substantially
  over the last decade. In addition, integrative and interdisciplinary approaches
  for clinical pain management are now considered best practices in pain care for
  patients with moderate to severe pain in addition to the development of a strong
  therapeutic alliance."
