input_text: Cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical cell or gene therapy cure for sickle
  cell disease. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited genetic conditions
  associated with lifelong complications and increased healthcare resource utilization.
  Standard treatment for SCD in the US varies based on stage of the disease and observed
  clinical severity. In this study, we aim to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness
  of a durable cell or gene therapy cure for sickle cell disease from the US healthcare
  sector perspective. We developed a lifetime Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
  of a hypothetical single-administration durable treatment (DT) for SCD provided
  at birth, relative to standard of care (SOC). We informed model inputs including
  direct healthcare costs, health state utility weights, transition probabilities,
  and mortality rates using a retrospective database analysis of commercially insured
  individuals and the medical literature. Our primary outcome of interest was the
  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of DT versus SOC evaluated at a base
  case willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year
  (QALY). We tested the robustness of our base case findings through scenario, deterministic
  sensitivity (DSA), and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). In the base case
  analysis, treatment with DT was cost-effective with an ICER of $140,877/QALY relative
  to SOC for a hypothetical cohort involving 47% females. Both males (ICER of $135,574/QALY)
  and females (ICER of $146,511/QALY) were similarly cost-effective to treat. In univariate
  DSA the base case ICER was most sensitive to the costs of treating males, DT treatment
  cost, and the discount rate. In PSA, DT was cost-effective in 32.7%, 66.0%, and
  92.6% of 10,000 simulations at WTP values of $100,000, $150,000, and $200,000 per
  QALY, respectively. A scenario analysis showed cost-effectiveness of DT is highly
  contingent on assumed lifetime durability of the cure. A hypothetical cell or gene
  therapy cure for SCD is likely to be cost-effective from the US healthcare sector
  perspective. Large upfront costs of a single administration cure are offset by significant
  downstream gains in health for patients treated early in life. We find cost-effectiveness
  outcomes do not vary substantially by gender; however, several model parameters
  including assumed durability and upfront cost of DT are likely to influence cost-effectiveness
  findings.
