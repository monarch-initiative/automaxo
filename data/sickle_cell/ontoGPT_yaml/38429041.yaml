input_text: 'The Inequality of Pain Control in Patients With Pain From Sickle Cell
  Disease: A Case Report.Approximately 100,000 people in the United States are affected
  by Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Acute pain and chronic pain are common and are experienced
  by everyone with SCD. Children and adolescents who had pain from SCD reported daily
  pain, decreased function, missed school/workdays, and limited participation in recreational
  and social activities. This case report aims to highlight the lack of diversity,
  equity, and inclusion of pain control through the lens of a patient with SCD to
  improve clinical practice.'
