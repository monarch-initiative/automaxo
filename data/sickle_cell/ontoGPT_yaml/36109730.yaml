input_text: 'Blood pressure in children with sickle cell disease is higher than in
  the general pediatric population.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated
  with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease that may be due to a variety of
  possible risk factors, including abnormal blood pressure. Blood pressure (BP) of
  children and adolescents with SCD has been reported to be lower compared to the
  BP of the general pediatric population. METHODS: To confirm this prior observation,
  we compared reference BP values for children with SCD with reference BP values of
  the general pediatric population. We hypothesized that children with SCD do not
  have lower BPs than children without SCD. RESULTS: Systolic BP differed for both
  males and females, over the different age groups between pediatric subjects with
  and without SCD. Systolic BP was higher in children with SCD, in both obese and
  non-obese populations. Diastolic BP did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our analysis demonstrated that systolic BP values are indeed higher in children
  with SCD than in the general pediatric population. This finding is consistent with
  the most recent literature showing abnormal BP patterns in the SCD pediatric population
  utilizing 24-hour BP monitoring devices. This is an important step for recognizing
  abnormal BP as a risk factor for cardio- and neurovascular events in SCD.'
