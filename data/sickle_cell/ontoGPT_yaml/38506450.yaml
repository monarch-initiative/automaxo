input_text: 'Post-transfusion biotin-labeled red blood cell survival studies in pediatric
  sickle cell disease with antibodies of uncertain significance. BACKGROUND: Red blood
  cell (RBC) antibodies are common in multiply transfused patients with sickle cell
  disease (SCD). Unlike RBC alloantibodies, the potential of autoantibodies to cause
  post-transfusion hemolysis may be uncertain. Biotin-labeling provides a direct measurement
  of red cell survival (RCS) over time, thus can be used to assess the clinical significance
  of RBC antibodies. Antibodies to biotinylated RBC (B-RBC) occasionally are detected
  after exposure, which may impact B-RBC survival in subsequent RCS studies. STUDY
  DESIGN AND METHODS: Pediatric patients with SCD receiving monthly chronic transfusions
  underwent RCS studies, receiving aliquots of allogeneic RBC labeled at distinct
  densities of biotin (2-18 mug/mL). B-RBC survival was followed for 4 months post-transfusion,
  and B-RBC antibody screening for 6 months. Patients with warm autoantibodies (WAA)
  or B-RBC antibodies are reported here. RESULTS: RBC antibodies were detected during
  RCS in four patients: one with WAA, one with WAA followed by B-RBC-specific antibodies,
  and two with transient B-RBC antibodies within the first 5 weeks of exposure. B-RBC
  half-lives (T50 ) ranged 37.6-61.7 days (mean 47.8 days). There was no evidence
  of increased hemolysis or accelerated B-RBC clearance in the presence of WAA or
  B-RBC antibodies. DISCUSSION: Biotinylation of allogenic RBC can be used to assess
  the possible effects of RBC antibodies on transfusion survival in individual cases,
  particularly when it is uncertain if the detected antibodies may result in hemolysis.
  In the cases presented here, neither WAA nor B-RBC antibodies were associated with
  significant shortening of B-RBC survival in individuals with SCD.'
