input_text: 'Survival of transfused red blood cells from a donor with alpha-thalassemia
  trait in a recipient with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Post-transfusion survival
  of donor red blood cells (RBCs) is important for effective chronic transfusion therapy
  in conditions including sickle cell disease (SCD). Biotin labeling RBCs allows direct
  in vivo measurement of multiple donor RBC units simultaneously post-transfusion.
  STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In an observational trial of patients with SCD receiving
  monthly chronic transfusion therapy, aliquots of RBCs from one transfusion episode
  were biotin-labeled and infused along with the unlabeled RBC units. Serial blood
  samples were obtained to measure RBC survival. Donor units were tested for RBC indices,
  hemoglobin fractionation, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme activity.
  For microcytic donor RBCs (MCV < 70 fL), HBA1 and HBA2 genetic testing was performed
  on whole blood. RESULTS: We present one recipient, a pediatric patient with SCD
  and splenectomy who received two RBC units with aliquots from each unit labeled
  at distinct biotin densities (2 and 18 mug/mL biotin). One donor unit was identified
  to have microcytosis (MCV 68.5 fL after biotinylation); whole blood sample obtained
  at a subsequent donation showed 2-gene deletion alpha-thalassemia trait (alpha-3.7kb/alpha-3.7kb)
  and normal serum ferritin. G6PD activity was >60% of normal mean for both. The RBCs
  with alpha-thalassemia RBC had accelerated clearance and increased surface phosphatidylserine
  post-transfusion, as compared with the normocytic RBC (half life 65 vs. 86 days,
  respectively). DISCUSSION: Post-transfusion RBC survival may be lower for units
  from donors with alpha-thalassemia trait, although the impact of thalassemia trait
  donors on transfusion efficacy requires further study.'
