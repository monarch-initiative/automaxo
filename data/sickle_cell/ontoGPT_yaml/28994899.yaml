input_text: "Prophylactic antibiotics for preventing pneumococcal infection in children
  with sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) are
  particularly susceptible to infection. Infants and very young children are especially
  vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence
  rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person years in children under the
  age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be
  of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may
  be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published
  in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2014. OBJECTIVES: To assess the
  effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD in relation
  to:1. incidence of infection;2. mortality;3. drug-related adverse events (as reported
  in the included studies) to the individual and the community;4. the impact of discontinuing
  at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched
  the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials
  Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic
  database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and
  the WHO International Registry Platform. Additionally, we carried out handsearching
  of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most
  recent search: 19 December 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised or quasi-randomised
  controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection
  in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION
  AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.
  The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN
  RESULTS: Five trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials (880
  children randomised) met the inclusion criteria. All of the included trials showed
  a reduced incidence of infection in children with SCD (SS or Sbeta0Thal) receiving
  prophylactic penicillin. In trials which investigated initiation of penicillin on
  risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval
  0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-quality evidence), while for withdrawal
  the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children)
  (low-quality evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal
  infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five.Overall,
  the quality of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from
  the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk
  of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition
  bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains
  considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting
  (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
  The evidence examined suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces
  risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated
  with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal
  age to safely withdraw penicillin."
