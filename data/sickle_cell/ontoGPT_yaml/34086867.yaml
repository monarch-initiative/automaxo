input_text: Enhanced HbF reactivation by multiplex mutagenesis of thalassemic CD34+
  cells in vitro and in vivo.Thalassemia or sickle cell patients with hereditary persistence
  of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) have an ameliorated clinical phenotype and, in some cases,
  can achieve transfusion independence. Inactivation via genome editing of gamma-globin
  developmental suppressors, such as BCL11A or LRF/ZBTB7A, or of their binding sites,
  have been shown to significantly increase expression of endogenous HbF. To broaden
  the therapeutic window beyond a single-editing approach, we have explored combinations
  of cis- and trans-editing targets to enhance HbF reactivation. Multiplex mutagenesis
  in adult CD34+ cells was well tolerated and did not lead to any detectable defect
  in the cells' proliferation and differentiation, either in vitro or in vivo. The
  combination of 1 trans and 1 cis mutation resulted in high editing retention in
  vivo, coupled with almost pancellular HbF expression in NBSGW mice. The greater
  in vivo performance of this combination was also recapitulated using a novel helper-dependent
  adenoviral-CRISPR vector (HD-Ad-dualCRISPR) in CD34+ cells from beta-thalassemia
  patients transplanted to NBSGW mice. A pronounced increase in HbF expression was
  observed in human red blood cells in mice with established predominant beta0/beta0-thalassemic
  hemopoiesis after in vivo injection of the HD-Ad-dualCRISPR vector. Collectively,
  our data suggest that the combination of cis and trans fetal globin reactivation
  mutations has the potential to significantly increase HbF both totally and on a
  per cell basis over single editing and could thus provide significant clinical benefit
  to patients with severe beta-globin phenotype.
