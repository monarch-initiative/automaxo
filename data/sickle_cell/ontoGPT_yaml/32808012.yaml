input_text: Fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can blunt
  the pathophysiology, temper the clinical course, and offer prospects for curative
  therapy of sickle cell disease. This review focuses on (1) HbF quantitative trait
  loci and the geography of beta-globin gene haplotypes, especially those found in
  the Middle East; (2) how HbF might differentially impact the pathophysiology and
  many subphenotypes of sickle cell disease; (3) clinical implications of person-to-person
  variation in the distribution of HbF among HbF-containing erythrocytes; and (4)
  reactivation of HbF gene expression using both pharmacologic and cell-based therapeutic
  approaches. A confluence of detailed understanding of the molecular basis of HbF
  gene expression, coupled with the ability to precisely target by genomic editing
  most areas of the genome, is producing important preliminary therapeutic results
  that could provide new options for cell-based therapeutics with curative intent.
