input_text: Brucellosis in a Sickle Cell Patient with Hyposplenia.Sickle cell disease
  patients are prone to infection and overwhelming sepsis because an immunedeficient
  state arises from asplenia (autosplenectomy/surgical splenectomy) and functional
  hyposplenism. The common pathogen encountered in sepsis with asplenic/hyposplenism
  patients is encapsulated organism, gram-negative bacilli, but in developing countries
  like India, there are many possibilities of infection by an uncommon organism that
  make it difficult to diagnose. Here, we have described a case of sickle cell disease
  presented with persistent fever and later, found to have an atrophic spleen with
  involvement of respiratory system and osteoarticular system. After extensive workup,
  he was diagnosed to be brucellosis. So, unusual infectious causes be kept as a differential
  diagnosis in a susceptible host while dealing with persistent symptoms. Uncommon
  infections like Brucella need to be studied in hyposplenism patients as data are
  lacking.
