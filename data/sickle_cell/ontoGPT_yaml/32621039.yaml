input_text: 'Prognostic value of left ventricular longitudinal strain by speckle-tracking
  echocardiography in patients with sickle cell disease. Cardiovascular complications
  have been increasingly detected in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Two-dimensional
  speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) detects early myocardial changes in a number
  of pathophysiological processes, which may be useful in SCD. This study was designed
  to examine the value of STE in predicting clinical outcome in adult patients with
  SCD. A total of 219 patients, mean age 33 +- 12 years were prospectively enrolled.
  Several clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic variables including left ventricular
  global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) by STE were assessed. The endpoint was a composite
  of the following events: (1) all-cause mortality, (2) three or more acute painful
  episodes that require hospitalization in one year, (3) acute chest syndrome and
  (4) hospitalization due to disease complication. The majority of the patients had
  enlargement of LV and left atrial (LA) with preserved ejection fraction. During
  the mean follow-up of 30 months, 69 patients (32%) had reached the endpoint, including
  eight deaths (3.7%). No difference was observed in the parameters of diastolic function
  comparing the patients with and without events. LVGLS ranged from - 12.25 to - 25.44
  (mean - 20.26 +- 2.5), with higher values in the patients who had events compared
  with those who did not. In the multivariable analysis, higher LVGLS values were
  associated with adverse events (adjusted OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04-1.51; p = 0.021),
  independently of the TR maximal velocity and LV ejection fraction. In patients with
  SCD, higher LV global longitudinal strain was a predictor of adverse outcome, independently
  of age, TR velocity and LV function.'
