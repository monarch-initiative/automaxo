input_text: Safety of Ultrasound Contrast Agents in Pediatric Patients With Sickle
  Cell Disease and Trait.Ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) use is increasing. Recent
  isolated reports observed a rise in pain-related adverse events with the intravenous
  administration of the UCA Definity in adults with sickle cell disease. To date,
  no studies have investigated the incidence of similar adverse events with UCA Lumason
  or Optison. We describe our experience regarding the safety of Lumason and Optison
  in children with sickle cell disease and trait who underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound
  exams in our department with intravenous, intravesical, and other intracavitary
  routes. No pain-related or other adverse events were observed in this pediatric
  population with any route of UCA administration.
