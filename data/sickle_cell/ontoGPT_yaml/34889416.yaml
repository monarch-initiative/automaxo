input_text: Indications for transfusion in the management of sickle cell disease.The
  transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a crucial treatment for sickle cell disease
  (SCD). While often beneficial, the frequent use of transfusions is associated with
  numerous complications. Transfusions should be offered with specific guidelines
  in mind. Here we present updates to the indications for transfusion of RBCs in SCD.
  We review recent publications and include expert perspectives from hematology and
  transfusion medicine. For some clinical indications, such as ischemic stroke, the
  role of transfusion has been well studied and can be applied almost universally.
  For many other clinical scenarios, the use of transfusion therapy has less conclusive
  data and therefore must be tailored to individual needs. We highlight the roles
  of RBC transfusions in preventing or mitigating neurological disease, in reducing
  perioperative complications, in managing acute chest syndrome, and in optimizing
  pregnancy outcomes in SCD. We further highlight various transfusion techniques and
  when each might be considered. Potential complications of transfusion are also briefly
  discussed.
