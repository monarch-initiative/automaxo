input_text: Disease-Modifying Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease-An Overview. Sickle
  cell disease refers to a group of inherited blood disorders in which hemoglobin
  polymerization leads to hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. This causes a myriad of complications
  during a patient's life span, ranging from anemia, infections, and acute and chronic
  pain to stroke and multiorgan dysfunction. Although there have been dramatic improvements
  in childhood survival thanks to improved supportive care with penicillin prophylaxis,
  immunizations, and improved transfusion practices, there was a dearth of disease-modifying
  therapies, with hydroxyurea being the only medication for >20 years. Here, we discuss
  the newer therapies for sickle cell disease that have emerged in recent years. [Pediatr
  Ann. 2024;53(2):e52-e55.].
