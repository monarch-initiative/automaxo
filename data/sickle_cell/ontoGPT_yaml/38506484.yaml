input_text: "Using the daily rate of rise in hemoglobin S to manage RBC depletion/exchange
  treatment in sickle cell disease. BACKGROUND: Red blood cell exchange is often used
  prophylactically in patients with sickle cell disease, with the goal to maintain
  hemoglobin S (HbS) below a target threshold level. We reviewed whether the daily
  \"rate of rise\" (RoR) in HbS that occurs between procedures can be used for patient
  management. For some patients not achieving their HbS goals despite efficient exchanges,
  the post-procedure hematocrit (Hct) target is increased to potentially suppress
  HbS production. This case series explores the utility of this approach, other clinical
  uses of the daily RoR in HbS, and the factors that influence it. STUDY DESIGN AND
  METHODS: A total of 660 procedures from 24 patients undergoing prophylactic RBC
  depletion/exchange procedures were included. Laboratory values and clinical parameters
  were collected and used to calculate the daily RoR in HbS. Factors such as Hct or
  medications that might influence the RoR in HbS were evaluated. RESULTS: The RoR
  in HbS varied widely between patients but remained relatively stable within individuals.
  Surprisingly, this value was not significantly influenced by changes in post-procedure
  Hct or concurrent hydroxyurea use. A patient's average RoR in HbS effectively predicted
  the pre-procedure HbS at the following visit (R2  = 0.65). DISCUSSION: The RoR in
  HbS is a relatively consistent parameter for individual patients that is unaffected
  by medication use or procedural Hct targets and may be useful in determining intervals
  between procedures."
